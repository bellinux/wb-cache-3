5|$|The {{smoke and}} {{airborne}} <b>particulates</b> from the fires posed {{a threat to}} local communities on several occasions. Smoke and <b>particulates</b> were especially high in Gardiner, Montana. There, monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded. This was also the case near fires, and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, {{the location of the}} park headquarters. In no other surrounding communities were <b>particulates</b> found to be above acceptable levels. Smoke and haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous. A number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for smoke and dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas.|$|E

5|$|Oil shale mining {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining. They include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of <b>particulates</b> during processing, transport, and support activities.|$|E
40|$|Multi-cyclones is {{commonly}} usedin the palm oil mill industry as <b>particulate</b> pollution arrestor. However, its ability in capturing <b>particulate</b> matter (PM) especially the fine <b>particulate</b> size fraction is limited. Thus, {{study has been}} carried out to investigate and predict the performance of MR-deDuster, a multi-cyclones unit developed as <b>particulate</b> emission control device in palm oil mill plant. The MR-deDuster is intentionally developed to overcome <b>particulate</b> emission issue facing by industries that generate <b>particulate</b> especially the palm oil mill industry. A number of semi-empirical theories were used to predict the performance of MR-deDuster. Based on the prediction, the MR-deDuster manages to capture <b>particulate</b> size 3. 8 µm at 50 % <b>particulate</b> collection efficiency. The MR-deDuster also manages to achieve more than 90 % for total <b>particulate</b> collection efficiency with low pressure drop...|$|R
40|$|Utilization {{of fiber}} and shell as boiler fuel in palm oil mill {{industry}} generates <b>particulate</b> emission {{that need to}} be controlled before emitting to the environment. This study investigates the <b>particulate</b> mass size distribution of <b>particulate</b> matter sampled from palm oil mills having different boiler capacities. The <b>particulate</b> emission was performed at the stack following US EPA Method 17 and while the <b>particulate</b> size distribution was determined using particle size analyzer. Results showed that the total <b>particulate</b> mass concentration varied between 0. 42 and 3. 77 g/Nm 3 (corrected at 7 % O 2). The emitted <b>particulate</b> was mainly found in the coarse particles, with 50 % cumulative size distribution ranged from 21 to 38 μm. The <b>particulate</b> mass concentration of PM 2. 5 and PM 10 of the total <b>particulate</b> emission was varied from 0. 03 to 0. 30 g/Nm 3 and 0. 37 to 0. 73 g/Nm 3, respectively. This contributes 0. 8 to 71 % and 13 to 95 % of the total <b>particulate</b> mass concentration, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A > 7 -year, time-series, {{epidemiologic}} {{study is}} ongoing in Spokane, Washington, {{to examine the}} associations between ambient <b>particulate</b> constituents or sources and health outcomes such as emergency department (ED) visits for asthma or respiratory problems. One of the hypotheses being tested is that <b>particulate</b> toxic metals are associated with these health outcomes. Spokane is a desirable city in which to conduct this study because of its relatively high concentrations of <b>particulate</b> matter, low concentrations of potentially confounding air pollutants, variability of <b>particulate</b> sources, and presence of several potential <b>particulate</b> metals sources. Daily fine- and coarse-fraction <b>particulate</b> samples are analyzed for metals via energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) and instrumental neutron activation analysis. <b>Particulate</b> sources are determined using receptor modeling, including chemical mass balancing and positive matrix factorization coupled with partial source contribution function analysis. Principal component analysis has also been {{used to examine the}} influence of sources on the daily variability of the chemical composition of <b>particulate</b> samples. Based upon initial analyses using the EDXRF elemental analyses, statistically significant associations were observed between ED visits for asthma and increased combustion products, air stagnation, and fine <b>particulate</b> Zn. Although there is a significant soil <b>particulate</b> component, increased crustal <b>particulate</b> levels were not found to be associated with ED visits for asthma. Further research will clarify whether there is an association between specific health outcomes and either coarse or fine <b>particulate</b> metal species...|$|R

The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although <b>particulates</b> from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
40|$|During {{a period}} of two years, organic and {{inorganic}} suspended <b>particulate</b> matter and phytoplankton biomass was frequently measured in Lake Erken, a moderately deep, eutrophic lake in south-eastern Sweden. Regression analyses of these data were used to differentiate and quantify newly produced planktonic <b>particulate</b> matter (zooplankton + phytoplankton + bacteria) and different types of resuspended <b>particulate</b> matter (organic, inorganic). Resuspended <b>particulate</b> matter was frequently dominant in the water column (yearly mean 59 % of suspended <b>particulate</b> matter), and resuspended <b>particulate</b> organic matter ranged from 11 to 99 % of suspended <b>particulate</b> organic matter (yearly mean: 40 %). The high amount of resuspended <b>particulate</b> matter originates from erosion/transportation bottoms which are located at water depths above 16 m and which cover 93 % of the lake area. Resuspended <b>particulate</b> matter was significantly related to diatom biomass but not to any other type of planktonic biomass. Consequently, the seasonal variations in the amount and distribution of diatoms {{can be explained by the}} hydrodynamic processes which affect the amount and distribution of resuspended <b>particulate</b> matter while seasonal variations in the amount and distribution of other planktonic biomass need further explanations, like active swimming, floating and grazing resistance...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend {{to accumulate}} on seamounts, which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores {{have also been}} found. They tend to gather small <b>particulates</b> and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals. Many seamounts also have hydrothermal vent communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.|$|E

Fine <b>particulates</b> (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with slightly increased risk. For nitrogen dioxide, an incremental increase of 10 parts per billion increases the risk of lung cancer by 14%. Outdoor air pollution is estimated to account for 1–2% of lung cancers.|$|E

Smoke shade, a measure of visibility interference in the atmosphere, was two to three times higher than usual.|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of <b>particulate</b> thorium in {{seawater}} {{were determined}} {{together with the}} strong organic ligand (SOL) and uranium in <b>particulate</b> matter (PM). The concentrations of <b>particulate</b> Th in surface waters of the western North Pacific and the Sea of Japan ranged from 0. 05 to 1. 5 pM (1 x 10 − 12 M), and showed relatively large temporal and spatial variations. In order to chemically characterize the <b>particulate</b> Th in seawater, the relationship between <b>particulate</b> Th and SOL concentrations in surface PM was examined. The result reveals that <b>particulate</b> Th in surface PM was well correlated with the SOL concentration in PM. The concentrations of <b>particulate</b> Th in surface water were linearly related to those of <b>particulate</b> U. Mass balance analysis suggests that the dominant chemical form of Th(IV), {{as well as of}} U, in surface PM is a surface complex with the SOL in PM. Our findings suggest that the SOL in PM is a nonmetal-specific chelator originating from the cell surface of microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|Keywords:boundary element method, {{two-phase}} composite, crack extension path, crack/particulate interaction, toughening. Abstract. Interaction {{between a}} crack and a rectangular <b>particulate</b> {{in a single}} edge notched beam is simulated using a boundary element program of automatic crack extension. The stress intensity factors of the growing crack are obtained from the J-integral. Three crack extension paths: deflecting around the <b>particulate,</b> growing along the interface and penetrating into the <b>particulate</b> are achieved {{in terms of the}} mismatch state of mechanical characteristics of matrix and <b>particulate.</b> The toughening is also given by the ratio of stress intensity factors. The results reveal that as stress shielding occurs, large toughening is obtained when the crack is approaching to a stiff and strong <b>particulate</b> weakly bonded to a relatively soft matrix; inversely the soft <b>particulate</b> is functional to attract the crack tip toward it, and obvious toughening arises when the tip is within this soft <b>particulate.</b> The present work intends to help for the design of <b>particulate</b> reinforced composites...|$|R

Ionization can also cause <b>particulate</b> matter to attach to surfaces such as walls, and flooring, resulting in lower <b>particulate</b> counts in the air, but without having <b>particulate</b> matter permanently removed from the air.|$|R
5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where <b>particulates</b> in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E
5|$|In arid climates, {{the main}} source of erosion is wind. The general wind {{circulation}} moves small <b>particulates</b> such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin, which is known as deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for {{a large percentage of the}} biomass of land plants.|$|E
5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as global warming and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the <b>particulates</b> bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E

These include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals including mercury into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of <b>particulates</b> during processing, transport, and support activities. In 2002, about 97% of air pollution, 86% of total waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia came from the power industry, which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.|$|E
5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic <b>particulates</b> such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E

40|$|The {{quantification}} of <b>particulate</b> matter {{emissions from}} mineral handling {{is an important}} problem for the quantification of global emissions on industrial sites. Mineral <b>particulate</b> matter emissions could adversely impact environmental quality in mining regions, transport regions, and even on a global scale. Mineral loading is an important process contributing to mineral <b>particulate</b> matter emissions, especially under weak wind conditions. Mathematical models are effective ways to evaluate <b>particulate</b> matter emissions during the mineral loading process. The currently used empirical models based on {{the form of a}} power function do not predict <b>particulate</b> matter emissions accurately under weak wind conditions. At low <b>particulate</b> matter emissions, the models overestimated, and at high <b>particulate</b> matter emissions, the models underestimated emission factors. We conducted wind tunnel experiments to evaluate the <b>particulate</b> matter emission factors for the mineral loading process. A new approach based on the mathematical form of a logistical function was developed and tested. It provided a realistic depiction of the <b>particulate</b> matter emissions during the mineral loading process, accounting for fractions of fine mineral particles, dropping height, and wind velocity.

5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{concluded}} that the severity of Frank's injuries and the numerous <b>particulates</b> found embedded in his body could only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion. Furthermore, the chemical compounds detected {{in the area around}} the explosion's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion. The manganese dioxide samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank's body indicated that a dry cell battery was located very near to the explosive. The CAB determined that, based on the blast pattern, a dynamite charge had been placed underneath the window seat of row 7.|$|E

About 60 percent of the particulate matter, however, comes from the neighboring United States. Lake Huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid continental climate, which makes temperature extremes of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect snow from Arctic air blowing across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls once over land.|$|E

A field {{evaluation}} on <b>particulate</b> emission concentrations {{from two}} different types of palm oil mill boilers (i. e water-tube, WT, and fire-tube, FT type boilers) was performed using a standard stack sampling procedures. A total of 12 WT and 12 FT boilers were studied. Six of the 12 WT boilers were equipped with multi-cyclones as a means of controlling <b>particulate</b> emissions from the boilers, whilst all 12 FT boilers were without any form of air <b>particulate</b> control equip-ment. Results showed that the mean <b>particulate</b> emission concentrations from water-tube type boilers with and without <b>particulate</b> control equipment installed was I. 1 I ± 0. 58 g!Nm 3 and 1. 93 ± 1. 40 g/Nm 3 respectively. There {{was no significant difference in}} the <b>particulate</b> emissions between WT boilers with or without <b>particulate</b> control installed. It was found that only one out of the six WT boilers with <b>particulate</b> control was able to meet the emission standards limit of 0. 40 g/Nm 3 while others were still violating the standard. Meanwhile, the mean <b>particulate</b> emission from all 12 FT type boilers (all were without control) was 0. 5 1 ± 0. 27 g/Nm 3, which was found to be significantly lower (p:s; 0. 01) compared to the WT boiler emissions of without <b>particulate</b> control. Apparently, the characteristic of <b>particulate</b> size distributions generated by the two types of boilers could be an important factor affecting the findings and it is discussed further in this paper...|$|R
