5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in <b>Poulet</b> Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter.

2500|$|His {{financial}} difficulties increased again, however, particularly after his publisher <b>Poulet</b> Malassis went bankrupt in 1861. In 1864, he left Paris for Belgium, partly {{in the hope}} of selling the rights to his works and also to give lectures. His long-standing relationship with Jeanne Duval continued on-and-off, and he helped her {{to the end of his}} life. Baudelaire's relationships with actress Marie Daubrun and with courtesan Apollonie Sabatier, though the source of much inspiration, never produced any lasting satisfaction. He smoked opium, and in Brussels he began to drink to excess. Baudelaire suffered a massive stroke in 1866 and paralysis followed. After more than a year of aphasia, he received the last rites of the Catholic Church. The last two years of his life were spent, in a semi-paralyzed state, in [...] "maisons de santé" [...] in Brussels and in Paris, where he died on August 31, 1867.

40|$|Abstract — The {{effect of}} caponisation on carcass {{composition}} by parts and tissues was examined. Twenty-eight castrated and twenty male Penedesenca Negra chicks reared under free-range condi-tions were slaughtered at 28 weeks of age. The birds were castrated at 4 or 8 weeks. The left {{sides of the}} carcasses were quartered (wing, breast, thigh and drumstick), and the parts dissected into the tis-sue components (skin, subcutaneous fat, intermuscular fat, muscle, bone and tendons). Capons showed more abdominal, intermuscular and subcutaneous fat than the cocks, {{both at the same}} slaugh-ter age and at the same weight. The breast and thigh were heavier in the capons than in the cocks. However, the whole muscle mass in the breast was increased by caponisation. This favourable effect was achieved at the expense of decreasing the carcass yield. The age of castration up to 8 weeks did not affect the carcass composition of the parts and tissues. chicken / capon / carcass / tissue composition Résumé — Comparaison du rendement à la découpe et de la composition tissulaire des carcasses de coqs et de chapons.

40|$|Summary &mdash; Data on {{live and}} carcass {{measurements}} {{were collected from}} 314 male Dandarawy chicks (Egyptian strain) from 33 sires and 157 dams using 2 full-sibs per dam. They were weighed, keel and shank length being recorded, and then slaughtered at 12 and 16 weeks of age (one progeny per dam at each age). Carcass weight was recorded. Dressing and giblet percentages were calculated as percentages of the live body weight. The means of live and carcass measurements indicated that our local strain Dandarawy had lower values than the meat type of fowls (broilers). The heritability estimates for weight and length measurements ranged from 0. 6 to 1. 3 calculated from the sire component of variance, but the estimates were very low and not significant for the dressing and giblet percentages. Those estimates indicated the possibility of improving weight and length measurements by individual selection. The phenotypic correlations between 12 and 16 weeks of age were significant for all the traits except the dressing and giblet percentages.
