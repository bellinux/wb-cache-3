5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has {{adequate}} {{angular resolution}} {{to separate the}} light from the moons from that of Haumea. <b>Photometry</b> of the Haumea triple system with HST's NICMOS camera has confirmed that the spectral line at 1.6µm that indicates the presence of water ice is at least as strong in the moons' spectra as in Haumea's spectrum.|$|E
5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} <b>photometry</b> to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the Milky Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} {{measurements for}} stars were obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness, {{a process that}} was slow and inexact. Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on a photographic plate. Regardless, neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy. Joel Stebbins' pioneering research for astronomical <b>photometry</b> {{took place at the}} observatory.|$|E
5|$|Leavitt worked {{sporadically}} {{during her}} time at Harvard, often sidelined by {{health problems and}} family obligations. An illness contracted after her graduation from Radcliffe College rendered her increasingly deaf. In 1921, when Harlow Shapley took over {{as director of the}} observatory, Leavitt was made head of stellar <b>photometry.</b> By the end of that year she had succumbed to cancer, and was buried in the Leavitt family plot at Cambridge Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|When Robert Baker arrived he {{continued}} a photoelectric <b>photometry</b> program focusing on variable stars. He {{continued to use}} the 12-inch refractor until 1927 when a new photometer was constructed and attached it to the 30-inch reflector telescope in the Observatory annex. He supervised two graduate students who worked on this equipment in the early 1930s. On May 27, 1933 the star Arcturus provided light which fell onto a photo cell in the observatory's annex and sent a signal to open the Chicago World's Fair.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{classified}} as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move {{into and out of}} the line of sight as it rotates. Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2days, which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term magnetic activity. <b>Photometry</b> has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing differential rotation i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high latitude. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.|$|E
5|$|The far-infrared (24–70μm) and {{submillimeter}} (70–500μm) <b>photometry</b> {{performed by}} Spitzer and Herschel telescopes {{revealed that the}} surface of Makemake is not homogeneous. Although the majority of it is covered by nitrogen and methane ices, where the albedo ranges from 78 to 90%, there are small patches of dark terrain whose albedo is only 2 to 12%, and that make up 3–7% of the surface. These studies were made before S/2015 (136472) 1 was discovered; thus, these small dark patches may actually have been the dark surface of the satellite rather than any actual surface features on Makemake. However, another experiment has refuted these studies. Between 2006 and 2013, the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo acquired new visible and near infra-red spectra for Makemake that covered nearly 80% of its surface; this {{study found that the}} variation in the spectra were negligible, suggesting that Makemake's surface may indeed be homogenous.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel's heavily cratered surface has {{probably}} been stable since the Late Heavy Bombardment. The only signs of the ancient internal activity are canyons and dark polygons—dark patches with complex shapes measuring from tens to hundreds of kilometers across. The polygons were identified from precise <b>photometry</b> of Voyager 2s images and are distributed more or less uniformly {{on the surface of}} Umbriel, trending northeast–southwest. Some polygons correspond to depressions of a few kilometers deep and may have been created during an early episode of tectonic activity. Currently there is no explanation for why Umbriel is so dark and uniform in appearance. Its surface may be covered by a relatively thin layer of dark material (so called umbral material) excavated by an impact or expelled in an explosive volcanic eruption. Alternatively, Umbriel's crust may be entirely composed of the dark material, which prevented formation of bright features like crater rays. However, the presence of the bright feature within Wunda seems to contradict this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric <b>photometry,</b> using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} section of Photoemtria, Lambert {{established}} and demonstrated the laws of <b>photometry.</b> He did this with visual <b>photometry</b> and to establish the uncertainties involved, described its approximate limits by determining how small a brightness difference the visual system could determine.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the laws}} of <b>photometry</b> {{and a great deal}} of geometry, Lambert {{calculated}} the times and depths of twilight.|$|E
25|$|The International Commission on Illumination, {{also known}} as the CIE from its French title, la Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage, will soon be {{releasing}} its own form of unified <b>photometry</b> for outdoor lighting.|$|E
25|$|An optical/infrared {{interferometer}} array doesn't collect as {{much light}} as a single telescope of equivalent size, but has the resolution of a single telescope {{the size of the}} array. For bright stars, this resolving power could be used to image a star's surface during a transit event and see the shadow of the planet transiting. This could provide a direct measurement of the planet's angular radius and, via parallax, its actual radius. This is more accurate than radius estimates based on transit <b>photometry,</b> which are dependent on stellar radius estimates which depend on models of star characteristics. Imaging also provides more accurate determination of the inclination than <b>photometry</b> does.|$|E
25|$|Gerald Kron (April 6, 1913 – April 9, 2012) was an American {{astronomer}} {{who was one}} of {{the pioneers}} of high-precision <b>photometry</b> with photoelectric instrumentation. He discovered the first starspot and made the first photometric observation of a stellar flare.|$|E
25|$|Using visual <b>photometry,</b> Lambert {{presented}} {{the results of}} many experimental determinations of specular and diffuse reflectance, {{as well as the}} transmittance of panes of glass and lenses. Among the most ingenious experiments he conducted was that to determine the reflectance of the interior surface of a pane of glass.|$|E
25|$|Both flame <b>photometry</b> {{and mass}} {{spectrometry}} are destructive tests, so particular care {{is needed to}} ensure that the aliquots used are truly representative of the sample. Ar–Ar dating is a similar technique which compares isotopic ratios from the same portion of the sample to avoid this problem.|$|E
25|$|The Observatory {{is located}} south of Smith Hall {{and north of}} the Morrow Plots. The {{building}} was designated as the National Historic Landmark by the Department of the Interior in 1989 as the birthplace in the early 1900s of photoelectric <b>photometry</b> through the work of Dr. Joel Stebbins. The Observatory {{is the site of}} frequent Astronomy Open House events and houses a 12-inch refractor telescope available for student and class use.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 Robert Frank Borkenstein (1912–2002) was {{a captain}} with the Indiana State Police {{and later a}} {{professor}} at Indiana University Bloomington. His Breathalyzer used chemical oxidation and <b>photometry</b> to determine alcohol concentrations. Subsequent breath analyzers have converted primarily to infrared spectroscopy. The invention of the Breathalyzer provided law enforcement with a non-invasive test providing immediate results to determine an individual's breath alcohol concentration {{at the time of}} testing.|$|E
25|$|Close non-eclipsing {{binaries}} {{can also}} be photometrically detected by observing how the stars affect each other in three ways. First is by observing extra light which the stars reflect from their companion. Second is by observing ellipsoidal light variations which are caused by deformation of the star's shape by their companions. The third method is by looking at how relativistic beaming affects the apparent magnitude of the stars. Detecting binaries with these methods requires accurate <b>photometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Inferences about regoliths from phase curves are {{frequently}} based on Hapke parameterization. However, in a blind test M. Shepard and P. Helfenstein found no {{strong evidence that}} {{a particular set of}} Hapke parameters derived from photometric data could uniquely reveal the physical state of laboratory samples. These tests included modeling the three-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions and the coherent backscatter opposition effect. This negative finding suggests that the radiative transfer model developed by B. Hapke may be inadequate for physical modeling based on <b>photometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Voyager 2 {{images and}} {{subsequent}} ground-based <b>photometry</b> indicated that Hyperion's rotation is chaotic, that is, its {{axis of rotation}} wobbles so much that its orientation in space is unpredictable. Its Lyapunov time is around 30 days. Hyperion, together with Pluto's moons Nix and Hydra, is among only a few moons in the Solar System known to rotate chaotically, although {{it is expected to}} be common in binary asteroids. It is also the only regular planetary natural satellite in the Solar System known not to be tidally locked.|$|E
25|$|All {{semiconductors}} {{are subject}} to optical charge carrier generation. This is typically an undesired effect, so most semiconductors are packaged in light blocking material. Photodiodes are intended to sense light(photodetector), so they are packaged in materials that allow light to pass, and are usually PIN (the kind of diode most sensitive to light). A photodiode {{can be used in}} solar cells, in <b>photometry,</b> or in optical communications. Multiple photodiodes may be packaged in a single device, either as a linear array or as a two-dimensional array. These arrays {{should not be confused with}} charge-coupled devices.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes Doppler spectrography {{produces}} false signals, {{especially in}} multi-planet and multi-star systems. Magnetic fields and {{certain types of}} stellar activity can also give false signals. When the host star has multiple planets, false signals can also arise from having insufficient data, so that multiple solutions can fit the data, as stars are not generally observed continuously. Some of the false signals can be eliminated by analyzing {{the stability of the}} planetary system, conducting <b>photometry</b> analysis on the host star and knowing its rotation period and stellar activity cycle periods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photometry</b> / {{spectrophotometry}} When the absorbance of {{a specific}} wavelength of light while passing through a fixed path-length through a cuvette of liquid test sample is measured and the absorbance is compared with a blank and standards with graded amounts of the target compound. If the emitted light is {{of a specific}} visible wavelength it may be called colorimetry, or it may involve specific wavelength of light e.g. by use of laser and emission of fluorescent signals of another specific wavelength which is detected via very specific wavelength optical filters.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} in this book that Huygens {{published}} his method for estimating stellar distances. He {{made a series of}} smaller holes in a screen facing the sun, until he estimated the light was of the same intensity as that of the star Sirius. He then calculated that the angle of this hole was th the diameter of the Sun, and thus it was about 30,000 times as far away, on the (incorrect) assumption that Sirius is as luminous as our sun. The subject of <b>photometry</b> remained in its infancy until Pierre Bouguer and Johann Heinrich Lambert.|$|E
25|$|The albedos of planets, {{satellites}} and minor planets such as asteroids {{can be used}} to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises {{a major part of the}} astronomical field of <b>photometry.</b> For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids.|$|E
25|$|The {{first new}} {{instruments}} were {{delivered in the}} spring of 1914. The 65cm refractor — the first big astronomical instrument manufactured by the famous enterprise of Carl Zeiss Jena — was mounted in 1915, whereas the completion of the 122cm reflector telescope was delayed until 1924 by the First World War. Struve died in 1920 from an accident, and his successor was Paul Guthnick, who introduced in 1913 photoelectric <b>photometry</b> into astronomy as the first objective method of measuring the brightness of stars. When the 122cm telescope (at this time the second largest in the world) was finished, the Babelsberg Observatory was the best-equipped observatory of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Determining {{the nature}} of this {{seasonal}} variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere has existed for less than 84 Earth years, or one full Uranian year. A number of discoveries have however been made. <b>Photometry</b> over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes. A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s. Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near 1986 solstice.|$|E
25|$|Dust and {{molecules}} in {{the interstellar medium}} not only obscures <b>photometry,</b> but also causes absorption lines in spectroscopy. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component electrons between different energy levels, or by rotational or vibrational spectra. Detection usually occurs in radio, microwave, or infrared portions of the spectrum. The chemical reactions that form these molecules can happen in cold, diffuse clouds or in the hot ejecta around a white dwarf star from a nova or supernova. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as acetylene (C2H2) generally group together to form graphites or other sooty material, but other organic molecules such as acetone ((CH3)2CO) and buckminsterfullerenes (C60 and C70) have been discovered.|$|E
25|$|High speed <b>photometry</b> of {{the system}} shows {{multiple}} periods of variation in the luminosity. The main period of seconds (17m 8.73s) is the orbital period of the pair. A secondary period of seconds (17m 31s) {{is believed to be}} caused by a superhump—an elevated outburst in the signal that occurs with a period slightly longer than the orbital period. The superhump {{may be the result of}} an elongation of the accretion disk in combination with precession. The elliptical disk precesses about the white dwarf over a time interval much longer than the orbital period, causing a slight change in the orientation of the disk over each orbit.|$|E
25|$|Given a {{centroid}} for the cluster, {{which can}} be determined by using a reconstructed mass distribution or optical or X-ray data, a model can be fit to the shear profile {{as a function of}} clustrocentric radius. For example, the singular isothermal sphere (SIS) profile and the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile are two commonly used parametric models. Knowledge of the lensing cluster redshift and the redshift distribution of the background galaxies is also necessary for estimation of the mass and size from a model fit; these redshifts can be measured precisely using spectroscopy or estimated using <b>photometry.</b> Individual mass estimates from weak lensing can only be derived for the most massive clusters, and the accuracy of these mass estimates are limited by projections along the line of sight.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem with}} wave heating {{has been the}} {{complete}} absence, until the late 1990s, of any direct evidence of waves propagating through the solar corona. The first direct observation of waves propagating into and through the solar corona was made in 1997 with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory space-borne solar observatory, the first platform capable of observing the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) {{for long periods of}} time with stable <b>photometry.</b> Those were magneto-acoustic waves with a frequency of about 1 millihertz (mHz, corresponding to a 1,000 second wave period), that carry only about 10% of the energy required to heat the corona. Many observations exist of localized wave phenomena, such as Alfvén waves launched by solar flares, but those events are transient and cannot explain the uniform coronal heat.|$|E
25|$|Early visual {{observations}} {{contributing to}} the phase curve of Mercury were obtained by G. Muller in the 1800s and by André-Louis Danjon in the mid-twentieth century. W. Irvine and colleagues used photoelectric <b>photometry</b> in the 1960s. Some of these early data were analyzed by G. de Vaucouleurs, summarized by D. Harris and used for predicting apparent magnitudes in the Astronomical Almanac for several decades. Highly accurate new observations covering the widest range of phase angles to date (2 to 170°) were carried out by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard using the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite. They also obtained new CCD observations from the ground. These data are now {{the major source of}} the phase curve used in the Astronomical Almanac for predicting apparent magnitudes.|$|E
25|$|The {{telescope}}s amateur telescope makers build {{range from}} backyard variety to sophisticated instruments that make meaningful {{contributions to the}} field of astronomy. Instruments built by amateurs have been employed in planetary study, astrometry, <b>photometry,</b> comet and asteroid discovery to name just a few. Even the “hobbyist” end of the field can break down into several distinct categories such as: observing deep sky objects, observing the planets, solar observing, lunar observation, and astrophotography of all those classes of objects. Therefore, the design, size, and construction of the telescopes vary as well. Some amateur telescope makers build instruments that, while looking crude, are wholly suited to the purpose they are designed for. Others may strive for a more aesthetic look with high levels of mechanical “finish”. Since some amateur telescope makers {{do not have access to}} high-precision machining equipment, many elegant designs such as the Poncet Platform, Crayford focuser, and the Dobsonian telescope have evolved, which achieve functionality and stability without requiring precision machining.|$|E
25|$|Their {{findings}} show that the three GPs display relatively low Extinction (astronomy), low oxygen abundances and high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. Also reported are the clear signatures of Wolf–Rayet stars, of which a population are found (between ~800 and ~1200). A combination of population and evolutionary synthesis models strongly suggest a formation history dominated by starbursts. These models show that these three GPs currently undergo a major starburst producing between ~4% and ~20% of their stellar mass. However, as these models imply, they are old galaxies having formed most of their stellar mass several billion years ago. The presence of old stars has been spectroscopically verified {{in one of the}} three galaxies by the detection of Magnesium. Surface <b>photometry,</b> using data from the Hubble Space Telescope archive, indicates that the three GPs possess an exponential low surface brightness envelope (see Low-surface-brightness galaxy). This suggests that GPs are identifiable with major episodes in the assembly history of local Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies.|$|E
500|$|The {{observatory}} holds {{significance in}} astronomy {{because of its}} association {{with the development of}} selenium and photoelectric cell. The cell revolutionized the science of astronomical photoelectric <b>photometry</b> by the use of electricity to measure the brightness of stars by providing a more precise and accurate measurement compared to the visual and photographic methods common at that time. This branch of astronomy measures stellar magnitude. The research regarding <b>photometry</b> was conducted on a [...] Warner and Swasey refractor telescope in the second-story equatorial room. [...] As a result of Dr. Stebbins' work determining stellar magnitude using photoelectric <b>photometry,</b> it became standard technique. Due to this astronomical importance the observatory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 6, 1986 and on December 20, 1989 the U.S. Department of Interior designated the U of I Observatory a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
