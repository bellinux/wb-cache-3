25|$|Incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton was ineligible {{to serve}} a third term due to term {{limitations}} in the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution, and Vice <b>President</b> <b>Gore</b> was able to secure the Democratic nomination with relative ease. Bush {{was seen as the}} early favorite for the Republican nomination and, despite a contentious primary battle with Senator John McCain and other candidates, secured the nomination by Super Tuesday. Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate, while Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his. Both major party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Clinton and Gore often did not campaign together, a deliberate decision resulting from the Lewinsky sex scandal two years prior.|$|E
500|$|During the {{election}} and his term as Vice <b>President,</b> <b>Gore</b> popularized the term Information Superhighway, which became synonymous with the Internet, and {{he was involved in}} the creation of the National Information Infrastructure. Gore first discussed his plans to emphasize information technology at UCLA on January 11, 1994, in a speech at The Superhighway Summit. He was involved in a number of projects including NetDay'96 and 24 Hours in Cyberspace. The Clinton–Gore administration also launched the first official White House website in 1994 and subsequent versions through 2000. The Clipper Chip, which [...] "Clinton inherited from a multi-year National Security Agency effort", was a method of hardware encryption with a government backdoor. It met with strong opposition from civil liberty groups and was abandoned by 1996.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph came in 1997, {{when she}} {{convinced}} Clinton {{to support a}} stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot. [...] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade. [...] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said {{the costs of the}} new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter. [...] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice <b>President</b> <b>Gore</b> to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent. [...] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate, and had come {{in the face of a}} silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration. [...] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination. [...] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor. [...] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions [...] "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura" [...] and Time magazine labelled Browner the [...] "Queen of Clean Air". [...] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns, Browner said: [...] "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125million Americans, including 35million children." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Clipper Chip, which [...] "Clinton {{inherited}} from a multi-year National Security Agency effort," [...] was {{a method of}} hardware encryption with a government backdoor. In 1994, Vice <b>President</b> <b>Gore</b> issued a memo {{on the topic of}} encryption, which stated that under a new policy the White House would [...] "provide better encryption to individuals and businesses while ensuring that the needs of law enforcement and national security are met. Encryption is a law and order issue, since it can be used by criminals to thwart wiretaps and avoid detection and prosecution." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Vice <b>President,</b> <b>Gore</b> {{promoted}} {{the development of}} what he {{referred to as the}} Information Superhighway. This was discussed in detail a few days after winning the election in November 1992 in The New York Times article [...] "Clinton to Promote High Technology, With Gore in Charge." [...] They planned to finance research [...] "that will flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry." [...] Specifically, they were aiming to fund the development of [...] "robotics, smart roads, biotechnology, machine tools, magnetic-levitation trains, fiber-optic communications, and national computer networks. Also earmarked are a raft of basic technologies like digital imaging and data storage." [...] These initiatives were met with some skepticism from critics who claimed that [...] "the initiative is likely to backfire, bloating Congressional pork, and creating whole new categories of Federal waste." [...] These initiatives were outlined in the report Technology for America's Economic Growth. In September 1993, they released a report calling {{for the creation of a}} [...] "nationwide information superhighway," [...] which would primarily be built by private industry. Gary Stix commented on these initiatives a few months prior in his May 1993 article for Scientific American, [...] "Gigabit Gestalt: Clinton and Gore embrace an activist technology policy." [...] Stix described them as a [...] "distinct statement about where the new administration stands on the matter of technology [...] Gone is the ambivalence or outright hostility toward government involvement in little beyond basic science. Although Gore is most famous for his political career and environmental work, he is also noted for his creation of the internet."
