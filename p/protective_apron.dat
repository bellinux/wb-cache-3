6000|$|In {{his various}} voyages, which we might almost style journeys, the {{originator}} of the [...] "Rob Roy" [...] canoe proved conclusively {{that there were}} few earthly objects which could form a barrier to his progress.

40|$|<b>Protective</b> <b>aprons</b> in imaging departments: {{manufacturer}} stated lead equivalence values require validation Abstract The {{composition of}} pro-tective aprons worn by X-ray per-sonnel to shield against secondary radiation is changing. Lead is {{being replaced by}} either lead-free or com-posite (lead with other high atomic numbered elements) materials. These newer aprons are categorised by manufacturers in terms of lead equivalent values, but {{it is unclear how}} these stated values compare with actual lead equivalent values. In this work, the actual lead equivalence of 41 <b>protective</b> <b>aprons</b> from four man-ufacturers, all specified as having 0. 25 mm lead equivalence, were investigated with transmission ex-periments at 70 and 100 kVp. All aprons were in current use. The aprons were screened for defects, and age, weight and design was recorded along with details of associated quality assurance (QA). Out of the 41 <b>protective</b> <b>aprons</b> examined for actual lead equivalence, 73 % were outside tolerance levels, with actual levels in some aprons demonstrating {{less than half of the}} nominal values. The lack of compatibility between actual and nominal lead equivalent values was demonstrated by aprons from three of the four manufacturers investigated. The area of the defects found on screening of the <b>protective</b> <b>aprons</b> were within recommendations. The results highlight the need for accep-tancy and ongoing checks of protec-tive aprons to ensure that radiation exposure of imaging personnel is kept to a minimum...|$|R

The study is based on a questionnaire in the district of Gävleborg in the spring of 2009. Nurses, auxiliaries and carers whom were in close contact with patients were asked to join the study. In total 134 participated, 67 within municipal care and 67 from hospital care. The result showed that there was a lack of compliance of routines in both areas. The most significant difference was to be seen in the compliance of using hand disinfectant before close contact with the patients.

Before the special holder was introduced it was not possible to derive a relation between the doses above and those under the lead apron, as the doses were measured at varying places above and under the lead apron. There is no evidence that the effective dose can be estimated more accurately when an additional dosimeter is used. The present study revealed a threshold before doses under the lead apron were measured. Due to the threshold it can be concluded that the doses under the lead apron will not be underestimated easily when doses above the lead apron are used to calculate them.

40|$|Journal articleThe aim of {{this study}} was to design and execute a pilot study to collect {{information}} on the personal exposure levels of podiatrists to microbial hazards in podiatry clinics and also to assess health and safety knowledge within the sector using a questionnaire survey. A self-report quantitative questionnaire dealing with health and safety/health issues was issued to 250 podiatrist clinics. Fifteen podiatry clinics were randomly recruited to participate in the exposure study. Concentrations of airborne bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and moulds were assessed using a six-stage viable microbial cascade impactor. Personal samples of total inhalable dust and endotoxin were measured in the breathing zone of the podiatrist. A questionnaire response rate of 42 % (N = 101) was achieved. Thirty-two per cent of respondents indicated that they had a respiratory condition; asthma was the most prevalent condition reported. The most frequently employed control measures reported were use of disposable gloves during patient treatments (73. 3 %), use of respiratory protective equipment (34. 6 %), use of <b>protective</b> <b>aprons</b> (16. 8 %), and eye protection (15. 8 %). A total of 15. 8 % of respondents used mechanical room ventilation, 47. 5 % used nail drills with local exhaust ventilation systems, and 11 % used nail drills with water spray dust suppression. The geometric mean concentrations of bacteria, Staphylococci, fungi, and yeasts/moulds were 590, 190, 422, and 59 CFU m(- 3), respectively. The geometric mean endotoxin exposure was 9. 6 EU m(- 3). A significant percentage of all the bioaerosols that were in the respirable fraction was representative of yeasts and moulds (65 %) and Fungi (87 %).

This paper examined risk factors for leptospirosis seropositivity in slaughterhouse workers in western Kenya. Methods The study was conducted between May 2011 and October 2012. Questionnaires were used to collect information from workers on demographic data, health and hygiene practices in the slaughterhouse. A commercial ELISA detected antibodies to Leptospira spp. in serum samples and multilevel logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with leptospirosis seropositivity. Results A total of 737 workers from 142 slaughterhouses were recruited. The seroprevalence of antibodies to Leptospira spp. was 13. 4 % (95 % CI 11. 1 % to 16. 1 %). Risk factors included: having wounds (OR 3. 1; 95 % CI 1. 5 to 6. 1); smoking (OR 1. 8; 95 % CI 1. 1 to 2. 9); eating at work (OR 2. 1; 95 % CI 1. 2 to 3. 6); cleaning the offal (OR 5. 1; 95 % CI 1. 8 to 15. 0); and having a borehole for personal water use (OR 2. 3; 95 % CI 1. 1 to 4. 7). At the slaughterhouse level, risk factors included having a roof (OR 2. 6; 95 % CI 1. 2 to 5. 6) and drawing water from a well (OR 2. 2; 95 % CI 1. 2 to 4. 0). Protective factors included working in slaughterhouses where antemortem inspection was conducted (OR 0. 6; 95 % CI 0. 4 to 1. 0) and where workers wore <b>protective</b> <b>aprons</b> (OR 0. 4; 95 % CI 0. 2 to 0. 7).

Instructors advised orally; however, they made an effort to let trainees do the procedure by themselves and to assist directly through hands-on instruction as little as possible. The trainee and instructors wore a <b>protective</b> lead <b>apron</b> and radio-protective glasses. An instructor evaluated the procedure on the monitor and timed the procedure. If the trainee could not either implant or retrieve a filter within 13  minutes, the instructor assisted with a hands-on demonstration and allowed the trainee to continue from that point or actually completed the procedure in place of the trainee from that point forward. Time required for implantation and retrieval of the filter, respectively, was measured. When a trainee could not successfully implant or retrieve the filter within 13  minutes, the procedure time was noted as 13  minutes.|$|R
