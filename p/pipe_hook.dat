50|$|Although the {{original}} plans called for two towers {{on the north}} and south ends of the facade; only the south tower was built. The Cathedral's tower contained a 43-bell carillon that was made by Bollee & Son, in Le Mans France. At the time of its completion in 1869, the clarion was the largest in America and the third largest in the world. Installed in St. Joseph's in 1870, the bells were too large for the cathedral's tower and never worked properly. Currently all but 2 of the bells have been removed from the church tower. Bishop Stephen V. Ryan had the Lady Chapel built {{in the rear of the}} cathedral in 1873. The loft in the rear of the church contains a 3,627 <b>pipe</b> <b>Hook</b> & Hastings organ. The organ was originally built in 1876 for the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, where it was played frequently for concerts. It was moved to the Cathedral following the end of the Exposition in November, 1876.|$|E
25|$|Most {{hardware}} stores were raided, especially in San Victorino district. People armed themselves with <b>pipes,</b> <b>hooks,</b> steel rods, hatchets, saws, and machetes. Some policemen joined the mobs. Others were confused {{and waited for}} orders that never came.|$|R
5000|$|Horizontal {{supports}} {{are held}} in place by small metal hooks permanently mounted to each end of the <b>pipe.</b> The <b>hooks</b> are then placed into a slot on the upright and {{held in place by}} gravity, thereby making the pipe and drape support system.|$|R
50|$|Trouble-free {{locomotive}} running {{requires that}} there is sufficient traction between wheel and rail. Steam engines therefore had sandboxes (usually two, {{on top of the}} boiler). These were filled with the help of sanding equipment. For sanding there was either a sanding system with an elevated bunker or a sanding tower. The special sand was kept in its own store. On a sanding tower a telescopic <b>pipe</b> was <b>hooked</b> up to the sandbox, the lock released and the locomotive sandbox filled as required. All Betriebswerke had to have enough sand for at least 30 days.|$|R
60|$|Turnbull {{thrust his}} first finger down the aperture, {{and at last}} managed to make a slight further fissure in the piping. The light that came up from beyond was very faint, and {{apparently}} indirect; it seemed to fall from some hole or window higher up. As he was screwing his eye to peer at this grey and greasy twilight he was astonished to see another human finger very long and lean come down from above towards the broken <b>pipe</b> and <b>hook</b> it up to something higher. The lighted aperture was abruptly blackened and blocked, presumably by a face and mouth, for something human spoke down the tube, though the words were not clear.|$|R
40|$|The Quarter {{began with}} {{installing}} the new drill <b>pipe,</b> <b>hooking</b> {{up the new}} hydraulic power unit, completing the pipe rotation system (Task 4 has been completed), and making the SWACO choke operational. Detailed design and procurement work is proceeding on a system to elevate the drill-string section. The prototype Foam Generator Cell has been completed by Temco and delivered. Work is currently underway to calibrate the system. Literature review and preliminary model development for cuttings transportation with polymer foam under EPET conditions are in progress. Preparations for preliminary cuttings transport experiments with polymer foam have been completed. Two nuclear densitometers were re-calibrated. Drill pipe rotation system was tested up to 250 RPM. Water flow tests were conducted while rotating the drill pipe up to 100 RPM. The accuracy of weight measurements for cuttings in the annulus was evaluated. Additional modifications of the cuttings collection system are being considered {{in order to obtain}} the desired accurate measurement of cuttings weight in the annular test section. Cutting transport experiments with aerated fluids are being conducted at EPET, and analyses of the collected data are in progress. The printed circuit board is functioning with acceptable noise level to measure cuttings concentration at static condition using ultrasonic method. We were able to conduct several tests using a standard low pass filter to eliminate high frequency noise. We tested to verify that we can distinguish between different depths of sand in a static bed of sand. We tested with water, air and a mix of the two mediums. Major modifications to the DTF have almost been completed. A stop-flow cell is being designed for the DTF, the ACTF and Foam Generator/Viscometer which will allow us to capture bubble images without the need for ultra fast shutter speeds or microsecond flash system...|$|R
50|$|The First Congregational Church in Woburn is an {{historic}} Congregational church at 322 Main Street in Woburn, Massachusetts. The congregation, established in 1642, {{is one of}} the oldest in the United States, and its church building (the sixth for the congregation) is a local landmark. The Italianate-style church was built in 1860, and its 196 ft steeple is believed to be the tallest wooden steeple in North America.The church is home to a historic E&GG <b>Hook</b> <b>pipe</b> organ, dating to the time of the church's construction.|$|R
5000|$|In 1829, Te Whakataupuka sold 60 acre of land at Preservation Inlet to the whaler, Peter Williams, on {{payment of}} sixty muskets, 1000 lb of gunpowder, 1000 lb of musket balls, two 12 lb cannonades, two air-guns, {{and a large}} {{quantity}} of tobacco, <b>pipes,</b> spades and <b>hooks.</b> This increased the armament of southern MƒÅori and facilitated {{the establishment of the}} South Island's first whaling station. (In what became the historical province of Otago it was next followed by the Weller brothers' on Otago Harbour in 1831.) ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{focal point}} of the first floor hall is the open straight-run stair leading to the second floor and basement. It is {{detailed}} with turned balusters, heavy turned newel and curvilinear stair brackets. The entrance doors on the first floor have square bottom panels and elongated upper panels the tops of which are arched on the exterior. The hall has a chair rail and dentilled cornice. A single period light fixture hangs from the center of a round plaster moulding {{at the north end of}} the hall. Wood panels placed diagonally in the corners of the north end of the hall were added to disguise <b>pipes.</b> Two hammock <b>hooks</b> are located in the east and west walls at the north end of the hall.|$|R
40|$|Downhole {{restrictions}} are causing non-productive time, which represents large economic losses. Knowing {{the cause of}} the restriction in order to implement the correct remedies are crucial for preventing extensive cleaning activities or even stuck <b>pipe.</b> Using the <b>hook</b> load signal to find special signatures for the different causes of restriction could be a solution to quick recognition of restriction type. In the wells studied it was found 22 cases of restriction, which could be divided into 5 main groups of causes; unstable wellbore, ledges, cuttings accumulation, differential sticking and local dogleg. One incident from each group was chosen for an extensive post-event analysis for the purpose of strengthening the hypothesis of the cause. The results from the study has shown that it was necessary to simplify the analysis in to two main types of hook load restriction signatures; fixed and moveable. For the physical interpretation of the two signatures, fixed and moveable, hook load signals from ledge and cuttings bed were used respectively. These were assumed to be good representatives for the two main types, and the signals proved to coincide with the physical explanation valid for them. The two groups were created based on the clear differences in the hook load signals between ledges and cuttings accumulation visible in the post-event analysis. Both of these causes of restriction have a very clear physical explanation; when the drill string encounters a ledge it will stop moving and is thereby fixed to one position in the well. On the other hand, cuttings downhole is moveable and is able to move along with the drill string. It became clear that dividing signatures into groups based on causes of restrictions was not {{the best way to do}} it, but rather divide it into groups based on physical explanation such as fixed and moveable. From that point on causes of {{restrictions are}} related to one or two of the two main groups. The goal of distinguishing hook load signals from different causes of restrictions was reached to some extent. It was found that by recognizing if the restriction was fixed or moveable by looking at the hook load signal, 4 out of 5 causes of restrictions were distinguishable. This was possible because unstable wellbore was recognized by including both fixed and moveable restrictions and differential sticking was recognized by occurring at the beginning of a stand pulled. </p...|$|R
