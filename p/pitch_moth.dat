40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Ponderosa pine is an {{important}} species both commercially and ecologically in western North America. This study considers the incidence of insect and disease pests {{on a series of}} replicated ponderosa pine research plantations in northern California. The studies, on an environmental gradient, contain a series of silvicultural treatments including vegetation control, fertilization application and insecticide application/ thinning. The mean annual temperature and total precipitation were used as climatic variables and the site index was considered as an environmental site variable. Needle retention was negatively correlated to the site productivity, with no treatment affects. Estimates of mean needle retention were in-line with those found in the literature. Total foliar herbivory was the lowest at the highest productivity site, again there were no treatment effects. The gouty pitch midge had the highest level of infestation on the branches of the trees at the site with the lowest productivity. The environmental variables support this with drier, warmer and higher sites being more susceptible. Sequoia <b>pitch</b> <b>moth</b> attacks were highest at the more drier and warmer sites while treatments with vegetation control appear to experience higher levels of attack. Total foliar pathogen infection was the lowest at the highest site index. There was no statistically significant difference between the other five sites and no treatment effect was established. Western gall rust was the highest that the most productive sites and treatments that were fertilized had higher levels of infection. The year of gall infection was associated with the occurrence of El Ni√±o events in the study time period...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 The Douglas-fir <b>pitch</b> <b>moth</b> (DFPM), Synanthedon novaroensis, is {{attracted}} to exudations of oleoresin and oviposits at wounds on the bole of host trees. Larvae then feed in subcortical regions of vigourously growing hosts. With the increase use of pruning in young stands of Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menzesii (Mirb.) Franco, the potential exists for the DFPM, {{attracted to}} pruning wounds, to create defects {{that would reduce}} the value of wood products and erode potential returns on this investment. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to investigate the relationship between host selection behavior of the DFPM related to intermediate silvicultural activities such as pruning. Specific objectives of this study were to determine if DFPM demonstrates an ovipositional preference between: individual pruned Douglas-fir trees; clones of Douglas-fir; branch pruning wounds and wounds on the bole of Douglas-fir; pruning wounds made through the branch collar and wounds made outside the branch collar; and wounds made during different seasons of the year. A series of field experiments were conducted in young Douglas-fir stands in Western Washington from 1991 - 1997. The principal conclusions from these experiments were: DFPM host preference varies significantly between individual Douglas-fir trees; DFPM host preference varies significantly between clones of Douglas-fir; DFPM oviposits at wounds on the bole of a host more often than at wounds made outside the branch collar; DFPM oviposits significantly more often at pruning wounds made through the branch collar than at pruning wounds made outside the branch collar; and DFPM oviposits significantly more often at pruning wounds made in the spring than at pruning wounds made in summer, autumn, or winter...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{sometimes}} described, e.g., by Switzer (1960), as relatively {{resistant to}} attack by insects and disease, white spruce {{is far from}} immune to depredation. Important insect pests of white spruce include the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana [...] ), the yellow-headed spruce sawfly (Pikonema alaskensis Rohwer), the European spruce sawfly (Gilpinia hercyniae [...] ), and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis [...] ) (Fowells 1965, Rose and Lindquist 1985, Ives and Wong 1988). As well, other budworms, sawflies, and bark beetles, gall formers, bud midges, leaf miners, aphids, leaf eaters, leaf rollers, loopers, mites, scales, weevils, borers, <b>pitch</b> <b>moths,</b> and spittlebugs cause varying degrees of damage to white spruce (Ives and Wong 1988).|$|R
