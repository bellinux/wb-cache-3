5000|$|Electric current {{assisted}} sintering (ECAS) technologies rely on electric currents {{to densify}} powders, with {{the advantage of}} reducing production time dramatically (from 15 minutes of the slowest ECAS to a few microseconds of the fastest), not requiring a long furnace heat and allowing near theoretical densities but with the drawback of simple shapes. Powders employed in ECAS can avoid binders thanks {{to the possibility of}} direct sintering, without the need of <b>pre-pressing</b> and a green compact. Molds are designed for the final part shape since the powders densify while filling the cavity under an applied pressure thus avoiding the problem of shape variations caused by non isotropic sintering and distortions caused by gravity at high temperatures. The most common of these technologies is hot pressing, which has been under use for the production of the diamond tools employed in the construction industry. Spark plasma sintering and electro sinter forging are two modern, industrial commercial ECAS technologies.|$|E

Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in thickness swelling between <b>pre-pressing</b> and post-pressing. On the other hand, the internal bond strength of post-pressed board Nos. 4 and 5 was 0.40 and 0.36  MPa, respectively, and that of pre-pressed board Nos. 1 and 2 was 0.16 and 0.23  MPa, respectively. The <b>pre-pressing</b> reduced the internal bond strength. Also, at 210  °C, there was no statistically significant difference in the modulus of rupture and thickness swelling between <b>pre-pressing</b> and post-pressing. The internal bond strength was more greatly reduced by the <b>pre-pressing</b> compared to the post-pressing.|$|E

30|$|Board Nos. 3 and 8 were {{manufactured}} without <b>pre-pressing</b> or post-pressing but {{by pressing}} at 190 and 210  °C, respectively, while injecting high-pressure air for 8  min. Of the boards pressed at 190  °C, board No. 3 showed the highest {{internal bond strength}}; and board No. 8 marked the highest internal bond strength among the boards pressed at 210  °C, showing that <b>pre-pressing</b> reduced the internal bond strength and post-pressing did not increase the internal bond strength. Therefore, {{it is likely that}} <b>pre-pressing</b> is not effective and injecting high-pressure air from the start of pressing is effective for increasing the internal bond strength.|$|E
30|$|As {{described}} above, {{air injection}} lowered the modulus of rupture. To increase it, boards were pre-pressed {{prior to the}} air-injection pressing. Air injection lowers the temperature at the board surface {{at the start of}} pressing [4], which would likely inhibit the binder from curing at the surface layer from which the air is injected (injection side). Air injection is also highly likely to cause the discharge of the binder from the injection side [5], reducing the bonding strength. As a result, the modulus of rupture also reduced, because the modulus of rupture depends on the strength at the surface layer [12]. To prevent these reductions, the boards were pre-pressed. Because <b>pre-pressing</b> does not involve air injection, the injection side is thoroughly heated from the start of pressing, and thus the binder cures sufficiently. <b>Pre-pressing</b> does not cause discharge of the binder from the injection side either, and thus the binder remains and bonds the particles in the injection side. Due to these two reasons, <b>pre-pressing</b> was predicted to increase the modulus of rupture. After the <b>pre-pressing</b> process, air was injected to force out vapor, cure the binder in the center layer, and increase the strength in the center layer. For comparison, post-pressing was also tested.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Adhesion {{properties}} of soy protein isolate (SPI) on fiber cardboard {{and effects of}} press conditions, <b>pre-pressing</b> drying time, and protein concentrations on gluing strength were investigated. Shear strength increased as press time, press pres-sure, and/or press temperature increased. The effect of tempera-ture on shear strength became more significant at high press pressure. The shear strength of the SPI adhesive on fiber card-board decreased by 12 – 25 % after water soaking. Shear strength increased as <b>pre-pressing</b> drying time increased and reached its maximal value at about 10 min. An SPI/water ratio of 12 : 100 (w/w) gave the highest gluing strength. The specimens showed complete cohesive failure (fiber cardboard failure) except for soaked specimens pressed at low press temperature, low pres-sure, and short press time. Specimens pressed at 25 °C and 2 MPa for 5 min with <b>pre-pressing</b> drying time of 10 min and an SPI/water ratio of 12 : 100 (w/w) had T-peel strength and tensile bonding strength of 1. 15 N/mm and 0. 62 MPa, respectively, without water soaking, and 1. 11 N/mm and 0. 24 MPa, respec-tively, with water soaking...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} and coal {{has been the subject}} of many studies in recent years. This paper reports two different types of swelling experiments, one on confined and one on unconfined samples of pre-pressed, crushed bituminous coal, performed at gas or fluid pressures up to 10 MPa and temperatures of around 40 °C. These experiments confirm earlier observations of increased swelling of coal due to carbon dioxide adsorption compared with methane and argon. However, the experiments reveal a previously unrecognised swelling phenomenon. The swelling observed in the present samples is up to 3 times larger than that seen in block-shaped coal matrix fragments that have not been pre-compacted and is largely irreversible. We propose that <b>pre-pressing</b> led to permanent compaction of the internal pore structure of the coal matrix grains, decreasing the mean pore aperture and increasing the proportion of micropores. Introduction of CO 2 and CH 4 resulted in increased micropore adsorption which, through the associated surface forces developed within the micropores, led to a disjoining pressure effect that caused recovery of the pre-pressing-induced permanent strain. The higher affinity of micropores for CO 2 than for CH 4 adsorption, explains the markedly bigger effect of CO 2. After the recovery of the permanent strain was achieved, the samples seem to have exhibited a normal, reversible response to adsorption. We thus attribute the irreversible swelling effect seen in our experiments to the stress-history effect of <b>pre-pressing.</b> The findings of this study may be relevant for coals that have undergone deep burial after formation, or for naturally stressed coals in tectonic zones, which may exhibit more swelling upon gas adsorption than expected from their reversible adsorption capacity. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. Primary factors {{determining}} surface {{figure of}} optics, including the velocity and pressure distributions, have been analyzed and improving methods provided accordingly for the pad continuous polishing (CP). With a septum {{on the exterior}} of the workpiece <b>pre-pressing</b> the pad, the inevitable depression {{on the edge of the}} workpiece incurred by the elastic response of the pad has been relieved obviously. By introducing the driving wheel system, the rotation speed of the septum & workpiece can be regulated and adjusted to that of the lap/pad, which produces a uniform velocity distribution on the polishing surface. Diamond conditioners with ring & disk patterns are employed to planarize the annular polyurethane pad and hence uniformise the pressure distribution on the workpiece/pad interface. Polishing experiments (Fused silica flat, 320 mm in diameter x 30 mm thick) conducted on the typical CP machine have demonstrated advantages of these methods. 1...|$|E

These exchangers used as pre-conditioners saves about 55 MJ. t− 1 of heat by use of steam condensates. We could go further in use of these devices on the one hand to recover heat from press cake and meal, and secondly to use recovered energy to dry and warm up the seeds before <b>pre-pressing.</b> In this configuration, the energy savings could reach 38 % of current needs...|$|E

An optimum hole diameter was not found for the modulus of rupture and thickness swelling for a spacing of either 25 or 50  mm. In terms of internal bond strength, the optimum diameter of the holes arranged at a spacing of 25  mm was 1  mm, but the internal bond strength was not changed by the diameter of holes spaced 50  mm apart.
