40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} look into the causes of fire {{response}} and post-fire bearing capacity of the steel tubular columns protected with different materials, the fire test was conducted for a set of circular steel tubes protected with different materials such as gypsum fireproof panel, bamboo plywood and the ordinary <b>lumber</b> <b>core</b> plywood, and the steel tube without any protective material. The fire response temperature of surface of steel tubes is measured and the axial compressive bearing capacity of the specimens after fire are tested and analyzed. The test results show that gypsum fireproof panel has the best fire protection characteristics, the ordinary <b>lumber</b> <b>core</b> plywood and bamboo plywood can also retard rising of the surface temperature of the steel tubes during the initial 35 min although they are combustible materials. It is found that the post-fire bearing capacity of the steel tubes protected with different materials varies evidently, and the maximum value of response temperature has the greatest effect...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{study was}} an {{analysis}} of the potential to shorten pressing time or reduce pressing temperature for <b>plywood</b> resinated <b>with</b> alcohol- and ester-modified PF resin. Birch and pine plywoods were produced using such modified resin at a temperature range of 135 to  115 [*]°C, at a constant pressing time (4  min) and at pressing times ranging from  240 to 150  s at a constant pressing temperature (135 [*]°C). Tests showed that the application of PF resin modified with polyols and esters makes it possible, under standard pressing conditions, i. e. 135 [*]°C and pressing time of 4  min, to produce <b>plywood</b> <b>with</b> improved properties in comparison to respective control plywoods. Moreover, it was shown that the used modifiers enhance resin reactivity, facilitating an adequate course of resin curing, resulting in the manufacture of <b>plywoods</b> <b>with</b> good properties even at a pressing temperature reduced by  20 [*]°C or pressing time shortened to 150  s...|$|R
