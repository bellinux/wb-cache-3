Many reviewers stress in turn that Monster cables are not needed for lower-resolution televisions or over short distances and that the difference in audio quality is not substantial enough.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Loukyam and Govindudu Andarivadele, Aagadu lost major portion of its screens. In its lifetime, Aagadu {{collected}} a distributor share of 342.5 million and was declared a box office bomb due to the high costs involved. It however managed to <b>perform</b> <b>better</b> than the year's other commercial failures 1: Nenokkadine and Rabhasa. Aagadu final distributor share figures of AP/Nizam, Karnataka, {{and the rest of}} Indian box office stood at 214 million, 37.5 million and 16 million respectively. It also collected 62.5 million at the United States box office and 12.5 million at the other international markets in its full run.|$|E
5|$|Another {{complication}} is {{release in}} multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable {{example of this}} phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change {{and the growth of}} international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or <b>perform</b> <b>better</b> in big cities where tickets cost more.|$|E
40|$|For {{almost two}} decades the {{question}} of whether tabu search (TS) or simulated annealing (SA) <b>performs</b> <b>better</b> for the quadratic assignment problem has been unresolved. To answer this question satisfactorily, we compare performance at various values of targeted solution quality, running each heuristic at its optimal number of iterations for each target. We find that for a number of varied problem instances, SA <b>performs</b> <b>better</b> for higher quality targets while TS <b>performs</b> <b>better</b> for lower quality targets...|$|R

5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{began the}} 2009 season after {{finishing}} 7–6 in 2008, including a season-ending {{loss in the}} 2009 Gator Bowl to Nebraska. Heading into 2010, Clemson returned many of its 2009 players, but faced questions about whether those players would <b>perform</b> <b>better</b> with another year of experience. Also under question was head coach Dabo Swinney, who was beginning his first full season as {{head coach of the}} Tigers after assuming control in the seventh game of 2008. Clemson attempted to answer some of the questions about the team's potential in {{the first game of the}} season, a 37–14 win against Middle Tennessee State.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product Microsoft Office allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of the DOS and Windows kernels and of undocumented Application Programming Interface features to make Office <b>perform</b> <b>better</b> than its competitors. Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors. In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as peer-to-peer file and printing sharing. In November, Microsoft released {{the first version of}} their popular database software Microsoft Access.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 World's Best 10K he came third, {{beaten by}} Sammy Kitwara and Vincent Chepkok. He won the Lisbon Half Marathon {{for the third}} {{straight}} year, but was slower than previous times (59:34) due to warm conditions and having the flu. A run at the 2012 London Marathon saw him <b>perform</b> <b>better</b> than he did in 2010, but he lost touch with the leading pack after the halfway point and came fourteenth with a time of 2:10:41 hours. He was chosen as Eritrea's flag bearer at the 2012 London Olympics and ran in the 10,000 metres final. He set the pace early on in the race but was defeated in the sprint finish, finishing in sixth place some three seconds behind the winner Mo Farah. After the Olympics he ran at the 2012 World Half Marathon Championships. He dominated the race from just beyond the 5km point, and won it convincingly in a time of 1:00:19 hours, 32 seconds ahead of the runner-up, Deressa Chimsa. Only two weeks later he entered the Great Birmingham Run, but he appeared tired and finished third in a race where the top three all dipped under Haile Gebrselassie's course record.|$|E

5|$|For 1987, Forti {{moved up}} to International Formula 3000 with less {{immediate}} success than experienced in Formula Three. The main reason for this was the chassis the team chose to compete with. Instead of using customer Lolas, Marches or Ralts, {{all of which were}} produced by established companies who had many years' experience of designing and building such cars, Forti stuck with their Italian Formula Three chassis supplier Gian Paolo Dallara, who had just designed his company's first F3000 machine. Forti was the first team to use this machine, which was dubbed the Dallara 3087 (a chassis which later would make a single appearance in Formula One for the BMS Scuderia Italia team, as that team's car was not ready for the first race of the 1988 season). This combination of an inexperienced team and an untested car did not score any points in its first F3000 year, nor did the team attend every race on the schedule. Forti used 1988 to gain valuable experience in F3000, and this helped the team to <b>perform</b> <b>better</b> in following seasons, as did a change to more competitive Lola and then Reynard chassis.|$|E
25|$|Absolute {{pitch is}} not a {{prerequisite}} for skilled musical performance or composition. However, musicians with absolute pitch tend to <b>perform</b> <b>better</b> on musical transcription tasks (controlling for age of onset and amount of musical training) compared with those without absolute pitch. It {{has been argued that}} musicians with absolute pitch perform worse than those without absolute pitch on recognition of musical intervals. However, experiments on which this conclusion was based contained an artifact, and when this artifact was removed, absolute pitch possessors were found to <b>perform</b> <b>better</b> than nonpossessors on recognition of musical intervals.|$|E

50|$|Also, monolinguals <b>performed</b> <b>better</b> than bilinguals on verbal {{fluency in}} the study.

The same {{study also found that}} bilinguals, in a version of the letter fluency task that placed more demand on executive control, <b>performed</b> <b>better</b> than monolinguals. Thus, once vocabulary abilities were controlled, bilinguals <b>performed</b> <b>better</b> on letter fluency possibilities by the enhanced frontal executive processes in the brain.|$|R

Helicopters can land almost anywhere and are much easier to control in the air, but are slower. While previous Grand Theft Auto games {{had only a few}} aircraft that were difficult to access and fly, San Andreas has eleven fixed-wing aircraft and nine helicopters and makes them more integral in the game's missions. There is also the ability to skydive from aircraft, using a parachute. Several boats were added, while some were highly modified.|$|E
