5|$|A {{native of}} Póvoa de Varzim {{is called a}} Poveiro which can be {{rendered}} into English as Povoan. According to the 2001 Census, there were 63,470 inhabitants that year, 38 848 (61.2%) of whom lived in the city. The number goes up to 100,000 if adjacent satellite areas are taken into account, ranking it as the seventh largest independent urban area in Portugal, within a <b>polycentric</b> agglomeration of about 3 million people, ranging from Braga to Porto.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and <b>polycentric</b> public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester spans , which roughly {{covers the}} {{territory}} of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, the second most populous urban area in the UK. It is landlocked and borders Cheshire (to the south-west and south), Derbyshire (to the south-east), West Yorkshire (to the north-east), Lancashire (to the north) and Merseyside (to the west). There is a mix of high-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but land use is mostly urban — the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry. It has a focused central business district, formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford, but Greater Manchester is also a <b>polycentric</b> county with ten metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs.|$|E

25|$|The EU {{contains}} about 40 urban areas with populations of over one million, including the three megacities (cities {{with a population}} of over 10 million) of London, Paris, and the Rhine-Ruhr. In addition to large agglomerations, the EU also includes several densely populated <b>polycentric</b> urbanised regions that have no single core but have emerged from the connection of several cities and now encompass a large metropolis. The largest of these <b>polycentric</b> metropolis include Rhine-Ruhr with approximately 11.5million inhabitants (Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf et al.), Randstad with approx. 7million (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht et al.), Frankfurt Rhine-Main with approx. 5.8million (Frankfurt, Wiesbaden et al.), the Flemish Diamond with approx. 5.5million (Antwerp, Brussels, Leuven, Ghent et al.), and Øresund with approx. 3.7million (Copenhagen, Malmö).|$|E
25|$|Stoke is <b>polycentric,</b> {{having been}} {{formed by the}} {{federation}} of six towns in 1910.

The other four towns are Burslem, Tunstall, Longton, and Fenton.|$|E
25|$|Somalis {{for centuries}} have practiced {{a form of}} {{customary}} law, which they call xeer. Xeer is a <b>polycentric</b> legal system {{where there is no}} monopolistic agent that determines what the law should be or how it should be interpreted. It is assumed to have developed exclusively in the Horn of Africa since approximately the 7th century. Given the dearth of loan words from foreign languages within the xeer's nomenclature, the customary law appears to have evolved in situ.|$|E
25|$|Berlin's {{history has}} left the city with a <b>polycentric</b> {{organization}} and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin the Kingdom of Prussia, the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.|$|E
25|$|With rapid {{industrialisation}} in post-war years, {{the population}} of Milan peaked at 1,743,427 in 1973. Thereafter, during the following thirty years, almost {{one third of the}} population moved to the outer belt of new suburbs and satellite settlements that grew around the city proper. There were an estimated 1,368,590 official residents in the municipality of Milan at the end of 2016 and 3,218,201 in its province-level municipality. However, Milan's urban area extends well beyond the limits of its administrative commune and was home to 5,270,000 people in 2015, while its wider, <b>polycentric</b> metropolitan area is estimated to have a population exceeding 8 million.|$|E
25|$|Of {{economic}} {{importance is}} BrabantStad, {{a partnership between}} the municipalities of Breda, Eindhoven, Helmond, 's-Hertogenbosch and Tilburg and the province of North Brabant. BrabantStad is the fastest growing economic region in the Netherlands, with the Brabantse Stedenrij (<b>polycentric</b> city region) {{as one of the}} national top regions, behind the Randstad megalopolis (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht). The partnership in North Brabant aims to form an urban network and to make the province explicitly known as a leading knowledge region within Europe. With a total of 1.5million people and 20% of the industrial production in the Netherlands is BrabantStad one of the major economical important, metropolitan regions of the Netherlands. Of all the money that goes to research and development in the Netherlands, one third is spent in Eindhoven. A quarter of the jobs in the region are in technology and ICT.|$|E
25|$|Some barangays {{are divided}} into sitios and puroks. Sitios are most common in rural barangays where human {{settlement}} is <b>polycentric,</b> with multiple communities spread across a wide area, separated by farmland, mountains, or water (e.g. a barangay encompassing different islands). Puroks are often found in densely populated areas of barangays categorized as urban, but outside of a major metropolis, and in population-dense areas of barangays of rural municipalities. Puroks and sitio boundaries are rarely defined precisely, and may use natural landmarks such as roads, rivers or other natural features to unofficially delineate divisions. They are not a Local Government Unit and their officials are not elected in regular general elections. The selection process for sitio and purok leaders may vary from one barangay to another. There are cases where a barangay council member is officially designated as a purok leader, while sitio leaders may be appointed and drawn from the hamlet's own residents.|$|E

500|$|However, certain {{matters are}} {{regarded}} as impervious to judicial review owing to limitations in the courts' institutional capacity. Courts are generally reluctant {{to get involved in}} affairs relating to national security, leaving this role to the Government. At the same time, Singaporean courts are committed to careful scrutiny of matters to decide whether they are indeed non-justiciable, as affirmed in the Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co. Ltd. (2007). This case held that courts would exclude matters involving [...] "high policy" [...] from their purview, but still analyse cases carefully {{to determine whether or not}} they truly fell within areas of executive immunity. Also, limitations on the role of the court have led to the rational conclusion that certain other areas are to be excluded from judicial review. These include matters in which the court lacks expertise and those which are <b>polycentric,</b> as was held in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General.|$|E
500|$|MacCallum {{credits the}} Xeer with [...] "Somalia's success without a central government, since it {{provides}} an authentic rule of law to support trade and economic development." [...] In the Xeer, law and crime are {{defined in terms of}} property rights; consequently the criminal justice system is compensatory rather than the punitive system of the majority of states, and the Xeer is [...] "unequivocal in its opposition" [...] to any form of taxation. Powell et al. (2006) find that the existence of the common law dispute resolution system in Somalia makes possible basic economic order. MacCallum compares the Xeer to the common law in 6th century Scotland, and notes that there is no monopoly of either police nor judicial services, a condition of <b>polycentric</b> law. However, a weakness of such a system is that it proves ineffective at handling disputes and enforcing resolutions that cross clan boundaries. For example, in a dispute involving telecommunications company Aerolite, the plaintiff from the weaker clan was unable to collect the [...] "unfairly" [...] small settlement they had been awarded.|$|E
500|$|Greater Manchester is characterised by dense {{urban and}} {{industrial}} development, which includes centres of commerce, finance, retail and administration, {{as well as}} commuter suburbs and housing, interspersed with transport infrastructure such as light rail, roads and motorway, and canals. There {{is a mix of}} high density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but land use is mostly urban. The built environment of Greater Manchester utilises red brick and sandstone prominently as a building material, alongside structures composed of modern materials, high-rise towers, and landmark 19th-, 20th- and 21st-century buildings in the city and town centres. Manchester city centre is the commercial and geographic heart of Greater Manchester, and with the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford, is defined as Greater Manchester's [...] "Regional Centre" [...] for purposes of urban planning and public transport. Political and economic ties between the city centre and neighbouring Salford and Trafford have strengthened with the shift from town and district centres to metropolitan-level centres in England, and this area's high-rise landmark buildings provide a visual orientation point of reference as a central business district. However, Greater Manchester is also a <b>polycentric</b> county with ten metropolitan districts, each of which has a major town centre– and in some cases more than one– and many smaller settlements. The major towns encircle Manchester city centre, and between them are smaller towns (such as Denton, Middleton and Failsworth) which are suburban to both the Regional Centre and the major town centres. Combined, these factors make Greater Manchester the most complex [...] "polycentric functional urban region" [...] in the UK outside London.|$|E
2500|$|Stoke-on-Trent {{is often}} known as [...] "the city of five towns", {{because of the}} name given to it by local novelist Arnold Bennett {{and is the only}} <b>polycentric</b> city in the UK. In his novels, Bennett used mostly {{recognisable}} aliases for five of the six towns (although he called Stoke [...] "Knype"). However, Bennett said that he believed [...] "Five Towns" [...] was more euphonious than [...] "Six Towns", so he omitted Fenton (now sometimes referred to as [...] "the forgotten town").|$|E
2500|$|Pan-Turkism was an ethnocentric {{ideology}} [...] while Kemalism is <b>polycentric</b> [...] in character. Kemalism {{wants to}} have an equal footing among the mainstream world civilizations. Pan-Turkists have consistently emphasized the special attributes of the Turkic peoples, and wanted to unite all of the Turkic peoples. Kemalism wants an equal footing (based on respect) and does not aim to unite the people of Turkey {{with all the other}} Turkic nations. Most Kemalists were not interested in Pan-Turkism and from 1923 to 1950 (the single state period) reacted with particular firmness.|$|E
2500|$|Coon first {{modified}} Franz Weidenreich's <b>Polycentric</b> (or multiregional) {{theory of}} the origin of races. The Weidenreich Theory states that human races have evolved independently in the Old World from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens sapiens, {{while at the same time}} there was gene flow between the various populations. Coon held a similar belief that modern humans, Homo sapiens, arose separately in five different places from Homo erectus, [...] "as each subspecies, living in its own territory, passed a critical threshold from a more brutal to a more sapient state", but unlike Weidenreich stressed gene flow far less.|$|E
2500|$|Milan ( [...] or [...] (Milanese variant)) is {{the capital}} of Lombardy and the second most populous city in Italy after Rome, with the city proper having a {{population}} of 1,360,422 while its province-level municipality {{has a population of}} 3,228,000. Its continuously built-up urban area (that stretches beyond the boundaries of the Metropolitan City of Milan) has a population estimated to be about 5,270,000 over , ranking 4th in the European Union. The wider Milan metropolitan area, known as Greater Milan, is a <b>polycentric</b> metropolitan region that extends over central Lombardy and eastern Piedmont and which counts an estimated total population of 8,173,176, making it by far the largest metropolitan area in Italy.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike other Soviet time Metros, Nizhny Novgorod {{does not}} feature the {{traditional}} triangle layout of three line, six radii intersecting under city centre. [...] This {{is because of}} the unusual layout of the city. [...] Nizhny Novgorod is located on the right bank of the Volga River, and at the confluence of the Oka River. Over the 20th century, the city developed in a <b>polycentric</b> manner. The historical city centre, including the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin bears most of administrative, cultural and educational functions and is located on the high hilly right bank of the Oka, whilst the low flat left bank hosts city's most industries and some major residential districts grouped around the three centers in Kanavino (where the city's central railway station and the largest urban transport hubs are located), Sormovo (with the largest industry being the Krasnoye Sormovo plant) and Avtozavod (GAZ).|$|E
2500|$|Although the Court of Appeal {{rejected}} Vellama's appeal on {{the preliminary}} ground {{of a lack}} of standing, it went on to consider the substantive issues raised. Disagreeing with the High Court's judgment, the Court of Appeal interpreted Article 49(1) of the Constitution as providing that the Prime Minister does not have unfettered discretion in deciding whether or not to call a by-election when a casual vacancy in an SMC arises. Noting the absence in Article 49(1) of a specific time frame within which a parliamentary vacancy must be filled, the Court held that the Prime Minister must do so with [...] "all convenient speed" [...] in line with the common law concept of reasonable time. However, given the <b>polycentric</b> nature of the decision, the Court felt it was undesirable to lay down specific considerations or factors which would determine whether the Prime Minister had or had not called a by-election in reasonable time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second section}} gives {{the names of}} the populi Albenses. These were local {{communities}} inhabiting the region of Mons Albanus (now Monte Cavo) and its immediate surroundings, the Alban Hills. Only some of them seem to have reached the urban stage and the list reflects the typical archaic Bronze Age organization of [...] human settlement: sparse, <b>polycentric</b> and gravitating around a religious centre, in this case the sanctuary of Iuppiter Latiaris. The exact location of these settlements is unknown with a few exceptions: Aesulae, Pedum, Fidenae, Politorium, Bovillae, and Tolerium. It is possible that the Latinienses were settlers of the Ager Latiniensis, i. e. the area near Laurentum and Lavinium, and that the Foreti were actually settlers of the area later occupied by the Roman Forum. The Querquetulani, however, were certainly not the settlers of the Querquetulan (i.e. Caelian [...] ) Hill in Rome as they are mentioned by Dionysius in the list of Latin peoples who went to war against Rome in 495.|$|E
2500|$|Hemoglobin C (HbC) is an {{abnormal}} hemoglobin with substitution of a lysine residue for glutamic acid residue of the β-globin chain, {{at exactly the}} same ß-6 position as the HbS mutation. The [...] "C" [...] designation for HbC is from the name of the city where it was discovered—Christchurch, New Zealand. People who have this disease, particularly children, may have episodes of abdominal and joint pain, an enlarged spleen, and mild jaundice, but they do not have severe crises, as occur in sickle cell disease. Haemoglobin C is common in malarious areas of West Africa, especially in Burkina Faso. In a large case–control study performed in Burkina Faso on 4,348 Mossi subjects, that HbC was associated with a 29% reduction in risk of clinical malaria in HbAC heterozygotes and of 93% in HbCC homozygotes. HbC represents a ‘slow but gratis’ genetic adaptation to malaria through a transient polymorphism, compared to the <b>polycentric</b> ‘quick but costly’ adaptation through balanced polymorphism of HbS.|$|E
2500|$|However, when {{a hearing}} {{requires}} the balancing of multiple <b>polycentric</b> {{issues such as}} natural justice {{and the protection of}} confidential information for national security reasons, both the concerns of public security and the right to a fair trial must be adequately met. It was held by the House of Lords in AF, applying the decision of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights A. v. United Kingdom (2009), that a person accused of terrorism against whom a control order has been issued must be given sufficient information about the allegations against him to enable him to give effective instructions to his special advocate. If this requirement is satisfied, a fair hearing can be conducted without detailed disclosure of confidential information that might compromise national security. On the facts of the case, a special advocate was not permitted further contact with an applicant or his ordinary legal representatives except with permission of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) after viewing confidential (or [...] "closed") materials. The House of Lords recognized that although a special advocate's usefulness is stymied somewhat from having no further instructions after viewing such materials, if the SIAC decides to issue a control order predominantly on the basis of non-confidential (or [...] "open") materials, an applicant cannot be regarded as having been denied an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the government's beliefs and suspicions about him. If the evidence against the applicant is largely closed but allegations contained in open material are sufficiently specific, an applicant should be able to provide his legal representatives and special advocate with information to refute it (such as an alibi, if the open material alleges he was at a certain place during a certain period) without having to know the detail or sources of the closed evidence. However, if the evidence revealed to the person consists only of general assertions and the case against him is based solely or to a substantive extent on undisclosed adverse evidence, the fair hearing rule under natural justice will not be satisfied.|$|E
