5000|$|Each {{player has}} a board called a [...] "capital", which {{is divided into}} 3 zones: Battlefield, Quest, and Kingdom. The Battlefield is the area where attacks are launched, Quest determines how many cards are drawn each turn, and Kingdom determines how many {{resources}} are gathered each turn. Resources are spent to play cards. Each unit has a power rating that adds to the zone they are <b>played</b> <b>into.</b> For example, a unit with a power of 2 would add 2 damage to attacks when <b>played</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Battlefield, 2 additional resources per turn if <b>played</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom, or 2 additional cards drawn if <b>played</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Quest zone.|$|R

McNamara and Warrick led the Orange to a 23-8 record and a five seed in the NCAA Tournament.

5|$|Booth {{was less}} {{successful}} in his penultimate season in 196768, with only 426 runs at 23.66, including two half-centuries, both against Victoria. A decision by administrators to introduce Sunday <b>play</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Sheffield Shield ended his career, as {{he refused to}} make himself available for games that involved Sunday play. He played in only one match in his final season in 196869, scoring a duck and 15 as New South Wales lost to South Australia by three wickets. Booth continued to play grade cricket for the St. George club until 197677, leading the batting averages and aggregates in 197475. With 10,674 runs at 45.42, he was fifth on the all-time run-scoring aggregates in Sydney grade competition {{at the time of}} his retirement, but has now dropped to ninth.|$|E
5|$|Events in {{the world}} {{appeared}} to <b>play</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War and the Austro-Turkish War); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War). At first, King Poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain Russian support for the reforms; they attempted to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans {{as an opportunity to}} strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line of reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. With the new Polish-Prussian alliance seeming to provide security against Russian intervention, King Poniatowski drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. This alliance was also helped as the 1790 elections were more supportive of the royal faction then Potocki's; and the conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten the reformers if they were to stay divided. With the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, Potocki and Poniatowski begun to reach a consensus on a more constitutional monarchy approach, and started to draft a constitutional document.|$|E

5|$|In English {{folklore}} and literature, green {{has traditionally been}} used to symbolize nature and its embodied attributes, namely those of fertility and rebirth. Critics have claimed that the Green Knight's role emphasizes the environment outside of human habitation. With his alternate identity as Bertilak, the Green Knight {{can also be seen}} as a compromise between both humanity and the environment as opposed to Gawain's representation of human civilization. Oftentimes it is used to embody the supernatural or spiritual other world. In British folklore, the devil was sometimes considered to be green {{which may or may not}} <b>play</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> concept of the Green Man/ Wild Man dichotomy of the Green Knight. Stories of the medieval period also portray the colour as representing love and the amorous in life, and the base, natural desires of man. Green is also known to have signified witchcraft, devilry and evil for its association with the fairies and spirits of early English {{folklore and}} for its association with decay and toxicity. The colour, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In the Celtic tradition, green was avoided in clothing for its superstitious association with misfortune and death. Green can be considered in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; displaying both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour. Given these varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} the final {{production}} and release of the Thanhouser Company and {{it was to be}} released through Pathé. Numerous factors would <b>play</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> winding down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser. Q. David Bowers writes that it was easy to understand Thanhouser's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through Pathé were based on their decision to release or discard the work, the New Rochelle studio was 2,500 miles {{from the center of the}} trade activity and the slump in industry tied to World War I. Weeks before the film was released, Variety told of the winding down of the Thanhouser with the studio's staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the bookkeeper, Jessie B. Bishop. The article concluded with the announcement that Lloyd F. Lonergan, the scenario writer of the company, had retired from the company. As it wound down, the Thanhouser Company was announced to have no liabilities would close with a positive bank balance. Little is known of the production of this final film, but it was directed by Emile Chautard from a scenario written by Lloyd F. Lonergan. The cameraman was Jacques Bizeul.|$|E

A slap-shot by Flyers defenceman Kimmo Timonen was deflected by Flyer forward Jakub Voráček into Staal's right eye, sending him to the ice. After the game, it was concluded that Staal suffered a small retinal tear in his right eye and an orbital fracture. The injury effectively ended his season, as he only played in one game the rest of the year, in the first round of the playoffs, before pulling himself from the line-up again. When he returned, he wore a visor {{for the first time in}} his career due to the nature of the injury.|$|E

The Browns seemed to be {{taking control of the}} game now, particularly when another Steelers drive into field goal range was again snuffed out by a McCutheon interception (the Steelers' third turnover in less than six minutes). But suddenly Randle El brought the team right back into the game by returning a punt 66 yards for a touchdown, making the score 14-7. Cleveland stormed right back, as Holcomb's 29-yard pass to Johnson and two completions to running back Jamel White for 22 total yards earned the team a Phil Dawson field goal that made the score 17-7 going into halftime.|$|E
