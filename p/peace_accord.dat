40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} the content of <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> and post-accord stability. This relationship has rarely been studied before. In this regard, this research addressed the gap in the literature by examining to what extent the inclusion of socio-economic, political, security-related and social-fabric related issues in <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> impacts these socio-economic, political, security-related and social-fabric related issues in the post-accord period. The two cases of post-conflict countries, Guatemala and El Salvador, were comparatively analyzed. The Guatemalan and Salvadoran <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> were content-coded. Subsequently, the level of post-accord stability in these countries was measured by using various indicators for socio-economic, political, security-related and social-fabric related issues. Findings revealed {{that there is not a}} strong relation between the inclusion of socio-economic, political, security-related and social-fabric related issues in <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> and the level of these issues in the post-accord period. In other words, the comprehensiveness of <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> does not necessarily lead to stability in the post-accord period. There are other factors like specificity and applicability of provisions, implementation-related issues, sense of ownership of the <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> by the society that influence the relationship between <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> and post-accord period. Findings have also implications for designing more efficient peace agreements...|$|R

5|$|The Jurchens marched southward {{with the}} aim of conquering the Southern Song, but counteroffensives by Chinese generals like Yue Fei halted their advance. A <b>peace</b> <b>accord,</b> the Treaty of Shaoxing, was {{negotiated}} and ratified in 1142, establishing the Huai River as the boundary between the two empires. Peace between the Song and Jin was interrupted twice. Wanyan Liang invaded the Southern Song in 1161, while Song revanchists tried and failed to retake northern China in 1204.|$|E
5|$|According to Nolutshungu, the 1984 {{bilateral}} Franco-Libyan agreement {{may have}} provided Gaddafi with {{an excellent opportunity}} to find an exit from the Chadian quagmire, while bolstering his international prestige and giving him an opportunity to force Habré into accepting a <b>peace</b> <b>accord</b> which would have included Libya's proxies. Instead, Gaddafi misread France's withdrawal as a willingness to accept Libya's military presence in Chad and the de facto annexation of the whole BET Prefecture by Libya, an action that was certain to meet the opposition of all Chadian factions and of the OAU and UN. Gaddafi's blunder would eventually bring about his defeat, with the rebellion against him of the GUNT and a new French expedition in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996 {{the last}} 17 <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> were signed after nine years. The process was {{considered}} a model due to civil society having a formal consultative role, which was never seen before in peace talks. [...] Indigenous issues and rights became a central issue of the peace talks and {{the signing of the}} <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> symbolized the height of the movement. International organizations that supported the movement also played a role in engaging in the <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> and pushing for change in Guatemala. The <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> included an accord on indigenous rights, the Accord on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which was signed in 1995. This accord called Guatemala a multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual nation and called for reforms to help the indigenous populations. Parts of The Indigenous Rights Accords required constitutional reforms to be implemented, which were later faced with high opposition.|$|R

5|$|Eleanor of Castile {{had died}} on 28November 1290. Uncommon for such marriages of the period, the couple loved each other. Moreover, like his father, Edward was very {{devoted to his}} wife and was {{faithful}} to her throughout their married lives — a rarity among monarchs of the time. He was deeply affected by her death. He displayed his grief by erecting twelve so-called Eleanor crosses, one at each place where her funeral cortège stopped for the night. As part of the <b>peace</b> <b>accord</b> between England and France in 1294, it was agreed that Edward should marry Philip IV's half-sister Margaret, but the marriage was delayed by the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|His reign {{was marked}} by {{multiple}} wars with the Lombards, a Germanic people who {{had arrived in the}} former Roman province of Pannonia under the leadership of their king, Audoin. Thurisind also had to face the hostility of the Byzantine Empire, which was resentful of the Gepid takeover of Sirmium and anxious to diminish Gepid power in the Pannonian Basin, a plain covering most of modern Hungary and partly including the bordering states. The Byzantines' plans to reduce the Gepids' power took effect when Audoin decisively defeated Thurisind in 551 or 552. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian forced a <b>peace</b> <b>accord</b> on both leaders so that equilibrium in the Pannonian Basin could be sustained.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, by {{the time}} the Paris <b>Peace</b> <b>Accord</b> was concluded, South Vietnam possessed the fourth largest air force in the world. Despite their size, however, Republic of Vietnam Air Force {{operations}} were severely curtailed due to cutbacks in U.S. military aid. Furthermore, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force were prevented from undertaking reconnaissance and ground support missions due to the threat posed by formidable anti-aircraft weapons deployed by North Vietnam. When the North Vietnamese military renewed their offensive early in 1975, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was virtually handicapped and many of their aircraft were either lost or captured as formations of the Vietnam People's Army swept through the Central Highlands of South Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|With {{the help}} and {{mediation}} of international involvement, a peace negotiation, succeeding previous futile attempts {{to put an}} end to a civil war finally led to the signing of the Chapultepec <b>peace</b> <b>accords.</b> The first presidential elections in 1994 were won by right-winged party ARENA, who furthermore would hold power through elections for 15 years to come. In the 2009 elections, left winged party FMLN won the presidential elections for the first time, forming a minority government. This shift of power marked another victory for democracy in El Salvador. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the <b>peace</b> <b>accords</b> in their design and circumstances have had an impact in the political development of the transition to democracy of El Salvador.

5|$|On 15 February, Aguirre's term {{of office}} expired. Against {{the wishes of the}} Amapolas, the {{moderate}} Tomás Villalba was elected by the Senate to replace Aguirre. French, Italian and Spanish troops landed in Montevideo at Villalba's request to dissuade the radical Blancos from attempting a coup to retake power. Villalba entered into talks with Flores and Paranhos. With the Italian resident minister Raffaele Ulisse Barbolani serving as intermediary, an agreement was reached. Flores and Manuel Herrera y Obes (representing Villalba's government) signed a <b>peace</b> <b>accord</b> on 20 February at the Villa de la Unión. A general amnesty was granted to both Blancos and Colorados, and Villalba handed over the presidency to Flores on an interim basis until elections could be held.|$|E
5|$|The Modi {{administration}} {{negotiated a}} peace agreement with the largest faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCM), which was announced in August 2015. The Naga insurgency in northwest India had begun in the 1950s. The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a <b>peace</b> <b>accord</b> had not previously been signed. In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded {{with a series of}} attacks, which killed 18 people. The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organisation.|$|E

He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but he was back in England by {{the time of his death}} the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, probably on the 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral, and he was buried at Lincoln on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.|$|E

This conventional attack, backed by armor, heavy artillery, and anti-aircraft units (including SAMs) rolled over the two northernmost provinces of South Vietnam while two smaller offensives were launched in central and southern parts of the country. All U.S. and South Vietnamese air assets were diverted to first slowing, and then halting the onslaught. They were then utilized in the first sustained bombing of North Vietnam since late 1968 (see Operation Linebacker). Interdiction missions were then diverted to carry out an even heavier aerial offensive against the north (see Operation Linebacker II). The end was nigh for Commando Hunt.

5|$|During the war, the Duke of Braganza mounted cannons, dug trenches, tended the wounded, ate {{among the}} rank and file and fought under heavy fire as men next to him were shot or blown to pieces. His cause was nearly lost until he took the risky step of {{dividing}} his forces and sending a portion to launch an amphibious attack on southern Portugal. The Algarve region fell to the expedition, which then marched north straight for Lisbon, which capitulated on 24 July. Pedro proceeded to subdue the remainder of the country, but just when the conflict looked to be winding down to a conclusion, his Spanish uncle Don Carlos, who was attempting to seize the crown of his niece Doña IsabelII, intervened. In this wider conflict that engulfed the entire Iberian Peninsula, the First Carlist War, the Duke of Braganza allied with liberal Spanish armies loyal to IsabelII and defeated both MiguelI and Carlos. A <b>peace</b> <b>accord</b> was reached on 26 May 1834.|$|E
5|$|EdwardIII was {{not content}} with the peace {{agreement}} made in his name, but the renewal of the war with Scotland originated in private, rather than royal initiative. A group of English magnates known as The Disinherited, who had lost land in Scotland by the <b>peace</b> <b>accord,</b> staged an invasion of Scotland and won a great victory at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332. They attempted to install Edward Balliol as king of Scotland in DavidII's place, but Balliol was soon expelled {{and was forced to}} seek the help of EdwardIII. The English king responded by laying siege to the important border town of Berwick and defeated a large relieving army at the Battle of Halidon Hill. Edward reinstated Balliol on the throne and received a substantial amount of land in southern Scotland. These victories proved hard to sustain, as forces loyal to DavidII gradually regained control of the country. In 1338, Edward was forced to agree to a truce with the Scots.|$|E
