25|$|A fourth {{phase of}} post-approval {{surveillance}} is also often required {{due to the}} fact that even the largest clinical trials cannot effectively predict the prevalence of rare side-effects. <b>Postmarketing</b> <b>surveillance</b> ensures that after marketing the safety of a drug is monitored closely.

25|$|Some {{drugs are}} {{approved}} by the FDA under subsection H, which has two subparts.

The second part of subsection H applies to drugs that not only must meet restrictions for use due to safety requirements, but also are required to meet <b>postmarketing</b> <b>surveillance</b> to establish that the safety results shown in clinical trials are seconded by use in a much wider population. Mifepristone was approved under the second part of subsection H. The result is that women cannot pick the drug up at a pharmacy, but must now receive it directly from a doctor. Due to the possibility of adverse reactions such as excessive bleeding, which may require a blood transfusion, and incomplete abortion, which may require surgical intervention, the drug is only considered safe if a physician who is capable of administering a blood transfusion or a surgical abortion is available to the patient in the event of such emergencies. The approval of mifepristone under subsection H included a black box warning.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Objective: To {{evaluate}} the FDA’s approval process and <b>postmarket</b> <b>surveillance</b> strategies for THR devices. Design: The FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) 510 k releasable database {{was used to}} document approved THR devices. The CDRH Medical Device Reporting data files were used to study {{the efficiency of the}} FDA’s post-market surveillance system. Manufacturers were contacted to supply information regarding their implants. Medline was searched between 1966 - 1996 to determine the percentage of THR devices with published data on clinical outcomes. Results: Between 1976 and 1996, 701 new THR devices were approved by the Substantial Equivalent (SE) route and 34 were approved on the basis of Premarket Approval PMA. The number of approvals doubled between 1991 - 1995 compared to 1976 - 1990. Seventy-four different manufacturers obtained approval to market THR devices. Only four manufacturers obtained approval via the PMA application. Under Mandatory Device Reporting all revision arthroplasties should be reported. Using data from 2 independent services for which we had US hospital discharge data in 1993 we estimate that only 3 % of all revision THR were reported to the FDA. Manufacturers of hip implants failed to provide useful information. Medline search revealed only 15 % of the approved THR devices had published data on outcomes.
