She works often with quotidian materials such as <b>paper,</b> <b>yarn,</b> tape, and chalk interspersed with culturally charged materials such as cocoa butter, coffee, corn husks, and her body. Themes present in her work include memory, ritual, culture, and adornment. She is interested in chronicling, researching, and the systematic arrangement of objects. Her work gives form to patterns both natural and constructed, while creating tension and movement within space. These themes stem from an attraction to site-specificity and investigation of material and spatial properties. Much of her work deals with gestures of navigation and structures of memory.|$|E
30|$|In the {{production}} of the <b>paper</b> <b>yarn,</b> a Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is produced in almost the same process system as Japanese <b>paper</b> <b>yarn,</b> so the properties of the two paper yarns are quiet similar (Kim et al. 2006; Kim and Park 2008; Itoi 2001; Ishikawa and Shinohara 2001). In Korea, the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is made of Hanji paper sheets, so it has a high bulkiness. The thickness of <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is greater than that of the same count of cotton yarn. As a result, the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is evaluated as a lightweight yarn because Hanji paper yarn’s diameter is larger meaning that the apparent specific gravity is lower (Kim et al. 2007; Park 2012). Therefore, it is possible to produce a lightweight denim fabric that actually feels lighter when worn by using the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> as the weft. This is because the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is a <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> and is lightweight by its characteristic of yarn structure and is fast in absorption rate and drying speed rates. Therefore, Hanji denim fabric is a lightweight fabric material with a low specific gravity compared to existing denim fabric resulting in having excellent form stability and comfort.|$|E
30|$|The study {{evaluated}} the optimal weft inserting speed with two cases using Hanji combination yarn alone and Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> and {{core spun yarn}} in a 1 : 1 ratio. As a result, the optimal weft inserting speed (approximately 620  rpm) for the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> was approximately 90 % of the cotton yarn with the same yarn count. This is because we believe the tensile strength of Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> and Hanji combination yarn is {{lower than that of}} ordinary cotton yarn.|$|E
30|$|Using {{environmentally}} friendly fibers such as cotton, linen {{and in general}} cellulosic fibers is an important subject which has attracted much attention these days because of their benefits such as lightweight and low static electricity [1]. Many parameters can affect {{the life span of}} these fabrics including their intrinsic characteristics such as materials, diameter, strength, and extrinsic characteristics like spinning method and speed of spinning [2]. <b>Paper</b> <b>yarns</b> are one of these fibers that have recently been widely utilized. However, <b>paper</b> <b>yarns</b> have some disadvantages such as being wrinkled easily, low stretching properties, and low softness [1]. Also most <b>paper</b> <b>yarns</b> do not have enough strength [3], so, as they are made from cellulose, it is attractive to finish them in order to improve their physical properties.|$|R
30|$|The {{first step}} was {{preparing}} the <b>yarns,</b> so the <b>paper</b> <b>yarns</b> were washed with distilled water at 80  °C in order to remove any impurities. Then 6  % w/w succinic acid and 4  % w/w sodium hypophosphate were bath mixed in magnetic field for 20  min (preparing cross-link agent). Then the washed <b>paper</b> <b>yarns</b> were immersed in cross-link dispersion {{for an hour and}} after that, they were dried in oven for 3  min at 85  °C and 2  min at 160  °C. During this process, MWCNTs (with different percent) were sonicated for 30  min at 50  °C for the preparation of the precursor dispersion of nanomaterials. Then the paper fabrics were immersed in the bath of MWCNTs for an hour at 75  °C. Finally, for fixation of nanomaterials, the <b>paper</b> <b>yarns</b> were kept in an oven at 100  °C for an hour.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{physical}} properties of paper fabric (weaved <b>paper</b> <b>yarns)</b> coated with different percents of MWCNTs were investigated {{and its effects}} on paper fabric have been discussed.|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{physical}} properties of yarns, the breaking stress of Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> was {{lower than those of}} the cotton yarn and the core spun yarn, but the <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> maintained a relatively high breaking strain. The Hanji combination yarn has been improved the weaving ability by complementing the tensile strength of Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn.</b> In the surface structure of the yarn, the rope-dyed cotton yarn showed a rather bulky structure while the cheese-dyed cotton yarn showed a compact structure. The structure of Hanji combination yarns showed that the Hanji single yarn and core spun yarn were tightly combined resulting in a stable form. The optimal weft inserting speed for the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> was approximately 90 % of the cotton yarn with the same yarn count. Also, the appearance of most Hanji denim fabrics produced showed no significant difference from the existing stretchable denim fabrics indicating commercialization of Hanji denim fabrics as highly possible.|$|E

This study investigates and gives information about textile fabrics of <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> made from Manila hemp. Knitted structures made of paper yarn; cotton and viscose are tested and compared. Also, a tensile strength test of the yarns is performed. The <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> has low shrinkage and no tendencies to pilling, great characteristics for fabrics {{to be used in the}} textile- and clothing industry. The handleability / knittability: a problem that has to be solved if the <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> is going to be used in the textile industry to a high extent in the future.

30|$|In general, {{yarn count}} of the weft for {{commonly}} used cotton denim fabrics in summer and winter are respectively about 15 and 10  Ne. Taking this into consideration when calculating the count of final Hanji combination yarn, a single <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> {{count of the}} summer and winter usage is appropriate with the count of 30 and 15  Ne respectively based on the core spun yarns 30  Ne. Thus, when weaving with the <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> and the core spun yarn in the weaving process, according to the season, it is also advised to select each weft yarn within a similar yarn count range compared to the preferred cotton yarn count.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, in this study, {{we aim to}} {{manufacture}} the Hanji denim fabric by using either of these two yarn types for the weft: of the Hanji combination yarn (combined Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> with core spun yarn) or by inserting the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> and the core spun yarn in a 1 : 1 ratio. In the warp, we plan to use two kinds of existing yarns dyed with a chemical indigo dyestuff and a natural indigo dyestuff (blue color). After manufacturing Hanji denim fabrics, we plan to test {{the properties of the}} developed Hanji denim fabrics and the existing denim fabrics to compare them. This study also plans to suggest commercialization of denim fabric products utilizing the Hanji denim fabrics that have the improved properties such as light fabric weight, stretch, and comfort.|$|E

30|$|Using carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) in {{textile industry}} has {{attracted much attention}} due to its special properties. Also paper fibers and fabrics {{are the most important}} raw materials of textile. In this manuscript, <b>paper</b> <b>yarns</b> were weaved and treated with multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs) in order to improve the physical properties of paper fabrics. In this regard, different percents of MWCNTs were coated on fabrics and some physical properties were investigated. Based on the results, paper fabrics treated with MWCNTs show excellent UV protection. The treated samples have more crease recovery. Also bending test and abrasion resistance analyses show improvements in treated fabrics. The adsorption test of samples shows an increase in water adsorption due to MWCNTs role of adsorbent. The results show a little decrease in strength that seems natural because of acidic pH of the used cross-link agent. In general, in addition to economic benefits of using paper fabrics, treating them with MWCNTs can also improve their physical properties.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{core spun yarn}} used to impart {{elasticity}} to fabrics and their usage has recently been increasing. Most significantly, {{in the production of}} denim fabrics when the core spun yarn and the <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> are used properly as weft, it is found that the disadvantages of the paper denim fabric’s heaviness, roughness, and wrinkles caused by low stretchability, can be greatly improved.|$|E
30|$|With {{the popular}} use of denim fabric {{and of the}} {{advantages}} of paper yarns, we aimed to develop the Hanji denim fabric with Hanji combination yarn or with the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> and core spun yarn in a 1 : 1 ratio as the weft. As the warp yarn, chemical vat and natural dyestuffs were used. We tested the properties of the developed Hanji paper yarns, combination yarns, and Hanji denim fabrics. The summary and conclusions are as follows.|$|E
30|$|The paper yarns {{used in the}} weft {{were made}} into two types, single yarn and {{combination}} yarn. First, in the manufacturing process of a single yarn, a paper sheet was cut to a pre-determined width to make a tape yarn, and after that the single yarn was produced by adding a proper twist to the tape yarn through a twisting machine. In other words, the Hanji paper sheet, {{with the weight of}} 13  g/m 2, was cut into the tape yarn in the width of 2.75 and 3.75  mm. Then, the Hanji paper yarns, count of 16 and 11  Ne, were produced after twisting 600 and 520  tpm (Z-twist), respectively, using a twisting machine (Murata® 363). The combination yarn was manufactured by combining <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> and core spun yarn. In this study, Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> of 16 or 30  Ne was plied in S-twist with the core spun yarn [cotton (sheath)/spandex (core)]. After that, the structures of Hanji combination yarns were stabilized through the steam setting for 14  min at 105  °C. With this process, the count of Hanji combination yarn produced was 10 and 15  Ne, respectively.|$|E

30|$|This study aims {{to develop}} the Hanji denim fabric with Hanji {{combination}} yarn or with the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> and core spun yarn in a 1 : 1 ratio as a weft.

In addition, the study tested {{the properties of the}} developed Hanji paper yarns, Hanji denim fabrics, and existing denim fabrics. In regard to the physical properties of yarns, the Hanji <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> showed a lower breaking stress but a relatively high breaking strain, and it remained a stable structure with no surface fluff. The Hanji combination yarn improved the weaving ability and had a stable structure form. In the resulting physical properties of the developed Hanji denim fabrics, they had a low apparent specific gravity, stability in dimensional change in washing and drying, a higher chance of commercialization in colorfastness to washing, medium stretchability, a similar drying velocity, and a fast absorption velocity compared to the existing denim fabrics. The study suggests that the Hanji denim fabrics are the good candidate materials for summer product development, since generally the Hanji denim fabrics have cool characteristics with the excellent absorption velocity, drying velocity, and low specific gravity.|$|E

30|$|Since the denim {{fabric is}} stiff {{and the color}} of indigo blue fades over time, without an {{application}} of finishing methods by either conventional industrial washing or new laser fading, {{it is not easy to}} achieve high quality denim wear (Juciene et al. 2006; Kan and Wong 2011; Khedher et al. 2011). In the world today, the premium denim fabric’s dye has been known as a dye that gradually and slightly fades with repeated washings and with a dehydration process. Also, there is need for comfort with softer touch, a lighter weight, and stretch to this premium fabric. With this trend, recently, there has been a development of functional denim fabrics. For example, in Japan in 2015, a paper denim fabric has been developed and used as the premium denim fabric (Park and Lee 2016). This denim fabric has received attention as it introduces the need for lightweight with improved comfort by using a cotton yarn (indigo rope-dyeing) as the warp, and the Japanese <b>paper</b> <b>yarn</b> as the weft. The Japanese paper denim fabric is proper for denim jean pants and/or shirts worn in warm summer months. However, problems exist with wrinkles due to the fabric’s high rigidity and low stretchability of the <b>paper</b> <b>yarn.</b> In addition, there are consumers who want to wear denim jean pants or denim shirts, but they have a tendency to avoid these denim products due to skin allergies that are caused by a reaction to a chemical dye in the denim fabric.|$|E
