5|$|For his campaign, Romney {{assembled}} a veteran group of Republican staffers, consultants, and pollsters. He was little-known nationally, though, and stayed around the 10percent support range in Republican preference <b>polls</b> <b>for</b> {{the first half}} of 2007. He proved the most effective fundraiser of any of the Republican candidates and also partly financed his campaign with his own personal fortune. These resources, combined with the mid-year near-collapse of nominal front-runner John McCain's campaign, made Romney a threat to win the nomination and the focus of the other candidates' attacks. Romney's staff suffered from internal strife; the candidate himself was at times indecisive, often asking for more data before making a decision.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of the election was magnified due to Finland's capacity to influence the European Union's decision in regard to affecting a bailout for Portugal via the European Financial Stability Facility, as part of financial support systems for debt-laden European countries, and {{the fall of the}} Portuguese government.
