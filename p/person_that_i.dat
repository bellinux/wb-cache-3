500|$|Obama is a Protestant Christian whose {{religious}} views developed in his adult life. He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he [...] "was not {{raised in a}} religious household". He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet [...] "in many ways the most spiritually awakened <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have ever known." [...] He described his father as a [...] "confirmed atheist" [...] {{by the time his}} parents met, and his stepfather as [...] "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." [...] Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand [...] "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Get Back" [...] {{was written}} by Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas, and {{produced}} by the Jonas Brothers alongside John Fields. Lovato {{wanted to write a}} song about getting back together with someone, as she believed enough mean and heartbroken songs had already been made. She said, [...] "It's kind of a fun, upbeat song and it's kind of just fun to sing to the <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wrote it about." [...] The Jonas Brothers provided backing vocals and guitars on the track. In addition to co-producing the song, Fields also provided bass, guitars and keyboards. Jack Lawless played the drums, and John Taylor contributed backing vocals and played the guitar. The song was released as the lead single for Don't Forget on August 12, 2008, in the United States and Canada via digital download. The edited Radio Disney version was released on the same day.|$|E
500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E

500|$|After Barack Obama {{was elected}} as U.S. Senator of Illinois, Lu joined Obama's office in early 2005 as {{legislative}} director. Lu developed a strong admiration for Obama, {{of whom he}} said, [...] "With his quick and incisive mind, Obama is the most intelligent <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have ever met (in the political arena)." [...] As legislative director, Lu led a 15-person group and was responsible for overseeing the drafting of all legislation and advising Obama on votes and policy decisions. When weighing difficult votes, Obama had Lu and his other staff members assemble together and argue about the issue in front of him. David Mendell, a Chicago Tribune reporter and Obama biographer, said Lu was among the [...] "moderate voices in this atmosphere of smart young staffers." [...] Lu advised Obama to {{vote in favor of}} the Military Commissions Act of 2006 because he felt it would have been politically wiser to support it, but Obama ultimately voted against it.|$|E
500|$|... "You and I", {{written by}} Lady Gaga and {{produced}} by Gaga and Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, {{was one of}} the first songs previewed from the album. Gaga said she wrote the song in New York, while she was busy playing her old piano. The singer first played [...] "You and I" [...] at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball in June 2010. She said that the song was a bit of a [...] "rock-and-roll tune" [...] and, as such, was unlikely to be released as a single from Born This Way. She said [...] that it [...] " [...] is very dear" [...] to her heart. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet soon after, and positive response encouraged Lady Gaga to perform the song during the first concert of the North American leg of The Monster Ball Tour in Montreal. Gaga told MSNBC's Meredith Vieira and Ann Curry that [...] "'You and I' was written about the most important <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever met", allegedly Lüc Carl, her ex-boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, Activision {{community}} manager Dan Amrich attempted {{to explain the}} acquisition history of the No One Lives Forever IP in a public video. This history includes the 2003 acquisition of NOLF publisher Fox Interactive by Vivendi Universal Games (who also owned Sierra Entertainment), {{as well as the}} 2008 merger between Vivendi Universal Games (VUG, which had since been renamed Vivendi Games) and video game publisher Activision, forming the Activision Blizzard holding company. After the merger, Activision decided to sell off some IPs and retain others. In order to find out the legal details behind NOLF, Amrich asked his colleagues, saying that [...] "he <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> normally talk to about this stuff does not believe that we [...] currently have the rights. They've never seen it, they've never been given the permission to put that stuff on [...] He said, basically, 'If we had it, I would {{love to be able to}} reissue those old games.'" [...] Amrich also asked a friend of his who working at NOLF developer Monolith (since acquired by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment), who also did not know who the IP belonged to. Amrich concluded that [...] "at this time I do not believe that Activision has the rights to No One Lives Forever." ...|$|E

I should talk about buttons, should I? which you were good enough to tell me was the proper subject of conversation. Mayn't I even speak of connexions of the family? Mr. Belsize, through this marriage, has the honour of being connected with you; and even I, in a remote degree, may boast of a sort of an ever--so--distant cousinship with him. What an honour for me!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{spoke in}} a beautiful, rich voice, with the most heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself that she {{appeared}} {{to be one of the}} most robust <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so insignificant a person were of some interest to her. My father, in his blunt, sailor fashion, tried to stammer out some commonplace condolence, but her eyes swept past his rude, weather-beaten face to ask and reask what effect she had made upon me.|$|R
2500|$|For a human antecedent, [...] "who", [...] "whom", or [...] "that" [...] {{is usually}} used ("He {{is the person}} who saw me", [...] "He {{is the person who}}m I saw", [...] "He is the <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw").

2500|$|In October 1595 De Vere {{wrote to}} his brother in law, Sir Robert Cecil, of {{friction}} {{between himself and the}} ill-fated Earl of Essex, partly over his claim to the property, terming him 'the only <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> dare rely upon in the court'. [...] Cecil seems to have done little to further De Vere's interests in the suit.|$|E
2500|$|Rochester's enemy Lord Halifax {{called for}} an inquiry into Rochester's {{stewardship}} of the finances and {{it was found that}} £40,000 had been lost by mismanagement. As a consequence Rochester was, in August 1684, removed from office and given the post Lord President of the Council, a more dignified but less lucrative and important office. Halifax said: [...] "I have seen people kicked down stairs but my Lord Rochester is the first <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever saw kicked up stairs".|$|E

It makes me weep to remember all the soft things you have said, all the kind things you have done for me, and to think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not conveyed to you {{at the time a}} tithe of my sense of all your gentle kindness. You are so gentle, Ferdinand! <b>I</b> think <b>that</b> is the greatest charm of your character. My gentle, gentle love! so unlike all other <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have met with!

2500|$|Li Jing {{was born}} in 571, during Sui Dynasty's {{predecessor}} state Northern Zhou. [...] His clan was from the Chang'an region. [...] His grandfather Li Chongyi (李崇義) served as a provincial governor during Northern Wei, and his father Li Quan (李詮) served as a commandery governor during Sui. [...] In his youth, Li Jing {{was said to be}} handsome and ambitious, and was talented both in literary and military matters. [...] His maternal uncle was the great Sui general Han Qinhu (韓擒虎), and it was said that Han was impressed by his talent, stating, [...] "You are the only <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can talk to about Sun Tzu's and Wu Qi's strategies." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Sakura-Con 2013, Kawahara {{noted that}} [...] "the {{character}} of Asuna I might {{have created a}} little too perfectly for Sword Art Online. When teamed up with Kirito, there were hardly any problems the two as a pair could not overcome", in response to whether Asuna was a [...] "tricky character" [...] to develop. In an interview with Haruka Tomatsu, Asuna's voice actor, she said that [...] "rather than having something similar to her, I feel that to me, she is the ideal <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would want to become. After all, she can cook, she's smart... I think that she's the type of woman I wanted to become and admired. Leaving aside if I can cook well, though, I really like to cook. I don't really know if I can say if we are alike because of that, though." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first five}} Governors of New South Wales {{realised}} {{the urgent need}} to encourage free settlers, but the British government remained largely indifferent. As early as 1790, Governor Arthur Phillip wrote: [...] "Your lordship will see by my...letters the little progress {{we have been able}} to make in cultivating the lands ... At present this settlement only affords one <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can employ in cultivating the lands..." [...] It was not until the 1820s that numbers of free settlers began to arrive and government schemes began to be introduced to encourage free settlers. Philanthropists Caroline Chisholm and John Dunmore Lang developed their own migration schemes. Land grants of crown land were made by Governors, and settlement schemes such as those of Edward Gibbon Wakefield carried some weight in encouraging migrants to make the long voyage to Australia, as opposed to the United States or Canada.|$|E

2500|$|A song titled [...] "Skyscraper" [...] {{was written}} by Toby Gad, Lindy Robbins, and Kerli for Utopia however the song {{did not make it}} to her album and instead Kerli gave it to be {{recorded}} by American musician Demi Lovato for her album Unbroken. Kerli was very pleased by Lovato's recording and responded by saying [...] "I really think that artists are story tellers and are here to deliver a message and there's no better <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can think of right now than her to deliver that very story. So although I did write this song for my album, it's really her song. She nails it, she owns it. I am just the Santa's little helper here." [...] Gad, Robbins, and Kerli also penned a song titled [...] "I Feel Immortal" [...] for Kerli that also did not make it to her album. The song was eventually recorded by Finnish musician Tarja for her album What Lies Beneath. A version of the track titled [...] "Immortal" [...] recorded by Kerli appears on Frankenweenie Unleashed!, an album consisting of tracks from and inspired by the Tim Burton film Frankenweenie.|$|E
2500|$|Though Norwood has {{acknowledged}} that the creative focus of the album was very much on its technical realization and its sound, she declared Full Moon a concept album based {{on the development of}} a male-female relationship: [...] "It's definitely the concept for the album —me falling in love, then going through some turbulence, and then, at the end, I find the <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really want to be with— so it's a great concept and it's a great experience that I had. [...] I found out a lot about myself. I found a lot out about love, and I'm just happy to have that reflect in my music." [...] Accounting the last three years of her life, Norwood decided to name the album after its title track, stating: [...] "I have done a complete circle and I feel whole. All of that's reflected in the music. That's why I entitled [...] Full Moon. It's a concept album, it's autobiographical. Everything that I've gone through {{in the last three years}} is reflected." [...] The album was originally set to be released on November 20, 2001, but plans were scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|Whedon always {{intended}} for the character to become an icon, claiming [...] "I {{wanted her to be}} a hero that existed in people's minds the way Wonder Woman or Spider-Man does, you know? I wanted her to be a doll or an action figure. I wanted Barbie with Kung Fu grip! I wanted her to enter the mass consciousness and the imaginations of growing kids because I think she's a cool character, and that was always the plan. I wanted Buffy to be a cultural phenomenon, period." [...] In developing Buffy, Whedon was greatly inspired by Kitty Pryde, a character from the pages of the superhero comic X-Men. He admits, [...] "If there's a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty, I don't know what it was... She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it." [...] In a 2009 interview, Whedon revealed he only recently realised how much he saw of himself in Buffy. After years of relating more to Xander, he says, [...] "Buffy was always the <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was in that story because I'm not in every way." [...] Whedon openly wonders why his identification figure is a woman, but describes it as [...] "a real autobiographical kind of therapy for me" [...] to be writing a strong female character like Buffy.|$|E
