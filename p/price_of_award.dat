40|$|This paper {{documents}} the long-run stock <b>price</b> performance <b>of</b> firms with effective Total Quality Management (TQM) programs. The winning <b>of</b> quality <b>awards</b> {{is used as}} a proxy for effective TQM implementation. We compare stock <b>price</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>award</b> winners against various matched control groups for a five-year implementation period and a five-year postimplementation period. During the implementation period there is no difference in the stock price performance, but during the postimplementation period award winners significantly outperform firms in the various control groups. Depending on the control group used, the mean outperformance ranges from 38 % to 46 %. Our results clearly indicate that effective implementation of TQM principles and philosophies leads to significant wealth creation. Furthermore, our results should alleviate many of the concerns regarding the value <b>of</b> quality <b>award</b> systems. Overall, these systems are valuable in terms of recognizing TQM firms and promoting awareness of TQM. Total Quality Management, Quality Awards, Stock Price Performance, Shareholder Value...|$|R
