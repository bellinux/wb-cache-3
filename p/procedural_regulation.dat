Original legislation proceedings soon became obsolete {{as it could}} not catch on an outset of changes in social development of the country. Therefore, {{it is no wonder}} that a vast majority of its inherent features did not make it to the next procedural form. Full impact of legislation proceedings was the most typical for the oldest stage of the Roman history.

Therefore, it did not come from usage in one day, but this process was very slow. This is demonstrated also by relatively long-lasting cohabitation of the classic and cognition procedure. Therefore, the identification "classic" is perfectly appropriate. Paradoxically, this procedure was not the one which should have become a focus of attention of many following generations of jurists. The term "post-classic procedure" can [...] ...|$|E

The legal capacity is the key legal institution for the human possibility to make a juridical acts.

To this purpose, opinions of experts and present case law regarding these matters are in the thesis also confronted.

40|$|The Copenhagen Principles on the Handling of Detainees in International Military Operations were {{released}} in October 2012 after a five-year long process involving states and certain organizations. The Principles address {{a number of}} issues concerning the handling and transfer of detainees. They apply in military operations conducted by states abroad in the context of non-international armed conflicts and peace operations. This article focuses on those principles that address the <b>procedural</b> <b>regulation</b> of internment (ie preventive, security detention), as it is here that the current law is particularly unclear. On the one hand, the treaty provisions applicable in non-international armed conflicts contain no rules on the <b>procedural</b> <b>regulation</b> of internment, in comparison with the law of international armed conflict. On the other hand, the relevant rules under international human rights law (IHRL) appear derogable in such situations. This article demonstrates that the approach taken to this issue in the Copenhagen Principles is one which essentially draws on the procedural rules applicable to civilian internment in the international armed conflicts. These rules adopt standards that are lower than those under IHRL. Reference is then made to other recent practice, which illustrates that the Copenhagen Principles do not apply in a legal vacuum. In particular, two recent judicial developments highlight the continued relevance of human rights law and domestic law, respectively, in regulating detention operations in the context of international military operations. Compliance with the Copenhagen Principles may not, therefore, be sufficient for detention to be lawful...|$|E

However, determinative method of civil procedure regulations is a kind of methodological system of weights and balances, where the dispositive will of the parties and the imperative discretion of the court dialectically transform themselves in a new quality representing a symbiosis of the ways and techniques of civil procedure regulations. Moreover, summarizing the comparative aspect of the conducted research, it is proved that there are more than enough reasonable grounds to state that despite some discrepancy in the scientific approaches of theoretical legal proceedings, the litigation in practice requires the usage of simultaneous methodological techniques for <b>procedural</b> <b>regulation</b> in different countries...|$|E

For decades, the Supreme Court {{has focused on}} jury trials as the central subject of criminal procedure, with only modest and ineffective <b>procedural</b> <b>regulation</b> of guilty pleas.
