40|$|The {{importance}} of disturbance in prairie {{has long been}} recognized. Increasingly interest and research {{have focused on the}} action and interaction of multiple disturbances. The distribution of Flodman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> [Cirsium flodmanii (Rydb.) Arthur] on ant mounds, badger mounds, buffalo wallows, and potholes and in a lightly and a moderately grazed pasture was compared at the Nature Conservancy 2 ̆ 7 s S. H. Ordway Jr. Memorial Prairie in northcentral South Dakota. In the lightly grazed pasture, Flodman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> occurred most frequently on hilltops and ridges, but in the moderately grazed pasture it occurred with equal frequency on hilltops and ridges, and low areas surrounding potholes. Flodman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> was common on earthen mammal mounds and was less abundant on thatching ant mounds and buffalo wallows. No thistles were sampled in potholes. Relative availability of light may explain the thistle 2 ̆ 7 s distribution. Implications of observed patterns are discussed for the evolution of life history traits and the management of prairie remnants...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{recovery}} {{planning for}} a rare species relies upon knowledge of its life history and ecology, {{as well as an}} understanding of its habitat requirements and disturbance regime (Gilpin 2 ̆ 6 Soule 1986, Lande 1988 a). Species that depend upon early-successional or transient habitats in landscape mosaics present unique recovery challenges (Menges 1990). They require perpetuation of multiple populations within a shifting mosaic of local habitats. Recovery plans for these species must be formulated from an understanding of population demography within the context of community and landscape dynamics. Processes that maintain landscape mosaics must be given long-term protection if recovery is to succeed. Pitcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle,</b> Cirsium <b>pitcher</b> (Torr.) T. and G., is listed as threatened in the United States and Canada (Harrison 1988). This monocarpic plant is endemic to the western Great Lakes sand dunes. It is an early-successional species that colonizes open patches in dynamic dune landscapes (Pavlovic et al. 1993). Its recovery depends upon the perpetuation of interacting mosaics of populations, or metapopulations, in Great Lakes dune systems. The concept of metapopulation dynamics (Levins 1970, den Boer 1981, Gilpin 1987, Goodman 1987 a, Gilpin 2 ̆ 6 Hanski 1991) is useful for understanding Cirsium pitcheri ecology and management options. It describes species persistence in environments where the probability of local extinction is high, and has applications to species recovery and reserve design (e. g., Shaffer 1981, Gilpin 2 ̆ 6 Soule 1986, Goodman 1987 b, Lande 1988 b, Menges 1990, Murphy, Freas 2 ̆ 6 Weiss 1990).

Purpose: To {{determine}} the most applicable tool to assess obesity in children. Methods: A systematic review was conducted on the following tools: Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), Underwater Weighing (UW), Skinfold Calipers (SF), Body Mass Index (BMI), Air Displacement Plethysmography (ADP), Waist Circumference (WC), Weight-Height Growth Velocity, Height and Weight Centiles, Photonic Imaging, Near-Infrared Interactance, Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), and Waist and Neck Circumference. Databases: EBSCO, PubMed, Medline, CINNAHL, Science Direct. Results: A variety of assessment tools to determine overweight and obesity in children were researched. Testing environment and the number of participants involved directly impact the most effective assessment tool. In a non-clinical setting with the need for quick results, e. g., a school system or field test, certain tools are more appropriate. Skin fold analysis predicts body composition whereas BMI is an indicator of obesity risk. Both tools are easy to use in a large group study. The tools found to be the most reliable and valid were DEXA and UW. The use of DEXA and UW for assessment of body composition are most effective in clinical studies. Conclusion: Assessment tools to predict overweight and obesity in children is dependent on the assessment environment. The tools with the highest reliability and validity are not feasible with large population study. BMI is an indicator of overweight and obesity and easy to use in a large population study. Researchers should determine the most practical tool to use to assess overweight and obesity based on equipment available {{and the size of the}} study population. **Statement of Disclosure: No researchers received compensation for this project...|$|R

The plasma flow patterns are a complex superposition of several competing effects, including Pfirsch-Schluter flows and currents, toroidal momentum generation and transport (with main chamber neutral recycling and drag playing an important role), {{as well as}} the E x B and diamagnetic drift flows. In the standard field direction the E x B flow in the core region adds to the toroidal plasma rotation, while in the reverse direction their respective contributions are roughly of the same order of magnitude but with opposite signs in the plasma core. However, in the edge, all terms can be of the same sign over most if not all of the radial extent of the SOL, leading to complex patterns and very strong flows. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Carnivory in {{pitcher plants}} {{generally}} involves digestion of prey, by the plant itself, by symbionts, or both. While symbionts {{appear to be}} important in the digestion of prey in Sarracenia purpurea, the importance of pitcher-derived enzymes is less well documented. Our goal was to reduce microbial numbers in pitcher fluid in order to measure the acid phosphatase activity attributable to the pitchers themselves. Preliminary experiments indicated that various antibiotics were minimally effective at reducing microbial populations and that antibiotic-resistant microbes were easily cultured from pitcher fluid. Consequently, we measured the abundance of culturable microbes in every sample taken for the measurement of acid phosphatase activity. Pitchers fed with one sterilized ant had higher levels of acid phosphatase activity than unfed pitchers. Older pitchers were more responsive to feeding than young pitchers. Pitchers with high levels of microbes (on Day 5) had higher acid phosphatase activity than pitchers with low levels of microbes. However, fed pitchers were not more likely to have higher microbe levels and microbe levels were not related to pitcher age. When fluid samples from inside the pitcher were compared to appropriate controls incubated outside the pitcher, acid phosphatase activity was higher inside the pitcher. Results from the feeding experiments are consistent with a primary role of microbes in the digestion of prey in <b>pitchers</b> of <b>S.</b> purpurea. However, the relationship between pitcher age and enzyme activity is not a function of microbes in the pitcher fluid and may depend on enzymes produced by the plant. Our methods would not detect microbes embedded on the inner surface of the pitcher; and if they survived the alcohol rinse and antibiotics, we cannot rule out microbes as the source of the relationship between pitcher age and acid phosphatase activity...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2002 the American Physiological SocietyWe {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether postexercise depression of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) could be demonstrated without voluntary muscle activation in humans. Voluntary fatigue was induced with a 2 -min maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. On another occasion, "electrical fatigue" was induced with trains of shocks delivered for 2 min over the FDI motor point. Five of the twelve subjects also underwent "sequential fatigue" consisting of a 2 -min MVC of FDI followed by 20 min of rest and then 2 min of motor point stimulation. Voluntary fatigue induced MEP depression that persisted for at least 20 min. Electrical fatigue induced a transient MEP facilitation that subsided 20 min after the stimulation and became depressed within 30 min. Thus MEP depression can be induced by both voluntary and electrical fatigue. With electrical fatigue, the initial depression is "masked" by transient MEP facilitation, reflecting cortical plasticity induced by the prolonged electrical stimulation. MEP depression probably reflects tonic afferent input from the exercising muscle that alters cortical excitability without altering spinal excitability.

40|$|Pharmacokinetic {{studies have}} become an {{integral}} part of modern drug development, but these studies are not regulatory needs for herbal remedies. This paper updates our current knowledge on the disposition pathways and pharmacokinetic properties of commonly used herbal medicines in humans. To retrieve relevant data, the authors have searched through computer-based literatures by full text search in Medline (via Pubmed), ScienceDirect, Current Contents Connect (ISI), Cochrance Library, CINAHL (EBSCO), CrossRef Search and Embase (all from inception to May 2010). Many herbal compounds undergo Phase I and/or Phase II metabolism in vivo, with cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) playing a major role. Some herbal ingredients are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) which is highly expressed in the intestine, liver, brain and kidney. As such, the activities of these drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters are determining factors for the in vivo bioavailability, disposition and distribution of herbal remedies. There are increasing pharmacokinetic studies of herbal remedies, but these studies are mainly focused on a small number of herbal remedies including St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> wort, milk <b>thistle,</b> sculcap, curcumin, echinacea, ginseng, ginkgo, and ginger. The pharmacokinetic data of a small number of purified herbal ingredients, including anthocyanins, berberine, catechins, curcumin, lutein and quercetin, are available. For the majority of herbal remedies used in folk medicines, data on their disposition and biological fate in humans are lacking or in paucity. For a herbal medicine, the pharmacological effect is achieved when the bioactive agents or the metabolites reach and sustain proper levels at their sites of action. Both the dose levels and fates of active components in the body govern their target-site concentrations after administration of an herbal remedy. In this regard, a safe and optimal use of herbal medicines requires a full understanding of their pharmacokinetic profiles. To optimize the use of herbal remedies, further clinical studies to explore their biological fate including the disposition pathways and kinetics in the human body are certainly needed. <br /...|$|R
