50|$|Never one to keep still, Dex parted {{company with}} the radio station and then {{subsequently}} King of the Jungle Records in 1995. By then he had already launched two further record labels, State of the Art Recordings alongside partners Paul Brown and Jon Stewart, and Subversive Recordings (formerly Subliminal Recordings) which featured a number of collaborations with longtime production partner Teebone including Selectors Roll which featured on the Suburban Base compilation album, Drum & Bass Selection 3 (The Dub <b>Plate</b> <b>Selection)</b> and Top Gun. These labels allowed Dex further creative freedom, the former being his platform to express his jazz roots. As a trio Paul, Jon and Dex recorded under the moniker Solid State. Collectively they have been credited {{as one of the}} pioneers of the Liquid Funk scene. Together they created the sound they branded 'Urban Fusion' to cover all of the creative influences evident in their music, including jazz, dub, Detroit techno, garage, funk and reggae. During this time Solid State recorded for Fabio's Creative Source label as well as Renegade Recordings and Alan McGee's Eruption Records (Creation Records' sister label).|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{was born}} in Manchester, Jamaica. His musical career began {{at the age of}} twelve, when he {{performed}} under the name Little Bimbo. During the 1980s he worked as a deejay on sound systems such as Conquering Lion, Soul Remembrance, Pepper's Disco, Stereophonic, and Destiny Outernational (where he first met Tony Rebel). He recorded his first track in 1985, but it would be two years later before his first single, [...] "Problem Everywhere" [...] was released. An album of material from this period (Journey) was later released. In 1988, he joined Sugar Minott's Youth Promotion label, releasing [...] "No Disrespect", and working regularly with Tony Rebel, Smith now being billed simply as 'Bimbo'. The pair began performing as a duo around the sound systems to much acclaim. The Garnett Silk Meets the Conquering Lion: A Dub <b>Plate</b> <b>Selection</b> album dates from about this time and features a clutch of exclusive recordings the DJ cut for the sound system from the mid-1980s {{through the end of the}} decade. Rebel, a Rastarfari, eventually converted Smith to his religion with the help of dub poet Yasus Afari, a close friend of both the DJs.|$|E
40|$|Selection of {{putative}} transformants after Arabidopsis in planta {{transformation and}} the main factors involved in are comprehensively discussed. Different antibiotic concentrations, basal medium composition, incubation condition of <b>selection</b> <b>plates</b> and various <b>selection</b> criteria were investigated. Results showed that although kanamycin concentrations from 35 to 75 mgl- 1 could discriminate transformants from non-transformed seedlings, optimum selection was carried out on plates with 75 mgl- 1 kanamycin. This concentration of kanamycin along with three days dark treatment before light incubation of <b>selection</b> <b>plates</b> resulted in etiolated seedlings which were distinguished quickly by their small dark green secondary leaves. Secondary leaves development was demonstrated {{to be the most}} reliable criteria for rapid and accurate selection of transformants with a selection efficiency of 97. 5 %. In contrast, variations in root length and seedling colour complicated the selection process resulting in more wrong selections. Addition of sucrose to selection medium deferred the selection procedure by repressing antibiotic toxicity; while sucrose omission accelerated discrimination of transformants form bleached non-transformed seedlings. We strongly recommend use of 75 mgl- 1 kanamycin supplemented medium, 3 day dark treatment before light incubation of <b>plates,</b> and <b>selection</b> of transformants using secondary leaves development criteria for rapid and accurate selection of transformed seedling. These modifications would eliminate false positive transformants while reducing selection period to 6 days...|$|R
40|$|One {{of organic}} wastes {{that are often}} {{produced}} by petrochemical industry is toluene, a naturally-slow-decomposed compound. The presence of toluene degrading gene can be useful to accelerate toluene degradation. In this study, we aims to clone the toluene gen from Pseudomonas putida isolated from waste. The toluene degrading, tol-like, gene was derived from P. putida genome cutting with Xbal, BamHI, EcoRI or Sacl. The fragments were then cloned on p UCP 18 into Escherichia coli Origami host cells. Selections of transformants were perfonned on luria-Bertani (LB) agar containing 100 ig/ml of ampicillin and then on Bushnell Haas Agar (BHA) containing toluene as the sole carbon source.

40|$|A simple {{technique}} has been devised that allows direct <b>plate</b> <b>selection</b> of tetracycline-sensitive clones from a predominantly tetracycline-resistant population. The technique is especially useful in genetic methodologies {{based on the}} use of tetracycline resistance transposons, such as Tn 10. Potential uses of the method include selection of deletion mutants, fine-structure mapping, generalized mapping, construction of multiply marked strains, elimination of tetracycline resistance transposons and plasmids and cloning. The technique is based on our finding that tetracycline-resistant cells are hypersensitive to lipophilic chelating agents, such as fusaric acid. This finding supports the contention that certain metal ions critically facilitate tetracycline uptake and leads us to suggest possible molecular mechanisms for tetracycline resistance...|$|E
40|$|Raw {{materials}} used in this lab {{is the result of}} oil ginger essential oil of ginger in Ungaran, using water and steam distillation method. At this lab using adsorption method, using the bentonite as adsorbent with a magnetic stirrer hot <b>plate.</b> <b>Selection</b> of bentonite as adsorbent because bentonite has the ability to adsorbs camphene compounds. With reduced levels of camphene in ginger oil, then zingiberene levels will increase. Based on practice is known that the longer the time it adsorbs the more compounds camphene be absorbed by bentonite, so that sooner zingiberene levels increased. Meanwhile, the higher the temperature it adsorbs the compounds that camphene be absorbed by bentonite back zingiberene apart so that the levels will decrease. Differences in variables such as time and temperature adsorption adsorbs very influential on lab results. This variable distinction serves to determine optimum operating conditions in the process of adsorption ginger oil with bentonite. Factors that affect the process adsrobi are temperature, time, stirring speed, absorbent surface area and concentration of the adsorbate. ...|$|E
40|$|High {{throughput}} screening (HTS) is {{an effective}} method for lead and probe discovery that is widely used in industry and academia to identify novel chemical matter and to initiate the drug discovery process. However, HTS can be time-consuming and costly {{and the use of}} subsets as an efficient alternative to screening these large collections has been investigated. Subsets may be {{selected on the basis of}} chemical diversity, molecular properties, biological activity diversity, or biological target focus. Previously we described a novel form of subset screening: plate-based diversity subset (PBDS) screening, in which the screening subset is constructed by <b>plate</b> <b>selection</b> (rather than individual compound cherry-picking), using algorithms that select for compound quality and chemical diversity on a plate basis. In this paper, we describe a second generation approach to the construction of an updated subset: PBDS 2, using both plate and individual compound selection, that has an improved coverage of the chemical space of the screening file, whilst only selecting the same number of plates for screening. We describe the validation of PBDS 2 and its successful use in hit and lead discovery. PBDS 2 screening became the default mode of singleton (one compound per well) HTS for lead discovery in Pfizer...|$|E

In particular, the pulsed YAG laser {{is an extremely}} flexible and versatile too] capable of hermetically sealing microelectronics packages containing sensitive components without damaging them. This paper presents an overview of details that must be considered for successful use of laser welding when addressing electronic package sealing. These include; metallurgical considerations such as alloy and <b>plating</b> <b>selection,</b> weld joint configuration, design of optics, use of protective gases and control of thermal distortions. The primary limitations on use of laser welding electronic for packaging applications are economic ones. The laser itself is a relatively costly device when compared to competing welding equipment. Further, the cost of consumables and repairs can be significant. These facts have relegated laser welding to use only where it presents a distinct quality or reliability advantages over other techniques of electronic package sealing. Because of the unique noncontact and low heat inputs characteristics of laser welding, it is an ideal candidate for sealing electronic packages containing MEMS devices (microelectromechanical systems). This paper addresses how the unique advantages of the pulsed YAG laser {{can be used to}} simplify MEMS packaging and deliver a product of improved quality...|$|R

40|$|We have {{constructed}} strains {{that allow}} a direct selection for mutators of Escherichia coli {{on a single}} plate medium. The <b>plate</b> <b>selection</b> is based on using two different markers whose reversion is enhanced by a given mutator. Plates containing limiting amounts of each respective nutrient allow the growth of ghost colonies or microcolonies {{that give rise to}} full-size colonies only if a reversion event occurs. Because two successive mutational events are required, mutator cells are favored to generate full-size colonies. Reversion of a third marker allows direct visualization of the mutator phenotype by the large number of blue papillae in the full-size colonies. We also describe plate selections involving three successive nutrient markers followed by a fourth papillation step. Different frameshift or base substitution mutations are used to select for mismatch-repair-defective strains (mutHLS and uvrD). We can detect and monitor mutator cells arising spontaneously, at frequencies lower than 10 − 5 in the population. Also, we can measure a mutator cascade, in which one type of mutator (mutT) generates a second mutator (mutHLS) that then allows stepwise frameshift mutations. We discuss the relevance of mutators arising on a single medium as a result of cells overcoming successive growth barriers to the development and progression of cancerous tumors, some of which are mutator cell lines...|$|E

[14] {{retrospectively}} analyzed {{data from}} 43 patients with fractured humerus shafts treated with DCP and LCP using minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) techniques, {{and showed that}} {{there was no significant difference}} when outcomes and complications of the two types of implants were compared. Hur et al. [15] retrospectively analyzed data from 19 elderly patients with fractured humerus shafts treated with LCDCP and LCP. In their study, loosening of the plate occurred in one case each from the LCP group and the LCDCP group. The rest of the patients achieved union uneventfully without any complications. Union rate and clinical scores were not significantly different between the two groups. They advised that the principle of fracture fixation was more important than <b>plate</b> <b>selection</b> in humeral shaft fractures of elderly patients. Results of the present study are comparable with the reported literature [14, 15]. In their prospective study, Sommer et al. [16] published the results of use of various LCPs in treatment of 144 patients with 169 fractures, and concluded that the LCP was a technically mature option in complex fracture situations and in revision operations after the failure of other implants. Ring et al. [17] treated 24 patients with osteoporotic delayed union (9 patients) and nonunion (15 patients) of the humeral diaphysis with LCP. All the fractures eventually healed and, using a modification of the Constant and Murley shoulder score, the results were good or excellent in 22 patients and fair in 2 patients.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The {{vertebral}} spine angle in {{the frontal}} plane {{is an important}} parameter {{in the assessment of}} scoliosis and may be obtained from panoramic X-ray images. Technological advances have allowed for an increased use of digital X-ray images in clinical practice. PURPOSE: In this context, the objective {{of this study is to}} assess the reliability of computer-assisted Cobb angle measurements taken from digital X-ray images. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Clinical investigation quantifying scoliotic deformity with Cobb method to evaluate the intra- and interobserver variability using manual and digital techniques. PATIENT SAMPLE: Forty-nine patients diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis were chosen based on convenience, without predilection for gender, age, type, location, or magnitude of the curvature. OUTCOME MEASURES: Images were examined to evaluate Cobb angle variability, end <b>plate</b> <b>selection,</b> as well as intra- and interobserver errors. METHODS: Specific software was developed to digitally reproduce the Cobb method and calculate semiautomatically the degree of scoliotic deformity. During the study, three observers estimated the Cobb angle using both the digital and the traditional manual methods. RESULTS: The results showed that Cobb angle measurements may be reproduced in the computer as reliably as with the traditional manual method, in similar conditions to those found in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: The computer-assisted method (digital method) is clinically advantageous and appropriate to assess the scoliotic curvature in the frontal plane using Cobb method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|When a {{wild-type}} strain of Escherichia coli B was cultured on a medium containing L-aspartic acid {{as the sole}} carbon source (Asp-C medium), aspartase formation was higher than that observed in minimal medium. Addition of glucose to Asp-C medium decreased aspartase formation. When also cultured in a medium containing L-aspartic acid as the sole nitrogen source (Asp-N medium), E. coli B showed {{a low level of}} aspartase formation and an elongated doubling time. To obtain aspartase-hyperproducing strains, we enriched cells growing faster than cells of the {{wild-type strain}} in Asp-N medium by continuous cultivation of mutagenized cells. After <b>plate</b> <b>selection,</b> the doubling times of these mutants were measured. Thereafter, fast-growing mutants were tested for aspartase formation. One of these mutants, strain EAPc 7, had a higher level of aspartase formation than did the wild-type strain in medium containing L-aspartic acid as the carbon source, however; addition of glucose to this medium decreased aspartase formation. The other mutant, strain EAPc 244, had a higher level of aspartase activity than did the wild-type strain in both media. Therefore, aspartase formation in mutant EAPc 244 was released from catabolite repression. In strain EAPc 244 the other catabolite-repressible enzymes, beta-galactosidase, tryptophanase, and the three tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, were also released from catabolite repression. Both mutants had sevenfold the aspartase formation of the wild-type strain in a medium which contained fumaric acid as the main carbon source and which has been used for industrial production of E. coli B aspartase.
