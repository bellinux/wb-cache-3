50|$|This type of <b>power</b> <b>wrench</b> is {{designed}} more for speed and less for torque. If {{high levels of}} torque are desired an impact wrench should be used.|$|E
50|$|A <b>power</b> <b>wrench</b> is type of wrench that {{is powered}} by other means than human force. A typical power source is {{compressed}} air. There are two main types of power wrenches: impact wrenches and air ratchet wrenches or pneumatic ratchet wrenches.|$|E
50|$|Swales {{set out on}} an {{acquisition}} {{drive in}} 1995. Around the same time, it ventured from pure engineering to manufacturing satellite hardware and tools for astronauts, such as a popular <b>power</b> <b>wrench.</b> Revenues exceeded $75 million in 1997. Swales then had 700 employees and was growing quickly. Among other projects, the company was manufacturing components for the International Space Station's thermal control system.|$|E
50|$|The main {{characteristics}} of a hydraulic torque wrench which set it apart from other <b>powered</b> <b>wrenches</b> of similar function are that (1) it must generate torque using only hydraulic means (2) it must be self ratcheting, and (3) it must include an accurate method of determining the amount of torque applied.|$|R
50|$|Cordless impact drivers {{should not}} to be {{confused}} with the <b>powered</b> impact <b>wrench.</b>|$|R
30|$|Among {{the various}} kinds of <b>power</b> <b>wrenches</b> we have {{evaluated}} (battery, gasoline, A.C. outlet and air-compressed), we determined that a heavy-duty electric wrench (Makita TW 450 D) was the most useful. Despite its portability (3.5  kg including a 6.0 Ah- 0.7  kg battery Makita BL 1860 B), it can deliver large torque. Therefore, we decided to use this electric wrench throughout our performance tests.|$|R
50|$|A {{tension control}} bolt (TC bolt) {{is a heavy}} duty bolt used in steel frame construction. The head is usually domed and is not {{designed}} to be driven. The end of the shank has a spline on it which is engaged by a special <b>power</b> <b>wrench</b> which prevents the bolt from turning while the nut is tightened. When the appropriate torque is reached the spline shears off.|$|E
5000|$|Pneumatic {{torque wrench}} - Operates like the torque {{multiplier}} but is mated to a pneumatic air motor. It {{is essentially a}} mix of the compressed air <b>powered</b> impact <b>wrench</b> and the traditionally hand operated torque multiplier, delivering aspects of both tools.|$|R
40|$|Tool mitten {{provides}} a low reaction torque source of <b>power</b> for <b>wrench,</b> screwdriver, or drill activities. The technique employed prevents the attachments from drifting {{away from the}} operator. While the tools are specifically designed for space environments, {{they can be used}} on steel scaffolding, in high building maintenance, or underwater environments...|$|R
60|$|Cunning and {{successful}} {{as was the}} savage's ruse, it failed signally, for {{to get hold of}} the Shawnee was all Joe wanted. Feeling the sharp pain as they fell together, he reached his hand behind him and caught Silvertip's wrist. Exerting all his <b>power,</b> he <b>wrenched</b> the Indian's arm so that it was not only dislocated, but the bones cracked.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} power tool {{versions}} of [...] "air" [...] (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive air <b>powered</b> socket <b>wrenches</b> which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are impact wrenches {{which are used}} for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric <b>powered</b> impact <b>wrenches</b> for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts. Hydraulic motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called [...] "impact sockets") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness {{so as not to}} shatter under the impacts of the impact tool. They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the hand-tool variety. Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with impact wrenches, presenting a safety risk.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{torque wrench}} {{was invented by}} George A. Sturdevant in Houston, Texas. The concept of a hydraulic <b>powered</b> torque <b>wrench</b> was first introduced on the market sometime in the early 1960s in a primitive form, and several key advances have been developed by manufacturers since that time which provided major advancements in the technology and usability of the tools far beyond the original concept tool.|$|R
5000|$|Impact wrench - An air <b>powered</b> socket <b>wrench</b> that {{delivers}} high torque output by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft. Nearly every auto body or mechanic shop {{will have an}} air compressor and impact wrench to loosen and tighten lug nuts on wheels. [...] Most major tool manufacturers carry an air impact wrench, including DeWalt, Ingersoll, and Craftsman.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, Wood {{and two of}} his brothers, Glen and Delano, {{purchased}} a 1940 Ford, which was later modified and used in NASCAR, and the team made its first start in a Lincoln at Martinsville Speedway on May 17, 1953. Wood was the team's engine builder, and the team's pit crew, originally composed of family and friends, became the first team in NASCAR history to record a 25-second four tire pit stop. Wood stated that in 1960 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, he noticed that Fireball Roberts', at the lead at the time, pit crew took 45 seconds to change two tires and fuel; Roberts' team was using a four-prong lug wrench, so Wood's team decided to use <b>power</b> <b>wrenches,</b> which cut down the time to 25 seconds. Wood later modernized the floor jack; originally, jacks weighed between 70 and 80 pounds, and required at least ten pumps for tire clearance. Wood disassembled the jacks and installed larger pistons, leading to only two to three pumps to clear. In 1965, Wood's team was hired by Jim Clark to pit for him in the 1965 Indianapolis 500, which went on to win. The team used a modified fuel can to make the gas flow faster.|$|R
50|$|An {{impact wrench}} (also {{known as an}} impactor, impact gun, air wrench, air gun, rattle gun, torque gun, windy gun) is a socket <b>wrench</b> <b>power</b> tool {{designed}} to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft.|$|R
25|$|On March 8, 1847, Narioki {{arrived in}} Satsuma, making Nariakira’s position, {{something}} equivalent to deputy to his father, obsolete. After essentially having {{the reins of}} <b>power</b> <b>wrenched</b> from his hands by his own father, Nariakira left Satsuma for Edo. The authority formerly vested him was clearly and quickly being shifted to his half brother, Hisamitsu Hisamitsu was rapidly elevated {{through the ranks of}} his father’s court soon after Nariakira’s departure from Satsuma for Edo. He was placed in charge of the newly created office of military service of Satsuma in October 1847. In 1848, Narioki appointed Hisamitsu steward of Chosa District, with the responsibility of acting on behalf of the daimyō in all military matters in the area. At about the same time, Hisamitsu was given the highly respected post of han councilor, a rank which, according to the instructions accompanying the appointment, placed him {{at the top of the}} social scale. At ceremonial occasions, Hisamitsu was ordered by his father to sit at a place higher than that of the deputy in charge of the daimyō of Satsuma’s castle. Narioki even went so far as to place Hisamitsu in charge of all of Satsuma whenever the daimyō chose to leave Satsuma for any reason, business or pleasure. It was apparent that Hisamitsu was being groomed to become the next daimyō, completely disregarding the fact that, by primogeniture, Nariakira was supposed to be the heir-apparent.|$|R
50|$|Torque {{multipliers}} {{are most}} often used when a compressed air <b>powered</b> impact <b>wrench</b> is unavailable due to remote locations without power, or where cost considerations require manually operated tools which do not require any power supply or power source of any kind. There are many instances where screws, bolts and other fasteners are secured so tightly that using a typical lug wrench with a cheater bar {{is not sufficient to}} loosen them. These include automotive repair, product assembly, construction projects, heavy equipment maintenance and other instances where high torque output is needed. A torque multiplier allows the user to generate high torque output without the use of an air compressor or impact gun.|$|R
5000|$|While Dazzle Vision is {{well known}} for {{creating}} a new mood and style for each album, Kirari is said to be all these influences put into a blender. The album opens up with a gut <b>wrenching</b> <b>power</b> ballad with screamo undertones and heavy riffs not typical of the usual power ballad. From there it bounces between an Alternative Metal and a Thrash Metal vibe. [...] The album also showcases the softer side of Dazzle Vision much like their previous album Crystal Children, clashing pop and rock into tunes such as Continue and Divided.|$|R

Many of Nariakira’s followers believed Yura was the source of the subsequent deaths of his eldest children. This belief caused many of them to call for the assassination of Yura, her son Hisamitsu, and Zusho, whom they felt also played a hand in the deaths of Nariakira’s eldest children. Nariakira was able to restrain them; upon hearing of their plans for murder, Narioki began rooting out Nariakira’s supporters and ordering their deaths by seppuku.|$|R

Kirari showcases the softer side of Dazzle Vision much like their previous album Crystal Children, clashing pop and rock into tunes such as Continue and Divided. The entire concept of the song is both symbolizes the rebirth of the band but the anger about the band's relationship with the Japanese music industry.|$|R
40|$|Were we {{to accept}} recent commentators, Queer Theory, is: over, passé, moribund, stagnant; or, at worst, dead, its time and its <b>power</b> to <b>wrench</b> frames having come and gone. Almost {{since it began}} we have been hearing about the death(s) of Queer Theory. Yet, despite the rumors of extinction, Queer Theory {{continues}} to tenaciously hold on to life, to affirm {{the promise of the}} future, even despite the dominant influence of Lee Edelman’s book No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive which encourages us to fuck the future and its coercive politics which are, he tells us, embodied in the fascist face of the Child. With each new book, conference, seminar series, each new masters program, we hear (yet again) that Queer Theory is over. Some argue that the unstoppable train of queer theory came to a halt in the late nineties having been swallowed up by its own fashionability. It had become, contrary to its own anti-assimilationist rhetoric, fashionable, very much included, rather than being the outlaw, it wanted to be. But the books and articles still continue to appear, the conferences continue to be held. And, if it were true that Queer Theory has been assimilated completely, become sedimented, completely domesticated (or at least capable of being domesticated) then it really would be over. Nobody would be reading any more for we would already know what was to come...|$|R
2500|$|The Minnesota Orchestra {{was founded}} in 1903 as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. Although it {{was among the first}} to perform on the radio and to record, it {{initially}} was not known as one of the country's great orchestras. In the 1930s, Eugene Ormandy transformed it into an excellent ensemble and expanded its repertory, making it the most-recorded orchestra in the United States, and giving it an international reputation. Other illustrious conductors included Dimitri Mitropoulos and Antal Dorati. Osmo Vänskä, a Finnish conductor, music director since 2003, took the orchestra into its second century. Its live performances and recordings in a program of the complete works of Ludwig van Beethoven have been received with enthusiasm, the group has been called [...] "brilliant", and a critic has stated the musicians are enjoying [...] "their first golden age" [...] since the days of Ormandy and Mitropoulos. Another critic wrote for The New Yorker of a concert in 2010 and its [...] "uncanny, <b>wrenching</b> <b>power,</b> the kind you hear once or twice a decade" [...] and thought that that day the Minnesota Orchestra was [...] "the greatest orchestra in the world". [...] The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the only full-time professional chamber orchestra in the country, [...] and also tours and records. [...] Professional orchestral ensembles outside the Twin Cities include the Duluth Superior Symphony Orchestra and the Rochester Symphony Orchestra and Chorale.|$|R
