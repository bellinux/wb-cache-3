It is helpful in deriving weak su±cient conditions for both partial e±ciency and Pareto-e±ciency. Unlike the ordered valuations case, Pareto e±ciency {{is shown to}} be a non-pathological case. Pareto e±ciency and positive consumer surplus are mutually exclusive. Under costs separability optimal package-pricing scheme is shown implementable by small rewards. Counter-examples show that our assumptions are essential. In certain non-ordered situations, package-optimization setting with rations is more appropriate than the standard setting.

40|$|We analyze {{nonlinear}} pricing problem under monopoly {{using two}} hidden types of agents with linear demands and fully characterize all possible optimal solutions for both ordered and non-ordered demands. We show that both optimal packages can either contain Pareto-efficient quantities or one package can be undersized or oversized. All these effects are non- degenerate {{and are expected}} to hold for nonlinear demands. Surprisingly, the total output under nonlinear price discrimination with self- selection is neither unambigously realted to efficiency nor to the degree of monopoly power (demand elasticity). We also show that under limited range of parameters quantity premia can occur only when demands are ordered.

40|$|In Inside Story, Fergus Green unpacks {{the carbon}} <b>pricing</b> <b>package</b> to {{discover}} a tension between fundamentally different visions {{for the future of}} Australia’s economy and environment • THE federal government wants to convince us that its new carbon <b>price</b> <b>package</b> creates a “clean energy future” for Australia. If you’re wading through Sunday’s avalanche of announcements in search of a clear policy signal to this effect, though, you won’t find it. The incentives in the package pull the economy in contradictory directions. But searching for policy coherence is a misguided exercise. It’s better to think of the package as the chaotic aftermath of the first real battle in a long war over the future composition of Australia’s economy and environment in a warming world. I say the first real battle because, although various political parties and social groups have always held visions for our collective future that differ fundamentally from the political mainstream, the negotiations over the carbon package mark the first occasion in which such an alternative vision has been expressed through a political party with sufficient power to influence a major economic and environmental reform, at least at the federal level… Read the full article  ...|$|R

5000|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Fairtrade farmers get higher prices on average [...] Some anecdotes state farmers are paid more by traders than by Fairtrade cooperatives and some state that they were paid less. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets, and few appreciate the complexity of different <b>price</b> <b>packages.</b> A different <b>price</b> <b>package</b> may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they may pay more or less than traders, depending on the day. Bassett (2009) [...] is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries, which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs of producing Fairtrade. For instance, when Fairtrade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, they earned a higher price per pound but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields. The claim that Fairtrade guarantees a 'fair price' for the producer is not supported by the evidence and although it is possible that Fair Trade may do so on occasions, {{there is no reason to}} believe that this is normal.|$|R
