The large abundance of schreibersite in all of the lithic types except the <b>poikilitic</b> rocks suggests that much of it may be of lunar origin. The near-absence of schreibersite in the <b>poikilitic</b> rocks may be a result of P diffusion from the metal to the surrounding silicate at low temperature. Application of the compositional data for the coexisting metal-schreibersite pairs to isotherms in the system Fe-Ni-P indicates a sequence of progressively lower temperatures of equilibration (and probably a corresponding sequence of slower cooling rates) of these phases from the devitrified glasses, to the mesostasis-rich rocks, to the diabases, to the <b>poikilitic</b> rocks...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePeridotite xenoliths erupted by alkali basaltic volcanoes in {{the western}} Pannonian Basin {{can be divided into}} two {{fundamentally}} contrasting groups. Geochemical characteristics of the abundant protogranular, porphyroclastic and equigranular nodules suggest that these samples originate from an old consolidated and moderately depleted lithospheric mantle domain. In contrast, the geochemical features of the worldwide rare, but in the Pannonian Basin relatively abundant, <b>poikilitic</b> xenoliths attest to a more complex evolution. It has been argued that the origin of the peculiar texture and chemistry may be intimately linked to melt/rock reactions at successively decreasing liquid volumes in a porous melt flow system. The most likely site where such reactions can take place is the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary. In this context, <b>poikilitic</b> xenoliths may provide petrological and geochemical evidence for reactions between magmatic liquids issued from the uprising asthenosphere and the solid mantle rocks of the lithosphere. These reactions are important agents of the thermal erosion of the lithosphere; thus, they could have considerably contributed to the thinning of the lithosphere in the Pannonian region.

40|$|The {{granulite}} suite {{consists of}} two major types of rocks. One is coarse-grained and <b>poikilitic</b> with many euhedral crystals of olivine and plagioclase. These characteristics indicate crystallization from a melt; the <b>poikilitic</b> granulites are impact melt breccias. The other group is finer-grained and granoblastic, with numerous triple junctions; the granoblastic granulites are metamorphic rocks. Compositional groups identified by Lindstrom and Lindstrom contain both textural types. Two pyroxene thermometry indicates that both groups equilibrated at 1000 to 1150 C. Calculations suggest that the granoblastic group, which has an average grain size of about 80 microns, was annealed for less than 6 x 10 exp 4 y at 1000 C, and for less than 2500 y at 1150 C. Similar equilibration temperatures suggest that both groups were physically associated after impact events produced the <b>poikilitic</b> melts. Granulitic impactites hold important information about the pre-Nectarian bombardment history of the Moon, and the composition and thermal evolution of the early lunar crust. Granulitic impactites are widely {{considered to be an}} important rock type in the lunar crust, but how they formed is poorly understood. Metal compositions and elevated concentrations of meteoritic siderophile elements suggest that most lunar granulites are impact breccias. Their occurrence as clasts in approximately 3. 9 Ga breccias, and Ar-(40 - 39) ages greater than or = 4. 2 Ga for some granulites show that they represent a component of the lunar crust which formed prior to the Nectarian cataclysm. Petrographic characteristics of lunar granulites indicate at least two endmember textural variants which apparently formed in fundamentally different ways. One type has granoblastic textures consisting of equant, polygonal to rounded grains, and abundant triple junctions with small dispersions around 120 degrees indicating a close approach to textural equilibrium. As suggested by many authors, granoblastic granulites probably formed by subsolidus annealing and recrystallization of fragmental or glassy protoliths. Examples of this type include 15418, 78155, and 79215. The other textural type consists of <b>poikilitic</b> to poikiloblastic rocks with euhedral to subhedral plagioclase and olivine enclosed by interstitial pyroxene. In some cases, the texture resembles that of an orthocumulate. Examples of this type include 60035, 67955, and 77017. Rounding of grain edges is common in <b>poikilitic</b> granulites, but the regular crystal shapes and widely dispersed dihedral angles show they are far from textural equilibrium. The textures of <b>poikilitic</b> granulites are more consistent with the formation of these rocks by crystallization from a melt than by subsolidus metamorphism. A few samples have been recognized with textural characteristics transitional between those of the granoblastic and poikiloblastic endmembers (e. g., 72559, 78527). Pyroxene compositions taken from the literature and determined for this study by electron microprobe were used to calculate equilibration temperatures. The Kretz Ca transfer (solvus) thermometer and the Lindsley and Anderson graphical method both give similar temperatures, which range from approximately 1000 to 1150 C. There is no apparent temperature difference between granoblastic and <b>poikilitic</b> varieties, but there is a hint in these data that the more ferroan varieties equilibrated to lower temperatures. Additional studies are in progress to test this possibility...|$|E
40|$|Y- 793605 {{is a new}} martian {{meteorite}} from Antarctica {{that can}} be classified as a lherzolitic shergottite. Y- 793605 mainly shows a <b>poikilitic</b> texture (large pyroxene oikocryst with enclosed olivine and chromite), but partly contains non-poikilitic areas (mainly maskelynite, olivine, and pigeonite). Olivine in the non-poikilitic area is more Fe-rich and shows a narrower compositional distribution than that in the <b>poikilitic</b> area. Low-Ca pyroxenes in the non-poikilitic area are also more Fe-rich (En_ Fs_ Wo_ 7 ∿En_ Fs_ Wo_) {{than those in the}} <b>poikilitic</b> area (En_ Fs_ Wo_ 3 ∿En_ Fs_ Wo_). Augites in the <b>poikilitic</b> area are usually present rimming the oikocrysts (En_ Fs_ Wo_ to En_ Fs_ Wo_). The crystallization sequence of minerals in Y- 793605 is considered to have begun by initial crystallization of cumulus phases (olivine and chromite) from the parent magma. Then, low-Ca pyroxenes and later augite poikilitically enclosed cumulus phases, and became a large oikocryst. Due to accumulation of phases, small interstitial melts formed between the oikocryst boundaries, and plagioclase crystallized from the Ca-Fe-rich melt along with pigeonite. After minor augite crystallization in the non-poikilitic area, all phases experienced re-equilibration (e. g., homogenization of olivine). Y- 793605 shows a close relationship to previously known lherzolitic shergottites ALH 77005 and LEW 88516. Especially, olivine composition of Y- 793605 is nearly identical to that of LEW 88516. Pyroxene and maskelynite compositions are almost the same among these three meteorites. Although it is hardly possible to consider that Y- 793605 is paired with ALH 77005 or LEW 88516 in the sense that Y- 793605 was in the same fall with them, it can be concluded that Y- 793605 originated from the same igneous body or rock in Mars as ALH 77005 and LEW 88516...|$|E
40|$|Early {{studies of}} rocks {{retrieved}} from the Moon during the Apollo missions defined {{a group of}} rocks as granulites or 'granulitic impactites'.

Petrographic studies indicate that the textures of 'granulitic breccias' are significantly varied so as to redefine the granulitic suite into at least two distinct groups. The first group consists of rocks that have true granulitic textures: polygonal to rounded, equant grains that are annealed, and have triple junctions with small dispersions from the average 120 degrees. The second group of rocks have <b>poikilitic</b> or poikiloblastic textures, with subhedral to euhedral plagioclase and/or olivine grains enclosed in pyroxene oikocrysts.

The samples include <b>poikilitic</b> melt rocks inferred to have been formed in the Serenitatis basin-forming impact, aphanitic melt rock whose compositions vary and whose provenance is uncertain, and granulite, gabbro, and melt clasts. Three of the <b>poikilitic</b> melts have similar age spectrum plateau ages (72395, 96, 3893 +/- 16 Ma (2 sigma); 72535, 7, 3887 +/- 16 Ma; 76315, 150, 3900 +/- 16 Ma) with a weighted mean age of 3893 +/- 9 Ma, which we interpret as the best age for the Serenitatis basin- forming impact. Published Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 age spectrum ages of Apollo 17 <b>poikilitic</b> melts are consistent with our new age but are much less precise. Two <b>poikilitic</b> melts did not give plateaus and the maxima in their age spectra indicate ages of {{greater than or equal}} to 3869 Ma (72558, 7) and {{greater than or equal to}} 3743 Ma (77135, 178). Plateau ages of two <b>poikilitic</b> melts and two gabbro clasts from 73155 range from 3854 +/- 16 Ma to 3937 +/- 16 Ma and have probably been affected by the ubiquitous (older?) clasts and by post- formation heating (impact) events. Plateau ages from two of the aphanitic melt 'blobs' and two granulites in sample 72255 fall in the narrow range of 3850 q 16 Ma to 3869 q 16 Ma with a weighted mean of 3862 +/- 8 Ma. Two of the aphanitic melt blobs from 72255 have ages of 3883 +/- 16 Ma and greater than or equal to 3894 Ma, whereas a <b>poikilitic</b> melt clast (of different composition from the 'Serenitatis' melts) has an age of 3835 +/- 16 Ma, which is the upper limit for the accretion of 72255. These data suggest that either the aphanitic melts vary in age, as is also suggested by their varying chemical compositions, or they formed in the 72255 accretionary event about 3. 84 - 3. 85 Ga and older relict material is responsible for the dispersion of ages. In any case the aphanitic melts do not appear to be Serenitatis products. Our age for the Serenitatis impact shows, on the basis of the isotopic age evidence alone, that Serenitatis is greater than 20 - 25 Ma and probably greatr than 55 - 60 Ma older than Imbrium (less than or equal to 3870 Ma and probably less than or equal to 3836 Ma (Dalrymple and Ryder, 19931). Noritic granulite sample 78527 has a plateau age of 4146 +/- 17 Ma, representing a minimum age for cooling of this sample in the early lunar crust.

40|$|The late Proterozoic Ntaka Ultramafic Complex {{is a body}} of dominantly pyroxenitic cumulate rocks {{containing}} cyclic alternations of olivine-orthopyroxene cumulates. Chemical zoning in the pyroxenes {{has been}} imaged at 25 - 40 μm resolution using desktop microbeam X-ray fluorescence mapping followed up with laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis for minor and trace elements on selected samples. <b>Poikilitic</b> and granular harzburgites are finely intermingled, in some cases on a centimetre scale in the same thin section. <b>Poikilitic</b> varieties display spectacular textures, ranging from isolated equant orthopyroxene oikocrysts within olivine-rich heteradcumulate harzburgites to rocks composed entirely of interlocking centimetre-sized anhedral orthopyroxene oikocrysts containing sharply bounded idiomorphic Cr-enriched cores. The <b>poikilitic</b> harzburgites are interlayered with cumulate pyroxenites in which orthopyroxene grains show a variety of zoning patterns: Cr-rich cores {{similar to those in}} the oikocrysts; sharply bounded oscillatory zoned cores; and reverse zoning with Cr-poor cores and Cr-enriched rims. A further variation is the presence of a mingled harzburgite lithology in which dunite or <b>poikilitic</b> harzburgite is invaded on a centimetre scale by diffuse vein networks or patches of coarse orthopyroxenite. This range of textures and lithologies attests to a more complex set of processes than implied by the standard cumulus theory model in which oikocrysts are considered to have crystallized from intercumulus liquid within a permeable crystal mush. A range of hypotheses is proposed, including infiltration metasomatism of original olivine cumulates by migrating orthopyroxene-saturated pore fluid; however, the textural relationships, whole-rock chemistry and Cr zoning within the grains can best be explained by a model in which the orthopyroxene oikocrysts form in part or whole as mechanically accumulated cumulus grains. The complexity of zoning patterns is attributed to stirring of entrained olivine and orthopyroxene crystals within a heterogeneous flowing crystal mush, where the transporting magma has a wide range of silica contents owing to poorly stirred incorporation of siliceous country-rock material. The Cr-rich orthopyroxenite component grew from Sienriched chromite-saturated magma. Mingled lithologies developed after accumulation as a result of percolation and infiltration metasomatism by Si-enriched liquid derived by melting of xenoliths within the crystal pile. The model may be more generally applicable: dunite-harzburgite cycles, common in many layered intrusions, may reflect variable degrees of contamination rather than cycles of fractional crystallization and replenishment...|$|E

In particular, extreme variations in incompatible element abundances, and fractionation of Zr and Y (and REE's), from the core to rim of clinopyroxene crystals occurs. It is proposed that the fractionation of the interstitial melt was caused by reaction between migration interstitial melt and the crystal assemblage (magmatic metasomatism).

These oxide bodies, irregular in shape, at approximately {{right angles to}} the regional layering and of considerable size (up to an estimated 50 t each), {{are mainly composed of}} vanadium-bearing titanian maghemite, as large equant grains forming a polygonal texture, <b>poikilitic</b> ilmenite and accessory amounts of maghemite. No Fe 2 + was detected by Mössbauer spectroscopy in either maghemite and titanian maghemite. Strongly weathered samples show hematit...|$|E
40|$|Clasts in breccia sample 67955 contain {{relatively}} coarse olivine and plagioclase in part enveloped by <b>poikilitic</b> hypersthene and diopside. This distinctive texture is concluded {{to result}} from high temperature crystallization {{in the presence of}} a fluid phase, probably a silicate melt. A problem posed by this rock is whether the bulk chemistry, characterized by a high Mg/Fe ratio but low total Fe + Mg, is the result of primary igneous processes on the moon or whether it is the residual end product of a multiple distillation process resulting from repeated meteorite impacts...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{experiments}} on the nucleation {{and growth of}} plagioclase from an igneous melt are carried out to characterize the magma prior to cooling. It is shown {{that the nature of}} the melt directly preceding cooling has a strong effect on texture development, regardless of the origin of the melt. The number, size, and shape of the crystals present in a melt upon extrusion can have a drastic effect on the final textures present in the resulting rocks. Conditions necessary for the formation of <b>poikilitic,</b> intersertal, and porphyritic textures in basaltic rocks are defined...|$|E
40|$|Three intermingled lithologies are {{identified}} in the Shaw L-group chondrite: a light-colored lithology with a <b>poikilitic</b> texture, consisting of olivine and augite crystals surrounded by larger orthopyroxene grains; a dark-colored lithology containing remnant chondrules and exhibiting a microgranular texture; and a gray lithology {{which appears to be}} intermediate between the other two. Contrary to published opinions, the Shaw meteorite contains normal L-group chondrite abundances of metal and troilite, though these phases are irregularly distributed. The lithological analyses suggest that 4. 52 Byr ago an impact took place on the L-group chondrite parent object of Shaw...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} crystal chemical {{study of}} clinopyroxenes (cpx) from {{a suite of}} mantle xenoliths of the Balaton–Bakony volcanic highland (Carpathian–Pannonian region (CPR), Hungary) has been undertaken by means of X-ray single-crystal diffraction and electron microprobe. The study aims to evaluate the response of cpx crystal chemistry to textural changes and increasing deformation, and to estimate equilibrium pressure conditions of texturally heterogeneous spinel-peridotite xenolith series. Moreover, our interest also focussed on cpx crystal chemistry of mosaic and <b>poikilitic</b> textured xenoliths. Results demonstrate that cpx from protogranular, porphyroclastic and some equigranular xenoliths define the ‘‘primary’’ compositional trend that reflects structural and textural changes. This cpx-trend also suggests that deformation increase correlates with pressure (and temperature) decrease. Protogranular xenoliths record pressure near to the garnet stability field whereas equigranular xenoliths record lower pressure approaching the plagioclase stability field. Some cpx from equigranular samples show a crystal chemistry {{similar to that of}} cpx from <b>poikilitic</b> and mosaic xenoliths which depart from the ‘‘primary’’ trend. This suggests that the latter cpx are likely formed at low pressure near to or within the plagioclase stability field. The inverse relationship between pressure and deformation in the main series can be explained geodynamically by the presence of a mantle diapir beneath the region, which could have caused significant deformation and lithosphere thinning in the centre of the CPR...|$|E
