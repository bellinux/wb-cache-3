For first section, the effect of sucrose solution concentration (50, 60, and 70 oBrix) on osmotic rate and moisture content of osmotic dehydrated <b>pomelo</b> were evaluated. After that, the effects of drying temperature (50, 65, and 80 oC) on quality of osmotic dehydrated <b>pomelo</b> including, odor, texture, taste, and color were determined. The experimental {{results showed that the}} osmotic dehydration rate of <b>pomelo</b> were 6. 4, 9. 4, and 9. 6 oBrix/hr when the <b>pomelo</b> was immersed in 50, 60, and 70 oBrix sucrose solutions, respectively.

500|$|Almost 71% of the {{population}} of Madras Presidency was engaged in agriculture with the agricultural year usually commencing on 1 July. Crops cultivated in the Madras Presidency included cereals such as rice, corn, kambhu (Indian millet) and ragi as well as vegetables including brinjal, sweet potato, ladies' fingers, beans, onions, garlic and spices such as chilli, pepper and ginger along with vegetable oils made from castor beans and peanuts. Fruits cultivated included lime, banana jackfruit, cashew nuts, mangos, custard apples and papayas. In addition, cabbages, cauliflowers, <b>pomelos,</b> peaches, betel pepper, niger seed and millet were introduced from Asia, Africa or Europe, while grapes were introduced from Australia. The total cultivated area used for food crops was 80% and for cash crops, 15%. Of the gross area, rice occupied 26.4 percent; kambhu, 10 percent; ragi, 5.4 percent and Cholam, 13.8 percent. Cotton occupied , oilseeds, 2.08 million, spices,0.4 million and indigo, 0.2 million.

40|$|Chronic {{hyperglycemia}} induces non-enzymatic protein glycation, {{which plays}} an important role in the development of diabetic complications. Immense efforts have been made to determine effective antiglycation compounds from natural products. <b>Pomelo</b> has shown beneficial effects for human health. The objective of this study was to determine the antiglycation effect of <b>pomelo</b> extract against fructose-mediated protein oxidation and glycation. Our results showed that the <b>pomelo</b> extract (0. 25 - 2. 00 mg/mL) significantly inhibited the overall formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in a concentration-dependent manner. The <b>pomelo</b> extract markedly decreased the level of fructosamine, which is directly associated with reduction in formation of AGEs and Nε -(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML). In addition, the <b>pomelo</b> extract inhibited protein oxidation through its ability to prevent the loss of thiol groups and reduced protein carbonyl formation. We characterized the active components in the <b>pomelo</b> extract by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which showed that the <b>pomelo</b> extract contained naringin (11. 90 ± 0. 21 mg/g dried extract), hesperidin (12. 04 ± 0. 12 mg/g dried extract), neohesperidin (25. 4 ± 0. 12 mg/g dried extract), and naringenin (9. 20 ± 0. 19 mg/g dried extract).

40|$|For {{development}} of eco-friendly packaging foam from <b>pomelo</b> peel, physical and mechanical {{properties of the}} <b>pomelo</b> peel and effects of <b>pomelo</b> varieties, namely Kao-Nampueng, Thong-Dee, and Kao-Pan, on their properties were investigated. It {{was found that the}} <b>pomelo</b> variety showed somewhat significant effect on physical and mechanical of <b>pomelo</b> peel properties. Because of its thick peel with high moisture content (75 - 80 %) and water activity (0. 90 - 0. 98), the peel weight accounted for almost half of the total fruit weight. Cell structure and pore size of the peel were examined using the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The result showed an open cell foam structure with pore size of approximately 151 ± 31 µm. The pore size was more open and large towards the outer surface. Uniaxial compression tests on <b>pomelo</b> peel samples with and without flavedo showed good reproducible stress-strain curves despite its biological variation. Young’s moduli of both samples were calculated to be 200 - 300 kPa and 110 - 210 kPa, respectively. Moreover, the most important property of packaging foam is the ability to absorb energy during impact which can be characterised through the measurement of the onset strain of densification. It was found that the strain values at the maximum energy absorption efficiency (εcd) of peel samples with and without flavedo for all studied <b>pomelo</b> varieties were comparable and were approximately in the range of 60 - 65 %. These preliminary results indicate very promising mechanical properties of <b>pomelo</b> peel as eco-friendly packaging foam although further modifications are required to improve their physical and shelf-stability properties...|$|R
