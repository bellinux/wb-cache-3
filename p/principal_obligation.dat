5000|$|The most {{prolific}} ground of discharge of a guarantor usually {{arises from the}} creditor's conduct. The governing principle {{is that if the}} creditor violates any rights which the surety possessed when he entered into the suretyship, even though the damage is only nominal, the guarantee cannot be enforced. The surety's discharge may be accomplished (1) by a variation of the terms of the contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, or of that between the creditor and the surety; (2) by the creditor taking a new security from the principal debtor in lieu of the original one; (3) by the creditor discharging the principal debtor from liability; (4) by the creditor binding himself to give time to the principal debtor for payment of the guaranteed debt; or (5) by loss of securities received by the creditor in respect of the guaranteed debt. The first four of these acts are collectively termed a novation. In general whatever extinguishes the <b>principal</b> <b>obligation</b> necessarily determines that of the surety, not only in England but elsewhere. [...] By most civil codes the surety is discharged by conduct of the creditor inconsistent with the surety's rights, although the rule prevailing in England, Scotland, America and India which releases the surety from liability when the creditor extends without the surety's consent the time for fulfilling the <b>principal</b> <b>obligation,</b> while recognized by two existing codes civil, is rejected by the majority of them. A revocation of the contract of suretyship by act of the parties, or in certain cases by the death of the surety, may also operate to discharge the surety.|$|E

50|$|In English law, a {{guarantee}} is {{a contract to}} answer for the payment of some debt, or the performance of some duty by a third person who is primarily liable for that payment or performance. It is a collateral contract, which does not extinguish the original obligation for payment or performance. It is rendered null and void if the original obligation fails.

40|$|Roberto Ago, the International Law Commission’s second Special Rapporteur on {{the topic}} of state {{responsibility}} for internationally wrongful acts, defined self-defence as a faculté of a state to use force in response to an act of another state through which a breach of the <b>principal</b> <b>obligation</b> under Article 2 (4) Charter is committed. On this basis, he then inserted a provision in Chapter V to Part One of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility expressing self-defence as a specific factual circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the use of force which constitutes a response to state aggression. This conception of self-defence, although misunderstood from the onset, remained in the backdrop of the study of the law of state responsibility for a considerable period. It was only dismantled during the reign of the last Special Rapporteur {{on the topic}} of state responsibility, James Crawford. The last Rapporteur, at the onset, submitted {{that it is not the}} function of the Draft Articles to specify the content of the primary rules, including that referred to in Article 51 Charter. He then redefined the function of the circumstance of self-defence as that of precluding the wrongfulness of non-performance of certain obligations other than the general prohibition insofar as such non-performance is connected with the exercise of the right under Article 51 Charter. This contribution first scrutinises this paradigmatic shift and finds it to be symptomatic of the conviction on the part of Crawford that the notion of self-defence could also encompass the use of force against speculative threats of state origin as well as actual threats that emanate from individuals or groups which are disconnected from the organisation of any state. It then uses this finding as a springboard towards the examination of the controversy surrounding the notion of self-defence under international law. In that connection, it first outlines the findings of the World Court on the requirements of armed attack and attribution and describes the points of criticism which those findings have elicited. Next, it argues that state practice is unable to settle the controversy concerning the scope of the concept of self-defence and that the question whether or not valid invocation of Article 51 Charter must be preceded by a state’s breach of the general prohibition can be conclusively answered only as part of efforts geared to devising an explanatory account of self-defence which accurately translates its normative origins and which preserves its logical relations with the other, more ordinary but fundamental legal concepts. The study’s conclusion is that respect for such criteria demands that the notion of self-defence under international law be defined in line with Ago’s proposition, i. e. in terms of a de facto situation, recognised by a secondary rule, whereby the <b>principal</b> <b>obligation</b> under the primary rule contained in Article 2 (4) Charter is pushed into abeyance to the detriment of a state which conducts itself in breach of that very same obligation in respect of another state; or, correlatively, in terms of a factual circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the use of force which constitutes a riposte to an unlawful armed attack of another state...|$|E
40|$|Is {{corporate}} leverage excessive? Is the {{tax code}} distorting corporate capital structure decisions {{in a way that}} increases the possibility of an economic crisis owing to "financial instability"? Answering these kinds of questions first requires some precision in terminology. In this paper, we describe the cases for and against the trend toward high leverage, and evaluate the role played by taxation. While provision of proper incentives to managers may in part underlie the trend to the debt, high leverage may in practice be a blunt way to address the problem, and one which opens up the possibility for undue exposure to the risks of financial distress. Our story takes as given the kinds of managerial incentive problems deemed important by advocates of leverage. We maintain, however, that when a firm is subject to business-cycle risk as well as individual risk, a profit maximizing arrangement is not simple debt, but rather a contract with mixed debt and equity features. That is, the contract should index the <b>principal</b> <b>obligation</b> to aggregate and/or industry-level economic conditions. We argue that the tax system encourages corporations to absorb more business cycle risk than they would otherwise. It does so in two respects: First, it provides a relative subsidy to debt finance; second, it restricts debt for tax purposes from indexing the principal to common disturbances. At a deeper level, the issue hinges on the institutional aspects of debt renegotiation. If renegotiation were costless, then debt implicitly would have the equity features relevant for responding to business-cycle risk. However, because of the diffuse ownership pattern of much of the newly issued debt and also because of certain legal restrictions, renegotiation {{is likely to be a}} costly activity. ...|$|E

40|$|LL. M. (International Law) The after-effects of the Second World War (WWII) and the Cold War that {{followed}} engendered a radical paradigm {{shift in the}} collective accountability for international crimes. Indeed, institutions have been established {{to take stock of}} the catastrophic effects of wars and enable states {{to come to terms with}} their confrontational past. The Nuremberg and Tokyo trials mainly focused on reigning in military leaders who perpetrated mass killings. These trials laid the foundation for a reconfiguration of the international criminal justice. This study argues that the complementarity principle in the classical sense and the prosecutorial strategy of the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of only bringing to justice high-level perpetrators effectively creates an impunity gap if states are unwilling and unable to prosecute. Therefore, positive complementarity becomes necessary for the ICC to encourage states to prosecute both high and low-level perpetrators. In an endeavour to achieve this, TJ mechanisms become necessary as they provide a holistic approach, i. e. involvement of victims, provision of reparations and prosecution of offenders. The statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome statute) is said to have a so-called “catalysing effect” on domestic criminal justice systems by some authors mainly because the <b>principal</b> <b>obligation</b> to investigate and prosecute international crimes is entrusted to the domestic criminal justice systems. The ICC may exercise its prerogative over a case only if the states have not genuinely investigated or prosecuted the perpetrator. However, the catalysing effect of the complementarity principle can be discordant with transitional justice (TJ) mechanisms in post-conflict societies where justice might have to be compromised over peace and vice versa. This has been observed where measures such as amnesty, the use of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs), and pardons have been solicited by rebels or de facto holders of power, such as military chiefs, as a way of evading accountability...|$|E
40|$|Suretyships {{given in}} favour of banks are being {{challenged}} in the courts {{on the basis of}} equitable doctrines of unconscionable conduct, undue influence, or statutory provisions dealing with unfair conduct or unfair contract terms. This thesis is an enquiry into a bank's duties of disclosure or advice to an intending surety. Such an investigation also necessitates a study of the relationship between banker and customer, as the surety is quite often a customer of the bank as well, and, as a surety's obligation to the bank is an accessory obligation, the obligation is dependent on a valid <b>principal</b> <b>obligation</b> between the bank and the principal debtor - the customer. The face of modern banking has, however, changed dramatically and most major banks have become multi-functional. As a result, the banker-customer relationship may often be seen as a fiduciary relationship. A major problem brought about my multi-functioning banks is that of conflicts of interest between the bank and its customer. Furthermore, the banker-customer relationship is providing much more scope for lender liability than in the past. Various factors are currently having an impact on the law of contract, and this is expected to affect the legal policy makers in their assessments of whether a duty of disclosure of material facts exits or not. A surety has long been a favoured debtor {{in the eyes of the}} law, and the courts have developed a plethora of technical principles on which a surety can be relieved of his obligation. The escape routes of the surety, especially if he is a consumer as well, on the new grounds of public policy, unconscionability, good faith or unreasonableness, are growing. The results of these trends is the expected demise of suretyship as an acceptable, cheap form of debt security in the banking sector. JurisprudenceLL. D...|$|E

40|$|The {{office of}} Pastor of a parish is an ecclesial {{institute}} constituted by the Church {{to be at}} the service of its threefold mission of teaching, sanctifying and ruling under the leadership of the diocesan bishop. As an institute created by positive law, this office has obligations and rights proper to it. Therefore, as a holder of this office, a pastor. of a parish is the subject of these obligations and rights. And these obligations and rights are to be properly understood and diligently exercised {{for the good of the}} Church and for the salvation of souls. Through its new theological insights, the Second Vatican Council ushered in significant changes in the understanding of the nature and scope of this office. The 1983 Code of Canon Law tried to translate those insights and changes into legal language in the revised legislation on the pastor of a parish. The Council described the parish in terms of a Eucharistic community, which, in communion with the Universal Church, in a special way makes Christ's Church present at a particular time and place through the shared faith of its members, clergy and laity together, its liturgical, catechetical charitable and social activities. It is at the level of a parish that the universal Church finds its concrete realization. And its pastor plays an important role in its life and activity. The object of this study, therefore, are the obligations and rights which the 1983 Code attributes to the office of pastor of a parish. There are several canons in the 1983 Code which express obligations and rights, explicitly in some instances and implicitly in others. The <b>principal</b> <b>obligation</b> of a pastor of a parish is to serve the faithful by leading the teaching, sanctifying and administrative activities of the faith community. Most of the rights attached to the office of a pastor are those which enable the pastor usefully and faithfully to fulfil the obligations entailed in his leadership role. Readily acknowledging that the pastor's obligations are so extensive that he will need various kinds of assistance, both the Second Vatican Council and the 1983 Code stipulate that other members of the parish community, clergy and laity together, are to cooperate with the pastor and to provide such help as the pastor needs. This principle implies that the ecclesial dimensions of the office of pastor of a parish cannot be totally circumscribed by a mere listing of the obligations and rights either explicitly or implicitly stated in the positive legislation. As an ecclesial institute, this office by its very nature demands that it be exercised in collaboration with all the members of a parish community...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Increased capital requirements and reduced profit margins have restricted farmers' borrowing and repayment capabilities. Many states have initiated beginning farmer financial assistance programs targeted towards potential farmers having difficulty obtaining debt capital from traditional sources. Such programs provide easier access to credit for beginning farmers through lower-cost credit and reduced <b>principal</b> <b>obligations.</b> The primary objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effects of beginning farmer operating loan financing versus conventional lending on Brazos and Jackson County farm operations. Measures used to evaluate the financial performance of the various scenarios include: expected ending equity position, variability of ending equity position, expected profitability, variation of expected profitability, loan performance, and probability of failure. FmHA's special beginning farmer operating loan is chosen to evaluate beginning farmer financing since it incorporates common characteristics of the state programs and is applicable to Texas farmers. The main differences between FMHA and conventional financing are lower interest costs and the availability of funds. The recursive, whole-farm, simulation model, ARFSIM, is selected for use in the study. The results indicate that FMHA financing benefit both the Brazos and Jackson County operations by improving availability of credit and reducing interest expense, thus allowing them to achieve higher net income levels, ending net worth levels, credit scores and greater probability of survival. Two sensitivity analyses are also performed. When the operations are supported with non-farm income, chances of survival are increased and overall performance improves. There are only slight differences between FMHA and conventional financing results under this scenario. When the farms incur a decrease in the overall level of prices, their chances of survival greatly decrease making it difficult for the operations to be profitable under either financing option. The use of FMHA financing results in better financial performance and chances of survival than with conventional financing. However, decreases in agricultural commodity price levels may reduce profit margins to a level that limits the sustainability of new entrants in production agriculture regardless of financing alternatives...|$|R
