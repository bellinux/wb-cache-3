40|$|Glutamate is {{the major}} {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. Its rapid clearance after the release into the synaptic cleft is vital {{in order to avoid}} toxic effects and is ensured by several transmembrane transport proteins, so-called excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). Impairment of glutamate removal has been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases and EAATs have therefore received increased attention as therapeutic targets. O-benzylated L-threo-β-hydroxyaspartate derivatives have been developed previously as highly potent inhibitors of EAATs with TFB-TBOA ((2 S, 3 S) - 2 -amino- 3 -((3 -(4 -(trifluoromethyl) benzamido) benzyl) oxy) succinic acid) standing out as low-nanomolar inhibitor. We report the stereoselective synthesis of all four stereoisomers of TFB-TBOA in less than a fifth of synthetic steps than the <b>published</b> <b>route.</b> For the first time, the inhibitory activity and isoform selectivity of these TFB-TBOA enantio- and diastereomers were assessed on human glutamate transporters EAAT 1 - 3.

40|$|As the air {{transportation}} system moves toward trajectory-based operations, {{there is a}} greater need for route modeling, especially in the terminal airspace where traffic flows twist and turn and many do not follow any currently <b>published</b> <b>route.</b> This paper presents a graph-based algorithmic method for defining nominal terminal routing from historical flight tracks. First historical traffic is used to generate a directed graph. Then Djikstra’s shortest path algorithm is used to identify the shortest yet most commonly used paths through the graph. There were many different nominal routes between different engine types due to the distinct differences in engine performance characteristics. A comparison of graph-based shortest path routes to two other methods (manual and k-means) showed how the method could rapidly produce similar distinct dominant terminal area flows. Finding shortest paths from all links of a sufficient weight, rather than just source nodes, identified more route options depicting standard path control techniques in addition to the dominant route. This method may be used to rapidly prototype route models to assess trajectory-based terminal area concepts...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) has received great attention {{as a potential}} drug target {{for the prevention of}} the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. The beneficial biological effects of PPARδ activation are well established, and increases in the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and reverse cholesterol transport, as well as a decrease in plasma glucose. However, much remains to be discovered, and to date, there are no drugs on the market targeting this receptor. Due to the beneficial effects of PPARδ activation, it is also of interest to investigate the effects of PPARδ antagonism, in order to further elucidate the biological role of PPARδ. This thesis therefore focused on the development of new high-affinity PPARδ antagonists. In total, eleven compounds were prepared using GSK 3787, a selective PPARδ antagonist, as the lead compound. The first-generation analogues, 7 - 16, were synthesized partly by a <b>published</b> <b>route.</b> An efficient approach was developed for the synthesis of the second-generation analogue 23.

The key stereoselective synthesis of beta-amino acid derivatives (7) was achieved by the Arndt-Eistert homologation reaction [2, 3] and Wolff rearrangement reaction [4] The synthetic route towards beta-amino methyl ester (7) was developed from N-(carbobenzyloxy) -L-lysine (3), which was prepared from L-lysine according to the followed scheme 1. This was subjected to diazotization {{in the presence of}} acetic to afford acetyl derivative (4) by a <b>published</b> <b>route</b> [5]. According to the Arndt-Eistert homologation reaction [2, 3], the carboxylic acid in (4) was converted into the mixed anhydride with triethylamine and isobutyl chloroformate, and then exposed to diazomethane [6] to yield alpha-amino diazoketone (5). A Wolff rearrangement[4 = 24] of the diazoketone (5) {{in the presence of the}} methanol was catalyzed by silver benzoate, gining the homologated ester (6) in 70 % yield.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{carried out}} on the synthesis of novel 5 - and 11 -substituted ellipticines and derivatives of the ellipticine analogues, isoellipticine and deazaellipticine, followed by investigation of their potential as anti-cancer agents. Preparation of the key 5 - and 11 -substituted ellipticine targets involved the development of regiospecific, sequential alkylation reactions with alkenyllithium and Grignard reagents. Investigation of these novel reactions resulted in a new route towards 5 -substituted ellipticines via Grignard reaction with vinylmagnesium bromide. These novel 5 -vinylellipticine derivatives were further functionalised in an ozonolysis reaction, followed by oxidation to give a range of novel 5 -substituted ellipticines. Less success was encountered in the 11 -substituted ellipticine series, however preparation of these derivatives using a previously <b>published</b> <b>route</b> was accomplished, and the resulting 11 -formylellipticine was further derivatised to give a panel of novel 9 - and 11 -substituted ellipticines, incorporating amide, carboxylate, imine and amine functionality. The successful route towards 5 -substituted ellipticines {{was applied to the}} preparation of a range of novel 11 -substituted isoellipticines and 6 -substituted deazaellipticines, the first time substantial synthesis has been undertaken with these analogues. In addition to this, the first preparation of isoellipticinium salts is described, and a panel of novel isoellipticinium, 7 formylisoellipticinium and 7 -hydroxyisoellipticinium salts were synthesised in good yields. Biological evaluation of a panel of 43 novel ellipticine, isoellipticine and deazaellipticine derivatives was accomplished with a topoisomerase II decatenation assay and submission to the NCI 60 -cell line screen. Four novel isoellipticine topoisomerase II inhibitors were identified from the decatenation assay, with strong activity at 10 μM. In addition to this, NCI screening identified five highly cytotoxic ellipticine and isoellipticine compounds with remarkable selectivity profiles for different cancer types. These novel lead compounds represent new templates for further research and synthesis...|$|E

TAVR represents an alternative to surgical valve replacement in high-risk patients. Whereas the transfemoral access route is used commonly as the first-line approach, transapical access is an option for patients not suitable for transfemoral treatment mainly due to anatomic conditions. TAo-TAVR {{has been shown to be}} a viable alternative surgical access route; however, only limited data on its effectiveness and safety has been <b>published.</b> <b>ROUTE</b> is a multicenter, international, prospective, observational registry; data were collected from 18 centers across Europe starting in February 2013. Patients having severe calcific aortic stenosis were documented if they were scheduled to undergo TAo-TAVR using an Edwards SAPIEN XT or a SAPIEN 3 valve. The primary endpoint was 30 -day mortality. Secondary endpoints were intraprocedural or in hospital and 30 -day complication rates. A total of 301 patients with a mean age of 81. 7 ± 5. 9 years and an Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 9. 0 ± 7. 6 % were included. Valve success was documented in 96. 7 %. The 30 -day mortality was 6. 1 % (18 / 293) (procedure-related mortality: 3. 1 %; 9 of 293).

40|$|The first enantioselective, {{catalytic}} vinylogous Mukaiyama-Michael {{reaction of}} siloxyfurans with simple alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes {{has been reported}} using chiral imidazolidinones. This methodology provides access to enantioenriched gamma-butenolides, a privileged motif in organic synthesis. The utility of this organocatalytic Mukaiyama-Michael reaction was highlighted by the total syntheses of ( [...] ) -spiculisporic acid and ( [...] ) - 5 -epi-spiculisporic acid. Investigations into the total syntheses of cylindrocyclophanes A and F necessitated {{the development of a}} novel B-alkyl Suzuki cross-coupling of trimethylanilinium salts using a nickel(0) catalyst and bulky phosphine ligand. This methodology study revealed a very competitive nickel-catalyzed demethylation pathway, which produced dimethylaniline byproducts. A possible explanation for this side reaction is discussed. This technology was applied to a dimerization strategy for the C 2 -symmetric cylindrocyclophane F. Synthesis of a dimerization precursor included an enantioselective organocatalytic 1, 4 -addition of 3, 5 -dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylaniline into an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. However, the B-alkyl Suzuki cross-coupling was unsuccessful in promoting a dimerization. Next, the synthesis of cylindrocyclophane A was explored using an alternative ring-closing metathesis dimerization strategy. A dimerization precursor was to be assembled via the cross-coupling of trimethylanilinium salts with potassium (vinyl) trifluoroborate salts, whose syntheses featured an organocatalytic 1, 4 -conjugate reduction of a beta,beta-disubstituted enal. This cross-coupling strategy revealed olefin isomerization as a major side-reaction in the nickel-catalyzed Suzuki dimerization, making this route a non-productive approach to the natural product. Lastly, formal synthesis of cylindrocyclophane A was accomplished using (i) a nickel-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling of an activated vinyl stannane with a judiciously chosen trimethylanilinium salt and (ii) an asymmetric palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation of an acyclic ketone. The latter represents the first example of application of the Pd 2 (dba) 3 /t-Bu-PHOX catalyst system to effect an asymmetric allylic alkylation on an acyclic system with good stereoselectivity. This route constituted a formal synthesis of cyclindrocyclophane A in eight linear steps, making it more efficient than the <b>published</b> <b>route</b> to the same advanced intermediate reported by Smith, which was synthesized in eleven steps...|$|E
