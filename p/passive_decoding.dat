40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the optical packet switched network (OPSnet) project, which investigated the design of an asynchronous optical packet switch suitable for the core of an optical transport network (OTN). The requirements for the switch were to control and route variable-length packets transmitted at bit rates beyond 100 Gbit/s. The subsystems and techniques used are analyzed and presented. Fast header encoding and <b>passive</b> <b>decoding</b> is based on the differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) method. The dual-pump four-wave mixing (d-p FWM) wavelength-conversion technique, in combination with an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG), is utilized for packet switching. An advanced and fully controllable mechanism for the packet-switch control is presented, which is implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. The control wavelength is generated using a tunable laser, the actual wavelength and new header values are provided utilizing fast header recognition and look-up tables. The integration of the subsystems is discussed, and the results of a four-output port asynchronous packet-switch demonstrator operating at 40 Gbit/s are presented. Finally, the switch limitations are examined and design issues are discussed. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporally}} encoded {{information obtained}} by vibrissal touch could be decoded “passively,” involving only input-driven elements, or “actively,” utilizing intrinsically driven oscillators. A previous study {{suggested that the}} trigeminal somatosensory system of rats does not obey the bottom-up order of activation predicted by <b>passive</b> <b>decoding.</b> Thus, we have tested whether this system obeys the predictions of active decoding. We have studied cortical single units in the somatosensory cortices of anesthetized rats and guinea pigs and found that {{about a quarter of}} them exhibit clear spontaneous oscillations, many of them around whisking frequencies (≈ 10 Hz). The frequencies of these oscillations could be controlled locally by glutamate. These oscillations could be forced to track the frequency of induced rhythmic whisker movements at a stable, frequency-dependent, phase difference. During these stimulations, the response intensities of multiunits at the thalamic recipient layers of the cortex decreased, and their latencies increased, with increasing input frequency. These observations are consistent with thalamocortical loops implementing phase-locked loops, circuits that are most efficient in decoding temporally encoded information like that obtained by active vibrissal touch. According to this model, and consistent with our results, populations of thalamic “relay” neurons function as phase “comparators” that compare cortical timing expectations with the actual input timing and represent the difference by their population output rate...|$|E

Working to diminish this deficit became the impetus behind the development of this intervention program. The purpose of this project was to design a supplemental expository reading comprehension program that would strengthen the metacognition of second language learners. My hypothesis is that when English language learners receive small group explicit strategy instruction, they will be more successful with the state standardized reading assessments. The main goal of the program was to cause the participants to utilize knowledge of the text features and structures to enhance their comprehension of content area reading. The secondary goal was to support students' thinking processes while they read. In other words, it was important to show, through the use of graphic organizers and social discourse, that reading is an active process, not merely a process of <b>passive</b> <b>decoding.</b> The five-week Tier Two reading intervention program provides a teacher's manual with text suggestions for appropriate materials, thirty minute strategy instruction lessons, and suggested graphic organizers useful in the scaffolding of metacognitive comprehension strategies. The format of the lesson plans include the identified expository comprehension strategies, a recommended time frame for each section, suggested teacher talk, and literacy activities. The design of the lesson plans is to allow pull-out teachers to use them during supplementary instruction time. Results of a pilot use of this intervention program with fom 1 h graders who were all English language leaners, found that additional explicit strategy instruction can positively impact the expository comprehension of second language leaners...|$|E
50|$|DeepProbe is an {{intelligent}} <b>passive</b> full <b>decoding</b> probe, {{often used in}} distributed surveillance environments, which are typically large, complex networks, or networks requiring significant application-level monitoring. Examples of such networks would be nationwide surveillance solutions with probes installed at the key service providers and gateways, critical, secure government networks, or large communications service providers. DeepProbe functions as a passive monitoring system, generally {{under the control of}} a separate surveillance element such as a mediation system or a Security Information and Event Management system.|$|R
50|$|All {{communication}} {{depends on}} the use of codes. When the message is received, the addressee is not <b>passive,</b> but <b>decoding</b> is more than simply recognising the content of the message. Over time, each individual in the audience develops a cognitive framework of codes which will recall the denotative meaning and suggest possible connotative meanings for each signifier. But the actual meaning for each message is context-dependent: the codified relations between the signifiers in the particular context must be interpreted according to the syntactic, semantic and social codes so that the most appropriate meaning is attributed (for labelling usages by reference to national characteristics, see Americanism).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} issues {{associated}} with the real-time implementation of upmixing stereo audio into 5. 1 channel audio {{in order to improve}} audio realism. First, we review four different upmixing methods, including a <b>passive</b> surround <b>decoding</b> method, a least-meansquare based upmixing method, a principal component analysis based upmixing method, and an adaptive panning method. After that, we implement a simulator that includes the upmixing methods and audio controls to play both stereo and upmixed 5. 1 channel audio signals. Finally, we carry out a MUSHRA test to compare the quality of the upmixed 5. 1 channel audio signals to that of the original stereo audio signal. It is shown from the test that the upmixed 5. 1 channel audio signals generated by the four different upmixing methods are preferred to the original stereo audio signals...|$|R
40|$|Many {{lines of}} {{evidence}} indicate that considering visual perception as a <b>passive,</b> stimulusdriven, feedforward <b>decoding</b> process {{is no longer}} tenable. Visual perception naturally occurs {{within the context of}} an integrated array of ongoing cognitive processes involving memory, perception in other modalities, and motor control. In many situations, these processes allow expectations to be formed for likely visual events. This article explores the idea that the formation of visual expectations involves the active organization of visual cortical areas, providing a framework of contextual information within which expected events are interpreted. Retinal inputs are treated as constraints that feed into a complex system of interacting visual cortical areas and thalamic nuclei, which are concurrently imposing constraints on one another. Although the nature of expectational organization in the visua...|$|R

Specifically it looks at the affordances the iPad offered to enhance the oral-aural-visual communication of children not yet fluent in print based literacies. The children were interviewed about their techno-literacy learning and observed as they engaged with applications (apps). The researchers were able to video them as they demonstrated high levels of interest, energised learning and a range of independently acquired techno- literacy skills. There is as yet little research {{on the use of}} portable personal computing devices such as the iPad in early years’ classrooms. The children in this study are shown as capable and articulate regarding their iPad use. Beyond the traditionally conceived struggle with <b>passive</b> print <b>decoding</b> when using iPads they become active creators of sophisticated multimodal artefacts that they consider worthy of acclaim, “I’m really proud of myself. ” Findings from this study suggest the visual/listening nexus of popular apps potentially challenges print based literacy education approaches and existing paradigms of research and teaching/learning practice in Australian early years’ literacy education...|$|R
