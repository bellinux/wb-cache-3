The flurocarbon treatment makes the surface of fabric hydrophilic due to etching of fabric by deposition of a flurocarbon monomer following ion activation of surface sites. The polymer surface layer is the main inhibitor for developing repellency in nature. The present results are comparable with those of Rajpreet et al. (2004) who also performed hydrostatic resistance of flurocarbon treated nonwoven. Plasma treated nonwoven fabric is showing better hydrostatic resistance than untreated.|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} a classification scheme for stochastic acceleration models involving low-frequency plasma turbulence in a strongly magnetized <b>plasma.</b> This <b>classification</b> {{takes into account}} both {{the properties of the}} accelerating electromagnetic field, {{and the nature of the}} transport of charged particles in the acceleration region. We group the acceleration processes as either resonant, non-resonant or resonant-broadened, depending on whether the particle motion is free-streaming along the magnetic field, diffusive or a combination of the two. Stochastic acceleration by moving magnetic mirrors and adiabatic compressions are addressed as illustrative examples. We obtain expressions for the momentum-dependent diffusion coefficient D(p), both for general forms of the accelerating force and for the situation when the electromagnetic force is wave-like, with a specified dispersion relation ω=ω(k). Finally, for models considered, we calculate the energy-dependent acceleration time, a quantity that can be directly compared with observations of the time profile of the radiation field produced by the accelerated particles, such as during solar flares.

40|$|Since the {{classical}} studies of Grosser 1 " {{the classification of}} mammalian placental types has been based upon the number of tissue layers separating the maternal vascular system from the fetal vessels and across which the diffusable materials essential to intrauterine development must move from the maternal to the fetal <b>plasma.</b> Grosser's <b>classification</b> {{is based on the}} concepts: (i) that in phylogeny as in ontogeny the simplest or primary stage in placentation is one in which the barrier consists of the following intervening structures-the maternal vascular endothelium, the maternal connective tissue, the maternal epithelium, the cavity of the uterus, the chorionic epithelium, chorionic connective tissue and endothelium; and (ii) that the phylogenetic development of the placenta involved the destruction of the tissue layers separating the maternal blood from the uterine cavity one after another as in implantation during ontogeny.

40|$|In this paper, {{different}} {{pattern recognition}} techniques {{have been tested}} in order to implement an automatic tool for disruption classification in a tokamak experiment. The methods considered refer to clustering and classification techniques. In particular, the investigated clustering techniques are self-organizing maps and K-means, while the classification techniques are multi-layer perceptrons, support vector machines, and k- nearest neighbours. Training and testing data have been collected selecting suitable diagnostic signals recorded over 4 years of EFDA-JET experiments. Multi-layer perceptron classifiers exhibited the best performance in classifying mode lock, density limit/high radiated power, H-mode/L-mode transition and internal transport barrier <b>plasma</b> disruptions. This <b>classification</b> performance can be increased using multiple classifiers. In particular the outputs of five multi-layer perceptron classifiers have been combined using multiple classifier techniques {{in order to obtain}} a more robust and reliable classification tool, that is presently implemented at JET...|$|R
40|$|The acidic alpha-D-mannosidase {{in human}} plasma closely resembles liver acidic alpha-D-mannosidase in its {{affinity}} for concanavalin A-Sepharose, molecular weight and resolution into multiple components on DEAE-cellulose. A combination of chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose and gel filtration on Sephadex G- 200 and Sepharose 6 B suggests that four forms of intermediate alpha-D-mannosidase, which differ either in their molecular weight of affinity for concanavalin A, exist in human <b>plasma.</b> A practical <b>classification</b> and nomenclature for the multiple forms of intermediate alpha-D-mannosidase in plasma based on molecular weight and affinity for concanavalin A is proposed. Multiple forms of intermediate alpha-D-mannosidase were also observed by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, {{but there was}} not a simple correlation between these forms and those obtained with the other separation procedures. The form of intermediate alpha-D-mannosidase least abundant in plasma, approx. 7 % of the activity, has very similar properties to the neutral alpha-D-mannosidase in human liver. In contrast, the other three forms of intermediate alpha-D-mannosidase, which account for over 90 % of the activity, {{do not appear to be}} present in liver, except perhaps in trace amounts...|$|R

Plasma ox-LDL levels were measured in 149 patients with UAP and in 88 control subjects, using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Angiographic morphology of the culprit lesion was classified as either simple or complex based on the Ambrose <b>classification.</b> <b>Plasma</b> ox-LDL levels in patients with Braunwald class III were significantly higher than in patients with class I (p < 0. 0001) or in control subjects (p < 0. 0001). In each of the 3 Braunwald classes, plasma ox-LDL levels in patients with a complex lesion were significantly higher than in patients with a simple lesion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that ox-LDL level and Braunwald class III were independent factors associated with angiographically detected complex lesions. In each Braunwald class of UAP, elevated plasma levels of ox-LDL closely relate to the presence of angiographically detected complex and thrombotic lesion morpholog...|$|R

40|$|Plasma process tools, {{which usually}} cost several {{millions}} of US dollars, {{are often used}} in the semiconductor fabrication etching process. If the plasma process is halted due to some process fault, the productivity will be reduced and the cost will increase. In order to maximize the product/wafer yield and tool productivity, a timely and effective fault process detection is required in a <b>plasma</b> reactor. The <b>classification</b> of fault events can help the users to quickly identify fault processes, and thus can save downtime of the plasma tool. In this work, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) is employed as the metrology sensor for in-situ process monitoring. Splitting into twelve different match rates by spectrum bands, the matching rate indicator in our previous work (Yang, R.; Chen, R. S. Sensors 2010, 10, 5703 - 5723) is used to detect the fault process. Based on the match data, a real-time <b>classification</b> of <b>plasma</b> faults is achieved by a novel method, developed in this study. Experiments were conducted to validate the novel fault classification. From the experimental results, we may conclude that the proposed method is feasible inasmuch that the overall accuracy rate of the classification for fault event shifts is 27 out of 28 or about 96. 4 % in success...|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeThere are {{few studies}} on heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) reported from Taiwan and Asian countries. We conducted a prospective study {{to investigate the}} frequency of HIT in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgeries. MethodsA cohort of 54 patients was enrolled from January 01, 2010 to October 31, 2011. Patients' clinical information was obtained for 4 T score <b>classification.</b> <b>Plasma</b> (2 – 4  mL) was also collected before surgery and on Days 5 and 10 following heparin administration during the bypass procedure. This was tested for anti-heparin/PF 4 antibodies and functional assay using flow cytometry (FC). ResultsThe mean platelet count for this cohort followed the expected pattern in the postoperative setting. Seven of the 54 (13 %) patients had positive antibodies assays before bypass surgery. This increased to 32 % on Day 5 and was markedly elevated to 63 % on Day 10 after surgery.

The blood plasma proteome was characterized to further elaborate upon the mechanisms involved and identify proteins that may improve classification of older adults developing an AD dementia. Identify and describe plasma protein expressions that best classify subjects with CSF-defined presence of AD pathology and cerebral amyloidosis. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of samples collected from community-dwelling elderly with (n =  72) or without (n =  48) cognitive impairment. CSF Aβ 1 - 42, tau, and phosphorylated tau (P-tau 181) were measured using ELISA, and mass spectrometry quantified the plasma proteomes. Presence of AD pathology was defined as CSF P-tau 181 /Aβ 1 - 42  >  0. 0779, and presence of amyloidosis was defined as CSF Aβ 1 - 42  <  724  pg/mL. Two hundred and forty-eight plasma proteins were quantified. Plasma proteins did not improve classification of the AD CSF biomarker profile in the whole sample. When the analysis was separately performed in the cognitively impaired individuals, the diagnosis accuracy of AD CSF profile was 88. 9 % with 19 plasma proteins included. Within the full cohort, there were 16 plasma proteins that improved diagnostic accuracy of cerebral amyloidosis to 92. 4 %. <b>Plasma</b> proteins improved <b>classification</b> accuracy of AD pathology in cognitively-impaired older adults and appeared representative of amyloid pathology.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Differentiating {{patients}} with primary aldosteronism caused by aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) from those with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH), which {{is essential for}} choice of therapeutic intervention, relies on adrenal venous sampling (AVS) -based measurements of aldosterone and cortisol. We assessed the utility of LC-MS/MS-based steroid profiling to stratify {{patients with}} primary aldosteronism. METHODS: Fifteen adrenal steroids were measured by LC-MS/MS in peripheral and adrenal venous plasma from AVS studies for 216 patients with primary aldosteronism at 3 tertiary referral centers. Ninety patients were diagnosed with BAH and 126 with APAs {{on the basis of}} immunoassay-derived adrenal venous aldosterone lateralization ratios. RESULTS: Among 119 patients confirmed to have APAs at follow-up, LC-MS/MS-derived lateralization ratios of aldosterone normalized to cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and androstenedione were all higher (P < 0. 0001) than immunoassay-derived ratios. The hybrid steroids, 18 -oxocortisol and 18 -hydroxycortisol, also showed lateralized secretion in 76 % and 35 % of patients with APAs. Adrenal venous concentrations of glucocorticoids and androgens were bilaterally higher in patients with BAH than in those with APAs. Consequently, peripheral plasma concentrations of 18 -oxocortisol were 8. 5 -fold higher, whereas concentrations of cortisol, corticosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone were lower in patients with APAs than in those with BAH. Correct classification of 80 % of cases of APAs vs BAH was thereby possible by use of a combination of steroids in peripheral plasma. CONCLUSIONS: LC-MS/MS-based steroid profiling during AVS achieves higher aldosterone lateralization ratios in patients with APAs than immunoassay. LC-MS/MS also enables multiple measures for discriminating unilateral from bilateral aldosterone excess, with potential use of peripheral <b>plasma</b> for subtype <b>classification...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) {{is used as}} a {{diagnostic}} marker of cardiovascular diseases. BNP is secreted mainly from the myocardium and has been detected by immunoreactivity in brain and cerebral arteries. The aim of our study was to investigate plasma BNP in patients with acute cerebral infarction according to infarction subtype and infarction volume. Methods: We studied 141 patients with acute cerebral infarction, classified as large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), cardioembolism (CE), or small vessel disease (SA) according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment <b>classification.</b> <b>Plasma</b> BNP level was measured in patients and 61 healthy controls. We analyzed various clinical and laboratory variables of patients according to plasma BNP level. Results : Compared to controls, the patients had higher plasma BNP (11. 9 &# 177; 11. 7 pg/mL versus 124. 6 &# 177; 228. 8 pg/mL, p &# 60; 0. 01). The highest quartile BNP group was associated with advanced age, female gender, current non-smoker, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, CE group, increased white blood cell counts, increased high sensitivity C-reactive protein, increased left atrium size, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, increased initial National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and increased infarction volume. According to multiple regression analysis, CE group, female gender, and infarction volume were independently associated with plasma BNP. Plasma BNP level showed statistically significant differences among LAA (n = 71), CE (n = 50), and SA (n = 20) groups (p &# 60; 0. 001), and the expression decreased in order of CE (253. 8 &# 177; 337. 1 pg/mL), LAA (61. 6 &# 177; 78. 8 pg/mL), and SA (25. 3 &# 177; 24. 8 pg/mL). Increased plasma BNP correlated with increased infarction volume (r = 0. 42, p &# 60; 0. 001). Conclusions : Plasma BNP may be helpful for prediction of etiologic classification of acute cerebral infarction and infarction volume. </p...|$|R

The post-liver transplant complications in recipients were stratified according to the Clavien <b>classification.</b> <b>Plasma</b> levels of cytokines IL- 6, IL- 2, and TNF-α were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, in all donors before organ procurement. Results: The mean (range) age of donors was 44 (16 – 74) years. Trauma due to car accident was {{the most common cause of}} brain death (79 %). The post-liver transplant complications occurred in 19 (50 %) recipients. The mean±SD plasma TNF-α concentration was significantly (p< 0. 001) higher in recipients with grade 1 - 3 post-transplant complications (68. 33 ± 27. 74 pg/mL) than those without complication (22. 09 ± 4. 14 pg/mL). Recipients with complications had also a significantly (p= 0. 001) higher mean±SD donor plasma concentration of IL- 6 (1009 ± 375. 5 pg/mL) compared to those without complications (779 ± 202 pg/mL). No significant differences was observed between the two groups in respect to IL- 2 concentration (0. 295 ± 0. 333 vs 0. 285 ± 0. 342 U/mL, p= 0. 207). Six recipients died of complications (grade 5), in whom no correlation could be found with donor plasma cytokine concentrations. Conclusion: Higher plasma concentrations of IL- 6 and TNF-α in donors before organ procurement, are associated with more post-operative complications in liver transplant recipients...|$|R
