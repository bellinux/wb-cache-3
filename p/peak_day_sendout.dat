3000|$|... {{the peak}} demand is the demand rate that is {{typically}} used to size the system components {{and so will}} affect {{the design of the}} system. The demand scenarios [W 13] are more likely to affect the operation of the system as the demand varies over the simulation time. The <b>peak</b> <b>day</b> demand (average demand over the <b>peak</b> <b>day),</b> the <b>peak</b> hour demand (the average demand over the hour with maximum consumption in the <b>peak</b> <b>day)</b> and average demand rates may also be required. Fire loading demands and other emergency conditions will affect the design of the system, for example storage tanks should be sized to be able to provide demand in the case of fires, other emergencies and system failures (e.g. if the supply to the tank is cut off).|$|R

40|$|Objective Epidemiologic {{studies on}} {{physical}} exposure during computer use have mainly focused on average exposure duration. In this study, we aimed to relate periods of high peak exposure during computer {{use with the}} occurrence of neck-shoulder (NS) and arm-wrist-hand (AWH) symptoms. Methods A prospective cohort study among 1951 office workers was carried out for two years, with periodical questionnaires and continuous measurements of computer input use. To define peak exposure, a distinction was made between <b>peak</b> <b>days</b> and weeks. <b>Peak</b> <b>days</b> were defined as days with a long duration of computer (ie, ≥ 4 hours) or mouse use (ie, ≥ 2. 5 hours) or days with high frequency of mouse (ie, ≥ 20 clicks per minute) or keyboard use (ie, ≥ 160 keystrokes per minute). Weeks containing ≥ 3 <b>peak</b> <b>days</b> were considered <b>peak</b> weeks. Independent variables were numbers of <b>peak</b> <b>days</b> and <b>peak</b> weeks during a 3 -month measurement period; dependent variables were self-reported NS and AWH symptoms during the following 3 -month measurement period. Results Valid data were available for 2116 measurements of 774 office workers. No relation was found between any of the peak exposure parameters and AWH symptoms or with peak exposure in duration and NS symptoms. Most parameters referring to high frequency-related peak exposure were associated with less NS symptoms, but the effect estimates were very small and the confidence intervals close to the null. Conclusion In this study, we found no indication that high peaks in computer use {{were related to the}} occurrence of NS or AWH symptoms...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the consequences of milking frequency on total yield, average-daily yield, <b>peak</b> <b>day,</b> flow rate, dairy merit and persistency in Red Sokoto goats. Thirty lactating does were divided into three categories on milking frequencies, once a day, trice a day and thrice a day milking of 10 animals each. All the does were at their third lactation and were hand milked {{for a period of}} 120 days postpartum. Over the 120 days lactation period, total yiel d, average daily yield, <b>peak</b> yield, <b>peak</b> <b>day,</b> flow rate, dairy merit and persistency were 55. 5 ± 2. 95 kg, 0. 466 ± 0. 025 kg, 0. 791 ± 0. 042 kg, 33. 8 ± 4. 01 d, 3. 7 ± 0. 25 g/d, 10. 6 ± 0. 21 % and 96. 1 ± 7. 92 %. Milking frequency significantly (P< 0. 05) influenced total yield, average daily yield, peak yield, and milk flow rate, but not <b>peak</b> <b>day,</b> dairy merit and persistency. Milk yield characteristics increased with milking frequency, but at a decreasing flow rate. In Red Sokoto goats milking frequency affected milk yield characteristics but not dairy merit and persistency. The high lactation persistency of these goats was an indication of their ability to maintain milk production throughout lactation...|$|R

40|$|Design {{criteria}} for drinking water systems at recreation developments, particularly summer home type, cause frequent confrontations with regulatory agencies.

Little empirical data have been available to resolve such questions. This study included the gathering and analysis of both historic water use measurements and additional daily and instantaneous measurements during peak seasons at 11 Utah and one Wyoming recreation development. The water demand parameters studied included average, <b>peak</b> month, <b>peak</b> <b>day,</b> and instantaneous events at mountain cabins, resort condominiums, marinas, and recreation vehicle campgrounds.

40|$|Viral {{videos that}} gain {{popularity}} {{through the process}} of In-ternet sharing are having a profound impact on society. Ex-isting studies on viral videos have only been on small or confidential datasets. We collect by far the largest open benchmark for viral video study called CMU Viral Video Dataset, and share it with researchers from both academia and industry. Having verified existing observations on the dataset, we discover some interesting characteristics of viral videos. Based on our analysis, {{in the second half of}} the pa-per, we propose a model to forecast the future <b>peak</b> <b>day</b> of viral videos. The application of our work is not only impor-tant for advertising agencies to plan advertising campaigns and estimate costs, but also for companies to be able to quickly respond to rivals in viral marketing campaigns. The proposed method is unique in that it is the first attempt to incorporate video metadata into the <b>peak</b> <b>day</b> prediction.

40|$|The {{changing}} {{natural gas}} industry {{has increased the}} importance for utility companies to develop an accurate <b>peak</b> <b>day</b> forecast. The model developed for this midwest utility estimates a firm natural gas sendout econometrically, using the Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis. The peak is primarily weather driven, thus the model made use of wind-chill variables from the current day, the previous day, and the current day squared. Also included is a disposable income variable to reflect the level of economic activity. The <b>peak</b> <b>day</b> forecast depends on using extreme weather conditions for the design day parameters. The parameters used represented the second worst wind-chill for the utility 2 ̆ 7 s service area {{to occur in the}} last thirty years of history. The forecasted peak for the 1993 / 1994 winter season is calculated from the model to be 515, 654 MCF, or 530, 092 DTH. The actual peak occurrence for this season fell on January 18, 1994 where firm sendout reached an all-time high of 513, 876 MCF, or 528, 261 DTH...|$|R
