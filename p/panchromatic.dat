5|$|NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second satellite, {{was built}} as a {{high-resolution}} earth satellite by Surrey Space Technology Limited, a United Kingdom-based satellite technology company. It has 2.5-metre resolution <b>panchromatic</b> (very high resolution), 5-metre multispectral (high resolution, NIR red, green and red bands), and 32-metre multispectral (medium resolution, NIR red, green and red bands) antennas, with a ground receiving station in Abuja. The NigeriaSat-2 spacecraft alone was built {{at a cost of}} over £35 million. This satellite was launched into orbit from a military base in China.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} most sensitive ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more sensitive than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a <b>panchromatic</b> wide-field camera that can record {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E
5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new <b>panchromatic</b> film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E
25|$|The Indian IRS-P5 (CARTOSAT-1) was {{equipped}} with high-resolution <b>panchromatic</b> equipment to enable it for cartographic purposes. IRS-P5 (CARTOSAT-1) {{was followed by a}} more advanced model named IRS-P6 developed also for agricultural applications. The CARTOSAT-2 project, equipped with single <b>panchromatic</b> camera that supported scene-specific on-spot images, succeeded the CARTOSAT-1 project.|$|E
25|$|India {{currently}} has 10 remote sensing satellites in orbit. Though most {{are not meant}} to be dedicated military satellites, some have a spatial resolution of 1 metre or below which can be also used for military applications. Noteworthy satellites include the Technology Experiment Satellite (TES) which has a <b>panchromatic</b> camera (PAN) with a resolution of 1-metre, the RISAT-2 which is capable of imaging in all-weather conditions and has a resolution of one metre, the CARTOSAT-2, CARTOSAT-2A and CARTOSAT-2B which carries a <b>panchromatic</b> camera which has a resolution of 80 centimetres (black and white only).|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{motion picture}} stocks were orthochromatic, and recorded {{blue and green}} light, but not red. Recording all three spectral regions required making film stock <b>panchromatic</b> to some degree. Since orthochromatic film stock hindered color photography in its beginnings, the first films with color in them used aniline dyes to create artificial color. Hand-colored films appeared in 1895 with Thomas Edison's hand-painted Annabelle's Dance for his Kinetoscope viewers.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1921 Weston used an {{orthochromatic}} sheet film, {{but when}} <b>panchromatic</b> film became {{widely available in}} 1921 he switched to it {{for all of his}} work. According to his son Cole, after Agfa Isopan film came out in the 1930s Weston used it for his black-and-white images {{for the rest of his}} life. This film was rated at about ISO 25, but the developing technique Weston used reduced the effective rating to about ISO 12.|$|E
25|$|Another very notable {{practitioner}} was Adolf Miethe, {{with whom}} Prokudin-Gorsky studied in Germany in 1902. Miethe was a photochemist who greatly improved the <b>panchromatic</b> {{characteristics of the}} black-and-white photographic materials suitable for use with this method of color photography. He presented projected color photographs to the German Imperial Family in 1902 and was exhibiting them {{to the general public}} in 1903, when they also began to appear in periodicals and books. Miethe took the first known aerial color photographs, from a hot air balloon, in 1906.|$|E
25|$|They were {{originally}} used, and still are, {{to increase the}} sensitivity range of photographic emulsions, i.e., to increase the range of wavelengths which will form an image on the film, making the film <b>panchromatic.</b> Cyanines are also used in CD-R and DVD-R media. The ones used are mostly green or light blue in color, and are chemically unstable. This makes unstabilized cyanine discs unsuitable for archival CD and DVD use, as they can fade and become unreadable in a few years, however, recent cyanine discs contain stabilizers that slow down the deterioration significantly. These discs are often rated with an archival life of 75 years or more. The other dyes used in CD-Rs are phthalocyanine and azo.|$|E
25|$|While in London he met Alice Dixon, {{the woman}} with whom he would {{collaborate}} {{for the rest of}} his life. Alice was born in London in 1851. Her father, Henry Dixon, was recognized in the late nineteenth century for his contribution to the development of <b>panchromatic</b> photography, and for his photos of London architecture taken for the Society for Photographing Relics of Old London. Alice learned the techniques of photography from her father and worked as an assistant in his studio. After meeting Augustus, she became interested in ancient American civilizations and studied John L. Stephen's Incidents of Travel in Yucatan. She agreed to accompany Augustus on an archaeology expedition to study Maya ruins in Mexico. The pair left for New York to finalize preparations for the trip. They married in New York before traveling to Mexico in 1873.|$|E
25|$|Framing camera (FC)— The framing camera uses 20mm aperture, f/7.9 {{refractive}} {{optical system}} with a focal length of 150mm. A frame-transfer charge-coupled device (CCD), a Thomson TH7888A, at the focal plane has 1024 × 1024 sensitive 93-μrad pixels, yielding a 5.5° x 5.5° field of view. An 8-position filter wheel permits <b>panchromatic</b> (clear filter) and spectrally selective imaging (7 narrow band filters). The broadest filter allows imaging at wavelengths ranging from 400 to 1050nm. In addition, the framing camera will acquire images for optical navigation while in the vicinities of Vesta and Ceres. The FC computer is a custom radiation-hardened Xilinx {{system with a}} LEON2 core and 8 GiB of memory. The camera will offer resolutions of 17 m/pixel for Vesta and 66 m/pixel for Ceres. Because the framing camera is vital for both science and navigation, the payload has two identical and physically separate cameras (FC1 & FC2) for redundancy, {{each with its own}} optics, electronics, and structure.|$|E
25|$|A {{pioneering}} three-color additive {{system was}} patented in England by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899. It used a rotating set of red, {{green and blue}} filters to photograph the three color components {{one after the other}} on three successive frames of <b>panchromatic</b> black-and-white film. The finished film was projected through similar filters to reconstitute the color. In 1902, Turner shot test footage to demonstrate his system, but projecting it proved problematic because of the accurate registration (alignment) of the three separate color elements required for acceptable results. Turner died a year later without having satisfactorily projected the footage. In 2012, curators at the National Media Museum in Bradford, UK, had the original custom-format nitrate film copied to black-and-white 35mm film, which was then scanned into a digital video format by telecine. Finally, digital image processing was used to align and combine each group of three frames into one color image. The result is that the whole world can now view brief motion pictures from 1902 in full color.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian musicologist Erwin Ratz {{argues that}} the formal {{organization}} of a fugue involves not only the arrangement of its theme and episodes, but also its harmonic structure. In particular, the exposition and coda tend to emphasize the tonic key, whereas the episodes usually explore more distant tonalities. Ratz stressed, however, {{that this is the}} core, underlying form ("Urform") of the fugue, from which individual fugues may deviate. Thus it is to be noted that while certain related keys are more commonly explored in fugal development, the overall structure of a fugue does not limit its harmonic structure. For example, a fugue may not even explore the dominant, one of the most closely related keys to the tonic. Bach's Fugue in B major from book one of the Well Tempered Clavier explores the relative minor, the supertonic and the subdominant. This is unlike later forms such as the sonata, which clearly prescribes which keys are explored (typically the tonic and dominant in an ABA form). Then, many modern fugues dispense with traditional tonal harmonic scaffolding altogether, and either use serial (pitch-oriented) rules, or (as the Kyrie/Christe in György Ligeti's Requiem, Witold Lutosławski works), use <b>panchromatic</b> or even denser harmonic spectra.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{separation}} from the launch vehicle, the two solar arrays on board the Cartosat-2D satellite were automatically deployed. Afterwards, ISRO's Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru took [...] control of the satellite. [...] "In the coming days, the satellite {{will be brought to}} its final operational configuration following which it will begin to provide remote sensing services using its <b>panchromatic</b> (black and white) and multispectral (colour) cameras," [...] an ISRO statement read. The mission lasted 29 minutes.|$|E
500|$|French {{film critic}} André Bazin defended {{the film and}} wrote that [...] "In this respect, the {{accusation}} of plagiarism {{could very well be}} extended to the film's use of <b>panchromatic</b> film or its exploitation of the properties of gelatinous silver halide." [...] Bazin disagreed with Sadoul's comparison to Lumière's cinematography since Citizen Kane used more sophisticated lenses, but acknowledged that the film had similarities to such previous works as The 49th Parallel and The Power and the Glory. Bazin stated that [...] "even if Welles did not invent the cinematic devices employed in Citizen Kane, one should nevertheless credit him with the invention of their meaning." [...] Bazin championed the techniques in the film for its depiction of heightened reality, but Bordwell believes that the film's use of special effects contradict some of Bazin's theories.|$|E
2500|$|The modern map making {{techniques}} in India, like {{other parts of}} the world, employ digitization, photographic surveys and printing.

2500|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} {{also affects}} black-and-white photography. Although {{there are no}} colors in the photograph, chromatic aberration will blur the image. It can be reduced by using a narrow-band color filter, or by converting a single color channel to black and white. This will, however, require longer exposure (and change the resulting image). (This is only true with <b>panchromatic</b> black-and-white film, since orthochromatic film is already sensitive to only a limited spectrum.) ...|$|E
2500|$|TMC or the Terrain Mapping Camera is a CMOS {{camera with}} [...] {{resolution}} and a [...] swath in the <b>panchromatic</b> band {{and was used}} to produce a high-resolution map of the Moon. The aim of this instrument was to completely map the topography of the Moon. The camera works in the visible region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} and captures black and white stereo images. When used in conjunction with data from Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI), it can help in better understanding of the lunar gravitational field as well. TMC was built by the ISRO's Space Applications Centre (SAC) at Ahmedabad. The TMC was successfully tested on 29 October 2008 through a set of commands issued from ISTRAC.|$|E
2500|$|Coincidentally at {{this same}} time a new <b>panchromatic</b> {{photographic}} emulsion was developed that allowed {{the full range of}} colors to be captured. Soon after it became available Stieglitz aimed his 8" [...] x 10" [...] view camera at the sky and began taking pictures. By the next year he had created a series of ten mounted photographs he called Music: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs (also called Clouds in Ten Movements). He told his wife Georgia O'Keeffe [...] "I wanted a series that when seen by Ernest Bloch (the great composer) he would exclaim: Music! Music! Man, why that is music! How did you ever do that? And he would point to violins and flutes, and oboes, and brass…" [...] He first exhibited this series in 1923 in his one-man show at the Anderson Galleries in New York, and reported that when Bloch saw them there he had exactly the reaction Stieglitz had wanted.|$|E
50|$|Orthochromatic film {{remained}} dominant {{until the}} mid-1920s due to Kodak's lack {{of competition in}} the <b>panchromatic</b> market. In 1925, Gevaert introduced an orthochromatic stock with limited color sensitivity and a fully <b>panchromatic</b> stock, Pan-23. In 1926, Kodak lowered the price of <b>panchromatic</b> stock to parity with its orthochromatic offering and the <b>panchromatic</b> stock began to overtake the orthochromatic stock's market share within a few years. Similar <b>panchromatic</b> film stocks were manufactured by Agfa and Pathé, the shift to <b>panchromatic</b> stocks had largely been completed by 1928, and Kodak discontinued orthochromatic stock in 1930.|$|E
50|$|DigitalGlobe's WorldView-2 {{satellite}} provides {{high resolution}} commercial satellite imagery with 0.46 m spatial resolution (<b>panchromatic</b> only). The 0.46 meters resolution of WorldView-2's <b>panchromatic</b> images allows the satellite {{to distinguish between}} objects {{on the ground that}} are at least 46 cm apart.

50|$|In 1894, the Lumière Brothers {{introduced}} their Lumière <b>Panchromatic</b> plate, {{which was}} made sensitive, although very unequally, to all colors including red.

The commercial availability of highly <b>panchromatic</b> black-and-white emulsions also accelerated the progress of practical color photography, which requires good sensitivity to all {{the colors of the}} spectrum for the red, green and blue channels of color information to all be captured with reasonable exposure times.|$|E

5000|$|Cinecolor, a bi-pack color process, the {{photographer}} would load a standard camera with two films, one orthochromatic, dyed red, and a <b>panchromatic</b> strip behind it.

50|$|A <b>panchromatic</b> {{emulsion}} {{produces a}} realistic reproduction {{of a scene}} as it appears to the human eye. Almost all modern photographic film is <b>panchromatic,</b> but some types are orthochromatic and are not sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. As naturally prepared, silver halide emulsions are much more sensitive to blue and UV light than to green and red wavelengths. The German chemist Hermann W. Vogel found out how to extend the sensitivity into the green, and later the orange, by adding sensitising dyes to the emulsion. By the addition of erythrosine the emulsion could be made orthochromatic while some cyanine derivatives confer sensitivity to the whole visible spectrum making it <b>panchromatic.</b> However, his technique was not extended to achieve a fully <b>panchromatic</b> film until the early 1900s, shortly after his death. <b>Panchromatic</b> stock for still photographic plates became available commercially in 1906. The switch from orthochromatic film, however, was only gradual. <b>Panchromatic</b> plates cost {{two to three times}} as much, and had to be developed in darkness, unlike orthochromatic—which, being insensitive to red, could be developed under a red light in the darkroom. And the process that increased the film's sensitivity to yellow and red also made it oversensitive to blue and violet, requiring a yellow-red lens filter to correct it, which in turn reduced the total amount of light and increased the necessary exposure time.|$|E
