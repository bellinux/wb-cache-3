5000|$|On 20 July 2010, the High Court made {{an order}} putting Halliwells into administration. Dermot Power and Shay Bannon of BDO LLP were {{appointed}} administrators. [...] Halliwells' practice was {{sold as a}} <b>pre-packaged</b> <b>insolvency</b> to four other firms: Hill Dickinson, Barlow Lyde & Gilbert, Gateley, and Kennedys.|$|R
5000|$|Where a {{compromise}} or arrangement {{has already been}} negotiated with the secured or unsecured creditors [...] essentially creating a <b>pre-packaged</b> <b>insolvency</b> [...] the court may summarily order that it proceed to be voted on by each class of creditors concerned, and, where necessary, by the shareholders as well. Whether a creditor is secured or unsecured is governed by the BIA.|$|R
50|$|On 27 March 2008, the Laurel Pub Company {{went into}} administration; this {{was thought to}} be due to high rents. R20, Robert Tchenguiz's company, with its 378 pubs, bought the company back via <b>pre-packaged</b> <b>insolvency,</b> with most of the former company {{becoming}} the Bay Restaurant Group on 28 March 2008, financed by Kaupthing bank. In a few months, many Icelandic banks such as Kaupthing would spectacularly collapse in October 2008.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pre-packaged</b> <b>insolvency</b> (a [...] "pre-pack") {{is a kind}} of {{bankruptcy}} procedure, where a restructure plan is agreed in advance of a company declaring its insolvency. In the United States pre-packs are often used in a Chapter 11 filing. In the United Kingdom, pre-packs have become popular since the Enterprise Act 2002, which has made administration the dominant insolvency procedure. Such arrangements are also available in Canada under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act.|$|R
50|$|While the {{moratorium}} {{is in effect}} the administrator's core purpose and duty under paragraph 3 is to rescue the company, or if impracticable, typically transfer the business as a going concern, or {{as a last resort}} break up the business and distribute proceeds to creditors. This and other duties, found in Schedule B1, paragraph 3, are theoretically meant to be exercised {{for the benefit of the}} creditors as a whole. There is some tension, however, between the duties on paper, and the administrator being appointed in fact by secured creditors, or through a <b>pre-packaged</b> <b>insolvency.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Marc and Nathaniel Meyohas of Greybull Capital, the {{directors}} of Bowman Birmingham, which acquired Metalrax out of administration. Almost 400 jobs were secured; April 2013. [...] KPMG, an auditing service, reported into the <b>pre-packaged</b> <b>insolvency,</b> showed: Greybull paid more than £8m. The deal left the group pension deficit of £16.9m as an unsecured creditor, with chances of repayment {{now in the hands}} of the Pension Protection Fund. A solvent offer was on the table before Metalrax's collapse, Grove Industries were report to be disappointed not to conclude a transaction in the time available.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{typically}} the term <b>pre-packaged</b> <b>insolvency</b> is recoined as pre-packaged bankruptcy. A conventional bankruptcy case {{is one in}} which the debtor files for Chapter 11 relief without having agreed in advance to the terms of a plan of reorganization with its creditors. During the course of the Chapter 11 case, the debtor or, if the debtor does not retain the exclusive right to propose a plan, a creditor or creditor group may formulate and propose a plan of reorganization. A company undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization is effectively operating under the protection of the court until it emerges. An example is the airline industry; in 2006, over half the industry's seating capacity was on airlines that were in Chapter 11.|$|R
50|$|The {{collection}} included {{paintings by}} Jan Lievens, Hendrick Goltzius, Paulus Potter, Adam Elsheimer, Dürer, David Vinckboons, Pieter Aertsen, Holbein, Jacob Pynas, Jan Miense Molenaer, Maarten van Heemskerck, Frans Floris, Philips Koninck and Pieter Lastman; Flemish artists represented included Rubens (three paintings), Van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Adriaen Brouwer. Van de Capelle owned 83 drawings by Jan den Uyl. The {{large groups of}} drawings by individual artists suggest that he had bought their studio stock of working drawings complete after their death or retirement. The Rembrandt drawings were probably acquired at his <b>insolvency</b> <b>sales</b> in 1656 and 1658.|$|R
5000|$|His father (1594-1674) was a cloth-dyer, {{his mother}} came from Rotterdam; {{they married in}} 1622 in Amsterdam. Joannes' baptism is {{recorded}} in the Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam on January 25, 1626. [...] He was described (by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout) as a self-taught artist, but probably received some form of training from Simon de Vlieger, whose style he copied or is closest to his early paintings, and perhaps other masters such as Willem van de Velde the Elder. He received the citizenship of Amsterdam on 24 July 1653, an essentially honorific ceremony {{for one of the}} city elite. A few months before, on February 2, 1653, he had married Annetje Jansdr. Grotingh, the daughter of a bricklayer. Van de Cappelle was a very wealthy man who never needed to rely on his painting for his livelihood, and it is not known if he joined the city's Guild of Saint Luke, or the separate [...] "brotherhood of painters" [...] founded in 1653. Whether he sold his work, or how he did so, is unclear.Abraham Bredius suggested Van de Cappelle was a friend of Rembrandt, at whose <b>insolvency</b> <b>sales</b> in 1656 and 1658 he was a large buyer, and who painted portraits of him and his wife. It has been speculated that he may have used his business contacts to help obtain the commission for Rembrandt's last, and financially very useful, group portrait commission, the Syndics of the Drapers' Guild of 1662.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{diverging}} {{views about}} the scope by which English law covers employees, as different tests are used for different kinds of employment rights, legislation draws an apparent distinction between a [...] "worker" [...] and an [...] "employee", {{and the use of}} these terms are also different from their use in the European Court of Justice and European Union Directives. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 230, an [...] "employee" [...] is anyone with a contract of service, which takes its meaning from a series of court cases that are also applicable for tax and tort law, where different judges have given different {{views about the}} meaning of the word. An [...] "employee" [...] is entitled to all types of rights that a worker has, but in addition the rights to reasonable notice before a fair dismissal and redundancy, protection {{in the event of an}} employer's <b>insolvency</b> or <b>sale</b> of the business, a statement of the employment contract, rights to take maternity leave or time off for child care, and an occupational pension.|$|R
50|$|Dyckerhoff & Widmann (Dywidag) {{was founded}} in 1865. In 1950 DYWIDAG starts its licence business, while in 1979 DSI, {{initiated}} international operations. DSI further strengthened its supply business, for the mining industry, in 2000. In 2001, DSI and DYWIDAG {{become part of the}} Walter Bau Group and in 2005 DSI was purchased by Industri Kapital after Walter Bau's <b>insolvency.</b> After the <b>sale</b> in 2006, the company began concentrating on new business divisions that included tunneling and concrete accessories. During 2007, DSI network comprised more than 90 subsidiaries, joint ventures, licensees and agents and it was sold to CVC Capital Partners. 2009 saw the merger of DYWIDAG-Systems International GmbH,Germany with subsidiaries including SUSPA-DSI and contec. Later merger of ALWAG Tunnelausbau Ges.m.b.H. into DYWIDAG-Systems International Ges.m.b.H., Austria was also completed. During 2010, DSI was acquired by DSI by BAML (Bank of America Merrill Lynch) and Barclays Capital. Subsequently, in 2011, DSI was sold to Triton Private Equity.|$|R
40|$|During {{some recent}} {{financial}} crises, {{the majority of}} domestic banks -or indeed the entire banking sector- became insolvent. We have analyzed the welfare effects of policy responses to bank insolvency by examining {{a modified version of}} the Diamond-Rajan model, introducing a fiat currency. The sources of inefficiency in our model are the "moral hazard in banking" and the "premature liquidation of bank assets". The model assumes that banking system insolvency is caused by an exogenous macroeconomic shock that destroys a portion of banks' assets. If the government does not intervene in very severe cases of bank <b>insolvency,</b> a fire <b>sale</b> of all bank assets can occur along with dis-intermediation of the economy and falls in price levels (debt deflation). We have analyzed the consequences of the following three different policy responses to bank insolvency: (1) providing deposit guarantees (without immediate recapitalization), (2) providing unlimited liquidity support, and (3) effecting bank recapitalization through either cash creation (monetary policy) or bond issuance (fiscal policy). In doing so, we showed that bank recapitalization by fiscal measures provides the optimal solution. Our findings imply that Japan's protracted recession and deflation problem may have been caused by an inappropriate policy response to bank insolvency. ...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{research}} gained new momentum {{with the}} completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. Formerly centered on the investigation of single-gene disorders, genetic research is increasingly targeting common complex diseases and in doing so is studying the whole genome, the environment and its impact on genomic variation. Consequently, biobanking initiatives have emerged around the world as a tool to sustain such progress. Whether they are small scale or longitudinal, public or private, commercial or non-commercial, biobanks should consider the possibility of closure. Interestingly, while raising important ethical issues, this topic has hardly been explored in the literature. Indeed, ethical issues associated with <b>sale,</b> <b>insolvency,</b> end of funding, or transfer of materials to other entities (which are all issues either related to or possible consequences of closure) are seldom the subject of discussion. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper will discuss-using population and direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies' biobanks as case studies-(1) international and national normative documents addressing the issue of closure and (2) the internal policies of population biobanks and DTC genetic testing companies. The analysis will inform the debate on biobank closure and elucidate the underlying ethical issues, which include, {{but are not limited to}} informed consent, storage and privacy. status: publishe...|$|R
