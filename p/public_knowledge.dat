Later, he practiced law in Frankfort, Kentucky, until his death in 1898, keeping many of the secrets of Confederate espionage from <b>public</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not <b>public</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E

The MCC committee met and granted retrospective approval to the actions of the four men. Griffith's offer to resign was declined. The press outcry of 1968 was not repeated; Fraser-Sampson speculates that the MCC may have applied pressure to journalists. Griffith and Allen later received honours from the British government.|$|E

He set about {{completing}} The Big Breach, {{which was published in}} 2001 in Russia. The book alleged that MI6 had infiltrated the German Bundesbank with a mole, and that the Service had a special means of writing in invisible ink. Other revelations were already <b>public</b> <b>knowledge,</b> such as that MI6 recruits are trained at Fort Monckton in Hampshire, and that agents in the field often use the cover of being a journalist.|$|E

At first {{it was unclear whether}} Henry VIII intended to appoint a successor, with Giovanni Domenico de Cupis emerging as an active candidate in March 1532. The king favoured Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), and instructed his ambassadors on 21 March to offer it to Farnese, and then de Cupis or Giovanni del Monte (future Pope Julius III) in the event that Farnese declined or was not approved.|$|E
5|$|Kirwan's {{contacts}} with Nassif {{later became the}} subject of a legal investigation. Kirwan not only shared inside information with Nassif about leasing plans of the GSA, he later invested in Nassif's D.C. business and became an officer in it. This relationship (Kirwan left GSA in December 1966, before the letter indicating intention to lease was set to Nassif), and GSA's irregular leasing of the building, became <b>public</b> <b>knowledge</b> in August 1970. An internal GSA audit was critical of the leasing process and the costs of the lease.|$|E

Our survey among Dutch households on these topics shows that the <b>public’s</b> <b>knowledge</b> about banking supervision is far from perfect.

As realistic views on banking supervision will lead to more prudent financial behaviour, thereby contributing to financial stability, communication policies of banking supervisors should aim to improve the <b>public’s</b> <b>knowledge</b> about banking supervision...|$|R

He was reunited in Boston with Wagner after more than three years of separation and they married on 21 September 1946. Miller and his new bride returned to Australia in November.

5|$|The Adelaide leak was {{the revelation}} {{to the press}} of a dressing-room {{incident}} during the third Test, a cricket match played during the 1932–33 Ashes series between Australia and England, more {{commonly known as the}} Bodyline series. During the course of play on 14 January 1933, the Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was struck over the heart by a ball delivered by Harold Larwood. Although not badly hurt, Woodfull was shaken and dismissed shortly afterwards. On his return to the Australian dressing room, Woodfull was visited by the managers of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team, Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet. Warner enquired after Woodfull's health, but the latter dismissed his concerns in brusque fashion. He said {{he did not want to}} speak to the Englishman owing to the Bodyline tactics England were using, leaving Warner embarrassed and shaken. The matter became <b>public</b> <b>knowledge</b> when someone present leaked the exchange to the press and it was widely reported on 16 January. Such leaks to the press were practically unknown at the time, and the players were horrified that the confrontation became <b>public</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|E

5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become <b>public</b> <b>knowledge,</b> the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that its cover was blown.|$|E

We also find that respondents often expect more from supervisors than they can realistically achieve. Finally, our findings suggest that better - informed people have more realistic views on banking supervision. Realistic views on banking supervision lead to more prudent financial behaviour, which, in turn, contributes to financial stability.

5|$|After announcing Gotham will {{be subject}} to his rule come nightfall, the Joker rigs two {{evacuating}} ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if its passengers (who have been supplied the trigger to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. Batman finds the Joker with a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of Lucius Fox. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes <b>public</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} <b>public</b> <b>knowledge</b> in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only {{out of the public}} eye but in greater intensity). Hitler did not want to run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E

5|$|In November 1888, he {{lost his}} post at the school for reasons that remain unclear. One month later his body was {{discovered}} drowned in the River Thames. His death, which {{was found to be}} a suicide, roughly coincided {{with the end of the}} murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became <b>public</b> <b>knowledge</b> in the 1960s, and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.|$|E
5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion.

The Smoking Man {{counters}} that <b>public</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the truth would create mass panic and {{do more harm than}} good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commercial}} {{traffic on the}} waterways continued despite the railway competition, with 44,034 tons generating £733 of tolls in 1888, which enabled the Commissioners to show a profit of £216. Traffic had fallen slightly to 42,640 tons in 1898, but by 1905 was down to 12,770 tons, and the Commissioners showed a loss of £702 that year. An Alderman giving evidence to the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways in 1905 pointed out {{that one of the}} railway companies had been paying to collect traffic in hay and straw, although this practice ceased when it became <b>public</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The condition of the Nene and the Wisbech Canal declined, which discouraged navigation, but some trade in agricultural produce, coal, bricks and road building materials continued.
