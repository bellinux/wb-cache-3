5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} protection of his <b>patent</b> rights. Even though he lawfully held the only <b>patent</b> on a revolver, scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly in litigation. In {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the <b>patent</b> system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with <b>patent</b> infringement suits slowed his own company's transition to the cartridge system and blocked other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they created their own.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{critics have}} noted the {{similarity}} between Qwak! and the 1984 Nintendo light gun game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled Duck Hunt. Nintendo used that similarity in a 1986 court case attempting to invalidate a <b>patent</b> held by Sanders Associates; the <b>patent,</b> filed by Ralph Baer, was for the light gun peripheral used in the Magnavox Odyssey light gun game and held to be infringed on by Duck Hunt. Nintendo unsuccessfully claimed that Baer had based his <b>patent</b> {{not only on the}} Odyssey work but also on Qwak! as seen by him at the 1974 MOA show.|$|E

5|$|Evans {{found himself}} in battles to protect his {{intellectual}} property many times throughout his career, but he pursued the cause most doggedly during his latter years. His first and most successful patents concerning flour-milling proved the most problematic to defend, and Evans' battles proved influential in setting precedent for the newly established area of federal <b>patent</b> law. His original <b>patent</b> for his automated flour-mill expired in January 1805, but Evans believed that the fourteen year <b>patent</b> term was too brief and petitioned the Congress to extend it. In January 1808 An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans was passed and signed by President Jefferson, a long-time admirer of Evans's work. The act took the extraordinary step of reviving to Evans his expired <b>patent</b> and giving it another fourteen year term— Evans was delighted, but the move was to highly problematic, particularly regarding those who had implemented Evans's designs in the intervening three year period between the <b>patent</b> terms, as many millers had waited for Evans's <b>patent</b> to expire before upgrading their mills.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} before Apple and Samsung began suing each other on most continents, and while Apple and HTC were already embroiled in a <b>patent</b> fight, Motorola Mobility and Apple started a period of intense <b>patent</b> litigation. The Motorola-Apple <b>patent</b> imbroglio {{commenced}} with claims and cross-claims between the companies for <b>patent</b> infringement and encompassed multiple forums in multiple countries as each party sought friendly venues for litigating its respective claims; the fight also included administrative law rulings as well as ITC and European Commission involvement. As of April 2012, the controversy centered on whether a FRAND license to a components manufacturer carries over to an equipment manufacturer incorporating the component into equipment, an issue not addressed in the U.S. Supreme Court's default exhaustion doctrine in Quanta v. LG Electronics. p. 3. Accessed 2012-4-13. Stern cites , 128 S. Ct. 2109, 2008; accessed 2012-4-13. The Quanta case cited the 150-year-old doctrine of <b>patent</b> exhaustion which limits <b>patent</b> rights that survive the initial authorized sale of a patented item. In June 2012, appellate Judge Richard Posner ordered dismissal of the case with prejudice and Apple announced its intention to appeal a month later.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court has {{indicated}} {{that there are two}} branches of double <b>patenting.</b> The first branch of double <b>patenting</b> ("same invention" [...] or [...] "novelty-type" [...] double <b>patenting)</b> requires that claims of two issued <b>patents</b> must not be identical or conterminous. The second branch of double <b>patenting</b> (termed [...] "obviousness-type" [...] double <b>patenting)</b> requires that claims of two issued <b>patents</b> be [...] "patentably distinct" [...] (non-obvious) in view of one another.

5|$|The <b>patent</b> {{illustrates}} a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance {{lies in its}} claim {{of a new and}} useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the <b>patent</b> explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control. The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the <b>patent.</b> The <b>patent</b> also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the <b>patent</b> describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.|$|E

5|$|When {{production}} of Aspirin began in 1899, Bayer sent out small packets {{of the drug}} to doctors, pharmacists and hospitals, advising them of Aspirin's uses and encouraging them to publish about the drug's effects and effectiveness. As positive results came in and enthusiasm grew, Bayer sought to secure <b>patent</b> and trademark wherever possible. It was ineligible for <b>patent</b> in Germany (despite being accepted briefly before the decision was overturned), but Aspirin was patented in Britain (filed 22 December 1898) and the United States (US <b>Patent</b> 644,077 issued 27 February 1900). The British <b>patent</b> was overturned in 1905, the American <b>patent</b> was also besieged but was ultimately upheld.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{explores the}} recent {{explosion}} in university <b>patenting</b> {{as a source}} of insight into the changing relationship between the university and the private sector. Before the mid- 1980 s, university <b>patents</b> were more highly cited, and were cited by more diverse <b>patents,</b> than a random sample of all <b>patents.</b> More recently several significant shifts in university <b>patenting</b> behavior have led to the disappearance of this difference. Thus our results suggest that between 1965 and 1988 the rate of increase of important <b>patents</b> from universities was much less than their overall rate of increase of <b>patenting.</b> I...|$|R

Also different linkage intensities could be identified. The second part of the study tries to identify areas for further analysis and introduces some results with respect to concentration of academic inventive activity, academic contributions to national <b>patenting</b> and utilization of <b>patented</b> inventions. Finally, limitations and applicability of the overall approach are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In 1998 Heller and Eisenberg raised {{concerns}} that <b>patenting</b> of genes could be {{counter to the}} common social interest. This sparked extensive research {{on the effect of}} gene <b>patenting</b> on research and product development. To date {{there is a lack of}} a comprehensive picture of the effects of gene <b>patenting</b> on product development. We operationalize this research gap by analyzing how <b>patents</b> influence market niche based on gene <b>patenting</b> and those based on other biological <b>patents.</b> To test the effects we sampled 288 market niches for diagnostic products approved by the FDA and we linked them to 1199 <b>patents</b> in the USPTO and 1602 licensing agreements. We test whether different qualities of <b>patenting</b> affects the rate of incremental innovation, the strength of monopoly and the strength of the barriers to entry in a market niche. The results show that <b>patenting</b> of genes does not have different effects than other type of <b>patenting,</b> thus the concerns of raised by Heller and Eisenberg on product development remain unsubstantiated...|$|R
