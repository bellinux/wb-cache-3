50|$|A plastic zipper, {{also known}} as a Delrin zipper, is a zipper made with <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> and molded POM elements. Delrin is a {{high-grade}} plastic that is molded in a form over the individual side of the zipper tape. These zippers are light in weight and can be colored to match the product they are fabricated for. They are more commonly known as molded zippers and have a larger bulk than coil zippers. Individually coupling of the teeth in these zippers interlocks seamlessly. In fact, they are almost similar to metal zippers in design because of the individually positioned teeth along the tape. The teeth are smartly injection molded onto a pre-woven, dyed tape. The degree of self-lubrication and sturdiness of Delrin zippers is far better than an equivalent size of coil zipper.|$|E

The echo probe cover that connects the proximal esophagus and distal esophagus is monitored for the presence of creases along the long axis to ensure there are no twists in the echo probe cover. We carry out a laparoscopic-assisted perigastric lymph node dissection, make a small skin incision, and guide part of the thoracic esophagus and stomach outside the body. Either one of the two lengths of <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> is connected to the gastric conduit. By pulling up this length of <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> from the neck, the gastric conduit can pass through the echo probe cover and be elevated to the neck.

40|$|The authors {{conducted}} a retrospective study comparing the corrective effect of two sublaminar techniques on scoliosis: the classical one, based on metal wire, {{and a more}} recent one, based on <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> (thoracic Universal Clamp), known to be safer (less risk of neurological damage, less laminar breakthrough) and compatible with MRI. Lumbar screws were used in both groups. The authors composed two groups of 25 scoliosis patients, matched for gender, age, aetiology, anterior release, number of levels fused, number of infections, major curve and flexibility: {{there was no significant}} difference. Only the follow-up period was different: 55 months in the metal wire group, versus 17 months in the <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> group (p < 0. 001), but this was immaterial because the curves were compared one year after surgery. After one year {{there was no significant difference}} between both groups, as to correction in the coronal or in the sagittal plane.

40|$|Abstract Background Transhiatal esophagectomy for {{esophageal cancer}} implies blind {{manipulation}} of the intrathoracic esophagus. We report a secure hemostatic method with gauze packing in transhiatal esophagectomy. Methods The gauze-packing technique is utilized for hemostasis just after removal of the thoracic esophagus during transhiatal esophagectomy. After confirming cancer-free margins, the abdominal esophagus and cervical esophagus are transected. A vein stripper is inserted into the oral-side stump of the esophagus and led to exit from the abdominal-side stump of the esophagus. The vein stripper and the oral stump of the esophagus are affixed by silk thread. A <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> is then affixed to the vein stripper, as the <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> is left in the posterior mediastinum after removal of the esophagus toward the abdominal side. The <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> on the cervical side is ligated with gauze and the <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> is removed toward the abdominal side. The oral stump of gauze and new additional gauze are affixed. As the first gauze is pulled out from the abdominal side, the second gauze gets drawn from the cervical wound into the mediastinum. The posterior mediastinum is finally packed with gauze and possible bleeding at this site undergoes a complete astriction. The status of hemostasis with the gauze packing is checked by an observation of color and bloodstain on the gauze. Results Between January 2005 and February 2012, 13 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer underwent a transhiatal esophagectomy with the gauze-packing hemostatic technique. Hemostasis at the posterior mediastinum was performed successfully and quickly in all cases with this method, requiring up to four pieces of gauze for a complete hemostasis. Median required time for hemostasis was 1219 (range 1896 to 1293) seconds and estimated blood loss was 20. 4 (range 15 to 25) ml during gauze packing. Conclusions Our technique could minimize bleeding after {{the removal of the}} thoracic esophagus. The gauze-packing method is a simple and easy technique for secure hemostasis when performing a transhiatal esophagectomy. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the construction and technology of multiaxial fabrics should be accompanied by exploring their specific properties. On the one hand, {{there is a need}} to assess the behaviour of such woven structures under complex loading, while on the other there are no appropriate tools to conduct such research. This paper presents a prototype of a bi-directional load testing machine which was used to generate complex stress in tri- and foura-xial fabrics. Fabrics used for the tests were made of woven <b>polyester</b> <b>tapes</b> subjected to the thermal stabilisation process in order to unify their properties. As was expected, the results confirmed that increasing the number of axes in the fabric results in improved directional properties and increases the transfer of oblique loads in relation to the main axis. In the case of multiaxial fabrics, longitudinal rigidity in both directions can be increased by either increasing the number of axes or reducing working-in of threads (tapes) in the fabric. A multiaxial fabric may replace a package composed of many orthogonal fabrics when reinforcement of a composite exposed to complex multidirectional loading is required...|$|R

30|$|A 42 -year-old para 1 + 4 {{attended}} the gynaecology clinic complaining of pelvic pain and requesting sterilisation. In 1998, {{a diagnosis of}} cervical incompetence had been made following two miscarriages at 12 and 19  weeks in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Following these two pregnancy losses, a cervical suture was placed vaginally but a subsequent pregnancy miscarried at 23  weeks. In 1999, an abdominal cervical suture (polyethylene terephtalate, <b>polyester</b> <b>tape)</b> was inserted at 11  weeks gestation. This pregnancy proceeded to term, when delivery of a healthy female infant by Caesarean section was undertaken. One further subsequent pregnancy in 2002 terminated with evacuation of the uterus when a blighted ovum was diagnosed at 10  weeks gestation. Following discussion with regards to laparoscopic sterilisation concerning the possible cause for pain {{and the risk of}} suture erosion, the decision was taken to perform a laparoscopic sterilisation and removal of cervical suture.|$|E
40|$|Omental torsion {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} acute abdomen.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{new method}} of {{treating}} acute rupture of the Achilles tendon using <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> is reported. This requires no postoperative splintage, allows earlier mobilisation and prompt {{return to work}} and sport. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients were reviewed prospectively and at a mean of 3 years from surgery. RESULTS: The average time of return to work, full weight-bearing and to driving was 40 days, 45 days and 49 days, respectively. The average time for return to sport was 122 days. Three patients required further surgery, two for infected wounds and one for scar release. There was one sural nerve injury. Twenty-two patients regained a normal range of ankle and subtalar movement, with the mean power of plantar flexion 84 % of the opposite side. Of the 22 patients who played sport, 14 were still performing at the same or a higher level. There were no re-ruptures over this period. CONCLUSIONS: The technique is straightforward and avoids splintage. It also conveys other short- and long-term advantages over more established methods...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the total cytochrome P 450 (CYP) content, microsomal mixed-function oxidase (MFO) activity, and expression of mRNAs for various CYP isozymes {{in a simple}} rat model of reversible obstructive jaundice. METHODS: Obstructive jaundice was created in male rats by causing bile duct obstruction with <b>polyester</b> <b>tape.</b> In another group of rats, bile duct obstruction was followed by internal biliary drainage after releasing the tape. The expression of various CYP isozyme mRNAs was semi-quantitatively assessed by competitive RT-PCR. RESULTS: The total CYP content and microsomal MFO activity showed a significant decrease after biliary obstruction, but returned to respective control levels after biliary drainage. A marked reduction in the expression of CYP 1 A 2, 2 B 1 / 2, 2 C 11, 2 E 1, 3 A 1, and 3 A 2 mRNA was detected during biliary obstruction, while expression increased significantly toward the control level after biliary drainage. Although expression of CYP 4 A 1 mRNA showed no reduction during biliary obstruction, it still increased significantly after biliary drainage. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that not only obstructive jaundice, but also the subsequent internal biliary drainage may affect regulatory medications of the synthesis of individual CYP isozymes differently...|$|E
40|$|During recent years, {{intensive}} {{research has}} been carried out in the area of electronic textiles. There is an emerging trend to create garments that host electronic components embedded in the textile substrate, as well as electronic textiles made from yarns or fibers already possessing electronic properties. The creation of passive devices, such as textile electrodes that measure body parameters, has proved successful. However, there is a great need for the development of textiles possessing additional active functions. Accordingly, we investigated the possibility of developing a textile substrate possessing integrated switching and amplification functions by depositing parts of an organic thin-film transistor on fibrous substrates of varying geometries and origins. This article relates the initial steps we employed to develop a textile-based thin-film transistor. It reports the development of a gate layer from the deposition of electroless copper, as well as the deposition of a polyimide dielectric layer using dip coating. Further, it discusses the layer's properties in terms of thickness and electrical characteristics. A copper layer of 350 nm thickness deposited on <b>polyester</b> <b>tape</b> and polyamide fibers displayed excellent electro-conductive properties. A smooth gate dielectric layer was achieved with a polyimide concentration of 15 w% and a withdrawal speed of 50 mm/min. As a result, optimum conditions for producing thin functional gate and dielectric layers were found. The transistor properties, the deposition of a semiconductive layer, and the production of drain and source electrodes remain the focus of future work...|$|E
5000|$|Analog {{recording}} {{is based}} on the fact that remnant magnetisation of a given material depends on the magnitude of the applied field. The magnetic material is normally in the form of tape, with the tape in its blank form being initially demagnetised. When recording, the tape runs at a constant speed. The writing head magnetises the tape with current proportional to the signal. A magnetisation distribution is achieved along the magnetic tape. Finally, the distribution of the magnetisation can be read out, reproducing the original signal. The magnetic tape is typically made by embedding magnetic particles (approximately 0.5 micrometers [...] in size) in a plastic binder on <b>polyester</b> film <b>tape.</b> The most commonly-used of these was ferric oxide, though chromium dioxide, cobalt, and later pure metal particles were also used. Analog recording was the most popular method of audio and video recording. Since the late 1990s, however, tape recording has declined in popularity due to digital recording.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this garment is to bring wonderment, beauty, and {{imagination}} back into our lives. When we were young, princesses, fairies, and mermaids were an everyday occurrence and they brought daydreams and joy. This garment shows that even as an adult, a woman can put on a fairytalesque dress and be in her own world of beautiful scenery, singing songbirds and her own Prince Charming. This dress is for dreamers who go after their bliss and don’t let anything stop them. Every woman is beautiful in her own wonderful way, and this dress is suited for any woman who knows her true beauty and wants {{to show it to}} the world. Process: During the design process of this project, wedding dress designers were reviewed and future bridal trends were analyzed. This dress resembles a bridesmaid dress, because prints are becoming particularly popular among bridesmaids, especially watercolor and floral prints. I chose to do a strapless bridesmaid-like dress because most bridesmaids’ dresses have straps, while most wedding dresses are strapless, and I wanted to do switch dress design roles. Technique: This dress was created using the draping technique. Fabric was draped over a dress form and a pattern was created from the draping. A sample garment was made from the pattern and fittings on a model were done {{in order to create a}} proper fit. Once the fit was correct, final alternations to the pattern were made and the final garment was created. The garment is lined and has an invisible zipper and features flowing fabric for the skirt and a silk bodice. Innovation: The innovation of this design is the bias cut bodice that includes unique triangular shapes that form a unique silhouette on the wearer. By incorporating these design lines, the woman wearing the garment can feel unique and beautiful in a style and dress all her own. Materials: 100 percent polyester, 100 percent silk, 100 percent cotton, invisible zipper, <b>polyester</b> thread, hem <b>tape.</b> This is one in a line of three garments; the entire line can be seen at the Apparel, Textiles, and Merchandising spring fashion show, May 30, at 3 : 00 p. m. and 7 : 00 p. m. in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall...|$|R
