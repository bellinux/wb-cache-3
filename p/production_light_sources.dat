40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the fabrication of all-UV-written devices in rare-earth doped silica-on-silicon to demonstrate the viability of this versatile single step channel definition process for the <b>production</b> of <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> The requirements for the glass substrate and the fabrication of waveguiding structures through use of the Flame Hydrolysis Deposition technique are discussed. The development of a process for rare-earth doping of the core layer through the immersion of a partially consolidated soot into a solution containing rare-earth ions is presented. The pre-requisites for direct-UV-writing of channels in a three-layer buried waveguide structure are then considered and results on the physical behaviour of the channels and spectroscopic properties of the rare-earth ions are reported. This study has resulted in the first demonstration of an all-UV-written waveguide laser in silica-on-silicon. Low-loss operation (0. 11 - 0. 3 dBcm− 1) of a 10 mm long channel waveguide laser doped with 1. 26 wt% of neodymium was demonstrated with efficient lasing action (~ 33 % slope efficiency). Erbium, ytterbium and thulium doping have been investigated to allow the <b>production</b> of <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> at other wavelengths. Further optimisation is still required to allow lasing to be achieved. Nevertheless, demonstration of y-splitters and Bragg grating fabrication in the doped material shows the potential of the combined fabrication techniques for the production of DFB laser-arrays for WDM technology. The additional developments required for the production of such devices are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} {{stochastic}} disturbance rejection, performance, and optimal control. This study {{is composed of}} three distinct investigations: an application, theory, {{and the development of}} an algorithm. The studies are linked by optimal control and its associated performance. In application, we study a disturbance rejection problem in a <b>production</b> pulsed <b>light</b> <b>source</b> to yield quantifiable and guaranteed improved performance over existing control techniques. We apply generalizations of continuous-discrete Kalman filter ideas for actuator and disturbance state estimation and prediction; following Harris, we analyze the variance <b>light</b> <b>source</b> output prediction errors in order to ascertain the theoretical lower bound for closed-loop control performance. We establish and solve a non-standard regularized minimum variance control problem, and use the derived control law in concert with the continuous-discrete estimator to construct a certainty-equivalence state-feedback controller. We demonstrate on a <b>production</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> that the estimator-controller yields closed-loop performance near the derived theoretical lower bound for the hardware. The theoretical framework is constructed around the application of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) schemes to discrete-time, nonlinear systems which are subject to persistent, stochastic disturbances. We pose a discounted-cost infinite-horizon optimal control problem and use its optimal value function as the performance benchmark to which all subsequent NMPC closed loops are compared. Following Jadbabaie, Hauser, Grüne, and Rantzer, who address performance and stability of NMPC in the undisturbed case, we employ monotonicity of finite- horizon optimal control value functions to establish an upper bound to NMPC loop performance. We highlight assumptions which are required to achieve this upper bound and offer insight as to how one might satisfy these assumptions. We tackle a third problem which is unrelated to performance of a closed-loop system, but which finds application in real-time MPC calculations. We consider the development of distributed algorithms which cooperating nodes can employ to solve a global optimization problem. The global solution constitutes the performance benchmark of interest and we seek distributed algorithms which nodes can employ in order to achieve this solution. Each node has access to local information which is suitable for solving a local optimization problem subject to local constraints; the nodes are coupled through a coupling constraint and through the structure of the global cost function. Our focus lies in understanding the required information content exchange between nodes to solve the global optimization problem. We show that the amount of information content is related to activity of both local constraints and coupled constraints at the global solutio...|$|R
50|$|Phosphor-based LED {{efficiency}} {{losses are}} due to the heat loss from the Stokes shift and also other phosphor-related degradation issues. Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the LED itself. For example, the luminous efficacy of a typical YAG yellow phosphor based white LED ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue LED because of the human eye's greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue (as modeled in the luminosity function). Due to the simplicity of manufacturing, the phosphor method {{is still the most}} popular method for making high-intensity white LEDs. The design and <b>production</b> of a <b>light</b> <b>source</b> or <b>light</b> fixture using a monochrome emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex RGB system, and the majority of high-intensity white LEDs presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion.|$|R

The glass rods {{were obtained by}} using a relatively effective and inexpensive method of modified physical and chemical purification. Then, the multi-material fiber preform was fabricated through a modified laboratory using one-step co-extrusion process. Moreover, the fiber preform with a Polyether Sulfone (PES) polymer was drawn with a core diameter of ~  22  μm. The core/cladding ratio of the fiber was approximately 1 : 17, and the minimum loss was approximately 1  dB/m between 4 and 6  μm. By pumping a 13  cm-long fiber with different laser powers and another two different lengths (20  cm and 50  cm, respectively) of fiber at 4. 8  μm, a supercontinuum covering 1 – 5  μm could be recorded in all fibers.

40|$|Architectures for {{next-generation}} modular instrumentation standards should aim to meet {{a requirement}} of High Availability, or robustness against system failure. This is particularly important for experiments {{both large and small}} mounted on <b>production</b> accelerators and <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> New standards should be based on architectures that (1) are modular in both hardware and software for ease in repair and upgrade; (2) include inherent redundancy at internal module, module assembly and system levels; (3) include modern high speed serial inter-module communications with robust noise-immune protocols; and (4) include highly intelligent diagnostics and board-management subsystems that can predict impending failure and invoke evasive strategies. The simple design principles lead to fail-soft systems that can be applied to any type of electronics system, from modular instruments to large power supplies to pulsed power modulators to entire accelerator systems.

40|$|Most {{illuminant}} estimation algorithms {{work with}} the assumption of one specific type of the <b>light</b> <b>source</b> (e. g. point <b>light</b> <b>source</b> or directional <b>light</b> <b>source).</b> This assumption brings up two main limitations which significantly restrict {{the applicability of the}} algorithms: First, the knowledge about the type of the <b>light</b> <b>source</b> presented in the scene is needed a priori; second, it can not handle complex scenes where multiple different types of <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> co-exist.
