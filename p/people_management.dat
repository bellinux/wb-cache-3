2500|$|Jackson {{began his}} European tour in Rome at the Flaminio Stadium on May 23, 1988. Police and {{security}} guards rescued hundreds of fans from being crushed {{in the crowd}} of 35,000. Police reported 130 women fainted at the concert in Vienna on June 2. On June 17, Jackson travelled {{to the town of}} Vevey to meet Oona O'Neill, the widow of comic actor Charlie Chaplin. [...] "I have fulfilled my biggest childhood dream", said Jackson after the visit. The most successful of the European dates were those in London at Wembley Stadium. Ticket demand for the five July dates exceeded 1.5 million, enough to fill the 72,000 capacity venue 20 times. Jackson performed seven sold out shows, beating the previous record held by Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and Genesis. More shows could have been added, but the venue had reached its quota for live performances. The third concert on July 16 was attended by Diana, Princess of Wales and Prince Charles. On September 8, Jackson was entered into the Guinness World Records, the first of three times from the tour alone. The Wembley shows were attended by a record 504,000 <b>people.</b> <b>Management</b> also presented him with a special award. On July 30, NBC aired Michael Jackson Around the World, a 90-minute special documenting the singer on tour. On August 29, after a birthday performance in Leeds, Jackson donated $130,000 to Give For Life. The final European show was held in Liverpool on September 11, staged at Aintree Racecourse. 1,550 fans were reported injured among the crowd of 125,000.|$|E

40|$|This essay aims {{to discuss}} the {{flexibility}} of work and the <b>people’s</b> <b>management</b> in a context that prevails the instrumental rationality, proper from the enterprises. The work can take positive connotations like its emancipating and transforming character, as it can takes its opposite: alienation and suffering. In the Capitalism, work is organized according {{to the interests of}} those who have capital. The <b>people’s</b> <b>management</b> is in tune with the changes in today’s capitalist economy and becomes more flexible through innovative practices, which intend to restore the subjectivity of human nature. This flexibility develops within a context in which the instrumental rationality prevails. It is believed that the <b>people’s</b> <b>management,</b> when based on a substantive view and characterized by an ethical code of conduct, with important values, tends to improve the participation of the workers. In this case, work itself could be able to develop the human potential and assume a creative, transforming and emancipating character...|$|R

Agriculture is not only the source of big data but also a typical field of big data applications [2]. This is the application and practice of big data theory and technology in agriculture. The application of big data technology in agriculture is conducive to achieving a holographic three-dimensional reflection of the agricultural ecosystem. Big data technology helps to improve people’s understanding and insight into the relationships between different things in an agro-ecosystem.
