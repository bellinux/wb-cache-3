The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor of the roof, giving the bombards <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> fire. The embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land.|$|E

On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.|$|E

[...] Marah Eakin of The A.V. Club {{described}} it as [...] "EDM-aping". She further stated that the song [...] "seems perfect for the album, rather than just thrown in {{to stay with the}} times."

500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{called the}} song a [...] "perfect kickoff to {{the career of}} Justin Bieber", noting the song had an effect of a younger Chris Brown, commended the {{production}} of The-Dream and Tricky Stewart for making the single contemporary and commercial. However Lamb criticized the song for being too [...] "generic", and that Bieber had little room to show his voice. Billboards Michael Menachem called the song [...] "a hallmark pop song that also taps into a prevalent teen hip-hop aesthetic". He also compared Bieber to Brown on the track, and said that [...] " [...] tenor brings to mind [...] vocal debut on [...] "Run It!" [...] in 2005, when he, too, was 15 and {{on the cusp of}} stardom". Unlike Lamb, Menachem said the song gave Bieber's vocals <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> shine as he confidently breaks into the chorus.

[...] He {{compared it to}} Lupe Fiasco's duet with Matthew Santos' [...] "Superstar" [...] (2007), [...] "especially its feel-good, singalong hook". The review concluded with positive feedback for the recording's lyrics and references. The same rating was give by Nick Levine of Digital Spy. He called the track a [...] "smash" [...] and praised its piano and hook. Levine concluded that although it doesn't show the same class as [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] (2009) by Jay Z and Alicia Keys, [...] "it's all so goddamn catchy you'd be a fool to give a hoot." [...] Lee Tyler from Blues & Souls awarded the single 8 out of 10 stars, calling it a [...] "delight" [...] from its beginning until the end. He said [...] "Whilst not being content to just please the ear... seems to laden with instant charisma, stopping only to refresh the parts others cannot reach of late". Tyler opined that it wouldn't surprise him if Gym Class Heroes sang the track, [...] "is sweet in it's up lifting melody, while giving the rapper <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> flex his prowess." [...] Richard of DJBooth enhanced the way B.o.B.

Angus Batey thought the song would have stuck out in 2010, even without B.o.B's verses, since is a clear departure from the [...] "in-the-club, eyeing-up-the-booty cliches {{that have come to}} pass for romance in hip-hop".|$|E

Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A-, and wrote, [...] "Irreverent camp that's infested with laughs (and creepy-crawlies) but throws credibility out the window." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and {{compared it to}} the previously Morgan-penned [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", writing, [...] "So! This is the second Darin Morgan episode I've had to write about, and once again, I'm not sure I've done it justice. [...] The comedy here can be broad, but there's always enough self-aware commentary buried in it that it never becomes simplistic. While [...] "Bruckman" [...] dealt with the misery of knowing all the answers, [...] "Coprophages" [...] looks at {{how easy it is}} to convince yourself you know what's going on, even when you don't. It'd be better to believe in a bunch of bugs from outer space coming down to earth to mess with our minds, than it would be to accept the more likely truth that bugs like shit—and around here, there's always plenty to go around." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode an 8/10 and praised the episode's self-parodying style, saying, [...] "Overall, this episode was a rare self-contained parody, well written by Darin Morgan. By standing on its own outside of continuity, the episode gives itself <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> send-up the series premise and its early internet fandom. There’s no real sense of resolution, but that’s really incidental to the point of the parody." [...] Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his second favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files.|$|E

Maury Chaykin has doubtless immersed himself in the Wolfe novels, for he brings to his interpretation of the part both a detailed knowledge of what Stout wrote and an unexpectedly personal touch of insight. He plays Wolfe as a fearful genius, an aesthete turned hermit who has withdrawn from the world (and from the opposite sex) in order to shield himself — against what?

With <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> grow the company to the ranks of Hasbro and Mattel, Friedman hoped to out-compete the hundreds of small competitors and the handful of medium-sized toy companies by acquiring their rivals and forging licensing agreements with other companies. During the company's first year, Friedman signed a licensing agreement with Titan Sports, {{at that time the}} parent company of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) whose popularity exploded during the 1990s, which secured an important source of revenue for the company. The exclusive, ten-year deal gave Jakks Pacific the rights to develop and market a line of action figures based on the WWF's wrestling personalities, such as Stone Cold Steve Austin and the Undertaker. For the next several years, Jakks Pacific attained much of its growth from the licensing agreement and the thousands of WWF action figures that were produced, similar to how Hasbro began their growth through sales of G.I. Joe.|$|E
