50|$|The Bowden {{mechanism}} {{was invented}} by Irishman Ernest Monnington Bowden (1860 to April 3, 1904) of 35 Bedford Place, London, W.C. The first patent was granted in 1896 (English Patent 25,325 and U.S. Pat. No. 609,570), and the invention {{was reported in the}} Automotor Journal of 1897 where Bowden's address was given as 9 Fopstone Rd, Earls Court. The principal element of this was a flexible tube (made from hard wound wire and fixed at each end) containing a length of fine wire rope that could slide within the tube, directly transmitting pulling, pushing or turning movements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wire rope {{from one end to the}} other without the need of pulleys or flexible joints. The cable was particularly intended for use in conjunction with bicycle brakes, although it had the potential for other applications. The Bowden Brake was launched amidst a flurry of enthusiasm in the cycle press in 1896. It consisted of a stirrup, pulled up by the cable from a handlebar mounted lever, with rubber pads acting against the rear wheel rim. At this date bicycles were fixed wheel, additional braking being offered by a 'plunger' brake <b>pressing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front <b>tyre.</b> <b>The</b> Bowden offered extra braking power still, and was novel enough to appeal to riders who scorned the plunger arrangement, which was heavy and potentially damaging to <b>the</b> (expensive) pneumatic <b>tyre.</b> <b>The</b> problem for Bowden was his failure to develop effective distribution networks and the brake was often incorrectly, or inappropriately fitted, resulting in a good number of complaints being aired in the press. Its most effective application was on those machines fitted with Westwood pattern steel rims which offered flat bearing surfaces for the brake pads.|$|R

50|$|In September Kovalainen {{elaborated}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> {{issues for}} Autosport. The problem {{seemed to be}} indeed caused by his different driving style compared to Hamilton, particularly the way he enters corners, uses brakes differently and then accelerates. Hamilton turns the car in a shorter time whereas Kovalainen {{is trying to make}} the corners more round, inadvertently causing more wear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyres.</b> They had made progress by adapting the car and working on his driving style.|$|R
