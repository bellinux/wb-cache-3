5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her <b>people</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E

The diagnosis was later changed to stage II pancreatic cancer, for which Jones had surgery on her liver and underwent chemotherapy. The chemotherapy caused hair loss, and for a time she performed bald, refusing to wear wigs.|$|E

25|$|Sharon Lafaye Jones (May 4, 1956–November 18, 2016) was an American {{soul and}} funk singer. She {{was the lead}} singer of Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, a soul and funk band based in Brooklyn, New York. Jones {{experienced}} breakthrough success relatively late in life, releasing her first record when she was 40 years old. In 2014, Jones was nominated for her first Grammy, in the category Best R Album, for Give the <b>People</b> <b>What</b> <b>They</b> Want.|$|E
500|$|After a fallow {{period in}} the mid-1970s, the band {{experienced}} a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with albums Sleepwalker (1977), Misfits (1978), Low Budget (1979), Give the <b>People</b> <b>What</b> <b>They</b> Want (1981) and State of Confusion (1983). In addition, groups such as [...] Van Halen, The Jam, The Knack, The Pretenders and The Fall covered their songs, helping to boost The Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence. The Kinks broke up in 1996, {{a result of the}} commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers.|$|E
500|$|The {{court also}} {{evaluated}} {{the constitutionality of}} the Act's labeling provision, which requires that a label be affixed to the front of every package the state deems to be a [...] "violent video game." [...] Generally, [...] "freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling <b>people</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> must say." [...] However, the court has upheld compelled commercial speech where it is the inclusion of [...] "purely factual and uncontroversial information" [...] in advertising. However, the labeling requirement of [...] "violent video game" [...] is not factual information. The Act has not clearly and legally provided a way to determine if a video game is violent so the sticker does not convey factual information. Consequently, the court found that the Act is unconstitutional.|$|E

[...] Following the model of their projects, the Seacology staff asked the local <b>people</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> needed to rebuild their economy and infrastructure. [...] In Kiralakele, Sri Lanka, the people requested fishing nets and boats. [...] The people of Kadachang Village in the Andaman Islands requested goats and chickens. [...] On Kendhoo in the Maldives, the tsunami had destroyed the local plant life, so seedlings were {{needed in order to}} restore the environment. [...] In Trang Province, Thailand, basic structural repair was requested. [...] Seacology emphasized that it would repair and replace the projects that had been damaged or destroyed in the tsunami.|$|E
500|$|In 1890 at the {{formation}} of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), Stanton was elected president. She left such duties to Susan B. Anthony and instead traveled to Europe for two years. While there she met with women who shared her views, and she gathered critical observations about the place of woman in the Bible. In Greenbank, Bristol, Stanton met with English suffragist Helen Bright Clark, and spoke to a group about the Bible position of woman. Clark questioned whether Stanton's liberal views had shocked some in attendance, and Stanton replied: [...] "Well, if we who do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make any progress in the theologies? I am in the sunset of life, and I feel it to be my special mission to tell <b>people</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are not prepared to hear..." ...|$|E
500|$|Cope {{was raised}} as a Quaker, and was taught that the Bible was literal truth. Although he never confronted his family about their {{religious}} views, Osborn writes that Cope {{was at least}} aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion. Osborn writes: [...] "If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the Bible... he did not express them in his letters to his family but {{there can be little}} question... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period." [...] Lanham writes that Cope's religious fervor (which seems to have subsided after his father's death) was embarrassing to even his devout Quaker associates. Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope's internal religious conflicts. She ascribes Cope's deference to his father's beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain his father's financial support. Frazer's reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told <b>people</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted to hear, rather than his true views.|$|E

500|$|Jackson was a {{national}} co-chairman of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. As such, he is involved in garnering support from the superdelegates. During the campaign, he provided the voice for some advertisements such as one South Carolina radio ad in which he said: [...] "Once, South Carolina voted for my father, and sent a strong message to the nation,...Next year, you can send more than a message. You can launch a president.'" [...] When describing Obama he stated that [...] "Barack Obama is not speaking {{as a friend of}} the community; he's part of the community...He doesn't always tell <b>people</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to hear. He tells them what they need to hear.'" [...] During the campaign, he described Obama as the first [...] "successor" [...] of Martin Luther King Jr. to use the thoughtful and careful approach to language to frame social debate {{in a way that is}} unlikely to alienate whites and noted his ability to get various factions to agree with him and his political positions.|$|E
500|$|The next Kinks album, Give the <b>People</b> <b>What</b> <b>They</b> Want, was {{released}} in late 1981 and reached number 15 in the US. The record attained gold status and featured the UK hit single [...] "Better Things" [...] as well as [...] "Destroyer", a major Mainstream Rock hit for the group. To promote the album, the Kinks spent the end of 1981 and most of 1982 touring relentlessly, and played multiple sell-out concerts throughout Australia, Japan, England and the US. The tour culminated with a performance at the US Festival in San Bernardino, California, for a crowd of 205,000. In spring 1983, the song [...] "Come Dancing" [...] became their biggest American hit since [...] "Tired of Waiting for You", peaking at number six. It also became the group's first Top 20 hit in the UK since 1972, peaking at number 12 in the charts. The accompanying album, State of Confusion, was another commercial success, reaching number 12 in the US, but, like all of the group's albums since 1967, it failed to chart in the UK. Another single released from the record, [...] "Don't Forget to Dance", became a US top 30 hit and minor UK chart entry.|$|E

A writer for The Courier called the show [...] "short but sweet" [...] and praised her for never showing [...] "signs of slowing down" [...] throughout the show. James Montgomery of MTV News praised the overall show, calling it [...] "heavy on the hits, sublimely sexual, suitably sentimental—both for her glory days and the iconic venue she's closing with this seven-night stand—and ridiculous {{in all the right}} ways". He noted that the abrupt ending of the show was compensated by Gaga's dancing and singing, which inturn helped counteract the negative press she had been receiving since the release of Artpop. Glenn Gamboa from Newsday called the show [...] "fierce" [...] and [...] "brainy", saying that the singer [...] "fired up" [...] from the moment she took the stage, displaying an avant-garde artistic sensibility. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the show part of the [...] "Supernova" [...] phase of her career and explained, ...|$|E

500|$|On 16 October 2009, Wilders {{arrived in}} the United Kingdom and was quickly forced to move his press conference due to protests by about forty members of the {{organization}} Islam4UK, an organization that was later shut down under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000 on 14 January 2010. Though the Home Office had asserted that his entry into the country would not be blocked, a spokesman said his [...] "statements and behaviour during a visit will inevitably impact on any future decisions to admit him." [...] His visit to the UK met with protest, but Wilders called it [...] "a victory" [...] in a press conference. On his outspoken views on Islam, he said: [...] "I {{have a problem with the}} Islamic ideology, the Islamic culture, because I feel that the more Islam that we get in our societies the less freedom we get." [...] He opened the press conference with a quote from George Orwell's preface to Animal Farm: [...] "If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell <b>people</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> don't want to hear". Lord Pearson, who had invited him, said his arrival was [...] "a celebration of the victory of freedom of speech over those who would prevent it in this country, particularly the Islamists, the violent Jihadists who are on the march across the world and in the UK." ...|$|E

Christy Lemire of the Associated Press said, [...] "Giving the <b>people</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want is one thing. Making nearly the exact same movie a second time, but shifting the setting to Thailand, is just... what, lazy? Arrogant? Maybe a combination of the two".
