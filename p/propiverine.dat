40|$|<b>Propiverine</b> is a {{commonly}} used antimuscarinic drug used as therapy for symptoms of an overactive bladder. <b>Propiverine</b> is extensively biotransformed into several metabolites that {{could contribute to}} its spasmolytic action. In fact, three <b>propiverine</b> metabolites (M- 5, M- 6 and M- 14) {{have been shown to}} affect various detrusor functions, including contractile responses and L-type calcium-currents, in humans, pigs and mice, albeit with different potency. The aim of our study was to provide experimental evidence for the relationship between the binding of <b>propiverine</b> and its metabolites to human muscarinic receptor subtypes (hM(1) -hM(5)) expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells, and {{to examine the effects of}} these compounds on muscarinic receptor-mediated detrusor function. <b>Propiverine,</b> M- 5, M- 6 and M- 14 bound to hM(1) -hM(5) receptors with the same order of affinity for all five subtypes: M- 6 > <b>propiverine</b> > M- 14 > M- 5. In HEK- 293 cells expressing hM(3), carbachol-induced release of intracellular Ca(2 +) ([Ca(2 +) ](i)) was suppressed by <b>propiverine</b> and its metabolites; the respective concentration-response curves for carbachol-induced Ca(2 +) -responses were shifted to the right. At higher concentrations, <b>propiverine</b> and M- 14, but not M- 5 and M- 6, directly elevated [Ca(2 +) ](i). These results were confirmed for <b>propiverine</b> in human detrusor smooth muscle cells (hDSMC). <b>Propiverine</b> and the three metabolites decreased detrusor contractions evoked by electric field stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner, the order of potency being the same as the order of binding affinity. We conclude that, in comparison with the parent compound, loss of the aliphatic side chain in <b>propiverine</b> metabolites is associated with higher binding affinity to hM(1) -hM(5) receptors and higher functional potency. Change from a tertiary to a secondary amine (M- 14) results in lower binding affinity and reduced potency. Oxidation of the nitrogen (M- 5) further lowers binding affinity as well as functional potency. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Combination therapy of male lower {{urinary tract}} {{symptoms}} with α(1) -adrenoceptor and muscarinic receptor antagonists attracts increasing interest. <b>Propiverine</b> is a muscarinic receptor antagonist possessing additional properties, i. e., block of L-type Ca(2 +) channels. Here, we have investigated whether <b>propiverine</b> and its metabolites can additionally antagonize α(1) -adrenoceptors. Human prostate and porcine trigone muscle strips {{were used to}} explore inhibition of α(1) -adrenoceptor-mediated contractile responses. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing cloned human α(1) -adrenoceptors {{were used to determine}} direct interactions with the receptor in radioligand binding and intracellular Ca(2 +) elevation assays. <b>Propiverine</b> concentration-dependently reversed contraction of human prostate pre-contracted with 10 μM phenylephrine (-log IC(50) [M] 4. 43 ± 0. 08). Similar inhibition was observed in porcine trigone (-log IC(50) 5. 01 ± 0. 05), and in additional experiments consisted mainly of reduced maximum phenylephrine responses. At concentrations ≥ 1 μM, the <b>propiverine</b> metabolite M- 14 also relaxed phenylephrine pre-contracted trigone strips, whereas metabolites M- 5 and M- 6 were ineffective. In radioligand binding experiments, <b>propiverine</b> and M- 14 exhibited similar affinity for the three α(1) -adrenoceptor subtypes with -log K (i) [M] values ranging from 4. 72 to 4. 94, whereas the M- 5 and M- 6 did not affect [(3) H]-prazosin binding. In CHO cells, <b>propiverine</b> inhibited α(1) -adrenoceptor-mediated Ca(2 +) elevations with similar potency as radioligand binding, again mainly by reducing maximum responses. In contrast to other muscarinic receptor antagonists, <b>propiverine</b> exerts additional L-type Ca(2 +) -channel blocking and α(1) -adrenoceptor antagonist effects. It remains to be determined clinically, how these additional properties contribute to the clinical effects of <b>propiverine,</b> particularly in male voiding dysfunctio...|$|E
40|$|Besides its antimuscarinic effects, <b>propiverine</b> may {{possess an}} {{additional}} mode of action. We compared {{the effects of}} <b>propiverine,</b> three of its metabolites (M- 5, M- 6, M- 14) and atropine in human, pig and mouse urinary bladder preparations in order to elucidate {{the nature of a}} possible additional mode of action. Like the parent compound, M- 5, M- 6 and M- 14 reduced to variable degrees the contractions elicited by electric field stimulation (EFS) of isolated, urothelium-denuded detrusor strips. In mouse the atropine-resistant and therefore the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic component of contractile response to EFS was reduced by M- 5, M- 14 and <b>propiverine,</b> but was hardly affected by M- 6. Atropine, <b>propiverine</b> and M- 6 significantly shifted the cumulative concentration–response curves for carbachol (CCh) to higher concentrations. Atropine and M- 6 did not affect the maximum tension induced by CCh. <b>Propiverine,</b> M- 5 and M- 14 reduced the maximum CCh effect, suggesting at least one additional mode of action. This pattern of response was observed in all the three species, albeit with some differences in sensitivity to the various agents. In freshly isolated human detrusor smooth muscle cells, <b>propiverine</b> and M- 14 inhibited the nifedipine-sensitive L-type calcium current (ICa) in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the effects of M- 5 and M- 6 on ICa were insignificant in the concentration range examined. The investigated responses to <b>propiverine</b> and its metabolites suggest that impairment of maximum CCh-induced contractions is due to strong effect on ICa and that this may be associated with the presence of the aliphatic side chain...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Antimuscarinic drugs {{increase}} bladder capacity without prominent {{side effects}} such as urinary retention even when administered {{to patients with}} mild to moderate BOO. Some mechanisms might exist in the urethra {{to compensate for the}} emptying function of the detrusor after administration of antimuscarinic drugs. We investigated the influences of an antimuscarinic drug, <b>propiverine,</b> on urethral function. 	Materials and Methods: Urethral pressure and rhythmic bladder pressure were simultaneously monitored in urethane-anesthetized female Sprague-Dawley rats. PGE 2 was continuously administered intravesically or intraurethrally to induce detrusor overactivity. Next, to eliminate the influence of bladder activity and to monitor urethral baseline pressure, isovolumetric pressure of the urethra was recorded after cystectomy and ligation of the external urethral meatus. Furthermore, the in vitro contractile responses of the urethral circular smooth muscle to field stimulation were examined in the presence of <b>propiverine,</b> tamsulosin, verapamil, ω-conotoxin, and atropine. 	Results: The intravesical or intraurethral administration of PGE 2 significantly decreased bladder contraction interval (BCI) by 10. 7 % and 36. 0 %, respectively. The intraarterial administration of 2 x 102 nM/kg <b>propiverine</b> significantly increased BCI in rats receiving intraurethral PGE 2 by 81. 8 %, but had no marked effect on rats receiving intravesical PGE 2. Significant decreases in urethral baseline pressure were found after <b>propiverine</b> administration. Field stimulation-induced contraction was inhibited by <b>propiverine</b> and verapamil, but not by tamsulosin, ω-conotoxin or atropine. 	Conclusions: These results suggest that inhibitory effects of <b>propiverine</b> are more prominent in rats with detrusor overactivity induced by intraurethral PGE 2 than those by intravesical PGE 2. <b>Propiverine</b> may compensate for detrusor function by decreasing urethral resistance in the voiding phase...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} additional administration of <b>propiverine</b> were prospectively studied for naftopidil-resistant nocturia in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Patients of 50 years and over with BPH who experienced nocturia twice a night or more and an overall International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of 8 or more were first administered naftopidil (50 or 75 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Thirty subjects who did not show improvement in nocturia and requested further treatment {{were enrolled in the}} present study. <b>Propiverine</b> was then administered concomitantly 10 mg/day for 8 weeks. Significant improvement was observed with additional <b>propiverine</b> in the frequency of nocturia on voiding diary, total IPSS, voiding symptom, storage symptom and nocturnal voiding scores. No significant change was observed in the peak urinary flow rate (Qmax), mean urinary flow rate (Qave), voided urine volume, or residual urine volume. Adverse events were dysuria (2 cases), increased residual urine (6 cases), weak urine flow (1 case), thirsty (2 cases), angular cheilitis (1 case). Administration of <b>propiverine</b> was suspended in 7 subjects, 1 following dysuria and 6 following increased residual urine volume. The suspension of <b>propiverine</b> following increased residual urine volume was significantly more prevalent in subjects with pretreatment Qmax values of less than 10 ml/second or in subjects whose prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were 2 ng/ml or more. In conclusion, the results indicate that additional administration of <b>propiverine</b> may be useful for the patients with BPH who have naftopidil-resistant nocturia.

40|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to <b>propiverine,</b> a frequently prescribed pharmaceutical {{for treatment of}} overactive bladder and incontinence, provokes massive protein accumulation in the cytosol and nucleus of renal proximal tubule epithelial cells in rats. Previously, the accumulating protein was identified as d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), a peroxisomal flavoenzyme expressed in kidney, liver and brain. The cellular mechanism of propiverine-induced DAAO accumulation, however, remains unexplained and poorly characterized. Therefore, to further increase the understanding of DAAO accumulation in rat kidney, this study aimed to characterize DAAO accumulations using differential immunofluorescent staining of rat kidney sections {{as well as in}} vitro binding analyses and proteasomal activity studies. We demonstrated that <b>propiverine</b> is neither a ligand of DAAO nor an inhibitor of the proteasome in vitro. However, <b>propiverine</b> treatment resulted in a significant decrease of peroxisomal size in rat proximal tubule epithelial cells. Moreover, peroxisomal catalase also accumulated in the cytosol and nuclei of propiverine-treated rats concurrently with DAAO.

40|$|Autonomic dysreflexia is a {{clinical}} emergency {{that occurs in}} individuals {{with spinal cord injury}} at level T- 6 and above. We present a 58 -year-old male patient with paraplegia who developed a severe, recurrent, throbbing headache during the night, which was relieved by emptying the urinary bladder by intermittent catheterisation. As this person continued to get episodes of severe headache for more than 6 months, computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed. CT revealed an infarct measuring 1. 2 cm in the right basal ganglia. In order to control involuntary detrusor contractions, the patient was prescribed <b>propiverine</b> hydrochloride 15 mg four times a day.

Following 4 weeks of treatment with <b>propiverine</b> and doxazosin, the headache subsided completely. We learned from this case that bladder spasms in individuals with spinal cord injury can lead to severe, recurrent episodes of autonomic dysreflexia that, in turn, can predispose to vascular complications in the brain. Therefore, it is important to take appropriate steps to control bladder spasms and thereby prevent recurrent episodes of autonomic dysreflexia.

Fesoterodine is a newer drug awaiting regulatory approval. We briefly review the pharmacological activity of their metabolites and discuss how active metabolites may contribute to their efficacy and tolerability in vivo. Except for trospium, and perhaps solifenacin, all of the above drugs form active metabolites, and their presence and activity need to be taken into consideration when elucidating relationships between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs. Moreover, the ratios between parent compounds and metabolites may differ depending on genotype of the metabolizing enzymes, concomitant medication, and/or drug formulation. Differential generation of active metabolites of darifenacin or tolterodine are unlikely to influence the overall clinical profile of these drugs in a major way because the active metabolites exhibit a similar pharmacological profile as the parent compound.

40|$|Proper {{subcellular}} trafficking {{is essential}} to prevent protein mislocalization and aggregation. Transport of the peroxisomal enzyme d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) appears dysregulated by specific pharmaceuticals, e. g., the anti-overactive bladder drug <b>propiverine</b> or a norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitor (NSRI), resulting in massive cytosolic and nuclear accumulations in rat kidney. To assess the underlying molecular mechanism of the latter, we aimed to characterize the nature of peroxisomal and cyto-nuclear shuttling of human and rat DAAO overexpressed in three cell lines using confocal microscopy. Indeed, interference with peroxisomal transport via deletion of the PTS 1 signal or PEX 5 knockdown resulted in induced nuclear DAAO localization. Having demonstrated the absence of active nuclear import and employing variably sized mCherry- and/or EYFP-fusion proteins of DAAO and catalase, we showed that peroxisomal proteins â 8 ̆ 9 ¤ 134 kDa can passively diffuse into mammalian cell nucleiâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 4 thereby contradicting the often-cited 40 kDa diffusion limit. Moreover, their inherent nuclear presence and nuclear accumulation subsequent to proteasome inhibition or abrogated peroxisomal transport suggests that nuclear localization is a characteristic in the lifecycle of peroxisomal proteins. Based on this molecular trafficking analysis, we suggest that pharmaceuticals like <b>propiverine</b> or an NSRI may interfere with peroxisomal protein targeting and import, consequently resulting in massive nuclear protein accumulation in vivo...|$|E

Detrusor muscle strips were mounted in 10 -ml organ baths containing Krebs solution, and concentration–response curves for carbachol were obtained in the presence of antimuscarinic antagonists (4 -DAMP, methoctramine, pirenzepine, tolterodine, solifenacin, trospium, <b>propiverine,</b> oxybutynin, and imidafenacin) or vehicle. All antagonists competitively antagonized concentration–response curves to carbachol with high affinities in normal bladder. The rank order of mean pA 2 values was as follows: trospium (10. 1)  >  4 -DAMP (9. 87), imidafenacin (9. 3)  > solifenacin (8. 8)  > tolterodine (8. 6)  > oxybutynin (8. 3)  > propiverine (7. 7)  > pirenzepine (7. 4)  > methoctramine (6. 6). The effects of these antimuscarinic antagonists did not change when tested with DO/BPH bladder, suggesting that each antimuscarinic antagonist has a similar effect in this condition. Schild plots showed a slope corresponding to unity, except for <b>propiverine</b> with DO/BPH detrusor. In conclusion, M 3 -receptors mainly mediate contractions in human bladder strips with normal state and DO/BPH...|$|E

Recent findings Growing evidence demonstrates effects of renal impairment, hepatic impairment, genetics and/or comedications on the pharmacokinetics of muscarinic antagonists. They may cause greater exposure in the respective population, which may translate into greater risks for side effects. These possible risks lead to drug-specific regulatory dosing recommendations or even contraindications in certain patient populations.

40|$|Muscarinic {{receptor}} antagonists such as oxybutynin, <b>propiverine,</b> tolterodine, or trospium are {{the basis}} of medical treatment for overactive bladder. While they are moderately efficacious, their use can be limited by adverse effects such as dry mouth. This has sparked the search for new treatment options. Vanilloid receptor agonists, tachykinin receptor antagonists, potassium channel openers, and beta(3) -adrenoceptor agonists are currently under investigation, but are unlikely to become clinically available {{in the next few}} years. Therefore, current attempts to optimize treatment focus on improvement of existing drugs by new pharmaceutical formulations.

40|$|Naoya MasumoriDepartment of Urology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, JapanAbstract: Imidafenacin is an antimuscarinic {{agent with}} high {{affinity}} for the M 3 and M 1 muscarinic receptor subtypes and low {{affinity for the}} M 2 subtype, and is used to treat overactive bladder. Several animal {{studies have demonstrated that}} imidafenacin has organ selectivity for the bladder over the salivary glands, colon, heart, and brain. In Phase I studies in humans, the approximately 2. 9 -hour elimination half-life of imidafenacin was shorter than that of other antimuscarinics such as tolterodine and solifenacin. Imidafenacin was approved for clinical use in overactive bladder in Japan in 2007 after a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study and a propiverine-controlled Phase III study conducted in Japanese patients demonstrated that imidafenacin 0. 1 mg twice daily was clinically effective for treating overactive bladder and was not inferior to <b>propiverine</b> for reduction of episodes of incontinence, with a better safety profile than <b>propiverine.</b> Several short-term clinical studies have demonstrated that imidafenacin also improves sleep disorders, nocturia, and nocturia-related quality of life. In addition, it is speculated that addon therapy with imidafenacin is beneficial for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia whose overactive bladder symptoms are not controlled by alpha- 1 adrenoceptor antagonists. No cognitive impairment or influence of imidafenacin on the QTc interval has been observed. Although there have been very few relevant long-term clinical studies, the available information suggests the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of imidafenacin, with less frequent severe adverse events, such as dry mouth and constipation. In addition, imidafenacin can be used safely for a long time even for cognitively vulnerable elderly patients with symptoms of overactive bladder. Thus, it is highly likely that imidafenacin is safe, efficacious, and tolerable to control symptoms of overactive bladder even over the long term. However, it remains unknown if the practical effectiveness of imidafenacin is applicable to ethnic groups other than Japanese.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether low-dose anticholinergics combined with an α 1 -receptor antagonist would continue the effect of an alpha-blocker, decrease the side effects of anticholinergics, and improve the symptoms of lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). Materials and Methods: Two hundred nine men with LUTS/BPH with storage symptoms (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] ≥ 12; storage symptoms ≥ 4) were randomly assigned in a prospective, multicentered, and single-blind fashion to either the control group (alfuzosin 10 mg, once daily) or the combined group (alfuzosin 10 mg, once daily, and <b>propiverine</b> 10 mg, once daily) for 2 months. IPSS, maximal urinary flow rate (Qmax), and postvoid residual volume (PVR) were used to grade symptoms, side effects, and the impact on quality of life (QoL) at the start of the study and after 1 and 2 months. Results: There were no significant differences in patient background, including age, prostate size, Qmax, and PVR, between the control group and the combined group.

40|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} {{has a high}} prevalence in {{both men}} and women. Women suffer predominantly from stress urinary incontinence and men from urge incontinence. Other types of incontinence are less frequent. Stress urinary incontinence is caused by an insufficient urethral closure mechanism and urge incontinence by uninhibited detrusor contractions. Medical treatment is beside other conservative options and operations {{only one part of}} the treatment strategy in incontinence. Duloxetine, a serotonine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is used to treat stress urinary incontinence, can increase activity of the external urethral sphincter and is able to reduce incontinence episodes in up to 64 %. Antagonists of muscarinic receptors can reduce urgency, frequency and urge incontinence as well as increase bladder capacity significantly. In Germany, trospium chloride, tolterodine, solifenacin, oxybutynin and <b>propiverine</b> are available to treat urge incontinence. Efficacy of these agents are comparable. However, tolerability is different and side effects, especially dry mouth, often limit their use.

40|$|Introduction: Antimuscarinics (AMs) are the {{mainstay}} of pharmacological treatment of overactive bladder (OAB), a symptom complex defined {{by the presence of}} urinary urgency, usually associated with frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence. The AMs used to treat OAB differ in their pharmacological profiles, which may affect their potential for causing adverse effects (AEs). Areas covered: The present article aims to review the literature about pharmacokinetics (PK) of the different AMs used in the treatment of OAB. Furthermore, the AEs related to the use of these drugs and their incidence are presented. This systematic review is based on material searched and obtained via Medline, Pubmed and EMBASE up to March 2012 using the search terms "adverse events, pharmacokinetics, tolerability" in combination with "darifenacin, fesoterodine, imidafenacin, oxybutynin, <b>propiverine,</b> solifenacin, tolterodine, and trospium. " Expert opinion: Antimuscarinics are the first-line pharmacological treatment for OAB. Despite the development of new molecules that improve their efficacy/safety profile, there are some drugs that are pharmacokinetically more appropriate to be prescribed in specific populations such as patients with neurological disease or the elderly. Moreover, research should be encouraged in evaluating antimuscarinics in conjunction with other drugs such as estrogens or beta-agonists. The identification of prognostic criteria for pharmacological therapy would be helpful...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMuscarinic and purinergic (P 2 X) receptors play {{critical}} {{roles in}} bladder urothelium under physiological and pathological conditions. Aim of {{present study was}} to characterize these receptors in rat bladder urothelium and detrusor muscle using selective radioligands of [N-methyl- 3 H]scopolamine methyl chloride ([3 H]NMS) and αβ-methylene ATP [2, 8 - 3 H]tetrasodium salt ([3 H]αβ-MeATP). Similar binding parameters for each radioligand were observed in urothelium and detrusor muscle. Pretreatment with N-(2 -chloroethyl) - 4 -piperidinyl diphenylacetate (4 -DAMP mustard) mustard revealed co-existence of M 2 and M 3 receptors, with the number of M 2 receptors being larger in the urothelium and detrusor muscle. Intravesical administration of imidafenacin and Dpr-P- 4 (N → O) (active metabolite of <b>propiverine)</b> displayed significant binding of muscarinic receptors in the urothelium and detrusor muscle. The treatment with cyclophosphamide (CYP) or resiniferatoxin (RTX) resulted in a significant decrease in maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) for [3 H]NMS and/or [3 H]αβ-MeATP in the urothelium and detrusor muscle. These results demonstrated that 1) pharmacological characteristics of muscarinic and P 2 X receptors in rat bladder urothelium were similar to those in the detrusor muscle, 2) that densities of these receptors were significantly altered by pretreatments with CYP and RTX, and 3) that these receptors may be pharmacologically affected by imidafenacin and Dpr-P- 4 (N → O) which are excreted in the urine...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the suitability of}} 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol (4 betaOH-C) as an endogenous cytochrome P 450 3 A (CYP 3 A) phenotyping metric. 4 betaOH-C and its ratio to cholesterol (4 betaOH-C/C) were determined in five cocktail phenotyping studies, with and without co-medication with a potential CYP 3 A inhibitor. These parameters were compared with established midazolam-based CYP 3 A metrics: clearance after intravenous (i. v.) administration (M-Cl) and apparent clearance after oral administration (M-Cl/F), reflecting hepatic and overall activity, respectively. In a common evaluation of periods without co-medication, {{there was a slight}} positive correlation of 4 betaOH-C and 4 betaOH-C/C with midazolam metrics: M-Cl (r = 0. 239 and 0. 348, respectively) and M-Cl/F (r = 0. 267 and 0. 353, respectively); P (one-sided) < 0. 05. Co-medication with lopinavir/ritonavir caused a strong decrease in midazolam metrics and a mild decrease in cholesterol metrics. However, the intake of <b>propiverine</b> resulted in opposite trends for midazolam-based and cholesterol-based metrics. The information currently available does not justify the use of 4 betaOH-C for estimation of basal CYP 3 A activity. Further studies to address the temporal variations in local CYP 3 A activity are needed to assess its role as a biomarker during CYP 3 A inhibition.

40|$|AbstractAnticholinergics, {{and drugs}} with {{anticholinergic}} properties, are widely and frequently prescribed, {{especially to the}} elderly. It {{is well known that}} these drugs decrease cognitive function and increase the risk of dementia. Although the mechanism of anticholinergic drug-induced cognitive impairment has been assumed to be functionally reduced acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmission, some data have indicated that anticholinergics might enhance the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we investigated the pathological effects of anticholinergics on neurodegeneration. We chronically administered two anticholinergics, trihexyphenidyl (TP) and <b>propiverine</b> (PP) (the latter with less central anticholinergic action), to neurodegenerative tauopathy model mice 2 to 10 months old. Furthermore, because the ACh nervous system regulates both central and peripheral inflammation, we administered TP or PP to PS 19 mice in which we had artificially induced inflammation by lipopolysaccharide injection. Tau pathology, synaptic loss, and neurodegeneration in the hippocampal region, as well as tau insolubility and phosphorylation, were markedly increased in TP-treated mice and mildly increased in PP-treated mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed microglial proliferation and activation. Moreover, anticholinergics increased interleukin- 1 β expression in both the spleen and brain of the tauopathy model mice intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide to induce systemic inflammation. Interestingly, these alterations were more strongly observed in TP-treated mice than in PP-treated mice, consistent with the level of central anticholinergic action. Anticholinergic drugs not only impair cognitive function by decreased ACh neurotransmission, but also accelerate neurodegeneration by suppressing an ACh-dependent anti-inflammatory system. Anticholinergics should be less readily prescribed {{to reduce the risk of}} dementia...|$|E
40|$|This thesis, {{comprising}} {{of clinical}} studies, basic research {{as well as}} review of data, has aimed to provide further insight into the role and function of muscarinic receptors in the lower urinary tract. In light of increasing evidence of beneficial effects of combinations of pharmacological therapies for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), understanding mechanisms of action and interaction are crucial to maximize its therapeutic potency. The {{first part of this}} thesis focusses on the prostate, the second part on interaction of muscarinic and adrenergic signaling and the last part focusing on muscarinic antagonists in clinical practice. As muscarinic receptors are abundantly present in the prostate, and antimuscarinic therapy is increasingly used in male patients with LUTS, direct effects of antimuscarinics on the prostate need to be considered. Thereby we demonstrate that muscarinic receptors cause direct contraction and inhibition of relaxation in the bladder, but the two responses involve different subtypes and, at least for M 3 receptors, different signaling pathways. The α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist effects of muscarinic antagonist <b>propiverine</b> are explored and demonstrated, although these effects need to be confirmed in patients. In the third part we demonstrate that solifenacin, and perhaps other muscarinic receptor antagonists are similarly suitable for the treatment of OAB symptoms in both genders, irrespective of previous vaginal deliveries. Finally an overview is presented of antimuscarinics at risk for reduced tolerability in special patient populations, e. g. in those with impaired renal or liver function or those with comedications or genetic heterogeneity in drug metabolizing enzymes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder (OAB) {{affects the}} lives of {{millions}} of people worldwide and antimuscarinics are the pharmacological treatment of choice. Meta-analyses of all currently used antimuscarinics for treating OAB found similar efficacy, making the choice dependent on their adverse event profiles. However, conventional meta-analyses often fail to quantify and compare adverse events across different drugs, dosages, formulations, and routes of administration. In addition, the assessment of the broad variety of adverse events is dissatisfying. Our aim was to compare adverse events of antimuscarinics using a network meta-analytic approach that overcomes shortcomings of conventional analyses. METHODS: Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialized Trials Register, previous systematic reviews, conference abstracts, book chapters, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials comparing at least one antimuscarinic for treating OAB with placebo or with another antimuscarinic, and adverse events as outcome measures. Two authors independently extracted data. A network meta-analytic approach was applied allowing for joint assessment of all adverse events of all currently used antimuscarinics while fully maintaining randomization. RESULTS: 69 trials enrolling 26 ' 229 patients were included. Similar overall adverse event profiles were found for darifenacin, fesoterodine, transdermal oxybutynin, <b>propiverine,</b> solifenacin, tolterodine, and trospium chloride but not for oxybutynin orally administered when currently used starting dosages were compared. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed generally applicable transparent network meta-analytic approach summarizes adverse events in an easy to grasp way allowing straightforward benchmarking of antimuscarinics for treating OAB in clinical practice. Most currently used antimuscarinics seem to be equivalent first choice drugs to start the treatment of OAB except for oral oxybutynin dosages of ≥ 10 mg/d which may have more unfavorable adverse event profiles...|$|E
40|$|Urinary bladder {{function}} {{is known to}} mature during fetal and postnatal development, including changes in neurotransmitter regulation of detrusor contraction. However, only few experimental data are available about muscarinic receptor antagonist function in the urinary bladder from young animals. In the present study, we compare the muscarinic receptor-mediated contractions in juvenile and adult porcine detrusor {{and the effects of}} antimuscarinic compounds. Urinary bladders from young (8 - 12 weeks; 12 - to 35 -kg body weight) and mature pigs (> 40 weeks; > 100 kg) were compared. Muscarinic receptor expression was assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction and radioligand binding. Muscle contraction was measured with a force transducer; L-type Ca 2 + currents (ICa,L) of isolated detrusor myocytes were recorded with standard voltage clamp technique. Juvenile and adult detrusor expressed similar quantities of the messenger RNA of M 2 and M 3 receptors. The number of [3 H]QNB-binding sites and their affinity for the radioligand were also similar between juvenile and adult detrusor. In contrast, maximum contractile responses to the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol were slightly larger in juvenile than adult bladders. On the other hand, carbachol was slightly less potent in juvenile than in adult tissue. The M 3 antagonist DAU 5884 and the spasmolytic drug <b>propiverine</b> inhibited contractile responses with comparable efficacies and potencies in juvenile and adult tissue. ICa,L was somewhat smaller in juvenile than in adult cells. Taken together, these data suggest that expression and function of M 2 and M 3 receptors are similar in the detrusor of juvenile and mature pigs. Therefore, similar responses to antimuscarinic compounds could be expected in young and adult patient...|$|E
