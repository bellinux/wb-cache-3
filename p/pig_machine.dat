40|$|Mobile code {{refers to}} {{programs}} {{that come into}} a host computer over the network and start to execute {{with or without a}} user’s knowledge or consent. Because these programs run in the execution context of the user that downloads them, they can issue any system calls that the user is allowed to make, and thus pose a serious security threat when they are malicious. Although many solutions have been proposed to solve the malicious mobile code problem, none of them are truly effective at striking a good balance between defeating zero-day attacks and minimizing disruption to the execution of legitimate applications. This paper describes a commercial system called SEES that secures the execution of mobile code that comes into a host computer as an email attachment or as a web document downloaded through an anchor link by running them on a separate guinea <b>pig</b> <b>machine</b> rather than on the user machine. Effectively, it takes an isolation approach to the secure mobile code execution problem. As a result, SEES guarantees that no malicious email attachments or web documents that act on behalf of the user that downloads them, can damage the resources of the user machine, or can leak any confidential information. In particular, even zero-day virus cannot cause any harms. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of SEES on the Windows platform, and contrast it with other existing approaches to the same problem...|$|E

By {{the end of}} the 19th Century, Heyl & Patterson had set the industry standard for engineering and manufacturing bulk material handling equipment, such as coal tipples, coal preparation plants, <b>pig</b> iron casting <b>machines</b> and various coal cleaning and handling devices. The company was originally composed of contracting engineers, fabricators and erectors. The industries in the company's initial customer base were not only various types of coal plants, but also cement, chemical, steel, glass, blast furnaces, copper mines, ports, foundries, railroads, shipyards and public utilities.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{accuracy}} of A-mode versus B-mode ultrasound in measuring last-rib backfat, tenth-rib backfat, and tenth-rib longissimus muscle depth. Procedure: Twenty-seven market pigs were measured by three different technicians using five different A-mode ultrasonic machines. Measures included tenth-rib fat depth, tenth-rib longissimus muscle depth, and last-rib fat depth measured at the C and K positions. B-mode measures were collected by a National Swine Improvement Federation-certified technician as the standard for comparison. Results: For last-rib fat depth, the effects of <b>machine</b> and <b>pig</b> were highly significant (P ≤. 001). However, the interaction between <b>machine</b> × <b>pig</b> was also significant (P ≤. 01). <b>Pig</b> and <b>machine</b> × <b>pig</b> interactions {{may be explained by}} overestimating C and K for leaner pigs and underestimating C and K for fatter pigs. At the tenth rib only, the effect of machine was significant (P ≤. 001). For longissimus muscle depth, machine was highly significant (P ≤. 001) and a tendency (P ≤. 1) for the effects of technician and technician × machine interaction was observed. Implications: The accuracy of the estimation of both fat and longissimus muscle depth varies among ultrasound machines, which should be considered when making the decision to purchase ultrasonic equipment...|$|R

Combine the date of dynamic strain and static train in field surveys, by comparing the data, we can think finite element model is correct, and work on the model of stress and strain problem, and propose the reasonable design improvement. The result provides reliable date for improving and optimizing of the Big-Leg of Cantilever Side Material Piling Machine...|$|R
40|$|Data {{recorded}} individually from a {{group of}} young boars is used to quantify the feed intake pattern of growing pigs in the live weight interval from 30 to approx. 100 kg. The boars were feed ad-libitum with feed machines and each time a <b>pig</b> paid the <b>machine</b> a visit the meal size and time were recorded. A Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) is used as a Kalman Filter to smooth the feed intake from the individual pigs. The model is constructed by the principle of superposition of two sub models, one handling the daily fluctuation around the mean, and the other the overall underlying trend. The estimates in the model are updated at each time step. In this way it becomes possible to investigate how the eating dynamics evolve over time. Different eating behavior is found among the individual animals from the same pen. There is an overall tendency that the diurnal feed intake changes from a (rather diffuse) evenly distributed pattern towards a more marked one- or two-peak pattern as the boars grow. [...] ...|$|R
