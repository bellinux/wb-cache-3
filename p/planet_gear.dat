25|$|Having {{the beam}} {{connected}} to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant {{that it was possible}} to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel. The most simple solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic sun and <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E

40|$|Although {{planetary}} gears {{used in an}} industrial region have load equalizing mechanisms in order to equalize distributed loads on <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> each other, those mechanisms may be uneffective dynamically in some cases. In this report, the face bearing patterns, the load distributions on <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> and the dynamic loads on a sun gear in some types of {{planetary gears}} have been measured by strain gages {{in order to obtain}} an easy method of improving the dynamic characteristics of planetary gears. The planetary gears used in the experiment are those with non-crowned <b>planet</b> <b>gears,</b> those with crowned <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> and those with either the movable internal gear or the movable sun gear. Consequently results are as follows. Although using crowned <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> is effective for decreasing the maximum fillet stress owing to improvement of the face bearing patterns, which is uneffective for both equalizing the distributed loads on <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> each other and decreasing the dynamic load. On the other hand, moving either the internal gear or the sun gear, which is a comparatively easy method, is effective for both decreasing the maximum fillet stress and the dynamic load and equalizing the distributed loads on <b>planet</b> <b>gears...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{planetary}} gearbox {{is widely used}} in various rotating systems {{because it can be}} used as a speed reducer or increaser without change in direction of shaft while transferring great driving power. Despite many attempts it is still challenging to diagnose potential faults of the {{planetary gearbox}} because of multiple contacts and axis rotation of <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> resulting in complex vibration characteristics. This paper thus presents an original method to isolate vibration signals induced by the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> from the complex vibration signals for fault diagnostics of the planetary gearbox. First, an in-depth study on the vibration characteristics of <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> is presented using the autocorrelation function of the vibration signal. The autocorrelation-based time synchronous averaging (ATSA) method is then developed for the isolation of the vibration signals produced by the <b>planet</b> <b>gears.</b> The vibration signals were utilized for extracting health related data which facilitate the efficient fault diagnostics of the <b>planet</b> <b>gears.</b> Case study with a wind turbine testbed showed that the proposed method can diagnose the root crack of the <b>planet</b> <b>gears.</b> 1...|$|R

2500|$|Murdoch was the {{inventor}} of the oscillating cylinder steam engine, and gas lighting is attributed to him in the early 1790s, also the term [...] "gasometer". However, Archibald Cochrane, ninth Earl of Dundonald, had already in 1789 used gas for lighting his family estate. Murdoch also made innovations to the steam engine, including the sun and <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> and D slide valve. He invented the steam gun and the pneumatic tube message system, and worked on one of the first British paddle steamers to cross the English Channel. Murdoch built a prototype steam locomotive in 1784 and made a number of discoveries in chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|The mill {{was built}} in 1786 by Matthew Boulton, {{with the backing of}} City financiers and Joah Bates, an organ player and {{composer}} who [...] "embarked all his own money and 10,000/ belonging to his wife" [...] to build it. It was the first steam-powered commercial flour mill in the United Kingdom. James Watt, an associate of Boulton, was personally hired to build a steam engine for the mill to grind corn. Watt's engine was tested before numerous spectators, including Sir Joseph Banks, but encountered problems with the sun and <b>planet</b> <b>gear,</b> and the piston rods. Repairs were completed in April 1786. The cost of erecting the mill proved to be considerably in excess of the original estimate, and Watt soon feared that it {{would turn out to be}} a losing concern. He had no doubt that the engines or the machinery would be able to do all that had been promised; but he feared that the absence of business capacity on the part of the managers would be fatal to the mill's commercial success. In September 1786, the Duke of Milan visited the mills.|$|E
2500|$|One of Murdoch's most {{significant}} inventions, for which evidence exists to attribute it to him, was {{the sun and}} <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> which allowed steam power {{to be used to}} [...] "produce a continued Rotative or Circular Motion round an Axis or Centre, and thereby to give Motion to the Wheels of Mills or other Machines". This gear converted the vertical motion of a beam, driven by a steam engine, into circular motion using a 'planet', a cogwheel fixed {{at the end of a}} rod connected to the beam of the engine. With the motion of the beam this revolved around, and turned, the 'sun' a second rotating cog fixed to and which turned the drive shaft. This system of achieving rotary motion was patented in his own name by James Watt in October 1781 although Samuel Smiles, biographer of Boulton and Watt, attributes this to Murdoch and there also exists a drawing of the sun and planet system in Murdoch's hand dated August 1781. Other evidence attributing this invention to William Murdoch takes the form of a letter from Boulton to a colleague concerning Watt's forthcoming October patents in which he writes: ...|$|E

50|$|Epicyclic gearing or {{planetary}} gearing is a gear system consisting {{of one or}} more outer <b>gears,</b> or <b>planet</b> <b>gears,</b> revolving about a central, or sun <b>gear.</b> Typically, the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> are mounted on a movable arm or carrier, which itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. Epicyclic gearing systems also incorporate the use of an outer ring gear or annulus, which meshes with the <b>planet</b> <b>gears.</b> Planetary gears (or epicyclic gears) are typically classified as simple or compound planetary gears. Simple planetary gears have one sun, one ring, one carrier, and one planet set. Compound planetary gears involve {{one or more of the}} following three types of structures: meshed-planet (there are at least two more planets in mesh with each other in each planet train), stepped-planet (there exists a shaft connection between two planets in each planettrain), and multi-stage structures (the system contains two or more planet sets). Compared to simple planetary gears, compound planetary gears have the advantages of larger reduction ratio, higher torque-to-weight ratio, and more ﬂexible conﬁgurations.|$|R

5000|$|Torque {{multiplier}} - Uses a multi-stage {{epicyclic gearing}} mechanism to multiply torque output. Torque {{is applied to}} the input gear which engages with a number of <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> which are held in a fixed planetary gear. By using a reaction arm, the outside casing of the multiplier is prevented from rotating, causing the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> to rotate around the input gear. Along with the multiplication of torque, there is a decrease in rotational speed of the output shaft compared to the input shaft. This decrease in speed is inversely proportional to the increase in torque. [...] Torque multipliers {{come in a variety of}} output ratios as well.|$|R

50|$|An {{epicyclic}} gear train {{consists of two}} gears mounted so that the center of one gear revolves around {{the center of the}} other.

The planet and sun gears mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip. A point on the pitch circle of the <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> traces an epicycloid curve. In this simplified case, the sun gear is fixed and the planetary gear(s) roll around the sun gear.|$|E
