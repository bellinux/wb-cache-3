40|$|The {{comparison}} between the quality of runoff waters either collected at the outlet of a porous pavement with reservoir structure or coming from a nearby catchment drained by a conventional separate system, on the experimental site of RezC near Nantes (Loire-Atlantique, France) was studied. Four years after {{the beginning of the}} experiment, the results obtained from about 30 rainfall events show that runoff waters which went through the porous pavement contain a markedly lower polluting load than those from the reference catchment. The filtration effect of runoff waters by the reservoir structure can decrease the pollutant concentrations of about 64 % for suspended solids and 79 % for lead. Analyses carried out on materials from both the reservoir structure and the soil show that metallic micropollutants (lead, copper, cadmium, zinc) from runoff waters, accumulate {{on the surface of the}} <b>pervious</b> <b>asphalt</b> for the most part, and at the level of the geotextile layer separating the structure from the underlying soil for a small part. This soil does not appear significantly contaminated even after the 4 -year period during which the structure has been in operation.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{the results from}} an evaluation of reference profilers that was performed in May 2013. The evaluation tested the profile measurement accuracy, profile measurement repeatability, and longitudinal distance measurement accuracy of the reference profilers. The accuracy of the devices was evaluated by comparing the measurements with benchmark measurements that were deemed to be correct. A self-propelled and self-piloting robotic profiler that {{was developed by the}} University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute was used to collect the benchmark profiles. Benchmark longitudinal distance measurements were obtained using a nylon-coated steel tape corrected for temperature. Testing was performed at the MnROAD research facility in Albertville, Minnesota. Six test sections were used for the evaluation. The texture types of the sections were dense-graded asphalt, chip seal, <b>pervious</b> <b>asphalt,</b> transversely tined concrete, longitudinally tined concrete, and diamond ground concrete. Two vendors, Surface Systems and Instruments (SSI) and International Cybernetics Corporation (ICC) participated in the evaluation. Data were collected with a SSI CS 8800 unit and two ICC SurPRO units. The main report summarizes the experiment and provides a listing of which devices achieved a passing score for each criterion on each test section. The appendices provide much more detail about the performance of each device. The appendices include a summary for each device from each experiment, as well as individual “report cards” for each device on each test section...|$|E
40|$|Porous {{pavements}} can be penetrated by rainwater carrying dissolved and particulate matter; therefore investigations {{were carried}} out {{over a period of}} several years to study the drainage behaviour of and to examine the chemical properties of the drainage water from two previous pavements of the BAB A 1 near Nonnweiler and Illingen. The experimental highway sections are different in respect to operation time, daily traffic load, slope and the drainage discharge system. The porous pavement was in both cases 0 / 11 mm porous asphalt. The measurements showed that the discharge of the effluents from the porous asphalts occured with a delay and lasted for a long time. The permeability was limited and varied depending on the time of year. The drainage behaviour of the Illingen section was, even after 2 years of operation, unexpectedly good, in contrast to the Nonnweiler section, where the permeability decreased by 50 % within the same time. Porous pavements are comparable to filter media retaining many pollutants. Acid rains permeating through the <b>pervious</b> <b>asphalts</b> are neutralized. Substances such as PAHs, mineral oil etc. are absorbed on the binding agent, or they attack the bitumen. Winter maintenance with wet salts results in significantly higher chloride concentrations and loads. (orig.)

50|$|Although some porous paving {{materials}} appear nearly indistinguishable from nonporous materials, their environmental effects are qualitatively different. Whether it is <b>pervious</b> concrete, porous <b>asphalt,</b> paving stones or concrete or plastic-based pavers, all these pervious materials allow stormwater to percolate and infiltrate the surface areas, traditionally {{impervious to the}} soil below. The goal is to control stormwater at the source, reduce runoff and improve water quality by filtering pollutants in the substrata layers.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{feature of}} the parking lot is its paved area, hence, by {{changing}} this surface to be more permeable to water the parking lot will drain better. Some surface options are open joint pavers, porous <b>asphalt,</b> <b>pervious</b> concrete, or a turf grid. Drainage {{is an important part of}} a green parking lot because runoff is a serious concern. In addition to using a more porous surface, a more porous subsurface may be used to maximize drainage through the parking lot surface. Drains and low lying areas for water retention can also be components of a green parking lot.|$|R
40|$|This article {{compares the}} {{performance}} of three permeable pavement materials: porous <b>asphalt,</b> <b>pervious</b> concrete and permeable interlocking concrete pavers that have been implemented on low volume residential road applications via a thorough literature review and an analysis of four case studies in the United States. The research was undertaken due to the common belief that permeable road surfaces are deficient in structural integrity due to their porous nature and therefore limiting their use to footpaths, driveways and car parks. Their reduced structural integrity is said to cause a reduction in their design life when compared to traditional surface options. Recent advancements in technology and mix designs have produced successful applications of all three pavement types to low volume road applications therefore dispelling these common beliefs. This study is important as urbanisation is creating more runoff which needs to be sustainably handled and the current infrastructure and land space is already strained. Although the case studies analysed {{in this study are}} in their infancies, all three pavement types are wearing as designed. Porous <b>asphalt,</b> <b>pervious</b> concrete and permeable interlocking concrete pavers have each been successfully implemented on various projects and the current results show that each are feasible for low volume residential road applications. However it is difficult to nominate which pavement type is best for low volume residential road applications as each application and intended use will be unique. Early indications show that pervious concrete may be the most well rounded surface type in terms of costs, maintenance factors, availability of materials, water infiltration effectiveness and desired secondary benefits. This study also discovered that there are no common practices in terms of maintenance techniques and frequencies and recommends this as a further research area. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} make a comprehensive comparison between the relatively new breed of pavement, <b>pervious</b> concrete, and <b>asphalt,</b> a more popular and accepted pavement type. Pervious concrete is mainly used as a pavement surface for green purposes; however, this thesis delves into the possibility that pervious concrete {{may be able to}} offer benefits that allow the green alternative to be cost efficient as well. The comparison will be made over the entirety of the surface life including each pavement design and the materials used, the surface drainage, and the maintenance of each. The pavements were analyzed from a real parking lot while some of the characteristics and values were idealized {{for the purposes of the}} research, but the results could offer motivation for future contractors to utilize both a green and cost effective pavement...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} is an extensive review of full-depth permeable pavements including porous <b>asphalt,</b> <b>pervious</b> concrete, and permeable interlocking concrete pavers (PICP). Also included {{is a brief}} section on articulated concrete blocks/mats. The main topics, which have been divided into chapters, include structural and mix design, hydrologic design, hydraulic performance (i. e. infiltration capacity), maintenance needs/frequency/actions, the impact of permeable pavement on water quality, results of a highway shoulder feasibility study, knowledge gaps, and several cold climate case studies from the United States and Canada. While progress has recently been made with the relatively new permeable pavement technology, researchers have also identified many unresolved issues that are not well understood. These include a methodology to measure subgrade infiltration rates, filling data gaps related to structural integrity, construction, and related issues associated with permeable pavements, determining what maintenance activities are most effective on various pavement types and how frequently specific maintenance actions should be performed, {{a better understanding of}} the processes involved in the observed reduction of contaminant concentrations in stormwater flowing through permeable pavements, and {{a better understanding of the}} performance of permeable pavements over a time frame that better corresponds with a life-span of 20 years...|$|R
40|$|Multi-criteria {{decision}} making methods (MCDM) {{have been widely}} used throughout the last years to assist project contractors in selection processes related to the construction field. Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) are an especially suitable discipline to implement these techniques, since they involve important impacts on each branch of sustainability: economy, environment and society. Considering that pervious pavements constitute an efficient solution to manage urban stormwater runoff as a source control system, this paper presents a multi-criteria approach based on the Integrated Value Model for Sustainable Assessments (MIVES) method to facilitate their proper selection. Given the lack of accurate information to shape the behavior of the alternatives regarding some of the criteria defining the decision-making environment, a series of variables are modeled by executing stochastic simulations based on the Monte Carlo methods. Additionally, a group of ten experts from various sectors related to water management was requested to provide their opinions {{about the importance of the}} set of selected criteria, according to the comparison levels of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). These judgments are converted into triangular fuzzy numbers, in order to capture the vagueness that human attitude entails when making judgments. A case of study in which the three major types of <b>pervious</b> pavements (porous <b>asphalt,</b> porous concrete and interlocking concrete pavers) are evaluated is presented to demonstrate the potential of the model...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{pavement}} is {{a special}} type of pavement that allows rain and snowmelt to pass through it, thereby reducing the runoff from a site and surrounding areas. In addition, porous pavement filters some pollutants from the runoff if maintained. There {{are two types of}} porous pavement: porous <b>asphalt</b> and <b>pervious</b> concrete. Porous <b>asphalt</b> pavement consists of an open-graded coarse aggregate, bonded together by asphalt cement, with sufficient interconnected voids to make it highly permeable to water. Pervious concrete consists of specially formulated mixtures of Portland cement, uniform, open-graded coarse aggregate, and water. Pervious concrete has enough void space to allow rapid percolation of liquids through the pavement. The porous pavement surface is typically placed over a highly permeable layer of open-graded gravel and crushed stone. The void spaces in the aggregate layers act as a storage reservoir for runoff. A filter fabric is placed beneath the gravel and stone layers to screen out fine soil particles. Figure 1 illustrates a common porous asphalt pavement installation. Two common modifications made in designing porous pavement systems are (1) varying the amount of storage in the stone reservoir beneath the pavement and (2) adding perforated pipes {{near the top of the}} reservoir to discharge excess storm water after the reservoir has been filled. Some municipalities have also added storm water reservoirs (in addition to stone reservoirs) beneath the pavement. These reservoirs should be designed to accommodate runoff from a design storm and should provide for infiltration through the underlying subsoil. APPLICABILITY Porous pavement may substitute for conventional pavement on parking areas, areas with light traffic, and the shoulders of airport taxiways a runways, provided that the grades, subsoils, drainage characteristics, and groundwater conditions are suitable. Slopes should be flat or very gentle. Soils should have field-verified permeability rates of greater than 1. 3 centimeters (0. 5 inches) per hour, and there should be a 1. 2 meter (4 -foot) minimum clearance from the bottom of the system to bedrock or the water table...|$|R
