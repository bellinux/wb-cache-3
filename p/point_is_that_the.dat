5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic {{look back at the}} early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E
25|$|In this example, the key <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{kinetic energy}} is {{quadratic}} in the velocity. The equipartition theorem {{shows that in}} thermal equilibrium, any degree of freedom (such {{as a component of}} the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of kBT and therefore contributes kB to the system's heat capacity. This has many applications.|$|E
25|$|The <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> idea {{of space}} {{vehicles}} shaped like flying saucers was imprinted {{in the national}} psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place. It didn't take much stretching for the first observers of UFOs {{to assume that the}} unknown objects hovering in the sky had the same disk shape as the science fictional vehicles.|$|E
50|$|A {{particular}} construction {{found in}} English (particularly in speech) {{is the use}} of two successive copulas when only one appears necessary, as in My <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that....</b> <b>The</b> acceptability of this construction is a disputed matter in English prescriptive grammar.|$|R

50|$|BDS C {{was very}} memory efficient, with fast {{compilation}} speeds. Weak <b>points</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> floating <b>point</b> math routines and the file access functions were {{incompatible with the}} Unix C compilers and its relocatable object files were not compatible with the Microsoft assembler, {{making it more difficult}} to integrate C code with assembly language.|$|R
25|$|The writing {{style of}} the lyrics is {{deliberately}} obscure; Oakey says this is because he wanted the band's lyrics to provoke thought and get people talking about their songs. Often the meanings behind the songs have only been disclosed by Oakey in various interviews given since the album's release. An important <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album essentially evolved during 1981 and wasn't written from a single conceptual starting point.|$|E
25|$|Direct and inverse {{images of}} sheaves Every {{continuous}} map f : X → Y between topological spaces induces a functor f ∗ from {{the category of}} sheaves (of sets, or abelian groups, or rings...) on X to the corresponding category of sheaves on Y, the direct image functor. It also induces a functor f −1 from the category of sheaves of abelian groups on Y to the category of sheaves of abelian groups on X, the inverse image functor. f −1 is left adjoint to f ∗. Here a more subtle <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> left adjoint for coherent sheaves will differ from that for sheaves (of sets).|$|E
25|$|Another <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> four {{most popular}} Arabic metres (the ṭawīl, kāmil, wāfir and basīṭ) are hardly used {{at all in}} Persian, while three of the basic Persian metres are not found in Arabic. In addition, one of the {{characteristics}} of Arabic poetry, namely the anceps positions (that is, certain places in the line where a syllable can be either long or short), do not apply to the Persian version of the Arabic metres, since in Persian, except sometimes for the opening syllable and the possibility of substituting a long syllable for two shorts, every half line has exactly the same pattern of longs and shorts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} {{brought by}} the plaintiff contained four points, {{one of which was}} abandoned due to a mistake of fact. <b>The</b> abandoned <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> record did not state <b>that</b> Weems <b>was</b> arraigned, <b>that</b> he issued a plea to the complaint upon his demurrer being overruled, and <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> [...] "ordered to plead to the complaint." ...|$|R
30|$|Even {{though this}} example is simple, the {{implementation}} {{can benefit from}} several features of GridGain and provide a complex parallel implementation of membrane systems. <b>The</b> main <b>points</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> implementation <b>is</b> faithful to the formal description of the membrane systems, {{and it is also}} scalable to a high number of membranes (which is the case in cell biology simulations).|$|R
30|$|The loss of {{reduction}} is rarely encountered after crossed pins fixation and it usually occurs due to technical errors (Brauer et al. 2007; Omid et al. 2008). In present study, the reduction quality was same in both groups. Its retrospective nature {{was the main}} weak point of the current study. Another weak <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> surgical techniques <b>were</b> selected by surgeons.|$|R
25|$|The {{sweet potato}} was grown in Polynesia before western exploration. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the Cook Islands to 1000 AD, and current {{thinking}} {{is that it was}} brought to central Polynesia around 700 AD, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, and spread across Polynesia to Hawaii and New Zealand from there. It is possible, however, that South Americans brought it to the Pacific, although this is unlikely as it was the Polynesians who had a strong maritime tradition and not the native South Americans. The theory that the plant could spread by floating seeds across the ocean is not supported by evidence. Another <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sweet potato in Polynesia is the cultivated Ipomoea batatas, which is generally spread by vine cuttings and not by seeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of transport for importers supports the alternating-access model. The resting state of importers is inward-facing, where the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) dimer interface is held open by the TMDs and facing outward but occluded from the cytoplasm. Upon docking of the closed, substrate-loaded binding protein towards the periplasmic {{side of the}} transmembrane domains, ATP binds and the NBD dimer closes. This switches the resting state of transporter into an outward-facing conformation, in which the TMDs have reoriented to receive substrate from the binding protein. After hydrolysis of ATP, the NBD dimer opens and substrate is released into the cytoplasm. Release of ADP and Pi reverts the transporter into its resting state. The only inconsistency of this mechanism to the ATP-switch model is that the conformation in its resting, nucleotide-free state {{is different from the}} expected outward-facing conformation. Although that is the case, the key <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NBD does not dimerize unless ATP and binding protein is bound to the transporter.|$|E
500|$|We {{are also}} of opinion {{that as the}} right of the {{plaintiff}} to sue was given by, and is dependent upon, the statute, the statute of limitations is a bar to the action. By the act of 1845, the actions thereby authorized are to be brought and maintained ‘in the same time’ as if brought by citizens of the state. The question is not whether an Indian title can be barred by adverse possession, or by state statutes of limitation. The <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plaintiff cannot invoke the special remedy given by the statute, without being bound by the conditions upon which it is given.|$|E
30|$|The {{basic concept}} of quasi-Monte Carlo method {{is based on}} moving the random sample in Monte Carlo method with {{definite}} points accurately. The criterion of selection of definite <b>points</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequence in [0, 1)s has better uniformity than a random sequence. Indeed, these <b>points</b> should <b>be</b> such <b>that</b> [0, 1)s <b>is</b> covered uniformly. To measure uniformity, a different concept is used as explained in the following definitions.|$|R
2500|$|Bunting's <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Channel Islanders [...] "did {{not fight}} on the beaches, in the fields or in the streets. [...] They did not commit suicide, {{and they did not}} kill any Germans. [...] Instead they settled down, with few overt signs of resistance, to a hard, dull but {{relatively}} peaceful five years of occupation, in which more than half the population was working for the Germans." ...|$|R
2500|$|But few {{cared about}} such details. [...] <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Queen had touched a nerve when she [...] "declared" [...] so {{publicly}} that ordinary Greeks found Ancient Greek [...] "incomprehensible". [...] "The {{translation of the}} Bible into Modern Greek implied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> modern language <b>was</b> sufficiently different from <b>the</b> ancient language <b>that</b> uneducated people could not read Holy Writ.

500|$|In {{an article}} written after the episode's broadcast, actress Kate Flannery {{observed}} that [...] "lots of questions" [...] were answered {{and that it}} was [...] "like a movie." [...] Referring to the agreed-to date between Jim and Pam, Flannery said, [...] "The <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> elephant in the room has not only been addressed but asked to dinner. Makes Season 4 seem filled with possibilities – like an empty glass in front of a full bar." [...] In an article written around the time of actor Steve Carell's last performance on The Office in 2011, IGN's Cindy White listed Michael's quote about Jan's [...] "breast enhancement" [...] as among the best of the series. Dan Philipps, another writer for IGN, ranked Jim's date proposal among the best moments for the couple, stating that [...] "after toying with fans' expectations for two whole seasons, the series' writers finally allowed fans to breathe a sigh of relief. For many, the moment was well worth the wait." ...|$|E
500|$|Responding to this {{emphasis}} on pleasure, Albert Guerard, Jr. argues that the poem contains a [...] "longing not for art but a free reverie of any kind. The form of the poem is that of progression by association, so that the movement of feeling is {{at the mercy of}} words evoked by chance, such words as fade and forlorn, the very words that, like a bell, toll the dreamer back to his sole self." [...] However, Fogle points out that the terms Guerard emphasizes are [...] "associational translations" [...] and that Guerard misunderstands Keats's aesthetic. After all, the acceptance of the loss of pleasure {{by the end of the}} poem is an acceptance of life and, in turn, of death. Death was a constant theme that permeated aspects of Keats poetry because he was exposed to death of his family members throughout his life. Within the poem, there are many images of death. The nightingale experiences a sort of death and even the god Apollo experiences death, but his death reveals his own divine state. As Perkins explains, [...] "But, of course, the nightingale is not thought to be literally dying. The <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deity or the nightingale can sing without dying. But, as the ode makes clear, man cannot—or at least not in a visionary way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lincoln {{elaborated}} {{his position}} in his famous Cooper Union speech before Republican elites in New York on [...] February 27, 1860. He argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Founding Fathers expected slavery to die a natural death, not to spread. His <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Founding Fathers <b>were</b> anti-slavery and <b>the</b> notion <b>that</b> slavery <b>was</b> good was a radical innovation that violated American ideals. This speech solidified Lincoln's base in the Republican Party and helped assure his nomination.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Community-Embedded Reproductive Health Care for Adolescents (CERCA) Project was {{implemented}} in Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua (2011 – 2014) {{to test the}} effectiveness of interventions preventing teenage pregnancies. As the outcome evaluation showed limited impact, a post-hoc process evaluation was carried out to determine if and how CERCA’s design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation affected the results. We did a document analysis and conducted 18 in-depth interviews and 21 focus group discussions with stakeholders and beneficiaries. Transcripts were analyzed using directed content analysis. Data showed that CERCA sensitized stakeholders and encouraged the discussion on this sensitive issue. In terms of design, a strong <b>point</b> <b>was</b> the participatory approach; a weak <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> detailed situation analysis was completed too late. In terms of implementation, a strong <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> multifaceted activities <b>were</b> implemented; a weak <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> activities <b>were</b> not pilot tested for feasibility/acceptability and evolved substantially throughout the Project. In terms of monitoring, strong <b>points</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> regular monitoring kept the Project on track administratively/financially; a weak <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> monitoring indicators did not change as the intervention package changed. In terms of evaluation, weak <b>points</b> <b>were</b> the substantial attrition rate and narrow focus on adolescents. This study provides recommendations for future projects...|$|R

2500|$|The key <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ising {{model has}} a spin-spin interaction, making it energetically {{favourable}} for two adjacent spins to be aligned. On the other hand, thermal fluctuations typically introduce a randomness into the alignment of spins. At some critical temperature, [...] , spontaneous magnetization {{is said to}} occur. This means that below [...] the spin-spin interaction will begin to dominate, {{and there is some}} net alignment of spins in one of the two directions.|$|E

50|$|A {{complication}} at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> DNA polymerase {{used was}} destroyed by the high heat used {{at the start of}} each replication cycle and had to be replaced. In 1986, Saiki started to use Thermophilus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase to amplify segments of DNA. The Taq polymerase was heat resistant and would only need to be added once, thus making the technique dramatically more affordable and subject to automation. This has created revolutions in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, medicine and forensics.|$|R

2500|$|The telling <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "mask" [...] of coolness is worn {{not only}} in time of stress, but also of pleasure, in fields of {{expressive}} performance and the dance.
