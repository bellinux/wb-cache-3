5|$|The entire works was {{upgraded}} between 1956 and 1969, in five distinct phases. The {{plan was}} announced in January 1956, and was expected to cost £1 million. The first phase was {{the construction of a}} filter <b>pressing</b> <b>plant,</b> for which the main contractor was Norwest Construction Co Ltd, while the actual presses and other plant were supplied by S. H. Johnson and Co Ltd. This phase was completed in 1962, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 May 1963. The second phase consisted of a preliminary treatment plant, a storm sewage separation plant, and metering of the flows within the plant. This was completed in 1965. The third phase was split into two parts, which initially involved the building of new primary sedimentation tanks. Once these were operational in 1969, the old sedimentation tanks were converted to become temporary storm sewage tanks. This fourth phase was called phase 3b, and was completed in 1970. The final phase was the construction of a sludge incinerator, which was completed in 1969 and meant that the pressed sewage cake {{did not have to be}} taken to Thrybergh to be dumped.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local <b>pressing</b> <b>plant</b> to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} strikes {{in the summer}} of 1915 imposed the eight-hour day on the town's factories; rather than moving {{business}} elsewhere, the success spread the eight-hour day throughout the Northeast. The First World War continued the city's expansion so that, {{on the eve of the}} Great Depression, there were more than 500 factories in Bridgeport, including Columbia Records' primary <b>pressing</b> <b>plant.</b> The build-up to World War II helped its recovery in the late 1930s.|$|E

25|$|In 1969 Capitol Records' <b>Pressing</b> <b>Plant</b> in Scranton began {{phasing out}} its vinyl {{manufacturing}} {{in favor of}} the new Winchester plant. Records pressed here include the Beatles' Abbey Road, Simon and Garfunkel's The Concert in Central Park and Richard Pryor's self-titled album. Capitol Records announced in late 1987 that it would end tape duplicating production in the US, in favor of offshore manufacturing, including in Winchester by early 1988, putting more than 500 employees out of work when they closed the Winchester plant.|$|E
25|$|Winchester {{was home}} to Capitol Record's East Coast <b>Pressing</b> <b>Plant.</b> Capitol Records Distribution Corporation {{announced}} in 1968 the purchasing of land in Winchester, Va for a new record processing plant. Along with this plant they built several houses, bought a few small business and later built a tape production plant. The Winchester plant began construction in 1968 and production in 1969. The plant initially had a workforce of 250 people. This plant complemented the other existing manufacturing facilities of Capitol Records in Scranton, PA, Jacksonville, FL and Los Angeles, CA.|$|E
500|$|On 23 February, The Sun {{reported}} that Universal {{had received the}} first shipment of Faryl, but due to a pressing error, though they looked like Smith's albums, they actually contained the music of The Fall's album Imperial Wax Solvent. Universal {{was reported to have}} [...] "severe words" [...] with the <b>pressing</b> <b>plant.</b> The mix-up received attention from the international press, including an article in Canadian magazine Exclaim!.|$|E
50|$|The pink label was {{replaced}} by the 'pink rim/palm tree' label at this point, but there was a small cross-over period. At the same time, Island changed its main <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> from those of Phonogram to EMI.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} version of Moanin' in the Moonlight featured cover artwork by Don S. Bronstein and sleeve notes by Billboard editor Paul Ackerman. The label pressings {{from the original}} series have different colors on it because several <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> were used.|$|R
500|$|In Los Angeles {{there were}} a number of record {{mastering}} and <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> that were not [...] "first in line" [...] to press records for the major labels, usually only getting work when the larger plants were overloaded. These <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> were more than happy to generate income by pressing bootlegs of dubious legality. Sometimes they simply hid the bootleg work when record company executives would come around (in which case the printed label could show the artist and song names) and other times secrecy required labels with fictitious names. For example, a 1974 Pink Floyd bootleg called Brain Damage was released under the name The Screaming Abadabs, which was one of the band's early names. Because of their ability to get records and covers pressed unquestioned by these <b>pressing</b> <b>plants,</b> bootleggers were able to produce artwork and packaging that a commercial label would be unlikely to issue – perhaps most notoriously the 1962 recording of The Beatles at the Star Club in Hamburg, which was bootlegged as The Beatles vs. the Third Reich (a parody on an early US album entitled The Beatles vs. the Four Seasons), or Elvis' Greatest Shit, a collection of the least successful of Elvis Presley's recordings, mostly from film soundtracks.|$|R
500|$|Eddy Current Suppression Ring {{formed in}} 2004, {{as a group}} of friends writing and {{performing}} songs together for fun. They decided to keep making their music when they discovered that other people liked it. The band recorded their first song as a trio, at a vinyl <b>pressing</b> <b>plant</b> where Eddy Current (real name Mikey Young) was working at the time. After they took a liking to the resulting song, they recruited Rob Solid (real name Brad Barry) to play bass guitar. The group recorded their debut self-titled album in four hours in a rehearsal studio, and released it in 2006 on the Australian label Dropkick Records.|$|E
500|$|Vicious debuted {{with the}} band at London's Notre Dame Hall on 28 March. In May, the band signed with Virgin Records, their third new label {{in little more than}} half a year. Virgin was more than ready to release [...] "God Save the Queen", but new {{obstacles}} arose. Workers at the <b>pressing</b> <b>plant</b> laid down their tools in protest at the song's content. Jamie Reid's now famous cover, showing Queen Elizabeth II with her features obscured by the song and band names in cutout letters, offended the sleeve's plate makers. After much talk, production resumed and the record was finally released on 27 May.|$|E
500|$|After {{a year in}} existence, {{the band}} had earned a total of $600. They now faced two options: divide the money among the members, or press the {{recordings}} they had made with Zientara at Inner Ear. Choosing the latter, Nelson, Strejcek and MacKaye formed Dischord Records with Groff's help, to release the recordings. The band sent the tapes to a <b>pressing</b> <b>plant</b> in Nashville, Tennessee that specialized in pressing country music records. Initially puzzled by the request to put eight songs on a 7" [...] record, they pressed 1,000 copies. For the cover, the band took apart another 7" [...] record sleeve and {{used it as a}} template for their own cover design. They photocopied it on 11" [...] × 17" [...] paper, which the band members cut out with scissors, folded and glued by hand, then into these inserted the records and lyric sheets. Released in December 1980, Minor Disturbance was a local success, receiving radio airplay and reviews from fanzines such as Touch and Go, which meant that Dischord now had enough money to release records by other bands.|$|E
50|$|Celtic Folkweave {{was never}} reissued in either LP or CD format. The master tapes of the {{recording}} may have been destroyed in a fire {{at one of the}} vinyl <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> of Polydor Ireland in 1982. Copies of the original vinyl album Celtic Folkweave are considered rare collector's items.|$|R
50|$|More master {{recordings}} {{would be}} duplicated from the equalized master for regional copying purposes (for example {{to send to}} several <b>pressing</b> <b>plants).</b> Pressing masters for vinyl recordings would be created. Often these interim recordings were referred to as Mother Tapes. All vinyl records would derive {{from one of the}} master recordings.|$|R
5000|$|The label {{announced}} its closure in February 2015. Its statement announcing the closure {{stated that the}} production cost of vinyl albums had become prohibitive, {{and that they were}} facing significant backlogs at <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> because [...] "the vinyl comeback and Record Store Day disproportionately favour Beatles reissues" [...] over small independent companies.|$|R
500|$|In August 2010, it was {{announced}} that band would be releasing a second box set after Soundtrack to the Apocalypse (2003), and would include every one of Slayer's studio albums from 1986's Reign In Blood to 2009's World Painted Blood. It originally had a price tag of $199.99, but is now sold at retail price of $149.98. It was released through American Recordings and Sony. Blabbermouth.net noted that they are [...] "treating the albums the way they would treat a great jazz, classical, Bob Dylan or Miles Davis record, something that isn't normally done for metal records." [...] To increase quality, Lacquers were cut several times, and the original albums were remastered. It was released as a high-quality 180gram audiophile vinyl, pressed at RTI, an American <b>pressing</b> <b>plant.</b> The vinyl discs are packaged in a standard, clear inner sleeve to preserve the vinyl, and are also in high-quality litho-wrapped jackets, and boxed in a slipcase. Reproductions of the original albums inner sleeve artwork were converted to 12inch square inserts to fit the standard vinyl disc covers.|$|E
500|$|As {{the record}} neared {{completion}} by August 2003, the band performed {{for a short}} time for the armed forces in the Middle East and premiered more new songs at their Reading and Leeds sets. The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the <b>pressing</b> <b>plant.</b> For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good time in my life. I was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Painters and Dockers {{released}} seven albums between 1984 and 1994, {{which featured}} {{a selection of}} sarcastic and amusing singles, such as [...] "Die Yuppie Die" [...] from 1988's Kiss My Art and pro-queer and anti-monarchy [...] "I Know Better Queens Than That" [...] from 1994's The Things That Matter. Their greatest chart success was achieved with 1985's [...] "Nude School" [...] which received air play {{on a number of}} commercial radio stations and which was marked by its controversial lyrics and video clip. At one time, The Painters and Dockers even co-owned a vinyl record <b>pressing</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
25|$|James was meticulous {{about the}} process of recording, {{mastering}} and pressing. He tried a number of <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> until he was satisfied with the quality of each EP. James prefers vinyl or tape to digital. However, label co-owner Wilson-Claridge convinced him to release a CD compilation (Chosen Lords) with 10 tracks from the Analord series.|$|R
50|$|S&N British Data Archive Ltd {{was founded}} in 1999 to work with CD <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> and the Public Records Office (PRO) now known as The National Archives to make the project a reality.

50|$|The lands {{around the}} village of Algoz is used for {{agricultural}} production. The produce includes wheat, almonds, figs and olive oil. There are also vineyards. There are also many hot houses for growing tomatoes, cauliflowers, strawberries and other early fruits which are the sent off to the big central markets. There are also flourmillls and olive <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> in the parish.|$|R
2500|$|Their {{distribution}} {{deal with}} Unicorn—which {{was associated with}} MCA Records—resulted in an initial pressing of 25,000 copies. MCA Records president Al Bergamo listened to the album prior to release and claimed that it was [...] "anti-parent", although he never cited a specific lyric {{that led him to}} that conclusion. As a result, MCA refused to distribute the already-pressed-and-packaged album which bore an MCA Distributing Corp. logo on the lower right corner of the back cover. Black Flag members had to personally visit the <b>pressing</b> <b>plant</b> and apply a sticker over the MCA logo which read, [...] "As a parent... I found it an anti-parent record"—thus essentially throwing Bergamo's words back in his face.|$|E
2500|$|Because Vee-Jay {{wanted to}} get as many copies of the record pressed as quickly as possible, it did not insist on {{uniformity}} from one <b>pressing</b> <b>plant</b> to another. As a result, a dizzying number of label variations exist. Some of these added a comma to the song title, rendering it as [...] "Please, Please Me". Additionally, some copies of the record were issued with a picture sleeve. Early promotional copies had a special sleeve proclaiming [...] "Please Please Me" [...] as [...] "The Record That Started Beatlemania". The text on the sleeve noted that the Beatles had just appeared on Paar's program and were scheduled to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show in February. This sleeve is considered to be extremely rare.|$|E
2500|$|From 1981 until 1987, Zomba labels were {{distributed}} by Arista. [...] Following that, Zomba {{signed a deal}} with RCA for distribution that lasted until 1991. [...] The end of the deal coincided with BMG purchasing {{a large share of}} RCA and a deal with BMG was signed for distribution. [...] BMG remained the North American distributor for Zomba until after the purchase in 2002, however, other regions had various other distributors over time. [...] EMI became an important distributor for Zomba in Europe via Virgin Records, but distribution details are listed below in the Regional Branches section. [...] Zomba only controls one small vinyl <b>pressing</b> <b>plant,</b> therefore, most of their manufacturing has been outsourced to companies such as Sonopress (BMG affiliated), Sony and Technicolor.|$|E
5000|$|Dude Incredible was {{announced}} for release on Touch and Go Records official website in July 2014. In the announcement, {{it was revealed}} that vinyl editions of the album were mastered [...] "entirely in the analog domain" [...] using a process known as direct metal mastering. The vinyl discs were manufactured at Record Technology, Inc. in Camarillo, California using the <b>pressing</b> <b>plant's</b> HQ-180 system.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{the smaller}} record {{mastering}} and <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> simply hid the bootleg work when record company executives would come around (in {{which case the}} printed label could show the artist and song names) and other times they would print labels with fictitious names. For example, the 1972 Pink Floyd bootleg called Brain Damage was released under the name The Screaming Abdabs.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{isolated}} reports of CD discolouring with discs from other <b>pressing</b> <b>plants,</b> but these {{do not seem}} to be as widespread and may be due to other reasons than the manufacturing error that occurred at PDO. In particular, colour changes that occur along with the visible disintegration of the data layer (i.e. holes) are not typical of CD bronzing, but should be considered CD rot.|$|R
2500|$|In 1994 the Scissor Girls began {{recording}} {{their first}} 10” LP, “,” {{this time for}} Quinnah Records. The Scissor Girls first LP was delayed numerous times due to Quinnah’s tight budget at the time. When Quinnah finally did send the group’s master tapes to be pressed, the group discovered that the record <b>pressing</b> <b>plant</b> to which the masters had been sent had burned down, further delaying the album, but not affecting the master tapes, which were unharmed. The album was finally released in late 1994 as an expanded 12” LP, 500 copies of which were released on marbled gray vinyl, and all of which included a fold-out map hand-drawn by Youssefi. The CD version of “From: The Scissor Girls To: The Imaginary Layer on Skeletons” was released by The Making of Americans label, run by the New York City queercore duo, God is My Co-Pilot.|$|E
2500|$|Before its release, [...] "Merry Xmas Everybody" [...] {{received}} {{about half a}} million advance orders. 350,000copies were bought upon its release on 7December 1973. On 15December, it became the third song by Slade to enter the UK Singles Chart at number one in its first week, the sixth number one of their career, and the fastest selling single in the UK. Polydor, Slade's record label, were forced to use their French <b>pressing</b> <b>plant</b> {{to keep up with}} the demand, and the song eventually went on to sell over one million copies, becoming the Christmas number one of 1973, beating another Christmas-themed song, [...] "I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday" [...] by Wizzard. [...] "Merry Xmas Everybody" [...] remained number one until mid-January, and stayed in the Top 50 for nine weeks. That it remained in the charts after Christmas caused confusion for Holder, who wondered why people continued to buy it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} first issued on compact disc by Columbia Records in 1983, {{although}} early pressings were pressed in Japan by CSR Compact Disc, which was etched {{in the inner}} ring. This CD {{was one of the}} first pressed at CBS/Sony's Digital Audio Disc Plant in Terre Haute, Indiana CD <b>pressing</b> <b>plant.</b> The Columbia McCartney Discs are prized by audiophiles for their mastering. In 1993, Venus and Mars was remastered and reissued on CD as part of [...] "The Paul McCartney Collection" [...] series with [...] "Zoo Gang" [...] (a UK television theme that was the UK B-side of [...] "Band on the Run" [...] in 1974), [...] "Lunch Box/Odd Sox" [...] (B-side of [...] "Coming Up" [...] in 1980) and [...] "My Carnival" [...] ("Spies Like Us"' B-side in 1985) as bonus tracks.

50|$|As of 2011 many <b>pressing</b> <b>plants</b> {{have been}} {{reactivated}} and new releases in vinyl are appearing on an increasing basis, causing what many have called {{a revival of}} the format.

50|$|The {{event has}} been criticised for {{catering}} to record collectors, rather than casual music fans, and delaying {{the release of}} non-affiliated records by monopolising the capacity of record <b>pressing</b> <b>plants.</b> Major labels {{have been accused of}} hijacking the event, and the policy of shops being obliged to buy on a no-return basis has been criticised, along with many of the limited releases being re-sold online within hours, at inflated prices.|$|R
