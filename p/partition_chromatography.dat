Fractionation of an ethyl acetate extract from licorice root by centrifugal <b>partitioning</b> <b>chromatography</b> yielded 51 fractions, which were characterized by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and screened for activity in yeast estrogen bioassays. One third of the fractions displayed estrogenic activity towards either one or both estrogen receptors (ERs; ERα and ERβ). Glabrene-rich fractions displayed an estrogenic response, predominantly to the ERα. Surprisingly, glabridin did not exert agonistic activity to both ER subtypes. Several fractions displayed higher responses than the maximum response obtained with the reference compound, the natural hormone 17 β-estradiol Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi: 10. 1007 /s 00216 - 011 - 5061 - 9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users...|$|R

2500|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} is {{a method}} of physical separation in which the components of a liquid mixture are distributed between two immiscible phases, i.e., stationary and mobile. The practice of LC {{can be divided into}} five categories, i.e., adsorption chromatography, <b>partition</b> <b>chromatography,</b> ion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, and affinity chromatography. Among these, the most widely used variant is the reverse-phase (RP) mode of the <b>partition</b> <b>chromatography</b> technique, which makes use of a non-polar (hydrophobic) stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. [...] In common applications, the mobile phase is a mixture of water and other polar solvents (e.g., methanol, isopropanol, and acetonitrile), and the stationary matrix is prepared by attaching long-chain alkyl groups (e.g., n-octadecyl or C18) to the surface of [...] irregularly or spherically shaped 5 μm diameter silica particles.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Partition</b> <b>{{chromatography}}</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} kinds of chromatography that chemists developed. The partition coefficient principle has been applied in paper chromatography, thin layer chromatography, gas phase and liquid–liquid separation applications. The 1952 Nobel Prize in chemistry was earned by Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge for their development of the technique, which was used for their separation of amino acids. <b>Partition</b> <b>chromatography</b> uses a retained solvent, on the surface or within the grains or fibers of an [...] "inert" [...] solid supporting matrix as with paper chromatography; or takes advantage of some coulombic and/or hydrogen donor interaction with the stationary phase. Analyte molecules partition between a liquid stationary phase and the eluent. Just as in Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC; a sub-technique within HPLC), this method separates analytes based on differences in their polarity. HILIC most often uses a bonded polar stationary phase and a mobile phase made primarily of acetonitrile with water as the strong component. Partition HPLC has been used historically on unbonded silica or alumina supports. Each works effectively for separating analytes by relative polar differences. HILIC bonded phases have the advantage of separating acidic, basic and neutral solutes in a single chromatographic run.|$|E
2500|$|To {{get to this}} point, Sanger refined a <b>partition</b> <b>chromatography</b> method first {{developed}} by Richard Laurence Millington Synge and Archer John Porter Martin to determine the composition of amino acids in wool. Sanger used a chemical reagent 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (now, also known as Sanger's reagent, fluorodinitrobenzene, FDNB or DNFB), sourced from poisonous gas research by Bernhard Charles Saunders at the Chemistry Department at Cambridge University. Sanger's reagent proved effective at labelling the [...] N-terminal amino group {{at one end of}} the polypeptide chain. He then partially hydrolysed the insulin into short peptides, either with hydrochloric acid or using an enzyme such as trypsin. The mixture of peptides was fractionated in two dimensions on a sheet of filter paper, first by electrophoresis in one dimension and then, perpendicular to that, by chromatography in the other. The different peptide fragments of insulin, detected with ninhydrin, moved to different positions on the paper, creating a distinct pattern that Sanger called [...] "fingerprints". [...] The peptide from the N-terminus could be recognised by the yellow colour imparted by the FDNB label and the identity of the labelled amino acid at the end of the peptide determined by complete acid hydrolysis and discovering which dinitrophenyl-amino acid was there.|$|E

Several fractions displayed higher responses than the maximum response obtained with the reference compound, the natural hormone 17 ß-estradiol (E 2). The estrogenic activities of all fractions, including this so-called superinduction, were clearly ER-mediated, as the estrogenic response was inhibited by 20 – 60 % by known ER antagonists, and no activity was found in yeast cells that did not express the ERa or ERß subtype. Prolonged exposure of the yeast to the estrogenic fractions that showed superinduction did, contrary to E 2, not result in a decrease of the fluorescent response. Therefore, the superinduction was most likely the result of stabilization of the ER, yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein, or a combination of both. Most fractions displaying superinduction were rich in flavonoids with single prenylation. Glabridin displayed ERa-selective antagonism, similar to the ERa-selective antagonist RU 58668. Whereas glabridin was able to reduce the estrogenic response of E 2 by approximately 80 % at 6 ¿×¿ 10 - 6 M, glabrene-rich fractions only exhibited agonistic responses, preferentially on ERa...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is on {{hydrophilic}} interaction chromatography (HILIC) and the preparation of stationary phases for HILIC. The mechanism of HILIC is also discussed; {{a large part of}} the discussion has been adapted from a review written by me and professor Irgum for the Journal of Separation Science (ref 34). By reevaluating the literature we have revealed that the notion of HILIC as simply <b>partitioning</b> <b>chromatography</b> needed modification. However, our interest in the HILIC mechanism was mainly inspired by the need to understand how to construct the optimal HILIC stationary phase. The ultimate stationary phase for HILIC is still not found. My theory is that a non-charged stationary phase capable of retaining a full hydration layer even at extreme acetonitrile (> 85 %) concentrations should give a HILIC stationary phase with a more pure partitioning retention behavior similar to that of a swollen C 18 reversed phase. The preparation of a sorbitol methacrylate grafted silica stationary phase is one of our attempts at producing such a stationary phase. The preparation of such a grafted silica has been performed, but with huge difficulty and this work is still far from producing a column of commercial quality and reprodicibility. This thesis also discusses a new method for the initiation of atom transfer radical polymerization from chlorinated silica. This new grafting scheme theoretically results in a silica particle grafted with equally long polymer chains, anchored to the silica carrier by a hydrolytically stable silicon-carbon bond. The hydrolytic stability is especially important for HILIC stationary phases due to the high water concentration at the surface...|$|R
