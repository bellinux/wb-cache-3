30|$|For the {{estimated}} coefficients in Columns (1)–(4), economic development (lnGDPPC) and manufacturing (lnM) are significant. We find that economic development increases CIWB. In fact, empirical {{results suggest that}} carbon dioxide emissions increase {{with the increase in}} GDP per capita (Fei et al. 2011; Alkhathlan and Javid 2013). For example, Fei et al. (2011) examine the causal relationship between CO_ 2 emissions, energy consumption and economic growth for 30 <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>China</b> from 1985 to 2007. The long run positive cointegrated relationship of their paper showed that if GDP per capita increases by 1 %, energy consumption will increase by 0.50 % approximately, while CO_ 2 emissions will increase by 0.43 %. Therefore, a possible reason for the effect of economic development on CIWB is that economic development and carbon dioxide emissions are positively related, and economic development and human well-being are positively related. But the effect of economic development on carbon dioxide emissions is larger than that on human well-being.|$|E

If agricultural systems fail to provide enough food diversity and quantity to satisfy all the nutrients essential to human life, people will suffer, societies will deteriorate and national development efforts will stagnate.

This has resulted in an increasing prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies (e. g., iron deficiency, and zinc deficiency) that now afflicts over three billion people globally, mostly among resource-poor women, infants and children in developing countries. The consequences of micronutrient malnutrition are profound and alarming for human existence. Agricultural approaches to finding sustainable solutions to this problem are urgently needed.

40|$|Background: Hand, foot, {{and mouth}} disease (HFMD) has been {{reported}} in all 31 <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>China</b> and {{has become one of the}} most common infectious diseases in China. Here we review its spatial and temporal patterns in China and related statistical modeling. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature on the epidemic characteristics and related models proposed to reveal its spatial and temporal patterns of HFMD in mainland China. Results: In mainland China, HFMD is usually caused by enterovirus 71 (EV 71) and coxsackievirus A 16 (Cox A 16). The incidence of HFMD had one or two peaks in a year and presented obvious seasonality. The incidence rate of HFMD was associated with geographical factors, social factors and meteorological variables but it was different in some areas. In most regions of China, the incidence of HFMD was not a random distribution and presented a complex regularity. In this paper, we summarized the spatial autocorrelation analysis, spatial-temporal clustering analysis and time series analysis to the spatial and temporal distribution of HFMD. Conclusions: The spatial and temporal analysis can provide important information and contribute to development of effective measurements to control and prevent its transmission. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Taiwan {{has been}} rabies-free since 1958. We report a fatal case of rabies virus {{infection}} in a 45 -year-old woman from Hu-Nan <b>Province</b> <b>of</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>China</b> which occurred in June 2002. Since knowledge of rabies virus distribution in body organs is limited, the present case study attempted {{to explore the}} pathogenesis of infection of this virus. Materials and Methods: We performed a detailed pathologic examination, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and molecular studies in this case. Results: Acute rabies encephalitis with characteristic Negri inclusion bodies was noted. The brain stem and thalamus were most severely involved. There was mild involvement of the hippocampus and cerebellum. The inflammatory infiltrates consisted of lymphocytes involving primarily the gray matter with perivascular lymphocytic cuffing and neuronophagia. Rabies virus was iso-lated from fresh brain tissues and identified in neurons by immunofluoresence stain with specific rabies monoclonal antibody, and confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with sequence analysis. In addition to encephalitis, the following pathologic changes in the peripheral organs were also noted: ganglioneuritis involving the sympathetic and submucosal ganglion of the esophagus; mild focal myocarditis; interstitial pneumonitis with diffuse alveolar damage and granulation tissue formation in the alveolar space; mild interstitial nephritis and lymphocyte infiltration in the pituitary, adrenal, and submandibular glands. Rabies virus antigen was shown with immunohistochemical stain in the brain stem, cerebellum, thalamus, hippocampus, sympathetic ganglion, submucosal ganglion of the esophagus and tubular epithelium of the kidney.

40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases has been observed in the Hunan <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>China</b> since 2009 with a particularly higher level of severe cases in 2010 - 2012. Intestinal viruses of the picornaviridae family are responsible for the human syndrome associated with HFMD with enterovirus 71 (EV 71) and Coxsackievirus A 16 (Cox A 16) being the most common causative strains. HFMD cases associated with EV 71 are generally more severe with an increased association of morbidity and mortality. In this study, the etiology surveillance data of HFMD cases in Hunan province from March 2010 to October 2012 were analyzed to determine if there is a statistically relevant linear correlation exists between the detection rate of EV 71 in mild cases and the proportion of severe cases among all HFMD patients. As the cases progressed from mild to severe to fatal, the likelihood of EV 71 detection increased (25. 78 %, 52. 20 % and 84. 18 %, respectively). For all cases in the timeframe evaluated in this study, the presence of virus was detected in 63. 21 % of cases; among cases showing positivity for virus, EV 71 infection accounted for 50. 14 %. These results provide evidence to support the observed higher morbidity and mortality associated with this outbreak and emphasizes the importance of early detection in order to implement necessary prevention measures to mitigate disease progression...|$|R

The 9 remaining isolates were serotype B, MATalpha strains of C. gattii and portrayed a typical VGI molecular type. Data analyzed from multilocus sequences showed no variation and that these Chinese C. neoformans isolates belong to a cluster that has phylogenetically diverged from the VNI reference strain.

40|$|AbstractIn Japan, {{between the}} end of December 2003 and March 2004, four {{outbreaks}} of acute, highly transmissible and lethal disease occurred in birds in three prefectures separated by 150 – 450 km, involving three chicken farms and a group of chickens raised as pets. The cause of each outbreak was an H 5 N 1 influenza A virus—the first highly pathogenic virus to be isolated from the outbreaks in Japan since 1925. The H 5 N 1 virus was also isolated from dead crows, apparently infected by contact with virus-contaminated material. These H 5 N 1 viruses were antigenically similar to each other, but could be differentiated from other H 5 viruses, including those isolated from Hong Kong in 1997 and 2003, by use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies in hemagglutination inhibition assays. Genetically, the H 5 N 1 viruses in Japan were closely related to each other in all genes and were genetically closely related to a single isolate of genotype V that was isolated in 2003 in the Guandong <b>Province</b> <b>of</b> <b>mainland</b> <b>China</b> (A/chicken/Shantou/ 4231 / 2003). The virulence of the index isolate (A/chicken/Yamaguchi/ 7 / 2004) was studied in chickens and mice. Chickens intravenously or intranasally inoculated with the isolate died within 1 or 3 days of inoculation, respectively. In mice, although this virus replicated well in the lung without prior adaptation and spread to the brain, the dose lethal to 50 % of the mice was 5 × 105 50 % egg infectious doses (EID 50), which is less pathogenic than the Hong Kong 1997 H 5 N 1 viruses isolated from humans. Our findings indicate that the H 5 N 1 viruses associated with the influenza outbreaks in chickens in Japan were genotypically closely related to an H 5 N 1 virus isolated from chicken in China in 2003 (genotype V), but were different from those prevalent in southeastern Asia in 2003 – 2004 (i. e., genotype Z) and that these highly pathogenic viruses can be transmitted to crows, which are highly susceptible to these viruses...|$|R
