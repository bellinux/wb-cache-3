500|$|In Sanskrit, {{the word}} yoga {{comes from the}} root [...] which means [...] "to add", [...] "to join", [...] "to unite", or [...] "to attach" [...] in its most common senses. By figurative {{extension}} from the yoking or harnessing of oxen or horses, the word took on broader meanings such as [...] "employment, use, application, performance" [...] (compare the figurative uses of [...] "to [...] " [...] as in [...] "to <b>put</b> <b>something</b> to some use"). All further developments {{of the sense of}} this word are post-Vedic. More prosaic moods such as [...] "exertion", [...] "endeavour", [...] "zeal", and [...] "diligence" [...] are also found in Indian epic poetry.|$|E

Every time one of them <b>puts</b> <b>something</b> down {{on one end of}} the table, the other one <b>puts</b> <b>something</b> on the other end to balance it.

500|$|After {{the release}} of Subterranean Jungle, Marky was fired from the band due to his alcoholism. He was {{replaced}} by Richard Reinhardt, who adopted the name Richie Ramone. Joey Ramone remarked that [...] " [...] saved the band as far as I'm concerned. He's the greatest thing {{to happen to the}} Ramones. He put the spirit back in the band." [...] Richie is the only Ramones drummer to sing lead vocals on Ramones songs, including [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice" [...] as well as the unreleased [...] "Elevator Operator". Joey Ramone commented, [...] "Richie's very talented and he's very diverse... He really strengthened the band a hundred percent because he sings backing tracks, he sings lead, and he sings with Dee Dee's stuff. In the past, it was always just me singing for the most part." [...] Richie was also the only drummer to be the sole composer of Ramones songs including their hit [...] "Somebody <b>Put</b> <b>Something</b> in My Drink" [...] as well as [...] "Smash You", [...] "Humankind", [...] "I'm Not Jesus", [...] "I Know Better Now" [...] and [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice". Joey Ramone supported Richie's songwriting contributions: [...] "I encouraged Richie to write songs. I figured it would make him feel more a part of the group, because we never let anybody else write our songs." [...] Richie's composition, [...] "Somebody <b>Put</b> <b>Something</b> in My Drink", remained a staple in the Ramones set list until their last show in 1996 and was included in the album Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits. The eightsong bonus disc, The Ramones Smash You: Live'85, is also named after Richie's composition [...] "Smash You".|$|E
500|$|When the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Twist and Shout", {{the final}} track during the mammoth one-day session {{that produced the}} band's 1963 debut album, Please Please Me, Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, [...] "I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming." [...] In the words of biographer Barry Miles, [...] "Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords {{in the interests of}} rock 'n' roll." [...] The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon [...] "had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice!... <b>put</b> <b>something</b> on it... Make it different.'" [...] Martin obliged, often using double-tracking and other techniques.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album's content, [...] "It's a pretty exhausting record. It's quite dense and I {{think some of the}} decisions we made don't always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking a lot more about what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to <b>put</b> <b>something</b> away and move on." ...|$|E

The live titles, you have to <b>put</b> <b>something</b> like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... I just thought that is really not fair and I {{think we have to}} <b>put</b> <b>something</b> in that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Girl Gone Wild" [...] was {{recorded}} at MSR Studios, New York City and Sarm West Studios, Notting Hill, London. It {{was written by}} Madonna, Vaughan and the Benassi Bros., and was produced by the Benassis and Madonna. Demacio [...] "Demo" [...] Castellon recorded and mixed the track. Philippe Weiss and Graham Archer assisted Castellon on the recording, while Angie Teo assisted on the mixing. Stephen [...] "The Koz" [...] Kozmeniuk did the additional editing of the song and arranged the vocoder. Benny Benassi recalled that Madonna would arrive in the studio around 3–4 pm and would work till 11:30 pm in the night. Together they fixed {{the production of the}} song, including the layering and stacking of the track. They added more vocals to the composition and during the chorus, decided on how many voices should be duplicated. According to Alle Benassi, Madonna [...] "has clear idea. She knows very well what she wants: where <b>put</b> <b>something,</b> how, why. It's surreal but impressive." ...|$|E

500|$|There was {{discussion}} among {{the producers of}} the series regarding whether Bertram {{should be included in}} the storyline, as he had not appeared in any episodes for several years. An un-used scene was intended for broadcasting which showed Stewie, while trying to find Waldo in an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, saying to Brian [...] "Oh, turn to the next page. I bet they put him in someone's utility pocket", but it was never used as it was not deemed funny enough for the episode. Originally, Peter singing [...] "Milkshake" [...] to inmates at a prison was going to be naked and push his nipples from underneath, but broadcasting standards objected; as a result, the show broadcast Peter wearing underpants and pushing his nipples from the side. When Peter and Lois are in the restaurant and Peter leaves to [...] "warn the chef of Lois' arrival", Lois was intended to say [...] "If he won't <b>put</b> <b>something</b> in me, I will", but the gag was never broadcast.|$|E
500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But I just feel that if He's been that good, I should try to <b>put</b> <b>something</b> back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal problems. You haven't once talked about your own people." [...] The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was [...] "completely sympathetic and understanding".|$|E
500|$|De Vries, who {{had worked}} on the demo, asked Orbit to help produce the song, and was enlisted. According to [...] writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had {{originally}} composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution [...] "off-putting", to which the latter confessed, [...] "On all the collaborations I'd left {{a lot of space}} for him, but for this I wanted to <b>put</b> <b>something</b> on the table and say, 'This is what I think'". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a [...] "vision on how the song should be finished". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the [...] "DAT's broken". De Vries defended his contribution saying that {{it was supposed to be}} [...] "like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune." [...] Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on. In J. Randy Taraborrelli's book , the singer said that the main inspiration behind [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] and [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] from the same album, was other people judging and dissecting her creative process. Elaborating on the statement, she added, ...|$|E

500|$|In November 2009, in an {{interview}} with MTV News, Canadian rapper Drake praised Rihanna's then-upcoming fourth studio album, Rated R (2009). During the same interview, he revealed that they have collaborated on a track that didn't make the final cut on the album, [...] "the record we have is great. It's a special record, so for it not to make it, I know something had to click. It's all good. I think the project's gonna be great no matter what." [...] Talking for the same publication, Tor Erik Hermansen of Norwegian production duo StarGate recalled that during an event Rihanna met with Drake backstage and asked him to record a verse on her song, [...] "She's calling me up saying, 'Where are the files?' That's one thing you don't hear often from artists on her level." [...] "What's My Name?" [...] was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Hermansen, Ester Dean, Traci Hale and Drake, while the production was done by StarGate. In {{an interview}} for HitQuarters, Hale explained that she got into the project that's to a phone call she received from Dean. She also elaborated that her work on the song was mostly lyrical, while Dean and StarGate did most of the music. When asked what's the inspiration behind the song she stated, [...] "Oh love, love, love! And it’s sexy – it started as a real sexy track and then you <b>put</b> <b>something</b> sexy over it." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's going to listen to it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we <b>put</b> <b>something</b> together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E
