40|$|New discoveries could {{represent}} challenges {{in many ways}} such as high pressures and high temperatures. The reservoir contains corrosive liquids that are being produced to the surface. Since the casing is expensive to replace, it is common practice to flow the reservoir fluid through a protective tubing. Also the tubing and packer {{are part of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>well</b> <b>barrier.</b> Change of temperature and pressure can make the tubing buckle. When wells need intervention, for instance to repair some type of damage or to increase the production, intervention equipment run through the tubing could get stuck in the buckled section. This thesis will study buckling of tubing in vertical wells and sail sections for frictionless wells. By using theory, theoretical field cases and reverse engineering this thesis reveals the equations used by the buckling simulation software called WellCat 2003. 0. 4. 0 from Landmark. The fictitious force, also known as the buckling force, is discussed in details. The buckling limit used by WellCat is found, showing that the simulator performs very conservative buckling calculations. Buckling is less severe in sail sections than in vertical sections. The effect of inclination of the sail section on the piston effect, helical buckling length change and ballooning effect is shown for a mechanical set packer...|$|E

The Australian Government proposed accepting 92, noting 10, and not accepting three of the Report’s recommendations.Commissioner David Borthwick’s final report stated that while the source of the blowout was largely uncontested it was most likely that hydrocarbons entered the H1 Well through its 9⅝" [...] cemented casing shoe and flowed up the inside of its 9⅝" [...] casing. The Inquiry found that the <b>primary</b> <b>well</b> control <b>barrier</b> - the 9⅝" [...] cemented casing shoe - failed.The final report by the Commission commended the spill response efforts by PTTEPAA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in its role as Combat Agency and the then Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts for its role as environmental regulator.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Degradations or interruptions of the {{original}} <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> elements might occur at offshore wells after some time in operation. Experience from the Norwegian Continental Shelf has shown that these prob-lems are not always treated as thoroughly as expected by the parties involved. This paper presents an ap-proach for an efficient visualization and description of interrupted <b>well</b> <b>barriers,</b> basically to increase the <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> control and management. By mapping the history of operational demands and load picture of the well {{in combination with the}} status of <b>well</b> <b>barriers,</b> a consistent basis for evaluations is obtained. The main inten-tion is thus to realize the real well problem and its underlying causes in a controlled and systematic manner. Then, the responsible parties involved can take action more accurately according to the type of failure that has been revealed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry uses {{a variety of}} qualitative risk assessment methods for maintaining well integrity, such as <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> schematics and barrier diagrams. Identifying <b>barriers</b> and using <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> schematics are helpful tools in qualitative risk assessments. However, {{it is not yet}} clear if these methods can be applied for risk assessments in the geothermal industry. Geothermal wells often produce directly through the casing, instead of through production tubing, making it difficult to identify two independent barrier envelopes in accordance to NORSOK D- 010. High temperatures and corrosion are the most common contributors to failure in geothermal wells. In this study, a hypothetical case of a downhole corrosion problem was assessed by means of conducting a qualitative risk analysis and identifying <b>well</b> <b>barriers</b> in a geothermal well. This study shows that qualitative risk assessment methods from the {{petroleum industry}} are applicable using minor adjustments to <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> interpretation and barrier diagrams. Using NORSOK D- 010 as a guideline, the study found that typical Icelandic high temperature geothermal wells may consist of a primary and a secondary barrier envelope with a common <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> element at the wellhead. At shallow depths, the intermediate casing, often the anchor casing, acts as a secondary barrier against an aquifer. In addition, the study indicates that production of low enthalpy fluids and its financial impact might be the main concerns of downhole corrosion problems close to the production casing shoe. Findings in this study could form the foundation for raising the standard of risk assessment methods for high temperature geothermal wells, and the <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> interpretations defined in this thesis may be suitable for a number of these types of wells...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of wells {{will have to be}} {{abandoned}} at the NCS and around the world. NORSOK D- 010 states that a well that is permanently abandoned shall be abandoned with an eternal perspective and with zero leakage [1]. This is a challenge. It can be hard to predict downhole properties after a well is abandoned. One of the biggest challenges is to ensure that the barriers will keep their integrity for hundred or even thousands of years. To understand how the reservoir and well acts after it is plugged and abandoned, several mechanisms must be known. Barriers is affected by parameters like temperature, pressure and different fluids and gasses that are in contact. This thesis will review regulations and requirements for permanent <b>well</b> <b>barriers,</b> verification of permanent <b>well</b> <b>barriers,</b> barrier degradation models and degradation of cement and corrosion of casing steel due to CO 2. Use of carbon capture and storage is a very popular topic, which is discussed in this thesis. This method is based on pumping CO 2 into reservoirs to store it instead of releasing it to the air. Carbon dioxide is a large contributor for barrier degradation. This thesis will also look at <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> leakage and statistics around this. It will be discussed how to cope with the leakage in permanent <b>well</b> <b>barriers</b> after a <b>well</b> is abandoned...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{starts off}} by {{providing}} basic knowledge about relevant well type, well equipment, gas lift and <b>well</b> <b>barriers.</b> This is basic knowledge which {{is needed to}} understand the systems investigated {{throughout the rest of}} the thesis. Four annulus barrier configurations are found for gas lift systems. Their maintenance strategies are briefly described and general advantages and disadvantages are listed. <b>Well</b> <b>barrier</b> diagrams and <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> schematics are alsoprovided for each configuration. The terms safety instrumented systemand safety instrumented function are briefly explained. Governing regulations regarding barriers are provided both forNorway and for theUnited Statesof America. Requirements regarding safety instrumented system and annulus <b>well</b> <b>barriers</b> in Norway follow. These include requirements for documentation. The safety analysis report (SAR) process is described both for non-proven and proven technology. This process and the included documentation vary for whether the components are certified as proven in use or prior use. The required documentation is also dependent on the system complexity. Relevant terms are discussed. Flowcharts for the various SAR processes are made for both non-proven and proven technology based on the OLF 070 guideline. Two case studies are used to describe the SAR process and to compare the process for non-proven versus proven technology. Some challenges when performing SAR are found and discussed. Potential improvements to the OLF 070 guideline and to IEC standards are also proposed. Probability of unavailability (PFD) calculations are provided for each of the gas lift configuration options based on the <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> schematics and the <b>well</b> <b>barrier</b> diagrams. The results are discussed and an overall assessment of these configurations is made. The result shows that three of the options can be recommended. The option with three barrier elements has slightly better reliability than the most used gas lift configuration which only includes two barriers. Asystem weakness is reviled and an improvement proposed. The suggested improvement proves increased system reliability which resulted in recommendation of all four configurations options. A specified configuration is recommended not to be used. However, the suggested improvement may not be used in practise due to blocking of monitoring. Another improvement is suggested and analysed, but showed minor changes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Parameters from {{archive data}} of the Kalisz-Lis waterworks, located in the Prosna River valley south of Kalisz, have been analysed. <b>Well</b> <b>barrier</b> {{discharges}} groundwater from Quaternary sediments which is mixed with riverbank filtration water. The analysis focused on specific well capacity, a parameter that represents the technical and natural aspects of well life. To exclude any aging factor, an examination of specific well capacity acquired only in the first pumping tests of a new well was performed. The results show that wells drilled between 1961 and 2004 have similar values of specific well capacity and prove that > 40 years discharge has had little influence on hydrodynamic conditions of the aquifer, i. e., clogging has either not occurred or is of low intensity. This implies that, in the total water balance of the Kalisz- Lis <b>well</b> <b>barrier,</b> riverbank filtration water made little contribution. In comparison, a similar analysis of archive data on the Mosina-Krajkowo wells of two generations of <b>well</b> <b>barriers</b> located in the Warta flood plains was performed; this has revealed a different trend. There was a significant drop in specific well capacity from the first pumping test of substitute wells. Thus, long-term groundwater discharge in the Warta valley has had {{a great impact on}} the reduction of the hydraulic conductivity of sediments and has worsened hydrodynamic conditions due to clogging of river bed and aquifer, which implies a large contribution of riverbank filtration water in the total water well balance. For both well fields conclusions were corroborated by mathematical modeling; in Kalisz-Lis 16. 2 % of water comes from riverbank filtration, whereas the percentage for Mosina-Krajkowo is 78. 9 %...|$|R

40|$|Well {{integrity}} {{is a result}} of technical, operational and organizational barriers applied, with the intention to contain and control the reservoir fluid and well pressures. Failure to obtain and maintain adequate barriers could lead to catastrophic events, like demonstrated in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, with the Deepwater Horizon incident. Since then, the petroleum industry has experienced an increased focus on well integrity. Recent surveys conducted on the Norwegian Continental Shelf indicate shortcomings and insufficiencies regarding implementation of technical, operational and organizational barriers.

With the expected increase in well-operation activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf the coming years, ensuring secure wells should be a main priority.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{analytic}} {{results for the}} phase shifts delta_{l}(k) in non-relativistic scattering from a spherical well. The conditions {{for the existence of}} resonances are established in terms of time-delays. Resonances are shown to exist for p-waves (and higher angular momenta) but not for s-waves. These resonances occur when the potential is not quite strong enough to support a bound p-wave of zero energy. We then examine relativistic scattering by spherical <b>wells</b> and <b>barriers</b> in the Dirac equation. In contrast to the non-relativistic situation, s-waves are now seen to possess resonances in scattering from both <b>wells</b> and <b>barriers.</b> When s-wave resonances occur for scattering from a well, the potential is not quite strong enough to support a zero momentum s-wave solution at E = m. Resonances resulting from scattering from a barrier can be explained in terms of the `crossing' theorem linking s-wave scattering from barriers to p-wave scattering from wells.
