The models {{are based on the}} hypotheses that private firms can operate more efficiently than bureaucratically-run state enterprises and that Soviet-type economies are characterized by price controls and quantitative allocations. The state's enforcement policy is explicitly modeled. Although the welfare implications of the <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> for workers are ambiguous in general, under a variety of circumstances they turn out to be negative. For instance, responding to the shortage created by price controls, illegal firms divert resources from the official economy into the <b>parallel</b> <b>market.</b> The result is a higher price in the <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> without any increase in the total supply of the good.

The preliminary investigation regress a crash dummy on <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> premium using a Binary Choice model. The main analysis is conducted by estimating the traditional and a <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> variant of PPP using the Johansen Multivariate Cointegration method.

The empirical results obtained suggest that: weak-form PPP models receive stronger support than the alternative model across the whole sample especially for the Latin American economies. The strong-form PPP is best received for African economies but mostly for the parallel exchange rate solely. The use of <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> exchange rates and wholesale price indices {{has been shown to be}} more supportive of the PPP validity, especially for the strong-form PPP. The empirical findings emphasize the need to adopt more flexible exchange rate policies, while the liberalization of the capital flows and the global integration of the currency markets are in favour of the countries that avoid adopting restrictive macroeconomic policies...|$|R

The spot market changed in orientation because it started to deal not only with crude oil but also with refined products.

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{development}} and operation of the <b>parallel</b> exchange <b>market</b> in Argentina during the 1980 s, and evaluates its impact upon macroeconomic performance and policy. The historical evolution of Argentina's exchange market policies is reviewed {{in order to understand}} the government's motives for imposing exchange controls. The <b>parallel</b> exchange <b>market</b> engendered by these controls is then analyzed, and econometric methods are used to evaluate the behavior of the parallel exchange rate and its impact upon the balance of payments.; The main conclusion of the paper is that exchange controls were never effective enough in Argentina to allow the authorities to set the commercial exchange rate independently of the <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> rate. Attempts to set the commercial exchange rate at too appreciated a level consistently prompted widespread evasion of exchange controls that undermined the government's international reserve position. Econometric evidence supports the hypothesis that important components of the balance of payments were negatively correlated with the <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> premium during the 1980 s. The evidence also confirms that the <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> premium was influential in the determination of the commercial exchange rate.

40|$|This paper models the short-run {{as well as}} {{the long-run}} {{relationship}} between the <b>parallel</b> and official <b>markets</b> for US dollars in Greece in a threshold VECM framework. Modeling exchange rates within this context can be motivated {{by the fact that the}} transition mechanism is controlled by the <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> premium. The results show that linearity is rejected in favour of a TVECM specification, which forms statistically an adequate representation of the data. Two regimes are implied by the model; the “typical” regime, which applies most of the time and the “unusual” one associated with economic and political events t hat took place in Greece during the 1980 s. Another implication is that in the parallel exchange rate there are strong asymmetries between the two regimes in the speed of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium. Finally, Granger causality runs from the official to the <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> in both regimes but not vice versa. <b>Parallel</b> <b>market</b> premium, nonlinearity, threshold cointegration, regime switching,...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{restrictive}} {{foreign exchange}} policy and active <b>parallel</b> <b>markets</b> {{for foreign exchange}} in some developing countries, it is often believed that the real official exchange rate is undervalued (overvaluing in domestic currency). Since an overvalued domestic currency depresses official current account below its equilibrium level, while an undervalued domestic currency may be inflationary, {{it is important to}} be able to detect real official rate misalignment as early as possible. This is difficult in economies where <b>parallel</b> <b>markets</b> for foreign currencies are well established, and where it is therefore to observe underlying capital flows. We show that the direction of real official rate misalignment is identfiable without knowing the size of capital flow in the parallel market. We indicate that a change in the parallel market premium is an appropriate indicator of change in real official rate misalignment. ...|$|E
40|$|If co-existing <b>parallel</b> <b>markets</b> are efficient, then {{arbitrage}} {{will maintain}} a correct pricing relationship. A related {{question is whether}} two parallel emerging markets offering {{more or less the}} same securities but using different institutional designs, can behave as a single, fully integrated market. In this paper an explicit model of price convergence (with transaction costs) is introduced, in which price differences are studied using levels of arbitrage activity. For the empirical analysis two <b>parallel</b> <b>markets</b> in the Czech Republic are used — the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) and the RMS (over-the-counter system). In particular, the degree of arbitrage activity is studied for different segments of the PSE and the evolution of arbitrage in the early history of these emerging markets. The empirical results provide evidence of market linkage for actively traded stocks. A significant relationship is found between the segment of the market to which a given firm belongs and the estimated level of arbitrage trading. Moreover, the level of arbitrage activity increases over time for all market segments, and as the markets mature, the differences among the segments gradually disappear.

40|$|A large {{thriving}} <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> {{for foreign}} exchange has coexisted with a rich menu of official exchange rate policies aimed at achieving a more flexible exchange rate and price system as well as financial and trade liberalization. Despite aggresive policies in these areas, particularly for the exchange rate, the black market premium (defined as {{the ratio of the}} black market rate to the official rate) remains high. The authors examine the origins of the <b>parallel</b> <b>market,</b> the statistical properties of the parallel premium, and the shocks and macroeconomic policy changes that influence its evolution. Using annual data, they specify and estimate and eclectic error-correction model for the premium. They find that the large <b>parallel</b> <b>market</b> might have caused problems in macroeconomic management and economic reform. Also, the findings show that foreign inflation and depreciation of the black market rate (in a cost-push manner) directly increases domestic inflation.
