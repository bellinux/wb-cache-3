40|$|Friction Pull Plug Welding (FPPW) is a {{solid state}} repair process for defects up to one inch in length, only {{requiring}} single sided tooling (OSL) for usage on flight hardware. Experimental data {{has shown that the}} mass of plug heat sink remaining above the top of the plate surface after a weld is completed (the plug heat sink) affects the bonding at the <b>plug</b> <b>top.</b> A minimized heat sink ensures complete bonding of the plug to the plate at the <b>plug</b> <b>top.</b> However, with a minimal heat sink three major problems can arise, the entire plug could be pulled through the plate hole, the central portion of the plug could be separated along grain boundaries, or the <b>plug</b> <b>top</b> hat can be separated from the body. The Chamfered Heat Sink Pull Plug Design allows for complete bonding along the ISL interface through an outside diameter minimal mass heat sink, while maintaining enough central mass in the plug to prevent plug pull through, central separation, and <b>plug</b> <b>top</b> hat separation...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasound {{treatment}} {{is used in}} light alloys during solidification to refine microstructure, remove gas, or disperse immersed particles. A mechanical sonotrode immersed in the melt is most effective when probe tip vibrations lead to cavitation. Liquid contact with the probe can be problematic for high temperature or reactive melts leading to contamination. An alternative contactless method of generating ultrasonic waves is proposed, using electromagnetic (EM) induction. As a bonus, the EM force induces vigorous stirring distributing the effect to treat larger volumes of material. In a typical application, the induction coil surrounding the crucible— also used to melt the alloy—may be adopted for this purpose with suitable tuning. Alternatively, a <b>top</b> <b>coil,</b> immersed in the melt (but still contactless due to EM force repulsion) may be used. Numerical simulations of sound, flow, and EM fields suggest that large pressure amplitudes leading to cavitation may be achievable with this method...|$|R

At the bottom, cars are directed diametrically across the car-park, to find a left-hand ascending helix, also one-way with parking on either side, sandwiched between the turns of the descending helix.

40|$|Etching of {{semiconductor}} {{materials is}} reliant on plasma properties. Quantities such as ion and neutral fluxes, both in magnitude and in direction, are often determined by reactor geometry (height, radius, {{position of the}} coils, etc.) In order to obtain accurate etching profiles, one must also model the plasma as a whole to obtain local fluxes and distributions. We have developed a set of three models that simulates C 12 plasmas for etching of silicon, ion and neutral trajectories in the plasma, and feature profile evolution. We {{have found that the}} location of the peak in the ion densities in the reactor {{plays a major role in}} determining etching uniformity across the wafer. For a stove <b>top</b> <b>coil</b> inductively coupled plasma (ICP), the ion density is peaked at the top of the reactor. This leads to nearly uniform neutral and ion fluxes across the wafer. A side coil configuration causes the ion density to peak near the sidewalls. Ion fluxes are thus greater toward the wall's and decrease toward the center. In addition, the ions bombard the wafer at a slight angle. This angle is sufficient to cause slanted profiles, which is highly undesirable...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe AC {{electromagnetic}} field effects in molten metal are investigated {{to account for}} the mixing of particles (grain refiners, micro/nano additives, impurities, broken metal dendrite agglomerates, bubbles) during the full melting/solidification cycle. The particles travel due to the hydrodynamic drag, buoyancy, turbulent fluctuations and the electromagnetic force action via the local pressure distribution around the particle. The time average effects are investigated previously using approximation derived for a uniform electric and magnetic fields. In the presence of AC field the force distribution is non-uniform, confined to an exponential skin-layer near the outer surface of liquid. This typically results in high mixing rates and an intense turbulence in the bulk of molten metal, additionally contributing to the particle dispersion. The paper attempts to demonstrate the importance of each of the mentioned effects to the organized particle ‘swarm’ like transport and the eventual distribution. Three different examples of the mixing flows generated by AC fields are presented: a travelling field stirring during directional solidification, the semi-levitation dynamic melting and the contactless <b>top</b> <b>coil</b> ‘immersion’ mixing involving the dynamic AC field adjustment.
