5|$|President Bush {{declared}} Louisiana {{a federal}} disaster area after the storm, making it eligible for assistance. FEMA set up three locations to apply in Mississippi and Louisiana. Applications began <b>pouring</b> <b>in,</b> 153,000 {{by the time}} of the deadline. Over $311million in aid was granted to Louisiana. A total of $50million of that money was in the form of low interest loans, and not actual grants.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering {{of a fire}} extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun <b>pouring</b> <b>in.</b> Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E
5|$|At {{a public}} meeting in Alresford on 14 May, Onslow {{reported}} that subscriptions to the defence fund were already <b>pouring</b> <b>in,</b> and that invitations {{to visit and}} speak had been received from many towns. As the Claimant addressed meetings {{up and down the}} country, journalists following the campaign often commented on his pronounced cockney accent, suggestive of East London origins. The campaign drew in some high-level supporters, among whom was George Hammond Whalley, a controversial anti-Catholic who was MP for Peterborough. He and Onslow were sometimes incautious in their speeches; after a meeting in St James's Hall, London, on 11 December 1872, each made specific charges against the Attorney General and the Government of trying to pervert the course of justice. They were both fined £100 for contempt of court.|$|E

50|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} 911 performing the song <b>in</b> <b>pouring</b> rain <b>in</b> China. There {{are two different}} versions of the video, one featuring Natalie Jordan and one featuring Fann Wong. In Jordan's version, she can be seen singing her parts whilst on a television screen and in a dark room. In Wong's version, she is standing by herself in the rain as well.|$|R
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from <b>pouring</b> <b>in</b> between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
5|$|The battle had firmly {{turned in}} France's favour, {{but it was}} far from over. Napoleon ordered Bernadotte's I Corps to support Vandamme's left and moved his own command center from Žuráň Hill to St. Anthony's Chapel on the Pratzen Heights. The {{difficult}} position of the Allies was confirmed by the decision to send in the Russian Imperial Guard; Grand Duke Constantine, Tsar Alexander's brother, commanded the Guard and counterattacked in Vandamme's section of the field, forcing a bloody effort and the only loss of a French standard in the battle (a battalion of the 4th Line Regiment was defeated). Sensing trouble, Napoleon ordered his own heavy Guard cavalry forward. These men pulverized their Russian counterparts, but with both sides <b>pouring</b> <b>in</b> large masses of cavalry, no victory was clear.|$|E
5|$|The mafic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of thin mafic lava flows on an eroded surface. Successive eruptions sent lava <b>pouring</b> <b>in</b> all directions from central vents, forming a broad, gently sloping volcano of flat, domical shape, with a profile much {{like that of a}} warrior's shield. Alkali basalts and ankaramites were the primary lavas produced during this stage of activity which, due to their low silica content, were able to travel great distances away from their source. These lavas also erupted from vents on the flanks of the volcano. Blocky 'a'a and ropy pāhoehoe flows characterized the fluid and effusive nature of volcanism at Level Mountain during the mafic shield-building stage.|$|E

5|$|The action {{continued}} {{across the}} Narrow Seas towards Dunkirk, Nieuwpoort, Gravelines and Sluis. The Dutch Admiral Jan Cant soon {{cut off the}} Spanish and the English waited outside of the Flemish road stead in case any tried to escape elsewhere. The States' ship Mackerel (Makreel), came in sight and attacked the already damaged San Felipe, <b>pouring</b> <b>in</b> a broadside. Drawing off from this assailant, the galley found herself close to Vice-Admiral Cant's Half Moon (Halve Maene). The galley tried to evade discovery by remaining immobile in the darkness but this had disastrous results. The Halve Maene bore straight down upon the galley and struck at her amidships carrying off her mainmast and her poop. Whilst extricating himself with difficulty from the wreck Half Moon sent a tremendous volley of cannon fire straight into the waist. Another State's galliot bore down to complete the work; San Felipe sunk quickly carrying with her all the galley slaves, sailors, and soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Having the wickets in the gates, {{particularly}} if the gates are above the breast wall, means that the water <b>pouring</b> <b>in</b> could swamp some boats in the lock. Filling the lock through culverts eliminated that problem, as well as putting the lock gate below the breast wall.|$|E
25|$|The double-concentric siphon and {{the funnel}} with bent end for <b>pouring</b> <b>in</b> {{different}} liquids, {{neither of which}} appear in any earlier Greek works, were also original inventions by the Banu Musa brothers.

25|$|On {{the night}} of April 28, the German forces tried another mass {{breakout}} from around Halbe. They broke through the 50th Guards Rifle Division and created a corridor from Halbe to the west, but paid a very high price. During April 28 and 29, the Soviets reinforced the flanks and attacked from the south, <b>pouring</b> <b>in</b> Katyusha rockets and shells, concentrating on {{the area around the}} Halbe.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{used the}} period from May 1945 to July 1945 to {{dismantle}} industry, transport and other facilities in West Berlin, including removing railway tracks, as reparations for German war damage in the Soviet Union. This practice continued in East Berlin and the Soviet occupation zone after 1945. Conditions were harsh, {{and hundreds of thousands}} of refugees from the East kept <b>pouring</b> <b>in.</b> Residents depended heavily on the black market for food and other necessities.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} unrest, the 1950s were {{something}} of a golden age for the nearly 40,000 remaining Italian expatriates in Italian Somaliland.
