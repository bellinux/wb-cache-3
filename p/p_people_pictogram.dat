5000|$|Elk {{have played}} an {{important}} role in the cultural history of a number of <b>peoples.</b> <b>Pictograms</b> and petroglyphs of elk were carved into cliffs thousands of years ago by the Anasazi of the southwestern U.S. More recent Native American tribes, including the Kootenai, Cree, Blackfeet, Ojibwa and Pawnee, produced blankets and robes from elk hides. The elk was of particular importance to the Lakota, and played a spiritual role in their society. At birth, Lakota males were given an elk's tooth to promote a long life since that was seen as the last part of dead elk to rot away. The elk was seen as having strong sexual potency and young Lakota males who had dreamed of elk would have an image of the mythical representation of the elk on their [...] "courting coats" [...] as a sign of sexual prowess. The Lakota believed that the mythical or spiritual elk, not the physical one, was the teacher of men and the embodiment of strength, sexual prowess and courage.|$|R

The methodology used was qualitative descriptive practice-oriented business research with single case study. Based on the stakeholder analysis in Bogor tourism, the indicators of sustainable business in tourism are: (i) Involvement from local people, (ii) Preservation of nature and local culture, (iii) Availability of nature Education program, (iv) Strong commitment from business owner/leader, (v) Sufficient capital to support the initial business establishment, (vi) Availability of various networks. The operationalization in Pancawati Group was observed to have item i, iii, and iv partially implemented and the rest was fully implemented. The position of Pancawati Group in value chain was as main firm, as it acted as multiple actors in the chain. In order to have all indicators implemented, it was suggested to have public private partnership in place...|$|R

The basis of differentiation for these organizations is both human capacity-building and community development through zero distribution cost, water, and sanitation loan, and makes use of strategic assets, say low-cost energy and local materials. The core competencies of the founding social entrepreneur include quality control via technology, human resources and responsibility to the three <b>Ps</b> (<b>people.</b> planet, profits). The relationship dynamics are governed by both kinship and social compliance standards. The enterprise acts in a direct and indirect way with water treatment (pouring for purification and rainwater harvesting) for the customers on a continuous basis.|$|R

The Triple Ps principle indicates that a balance can be struck between shareholders and non-shareholding stakeholders, and could be used as a design guideline for other organizations seeking to improve their social sustainability...|$|R

But even knowing that these measures can prevent serious future problems, some people do not adopt them. From a managerial and academic standpoint, it is important to understand the factors behind why people develop preventive health behaviors such as those cited above.

40|$|Collaborating in {{healthcare}} {{is a complex}} and multidimensional undertaking demonstrating an abundance of diversity in action. As authors in the previous chapters have discussed, teams work together in many different ways. The previous chapters have shown that there are numerous elements {{that need to be}} considered ranging from <b>P's</b> (<b>people,</b> place, process, purpose) to E's (engaging, entering, establishing, envisioning, effecting) and to R's (reflexivity, responsiveness, reciprocity). Appreciating this diversity and multi-dimensionality would be incomplete without more deeply exploring what holds collaborative practices together. It is not by accident that the model that Anne developed in her doctoral studies was labelled RESPECT. It is respect that provides the soil from which collaborating can grow and flourish. It would be difficult to imagine healthcare team members collaborating well without having respect for one another and for the patients or clients they work with. Collaborating without such respect would disregard cultural, situation-specific, ethical and emotional factors integral to the complexity and uncertainty of healthcare practice. A team with lack of respect for others might rely on technical rationale exchanges and perhaps focus on predetermined efficiencies...|$|R
