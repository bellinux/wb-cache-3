5000|$|One Dollar Short were an Australian {{punk rock}} band. Formed in 1998, and hailing from Terrigal in New South Wales' Central Coast region, members {{included}} Michael Smith (drums), Trent Crawford (guitar), Tim Flaherty (guitar and backing vocals), Adam Check (bass) and Scott E.

Flaherty left before the release of <b>Press</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hold</b> to form another Central Coast-based pop-punk band, Best Kept Secret, who released the Unorganised Crime EP in 2003 before disappearing. He was replaced on guitar briefly by Michael Kemp, formerly of Sydney band Second Best. Kemp departed the band in mid-2001.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{involves}} the press-and-hold technique. In a press-and-hold, the user <b>presses</b> <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> the single button. After a certain period, software perceives the button press {{not as a}} single click but as a separate action. This has two drawbacks: first, a slow user may press-and-hold inadvertently. Second, the user must wait for the software to detect the click as a press-and-hold, otherwise the system might interpret the button-depression as a single click. Furthermore, the remedies for these two drawbacks conflict with each other: the longer the lag time, the more the user must wait; and the shorter the lag time, {{the more likely it}} becomes that some user will accidentally press-and-hold when meaning to click. Studies have found all of the above workarounds less usable than additional mouse buttons for experienced users.|$|R
