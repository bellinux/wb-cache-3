40|$|This <b>paper</b> <b>presents</b> an <b>extended</b> {{two-stage}} <b>data</b> envelopment analysis (DEA) {{method for}} analyzing water resource use efficiency (WRUE) and related WRUE issues, which {{was developed by}} introducing regional water resource metabolic theory into the two-stage DEA method. It has the following advantages: (1) it {{has the ability to}} reflect the inner difference and connection of the regional water resource consumption process, which developed the corresponding physical model instead of making it a “black box”; (2) the built physical model for WRUE divided the main body of water resource consumption into social and economic subsystems, which can thus elaborate WRUE; (3) it can analyze not only WRUE but also related WRUE issues. The proposed method was applied to a real-case study in Gansu Province, China. Results show that decision makers can determine the comprehensive and accurate WRUE and negative factors of WRUE in Gansu Province. Moreover, the results offer recommendations for decision makers to plan for efficient use of water resources in different cities...|$|R

Furthermore the tensile tester is able to measure the deformation of the specimen directly on the specimen, which allows more precise tests and more independence from temperature and stress dependent tester parts like the clamping and the rods. The tests were performed in three temperatures: 25 degC, 75 degC and 125 degC and three different stresses at each temperature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Keyword based {{queries are}} {{inherently}} ambiguous such that given {{a set of}} keywords the database search engine has only an uncertain guess about the user’s informational need represented by the query. Possibly high complexity of the data makes providing intelligent search results effectively extremely challenging. Databases enable users to precisely express their informational needs using structured queries. However, database query construction is a laborious and error-prone process, which cannot be performed well by most end users. Keyword search alleviates the usability problem {{at the price of}} query expressiveness. As keyword search algorithms do not differentiate between the possible informational needs represented by a keyword query, users may not receive adequate results.

The <b>paper</b> <b>presents</b> <b>extended</b> techniques which simulate the operating features of industrial power systems efficiently and evaluate the additional load supplied after each operational stage and the reliability indices of each load point of interest.

The focus is laid on the development and analysis of ASR front-end technologies covering speech enhancement and feature extraction. Speech enhancement is performed using a joint noise reduction and dereverberation system in the spectral domain based on estimates of the noise and late reverberation power spectral densities (PSDs). To obtain reliable estimates of the PSDs—even in acoustic conditions with positive direct-to-reverberation energy ratios (DRRs)—we adopt the statistical model of the room impulse response explicitly incorporating DRRs, as well in combination with a novel proposed joint estimator for the reverberation time T [...]...|$|R

Unlike these authors, censoring is allowed for, and two estimation methods are presented. The partial marginalization approach to full maximum likelihood of Molenberghs et al.
