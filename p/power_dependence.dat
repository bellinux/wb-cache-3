50|$|Since {{media with}} {{inversion}} symmetry are forbidden from generating second harmonic light, surfaces and interfaces make interesting subjects for study with SHG. In fact, {{second harmonic generation}} and sum frequency generation discriminate against signals from the bulk, implicitly labeling them as surface specific techniques. In 1982, T. F. Heinz and Y. R. Shen explicitly demonstrated {{for the first time}} that SHG could be used as a spectroscopic technique to probe molecular monolayers adsorbed to surfaces. Heinz and Shen adsorbed monolayers of laser dye rhodamine to a planar fused silica surface; the coated surface was then pumped by a nanosecond ultra-fast laser. SH light with characteristic spectra of the adsorbed molecule and its electronic transitions were measured as reflection from the surface and demonstrated a quadratic <b>power</b> <b>dependence</b> on the pump laser power.|$|E
40|$|Many {{outsourcing}} decision {{models have}} been developed over the years. These models are generally developed from either a transaction cost perspective or a resource based perspective. The Transaction Cost Theory (TCT) proposes that outsourcing decisions {{are influenced by the}} degree of asset specificity, frequency and uncertainty. The resource-based view proposes that organizations should define their core competences and core activities and keep those activities in-house. All non-core activities could be outsourced. Caniëls and Roeleveld (2009) introduce an alternative view on outsourcing: the <b>power</b> and <b>dependence</b> perspective. Their empirical findings show that <b>power</b> and <b>dependence</b> {{play an important role in}} make-or-buy decisions and that it should be considered complementary to cost and core competence considerations. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the influence of <b>power</b> and <b>dependence</b> in logistics outsourcing decisions and identify the importance of <b>power</b> and <b>dependence</b> compared to other factors that influence logistics outsourcing decisions. Therefore the following problem statement is formulated: What is the influence of <b>power</b> and <b>dependence</b> on logistics outsourcing decisions, and wha...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims to {{understand}} buyer-supplier <b>power</b> and <b>dependence</b> scenarios following a risk sharing contract. The study develops {{a supply chain}} risk sharing contract to mitigate demand uncertainty and price volatility related risks in a globalised business environment. An integer programming model is developed and analysed following an automotive case study to generate insights into buyer-supplier relationships. Multiple buyer-supplier <b>power</b> and <b>dependence</b> scenarios are considered to reflect the possible leverages involved in the decision-making. The situational strength evaluated through buyer-supplier <b>power</b> and <b>dependence</b> illuminates the inherent complexity in contract negotiation. Thus there is an evident need to develop risk sharing contracts for mitigating global risks. The developed relationship framework and risk sharing contract model are expected to help SC managers in better understanding behavioural aspects during contract negotiations. The risk sharing contract model proposed here also contributes to a potentially novel perspective on existing theory in buyer-supplier <b>power</b> and <b>dependence</b> by providing a relational perspective on the dynamics of supply chain design and collaboration...|$|R

Many business organizations have implemented KM and many are in the process of its implementation. KM implementation is adversely affected by few factors which are known as KM barriers.

Further, this paper is also helpful to understand mutual influences of barriers and to identify those barriers which support other barriers (driving barrier) and also those barriers which are most influenced by other barriers (dependent barriers). The interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology is used to evolve mutual relationships among these barriers.

Fitting such to experimental spectra yields both the Lorentzian natural linewidth and the Gaussian Doppler broadening. However, as the probe power increases saturation effects introduce spurious <b>power</b> <b>dependence</b> into the fitted Doppler width. Using a simple atomic model, we calculate power-dependent corrections to the Voigt profile, which are parametrized by the Gaussian Doppler width, the Lorentzian natural linewidth, and the optical depth.

A model derived from random-walk theory as well as Monte Carlo simulations are utilized to analyze nanotube length dependence and excitation <b>power</b> <b>dependence</b> of emission intensity.

Especially, the PL peak intensity of the narrow well rapidly decreases as excitation power increases to a certain extent.
