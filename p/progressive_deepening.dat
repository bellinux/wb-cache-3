40|$|In recent years, deep {{drilling}} undertaken {{as part of}} the International Continental Drilling Program has generated multiple long lacustrine sedimentary records to reconstruct continental paleoclimate. In many cases, the tectonic and geomorphic history of these basins is under-constrained and poorly known, which affects the interpretation of climate history from geophysical, geochemical, and paleobiotic proxies in the sedimentary record. In addition, non-analog biotic assemblages that reflect evolutionary processes may constrain the reconstruction of past environments. In the drill-core record of Lake Titicaca, spanning the last ~ 370 ka, the diatom stratigraphy reflects both the influence of climate and the longterm evolution of the lake basin and its biota. In {{the upper part of the}} drill-core sequence, glacial intervals were deep and dominated by freshwater planktic taxa, and peak interglacial intervals were shallow and dominated by benthic species, some with saline affinities. In the basal sections of the drill-core record, benthic diatoms are dominant in both glacial and interglacial units, with freshwater taxa dominating the glacial strata. This suggests that the ancient lake basin was shallower during intervals of both wet and dry climate, and that the modern deep lake may result from a <b>progressive</b> subsidence and <b>deepening</b> of the basin over time. In addition, morphological evolution in one of the major lineages of planktic diatoms, Cyclostephanos, indicates substantial change in the limnological environment that affected species morphology and may have driven speciation...|$|R

5000|$|Original {{interpretations of}} the {{formation}} of the Haasgat cave system (speleogenesis) emphasised development along a typical low-topographic relief pattern, where <b>progressive</b> erosion and <b>deepening</b> of the valley into the surface dolomites drained the phreatic cave, allowing for internal collapse and expansion of the system. Simultaneously, Keyser and Martini also suggested that the elevation of the system (near 1500m) and erosional deroofing prior to mining might indicate that the fossil deposits at Haasgat might have formed as early as the terminal Pliocene. [...] Subsequent biostratigraphic {{interpretations of the}} fauna processed from the ex situ dumpsites produced two different proposed age ranges. An evaluation of the extinct baboon (Papio angusticeps) sample, a species currently only known across African Pleistocene deposits in the Kromdraai A assemblage, were taken to suggest that the Haasgat fossils were roughly contemporaneous (~1.9-1.8 million years ago). In contrast, a description of the non-primate faunas from the ex situ dumpsite emphasised the largely modern ungulate sample and suggested a more recent depositional age of maximally 1.5 - 0.5 million years ago. Adams' (2013) recent analysis [...] of all the ex-situ fauna from the cave suggests an age later than the first occurrence of Equus in Africa at ~2.3 Ma and an age prior to ~1.8 Ma [...] Herries et al. 2014 (SAJS) [...] also undertook a palaeomagnetic analysis of the cave deposits, indicating that the main in situ fossil beds were older than the end of the Olduvai SubChron at 1.95 Ma and younger than the Gauss-Matuyama Boundary at 2.58 Ma.

40|$|Present-day bottom-water {{ventilation}} in the Eastern Mediterranean basin occurs through deep-water convection {{originating from}} the two marginal basins, i. e. Adriatic and Aegean Seas. In the paleo record, long periods of enhanced deep-water formation have been alternating with shorter periods of reduced deep-water formation. The latter is related mainly to low-latitude humid climate conditions and the enhanced deposition and preservation of organic-rich sediment units (sapropels). This study focuses on sedimentary archives of the most-recent sapropel S 1, retrieved from two sites under the direct influence of the two deep-water formation areas. Restricted oxygen conditions have developed rapidly {{at the beginning of}} S 1 deposition in the Adriatic site, but bottom-water conditions have not persistently remained anoxic during the full interval of sapropel deposition. In fact, the variability in intensity and persistence of sedimentary redox conditions at the two deep-water formation sites is shown to be related to brief episodes of climate cooling. In the Adriatic site, sapropel deposition appears to have been interrupted twice. The 8. 2 ka event, only recovered at the Adria site, is characterized by gradually increasing suboxic to possibly intermittently oxic conditions and decreasing Corg fluxes, followed by an abrupt re-establishment of anoxic conditions. Another important event that disrupted sapropel S 1 formation, has taken place at ca. 7. 4 cal ka BP. The latter event has been recovered at both sites. In the Adriatic site it is followed by a period of sedimentary conditions that gradually change from suboxic to more permanently oxic, as deduced from the Mn/Al pattern. Using the same proxy for suboxic/oxic sedimentary redox conditions, we observe that conditions in the Aegean Sea site shift to more permanently oxic from the 7. 4 ka event onwards. However, at both sites the accumulation and preservation of enhanced amounts of organic matter have continued under these suboxic to intermittently oxic sedimentary conditions. It seems thus, that after 7. 4 cal ka BP sapropel-like surface or deep-chlorophyll-maximum conditions including enhanced productivity continued, whereas bottom-water conditions were at least intermittently oxic. The latter is related to decreasing precipitation, i. e. run-off, and thus a <b>progressive</b> development and <b>deepening</b> of deep-water formation. The shallower Aegean site, would be affected earlier by such deepening ventilation than the slightly deeper Adriatic site. Finally, termination of sapropel S 1 formation as deduced from diminished organic matter contents and Ba/Al, appears to have occurred almost simultaneously in the two areas, namely at 6. 6 ± 0. 3 and 6. 3 ± 0. 5 cal ka BP in Adriatic and Aegean sites, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Carboniferous uccession in the Navan Mine area, {{which lies}} near the {{northern}} {{margin of the}} Dublin Basin, rests unconformably on folded Lower Palaeozoic rocks. The informal stratigraphic nomenclature of the mine is used throughout. Sedimentation {{began in the late}} Devonian-early Courceyan with Red Beds reflecting deposition in braided streams and alluvial fans. The overlying Laminated Beds consist of shallow-marine barrier sandstones, tidal-flat/lagoonal mudstones, and sabkha evaporites. The Muddy Limestone is a mud-dominated carbonate sequence reflecting deposition in an open elastic-influenced lagoon. The Pale Beds that follow, and on which attention is focused here, contain at least 44 peritidal and shallow-shelf depositional cycles. The overlying Shaley Pale and Argillaceous Bioclastic Limestones reflect deeper wat r open-sea conditions. This sequence is truncated by a conspicuous erosion surface overlain by Chadian submarine debris-flows and limestone turbidites.

40|$|The {{metasedimentary}} {{rocks of}} the Morar Group in northern Scotland {{form part of}} the early Neoproterozoic Moine Supergroup. The {{upper part of the}} Group is c. 2 - 3 km thick and contains two large km-scale facies successions: a coarsening-upwards marine-to-fluvial regression overlain by a fining-upwards fluvial-to-marine transgression. Fluvial facies make up {{less than a third of}} the total thickness; shallow-marine lithofacies comprise the remainder. Combining these new findings with previously published data indicates that the Morar Group represents, overall, a transgressive stratigraphic succession c. 6 - 9 km thick, in which there is both an upward and eastward predominance of shallow-marine deposits, and a concomitant loss of fluvial facies. Smaller-scale (100 s of m thick) transgressive-regressive cycles are superimposed on this transgressive trend. Collectively, the characteristics of the succession are consistent with deposition in a foreland basin located adjacent to the Grenville orogen, and possibly linked to the peri-Rodinian ocean.

Being meromictic, {{it is also}} expected to accumulate heat due to rising regional air temperatures. To investigate the warming trend and distinguish between atmospheric and geothermal heating sources, we compiled historical temperature data, performed measurements with logging instruments, and simulated heat propagation. We also performed isotopic analyses of water from the lake’s main basin and isolated Kabuno Bay. The results reveal that the lake surface is warming at the rate of 0. 12 uC per decade, which matches the warming rates in other East African lakes. Temperatures increase throughout the entire water column. Though warming is strongest near the surface, warming rates in the deep waters cannot be accounted for solely by propagation of atmospheric heat at presently assumed rates of vertical mixing. Unless the transport rates are significantly higher than presently believed, this indicates significant contributions from subterranean heat sources. Temperature time series in the deep monimolimnion suggest evidence of convection.

These results were related to observed vertical distributions of eggs obtained from stratified vertical distribution sampling in the Bay of Biscay. Eggs of both species had slightly positive buoyancy in local seawater throughout most of their development until near hatching, {{when there was a}} marked increase in density and they became negatively buoyant. The settling velocity of anchovy eggs, which are shaped as prolate ellipsoids, was close to predictions for spherical particles of equivalent volume. An improved model was developed for prediction of the settling velocity of sardine eggs, which are spherical with a relatively large perivitelline volume; this incorporated permeability of the chorion and adjustment of the density of the perivitelline fluid to ambient seawater. Eggs of both species were located mostly in the top 20 m of the water column, in increasing abundance towards the surface.

Horizontal and vertical job segregation have, however, proved intractable barriers to {{closing the gap}} fully. An under-researched element of the solution may involve examining whether skill levels are accurately reflected in the low pay and flat career structures of occupations and part-time jobs where women and ethnic minorities are concentrated. This is a public policy issue, requiring that systemic reviews of pay and employment equity include skill reassessments. It {{has so far been}} mainly a public administration issue, because of the state sector’s vanguard role in equity reviews. Against a backdrop of equality initiatives in the UK and other Anglophone countries, we focus on the pay and employment equity review process in Aotearoa-New Zealand between 2004 and 2008. Here a mainstreaming approach has been adopted, ‘making gender equity ordinary’ by providing tools for reviews of pay and employment opportunity and for remedies such as job re-evaluation. Our focus is on the potential contribution to this agenda of skill reassessments.

40|$|International audienceThe micropalaeontologic {{analysis}} of the Lower Toarcian from the Ksour Mountains (western Saharan Atlas, Algeria) allows us to recognize several assemblages of benthic foraminifera and to obtain information about the deposit environment. These assemblages dominated by Nodosariids are organized in four successive stages of settlement (normal, survival, extinction, and repopulation). This distribution gives new information on the environmental conditions and on their effect on {{the change in the}} vertical distribution of benthic foraminifera. The quantitative evolution documents a <b>progressive</b> <b>deepening</b> of the environment that is controlled by local tectonic and sedimentary dynamics. The result is an ecosequence depending both on the general sea-level rise and on a progressive confinement of the bottom water. The normal stage occurred {{at the beginning of the}} Polymorphum zone; uncoiled and small sized Nodosariids species indicate the opening of the Atlasic furrow. After, during the middle of this zone, these species were associated with Polymorphinids and Ceratobuliminids, which indicate a deep but isolated and confined environment (survival stage). The ecosequence ended with an episode without foraminifera; it is the extinction stage dated in the Polymorphum and Early Levisoni zones. This stage corresponds to an umbilicus setting. Such palaeophysiographic conditions exaggerated the general coeval hypoxy, responsible of the main Toarcian crisis. Then, from the late Levisoni zone to the end of the Middle Toarcian, the ecosequence evolution is inverted, as a consequence of the filling of the deep parts of the umbilicus, which were less partitioned and more oxygenated (repopulation stage) ...|$|E
40|$|The Tertiary Piedmont Basin (TPB) is a syn-tectonic Neoalpine–Apennine basin with {{an upper}} Eocene–upper Miocene {{sedimentary}} succession. It has an inner position {{with respect to}} the arcuate belt of the Western and Ligurian Alps, in northwestern Italy. In the area north of Genova, the Scrivia Valley separates two distinct sectors where the TPB basal conglomerates display a differentiated clast provenance: in the western sector conglomerates are fed by the metamorphic units of central Liguria, whereas in the eastern sector most of the conglomerate clasts come from the Antola ﬂysch Unit. Observations on clast lithology demonstrate that the transition between the two types of conglomerates is abrupt and roughly coincides with the Scrivia River Valley. An explanation of the different clast provenance as due to a <b>progressive</b> <b>deepening</b> of the erosional level appears to be possible in the eastern sector, but it is not feasible in the western sector, where the ﬂysch units appear to have been protected from erosion. We propose that the northwards thrusting of the Ligurian Alps metamorphic units onto the Antola ﬂysch units, made the latter not available to erosion and led the Scrivia Fault and other equivalent tectonic lineaments to act as tear faults. Field data suggest that the Tertiary geodynamics of the Ligurian Alps was dominated by the Corsica–Sardinia anticlockwise rotation, that caused the northwards backthrusting of the Ligurian Alps, accommodated by a complex strike-slip fault system, that segmented the TPB, affecting the sedimentation and the clast provenance of the conglomerates...|$|E
40|$|Transport by meridional flows has {{significant}} consequences for stellar evolution, but {{is difficult to}} capture in global-scale numerical simulations because of {{the wide range of}} timescales involved. Stellar evolution models therefore usually adopt parameterizations for such transport based on idealized laminar or mean-field models. Unfortunately, recent attempts to model this transport in global simulations have produced results that are not consistent with any of these idealized models. In an effort to explain the discrepancies between global simulations and idealized models, we here use three-dimensional local Cartesian simulations of compressible convection to study the efficiency of transport by meridional flows below a convection zone in several parameter regimes of relevance to the Sun and solar-type stars. In these local simulations we are able to establish the correct ordering of dynamical timescales, although the separation of the timescales remains unrealistic. We find that, even though the generation of internal waves by convective overshoot produces a high degree of time dependence in the meridional flow field, the mean flow has the qualitative behavior predicted by laminar, "balanced" models. In particular, we observe a <b>progressive</b> <b>deepening,</b> or "burrowing", of the mean circulation if the local Eddington-Sweet timescale is shorter than the viscous diffusion timescale. Such burrowing is a robust prediction of laminar models in this parameter regime, but has never been observed in any previous numerical simulation. We argue that previous simulations therefore underestimate the transport by meridional flows. Comment: 14 figure...|$|E
40|$|A better {{understanding}} of genesis and palaeoenvironmental setting of the Scisti silicei Formation (Lagonegro units, southern Italy) was achieved by means of geochemical analysis integrated with new stratigraphic information. Data show that major and trace element geochemistry of ancient clay-rich beds and banded cherts add {{new insights into the}} Mesozoic evolution of the Lagonegro basin. Sedimentary contributions to Jurassic shales sampled during this study were mainly derived from two major sources: (i) a dominant terrigenous fine-grained component, having affinity with average upper continental crust that had not undergone intense weathering and (ii) biogenic siliceous material. The latter component occurs in clay-rich layers from the ‘‘basal member’’ of the Scisti silicei Formation. Composition varies up section and accounts for changes in the detrital supply due to bathymetric oscillations. The compositional variations from the basal to the overlying member are consistent with a distal source passing in time to a more ‘‘proximal’’ source, as indicated by sharp changes in the concentrations of detrital elements (Ti, Zr and Nb). It is likely that increased detrital input occurred through turbidity current deposition. Finally, the chemical features of the clay-rich layers from the upper cherty portion of the studied succession imply a <b>progressive</b> <b>deepening</b> of the basin. The lack of any mafic and hydrothermal contributions in the Jurassic shales as well as the continental nature of detrital input suggests that the Lagonegro basin was located between two carbonate platforms, in accordance with the classical restoration of the African–Apulian palaeomargin. Thus, the basin acted as a preferential sink connected to the African cratonic areas through a southern entry point...|$|E
