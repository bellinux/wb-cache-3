25|$|Mechanical inertia is {{the basis}} of this storage method. When the {{electric}} power flows into the device, an electric motor accelerates a heavy rotating disc. The motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed, slowing down the disc and producing electricity. Electricity is stored as the kinetic energy of the disc. Friction must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time. This is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using magnetic bearings, tending to make the method expensive. Greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as steel or composite materials to resist the centrifugal forces. The ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic, however, tends to make flywheels unsuitable for general power system application; they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving <b>power</b> <b>quality</b> in renewable energy systems such as the 20MW system in Ireland.|$|E
500|$|VFDs are {{available}} with voltage and current ratings covering {{a wide range of}} single-phase and multi-phase AC motors. Low-voltage (LV) drives are designed to operate at output voltages equal to or less than 690V. While motor-application LV drives {{are available}} in ratings of up to the order of 5or6 MW, economic considerations typically favor medium-voltage (MV) drives with much lower power ratings. [...] Different MV drive topologies (see Table 2) are configured in accordance with the voltage/current-combination ratings used in different drive controllers' switching devices such that any given voltage rating is {{greater than or equal to}} one to the following standard nominal motor voltage ratings: generally either 2.3/4.16kV (60Hz) or 3.3/6.6kV (50Hz), with one thyristor manufacturer rated for up to 12kV switching. In some applications a step-up transformer is placed between a LV drive and a MV motor load. MV drives are typically rated for motor applications [...] greater than between about 375kW (500HP) and 750kW (1000hp). MV drives have historically required considerably more application design effort than required for LV drive applications. The power rating of MV drives can reach 100MW, a range of different drive topologies being involved for different rating, performance, <b>power</b> <b>quality,</b> and reliability requirements.|$|E
