2500|$|Theiler's murine {{encephalomyelitis}} virus (TMEV) {{leads to}} the development in mice of a progressive CD4+ T cell-mediated response after these cells have infiltrated the CNS. This virus {{has been shown to}} cause CNS disease in [...] mice that resembles multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease in humans that results in the gradual destruction of the myelin sheath coating axons of the CNS. The TMEV mouse virus shares a thirteen amino acid sequence (His-Cys-Leu-Gly-Lys-Trp-Leu-Gly-His-Pro-Asp-Lys-Phe) (PLP (<b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein)</b> 139-151 epitope) with that of a human myelin-specific epitope. Bystander myelin damage is caused by virus specific Th1 cells that cross react with this self epitope. To test the efficacy in which TMEV uses molecular mimicry to its advantage, a sequence of the human myelin-specific epitope was inserted into a non-pathogenic TMEV variant. As a result, there was a CD4+ T cell response and autoimmune demyelination was initiated by infection with a TMEV peptide ligand. In humans, it has recently been shown that there are other possible targets for molecular mimicry in patients with multiple sclerosis. These involve the hepatitis B virus mimicking the human <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> (myelin protein) and the Epstein-Barr virus mimicking anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (contributes to a ring of myelin around blood vessels).|$|E

40|$|AbstractVertebrate myelin {{contains}} two proteins that mediate compaction: protein zero (P 0), an immunoglobulin gene superfamily member, or <b>proteolipid</b> <b>proteins,</b> 4 -hydrophobic domain–motif proteins biogenetically unrelated to P 0. The prevailing view {{has been that}} expression of P 0 and <b>proteolipid</b> <b>proteins</b> is mutually exclusive; P 0, which mediates myelin compaction in fish, {{is thought to be}} completely replaced by the newer <b>proteolipid</b> <b>proteins</b> in the terrestrial vertebrate CNS. However, we now find that <b>proteolipid</b> <b>proteins</b> are actually major myelin constituents in bony fish and amphibia, and so are coexpressed with P 0. Clearly, myelin proteolipids are not new additions to the myelin protein repertoire, but instead were ancestral sheath components, expressed ∼ 440 million years ago in the first myelinated fish that existed at least ∼ 100 million years before the origin of amphibians. In conclusion, P 0 and the <b>proteolipid</b> <b>proteins</b> are evolving in parallel in myelinating cells of most vertebrate species...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo <b>proteolipid</b> <b>proteins,</b> PLP and DM 20, are {{the major}} {{membrane}} components of central nervous system (CNS) myelin. Mutations of the X-linked PLP/DM 20 gene cause dysmyelination in mouse and man and result in significant mortality. Here we show that mutant mice that lack expression of a targeted PLP gene fail to exhibit the known dysmyelinated phenotype. Unable to encode PLP/DM 20 or PLP-related polypeptides, oligodendrocytes are still competent to myelinate CNS axons of all calibers and to assemble compacted myelin sheaths. Ultrastructurally, however, the electron-dense `intraperiod' lines in myelin remain condensed, correlating with its reduced physical stability. This suggests that after myelin compaction, PLP forms a stabilizing membrane junction, similar to a “zipper. ” Dysmyelination and oligodendrocyte death emerge as an epiphenomenon of other PLP mutations and have been uncoupled in the PLP null allele from the risk of premature myelin breakdown...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of tyrosine into proteins was measured after the subcutaneous implantation of a pellet of [14 C]tyrosine in mice. This method keeps the specific radioactivity of free tyrosine fairly constant {{and makes it}} possible to follow incorporation up to a 10 -day period. At the end of 10 days most of the protein-bound tyrosine was replaced (i. e. most protein turned over) in lung, liver, heart, kidney and spleen; about half was replaced in brain, one-quarter in muscle. The rate of protein turnover in myelin was approx. 40 % of that of whole brain proteins; at 10 days one-fifth of the myelin proteins were replaced. All protein components of myelin measured were in a dynamic state; incorporation decreased in the following order, Wolfgram greater than DM- 20 greater than basic greater than <b>proteolipid</b> <b>proteins.</b> The {{incorporation of}} tyrosine into each protein fraction was greater in the 0 - 5 -day than in the 5 - 10 -day period, indicating heterogeneity of metabolic rates. The results show that after myelination at least a portion of each protein component of myelin is undergoing significant metabolic turnover. In the adult, myelin components are not stable, but turnover is heterogeneous, and each protein may be compartmentalized. Turnover can be influenced by a variety of factors...|$|R

5000|$|As {{development}} progresses {{a second}} and third wave of OPCs originate from the lateral and caudal ganglionic eminences and generate the majority of adult OLGs.

50|$|Due to the {{pronounced}} resolution {{activity of}} Cre, {{one of its}} initial applications was the excision of loxP-flanked ("floxed") genes leading to cell-specific gene knockout of such a floxed gene after Cre becomes expressed in the tissue of interest.

The specific DNA fragment recognized by Cre remains intact in cells, which do not express the PLP gene; this in turn facilitates empirical observation of the localized effects of genome alterations in the myelin sheath that surround nerve fibers in the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

40|$|The effect which {{intrinsic}} (<b>proteolipid)</b> <b>protein</b> has on fluidity {{of central}} nervous system myelin membrane was measured through differences in temperature-dependent anisotropy of the lipid-soluble fluorescence probe, 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene (DPH), in multilamellar vesicles (MLV) prepared from total myelin lipids in the presence and absence of <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein.</b> Very little difference was observed in the anisotropies of DPH incorporated into intact myelin membrane vesicles compared with MLV reconstituted from total myelin lipid plus <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> but excluding myelin basic protein. In contrast, a significant decrease (P less than 0. 01) in anisotropy was observed when MLV prepared from total myelin lipids depleted of <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> were compared with vesicles containing <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein.</b> Given the different distributions of myelin basic protein and <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> suggested by freeze-fracture, neutron and X-ray diffraction studies, {{and the fact that}} the hydrophobic DPH probe is known to distribute in the non-polar regions of lipid bilayers, we interpret the marked decrease in anisotropy when <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> is excluded from MLV to suggest that at least part of the proteolipid is distributed in the hydrocarbon region of the MLV. These findings are consistent with the earlier physical studies and recent postulations that extensive hydrophobic segments exist in <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> and that these hydrophobic segments are buried in the myelin lipid bilayer and alternate with hydrophilic extra-membrane segments...|$|E
40|$|Studies of lipid-protein {{interactions}} in double-reconstituted systems involving both integral and peripheral or lipid- anchored proteins are reviewed.

Even so, the effects on avidin-linked lipids are different from those induced by myelin basic protein on freely diffusible lipids, both interacting with the myelin <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein.</b> Both the former and the cytochrome c/cytochrome oxidase couple evidence a propagation of lipid perturbation out from the intramembrane protein interface that could be a basis for formation of microdomains...|$|E
40|$|During {{neonatal}} development glucocorticoids potentiate oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelinogenesis by {{regulating the}} expression of myelin basic protein, <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein,</b> and glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (sn-glycerol- 3 -phosphate: NAD+ 2 -oxidoreductase, EC 1. 1. 1. 8). The actual locus at which hydrocortisone exerts its developmental influence on glial physiology is, however, not well understood. Glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase is glucocorticoid-inducible in oligodendrocytes at all stages of development both in vivo and in vitro. In newborn rat cerebral cultures, between 9 and 15 days in vitro, a 2 - to 3 -fold increase in myelin basic protein and <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> mRNA levels occurs in oligodendrocytes within 12 hr of hydrocortisone treatment. Immunostaining demonstrates that this increase in mRNAs {{is followed by a}} 2 - to 3 -fold increase in the protein levels within 24 hr. In vitro transcription assays performed with oligodendrocyte nuclei show an 11 -fold increase in the transcriptional activity of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in response to hydrocortisone but no increase in transcription of myelin basic protein or <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein.</b> These results indicate that during early myelinogenesis, glucocorticoids influence {{the expression of}} key oligodendroglial markers by different processes: The expression of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase is regulated at the transcriptional level, whereas the expression of myelin basic protein and <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> is modulated via a different, yet uncharacterized, mechanism involving post-transcriptional regulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} optic nerve transection on myelin protein gene {{expression}} was studied in rats following axotomy at two ages: during active myelination (17 days of age) and after peak {{expression of the}} genes (35 days of age). mRNA levels for <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein,</b> myelin basic protein and myelin-associated glycoprotein were assessed by northern and dot blotting and byin situ hybridization using tissue sections and cultured individual oligodendrocytes. Transection at 17 days caused down-regulation of mRNAs for <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein,</b> myelin basic protein and myelin-associated glycoprotein by 5 days after axotomy {{with an increase in}} GFAP mRNA. A more protracted change followed axotomy at 35 days of age. The abundance of mRNAs for <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> and myelin basic protein was significantly reduced by 28 days after transection in the affected nerve. Quantification of <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> mRNA expression in individual oligodendrocytes confirmed the down-regulation. However, in contrast to the effects on the major myelin proteins, the abundance of myelin-associated glycoprotein mRNA increased in the affected nerve for at least the initial month after lesioning at 35 days. The results show that optic nerve transection has significant effects on myelin protein mRNA expression in oligodendrocytes of optic nerve. However, the changes in myelin protein gene activity are relatively small and more protracted than those seen in Schwann cells after peripheral nerve section. Because axotomy also causes marked changes in the glial population of the optic nerve it is not possible unequivocally to ascribe the alteration in gene expression to loss of axons. However, the data may provide evidence that axons do influence myelin protein genes in oligodendrocytes and are necessary for them to develop their full expression. </p...|$|E

These premyelinating oligodendrocytes have one of two fates: they myelinate axons or degenerate.

We previously showed the ratio of myelin-associated glycoprotein to <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> 1 in post-mortem human brain tissue correlates with the degree of ante-mortem ischaemia. In age-matched post-mortem cohorts of Alzheimer's disease (n = 49), vascular dementia (n = 17) and control brains (n = 33) from the South West Dementia Brain Bank (Bristol), we have now examined the relationship between the ratio of myelin-associated glycoprotein to <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> 1 and several other proteins involved in regulating white matter vascularity and blood flow. Across the three cohorts, white matter perfusion, indicated by the ratio of myelin-associated glycoprotein to <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> 1, correlated positively with the concentration of the vasoconstrictor, endothelin 1 (P = 0. 0005), and negatively with the concentration of the pro-angiogenic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor (P = 0. 0015). The activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme, which catalyses production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II was not altered. In samples of frontal white matter from an independent (Oxford, UK) cohort of post-mortem brains (n = 74), we confirmed the significant correlations between the ratio of myelin-associated glycoprotein to <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> 1 and both endothelin 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. We also assessed microvessel density in the Bristol (UK) samples, by measurement of factor VIII-related antigen, which we showed to correlate with immunohistochemical measurements of vessel density, and found factor VIII-related antigen levels to correlate with the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (P = 0. 0487), suggesting that upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor tends to increase vessel density in the white matter. We propose that downregulation of endothelin 1 and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor in the context of reduced ratio of myelin-associated glycoprotein to <b>proteolipid</b> <b>protein</b> 1 are likely to be protective physiological responses to reduced white matter perfusion. Further analysis of the Bristol cohort showed that endothelin 1 was reduced in the white matter in Alzheimer's disease (P < 0. 05) compared with control subjects, but not in vascular dementia, in which endothelin 1 tended to be elevated, perhaps reflecting abnormal regulation of white matter perfusion in vascular dementia.
