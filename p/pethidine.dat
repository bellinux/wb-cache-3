5|$|Linezolid is a weak {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should not}} be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with <b>pethidine</b> (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, <b>pethidine</b> (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
25|$|The {{adverse effects}} of <b>pethidine</b> {{administration}} are primarily those of the opioids as a class: nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, diaphoresis, urinary retention, and constipation. Unlike other opioids, it does not cause miosis because of its anticholinergic properties. Overdose can cause muscle flaccidity, respiratory depression, obtundation, cold and clammy skin, hypotension, and coma. A narcotic antagonist such as naloxone is indicated to reverse respiratory depression and other effects of <b>pethidine.</b> Serotonin syndrome has occurred in patients receiving concurrent antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Convulsive seizures sometimes observed in patients receiving parenteral <b>pethidine</b> on a chronic basis {{have been attributed to}} accumumulation in plasma of the metabolite norpethidine (normeperidine). Fatalities have occurred following either oral or intravenous <b>pethidine</b> overdose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pethidine,</b> {{also known}} as {{meperidine}} and sold under the brand name Demerol among others, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. <b>Pethidine</b> is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the <b>pethidine</b> 4-phenylpiperidines (piminodine, anileridine and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, etc.), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E
25|$|Like other opioid drugs, <b>pethidine</b> has the {{potential}} to cause physical dependence or addiction. It {{may be more likely to}} be abused than other prescription opioids, perhaps because of its rapid onset of action. When compared with oxycodone, hydromorphone, and placebo, <b>pethidine</b> was consistently associated with more euphoria, difficulty concentrating, confusion, and impaired psychomotor and cognitive performance when administered to healthy volunteers. The especially severe side effects unique to <b>pethidine</b> among opioids—serotonin syndrome, seizures, delirium, dysphoria, tremor—are primarily or entirely due to the action of its metabolite, norpethidine.|$|E
25|$|In {{data from}} the U.S. Drug Abuse Warning Network, {{mentions}} of hazardous or harmful use of <b>pethidine</b> declined between 1997 and 2002, in contrast to increases for fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, and oxycodone. The number of dosage units of <b>pethidine</b> reported lost or stolen in the U.S. increased 16.2% between 2000 and 2003, from 32,447 to 37,687.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pethidine</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of moderate to severe pain, and is delivered as a hydrochloride salt in tablets, as a syrup, or by intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection. For much of the 20th century, <b>pethidine</b> was the opioid of choice for many physicians; in 1975, 60% of doctors prescribed it for acute pain and 22% for chronic severe pain.|$|E
25|$|Like morphine, <b>pethidine</b> exerts its {{analgesic}} effects {{by acting}} as an agonist at the μ-opioid receptor.|$|E
25|$|Several {{synthetic}} opioids function additionally as NMDAR-antagonists, such as <b>pethidine,</b> levorphanol, methadone, dextropropoxyphene, tramadol and ketobemidone.|$|E
25|$|Analgesics, such as {{tramadol}} and <b>pethidine</b> due to {{the potential}} {{for an increase in}} seizure risk and serotonin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pethidine</b> {{is quickly}} {{hydrolysed}} {{in the liver}} to pethidinic acid and is also demethylated to norpethidine, which has half the analgesic activity of <b>pethidine</b> but a longer elimination half-life (8–12 hours); accumulating with regular administration, or in renal failure. Norpethidine is toxic and has convulsant and hallucinogenic effects. The toxic effects mediated by the metabolites cannot be countered with opioid receptor antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone, and are probably primarily due to norpethidine's anticholinergic activity probably due to its structural similarity to atropine, though its pharmacology has not been thoroughly explored. The neurotoxicity of pethidine's metabolites is a unique feature of <b>pethidine</b> compared to other opioids. Pethidine's metabolites are further conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted into the urine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pethidine</b> {{has serious}} {{interactions}} {{that can be}} dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, selegiline, tranylcypromine). Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion. It {{is thought to be}} caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that <b>pethidine</b> can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, some antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pethidine</b> is {{the most}} widely used opioid in labour and {{delivery}} but has fallen out of favour in some countries such as the United States in favour of other opioids, due to its potential drug interactions (especially with serotonergics) and its neurotoxic metabolite, norpethidine. It is still commonly used in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and is the preferred opioid in the United Kingdom for use during labour. <b>Pethidine</b> is the preferred painkiller for diverticulitis, because it decreases intestinal intraluminal pressure.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of {{potential}} clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, <b>pethidine</b> and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, amiodarone, flecainide, quinidine, fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pethidine</b> {{is often}} {{employed}} {{in the treatment of}} postanesthetic shivering. The pharmacologic mechanism of this antishivering effect is not fully understood, but it may involve the stimulation of κ-opioid receptors.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine's {{apparent}} in vitro efficacy as an antispasmodic agent {{is due to}} its local anesthetic effects. It does not have antispasmodic effects in vivo. Channels: Evidence that Meperidine is a Local Anesthetic| journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1481–1490 | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |date=November 1999 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199911000-00042 | pmid = 10551601}} <b>Pethidine</b> also has stimulant effects mediated by its inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). Because of its DAT inhibitory action, <b>pethidine</b> will substitute for cocaine in animals trained to discriminate cocaine from saline.|$|E
25|$|Two small, {{placebo-controlled}} {{trials have}} been conducted to assess the efficacy of ondansetron for postanesthetic shivering, a common occurrence after surgery. Ondansetron {{was found to be}} as effective as <b>pethidine</b> (meperidine, Demerol) when given as a single intravenous dose before anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurotoxicity}} of MPTP {{was first}} hinted at in 1976 after Barry Kidston, a 23-year-old chemistry {{graduate student in}} Maryland, synthesized MPPP (a synthetic opiate related to <b>pethidine</b> and the prodines) with MPTP as a major impurity, and self-injected the result. Within three days he began exhibiting symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The National Institute of Mental Health found traces of MPPP, MPTP, and other <b>pethidine</b> analogues in his lab. They tested the substances on rats, but due to rodents' tolerance {{for this type of}} neurotoxin nothing was observed. Kidston's parkinsonism was successfully treated with levodopa but he died 18 months later from a cocaine overdose. Upon autopsy, destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra was discovered.|$|E
25|$|Its {{analgesic}} effects {{take about}} one hour {{to come into}} effect and 2h to 4h to peak after oral administration with an immediate-release formulation. On a dose-by-dose basis tramadol has about one tenth the potency of morphine and is approximately equally potent when compared with <b>pethidine</b> and codeine.|$|E
25|$|Hannam also {{discovered}} that 4 members of Adams' household staff had been prescribed either morphine, heroin or <b>pethidine</b> by Adams. Adams obtained these on the NHS, leading Hannam to conclude that he was merely using their names and keeping the drugs for his own supplies – an act of fraud.|$|E
25|$|Three known {{kinds of}} opioid receptors have been identified: mu (μ), kappa (κ) and delta (δ). Synthetic opioid and opioid-derivative drugs {{activate}} these receptors (possibly by {{acting on the}} PAG directly, where these receptors are densely expressed) to produce analgesia. These drugs include morphine, heroin (diacetylmorphine), <b>pethidine,</b> hydrocodone, oxycodone, and similar pain-reducing compounds.|$|E
25|$|It is more lipid-soluble than morphine, {{resulting}} in a faster onset of action. Its duration of clinical effect is 120–150 minutes, although it is typically administered at 4– to 6-hour intervals. <b>Pethidine</b> {{has been shown to}} be less effective than morphine, diamorphine, or hydromorphone at easing severe pain, or pain associated with movement or coughing.|$|E
25|$|Several analogs of <b>pethidine</b> such as 4-fluoropethidine {{have been}} {{synthesized}} that are potent inhibitors of the reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine via DAT and NET. It {{has also been}} associated with cases of serotonin syndrome, suggesting some interaction with serotonergic neurons, but the relationship has not been definitively demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|Hydrazine sulfate {{is also a}} {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), and is incompatible with alcohol, tranquilizers and sleeping pills (benzodiazepines and barbiturates), and other psycho-active drugs, with <b>pethidine</b> (meperidine, Demerol), and with foods containing significant amounts of the amino acid breakdown product tyramine, such as aged cheeses, raisins, avocados, processed and cured fish and meats, fermented products, and others.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} {{synthetic}} opioids such as methadone (1937), <b>pethidine</b> (1939), fentanyl (late 1950s), and derivatives thereof have been introduced, and each is preferred for certain specialized applications. Nonetheless, morphine remains the {{drug of choice}} for American combat medics, who carry packs of syrettes containing 16 milligrams each for use on severely wounded soldiers. No drug {{has been found that}} can match the painkilling effect of opioids without also duplicating much of their addictive potential.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to {{drowsiness}} usually develops over 5–7 days, but if troublesome, {{switching to}} an alternative opioid often helps. Certain opioids such as fentanyl, morphine and diamorphine (heroin) {{tend to be}} particularly sedating, while others such as oxycodone, tilidine and meperidine (<b>pethidine)</b> tend to produce comparatively less sedation, but individual patients responses can vary markedly and some degree {{of trial and error}} may be needed to find the most suitable drug for a particular patient. Otherwise, treatment with CNS stimulants is generally effective.|$|E
25|$|The placebo {{administration}} {{may prove}} to be a useful treatment in some specific cases where recommended drugs cannot be used. For example, burn patients who are experiencing respiratory problems cannot often be prescribed opioid (morphine) or opioid derivatives (<b>pethidine),</b> as these can cause further respiratory depression. In such cases placebo injections (normal saline, etc.) are of use in providing real pain relief to burn patients if those not in delirium are told they are being given a powerful dose of painkiller.|$|E
25|$|Haloperidol was {{discovered}} in 1958 by Paul Janssen. It was made from <b>pethidine</b> (meperidine). It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is the most commonly used typical antipsychotic. The yearly cost of the typical dose of haloperidol is about 20 to 800 pounds (30 to 1,250 US dollars) in the United Kingdom. The cost in the United States is around 250 US dollars a year.|$|E
25|$|Jerks {{of muscle}} groups, {{much of the}} body, or a series in rapid succession, which results in the person jerking bolt upright from a more relaxed sitting {{position}} is sometimes seen in ambulatory patients being treated with high doses of morphine, hydromorphine, and similar drugs, and is possibly a sign of high and/or rapidly increasing serum levels of these drugs. Myoclonic jerks caused by other opioids, such as tramadol and <b>pethidine,</b> may be less benign. Medications unrelated to opioids, such as anticholinergics, are known to cause myoclonic jerks.|$|E
25|$|Shipman studied {{medicine}} at Leeds School of Medicine and graduated in 1970. He started working at Pontefract General Infirmary in Pontefract, West Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1974 {{took his first}} position as a general practitioner (GP) at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. In 1975, he was caught forging prescriptions of <b>pethidine</b> (Demerol) for his own use. He was fined £600 and briefly attended a drug rehabilitation clinic in York. He became a GP at the Donneybrook Medical Centre in Hyde near Manchester, in 1977.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl patches {{are on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most}} {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. Fentanyl was first made by Paul Janssen in 1960. Janssen developed fentanyl by testing chemicals similar in structure to <b>pethidine</b> (meperidine) for opioid activity. The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate (the salt formed by combining fentanyl and citric acid in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio), which entered medical use as a general anaesthetic under the trade name Sublimaze in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Following on, Laborit {{considered}} whether chlorpromazine {{may have}} a role in managing patients with severe burns, Raynaud's phenomenon, or psychiatric disorders. At the Villejuif Mental Hospital in November 1951, he and Montassut administered an intravenous dose to psychiatrist Cornelia Quarti who was acting as a volunteer. Quarti noted the indifference, but fainted upon getting up to go to the toilet, and so further testing was discontinued (orthostatic hypotension is a possible side effect of chlorpromazine). Despite this, Laborit continued to push for testing in psychiatric patients during early 1952. Psychiatrists were reluctant initially, but on January 19, 1952, it was administered (alongside <b>pethidine,</b> pentothal and ECT) to Jacques Lh. a 24-year-old manic patient, who responded dramatically, and was discharged after three weeks having received 855mg of the drug in total.|$|E
25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (<b>pethidine</b> was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E
500|$|Presley's divorce {{took effect}} on October 9, 1973. He was now {{becoming}} increasingly unwell. Twice {{during the year}} he overdosed on barbiturates, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. Toward the end of 1973, he was hospitalized, semicomatose {{from the effects of}} <b>pethidine</b> addiction. According to his primary care physician, Dr. George C. Nichopoulos, Presley [...] "felt that by getting [...] from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street." [...] Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever. Despite his failing health, in 1974 he undertook another intensive touring schedule.|$|E
500|$|Following Jackson's death, {{reports of}} {{his use of}} <b>pethidine</b> (Demerol) surfaced. Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who {{provided}} nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he asked her for unspecified [...] "products for sleep." [...] On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol. Lee refused, telling him, [...] "Michael, {{the only problem with}} you taking this medication ... is you're going to take it and you're not going to wake up." [...] Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before by IV injection and that his doctor told him it was safe. He did not name the doctor. [...] An overdose of propofol can cause the patient to stop breathing, leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.|$|E
2500|$|In {{another case}} the {{tribunal}} ordered {{the suspension of}} a nurse for professional misconduct. [...] The nurse was an addict of <b>pethidine</b> and {{was found to be}} administering <b>pethidine</b> to herself whilst on duty. [...] On a one occasion, her use of the drug caused her after helping a patient shower, swung the patient’s underpant above her head whilst laughing. The nurse concerned was also found to have administered <b>pethidine</b> to patients without prescription and also to have destroyed out-of-date <b>pethidine</b> without supervision.|$|E
