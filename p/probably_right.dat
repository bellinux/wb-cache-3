25|$|In {{addition}} to her closet drama Antonius, a translation of the French play Marc-Antoine (1578) by Robert Garnier, Mary {{is known to have}} translated two other works: A discourse of life and death by Philippe de Mornay, which was published with Antonius in 1592; and Petrarch’s The triumph of death, which circulated in manuscript. Her original poems include the pastoral, “A dialogue betweene two shepheards, Thenot and Piers, in praise of Astrea,” and the two dedicatory addresses, one to Elizabeth I and one to her brother Philip, contained in the Tixall manuscript copy of her verse psalter. An elegy for Philip, “The dolefull lay of Clorinda,” which was published in Colin Clouts come home againe (1595), has been attributed to both Spenser and to Mary Herbert, but Pamela Coren is <b>probably</b> <b>right</b> to attach the work to Spenser, and certainly right to assert that Mary’s poetic reputation does not suffer from the loss of the attribution.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few months}} of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a {{pregnancy}} scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She wants more from him (children), while he is happy just the way they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is <b>probably</b> <b>right,</b> {{but it would have been}} a great year.|$|E
500|$|In Illinois v. Gates, the Supreme Court {{established}} that courts should apply a [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] test {{to determine whether}} an anonymous tip is sufficiently reliable to provide probable cause to issue an arrest warrant. Although officers in Gates did not personally witness any criminal activity, the Supreme Court held that the anonymous tip in question was reliable, because officers could verify several events predicted by the anonymous tip. Seven years after Gates, the Supreme Court held in Alabama v. White that an anonymous tip was sufficiently reliable to provide reasonable suspicion to justify a temporary detention, because the tip accurately predicted several key details. Although the Court conceded that White was a [...] "close case", the tip in question [...] "exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability" [...] to justify a temporary detention. The Court explained that [...] if [...] "an informant is shown to be right about some things, he is <b>probably</b> <b>right</b> about other facts that he has alleged, including {{the claim that the}} object of the tip is engaged in criminal activity." ...|$|E

500|$|Less {{successfully}} {{during this}} period, Kneale completed screenplays for adaptations of the novels Lord of the Flies by William Golding and Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Neither of these scripts ever saw production, as the companies making them {{went out of}} business—Kneale commented in a 2003 interview that [...] "I reckon I closed down at least two film companies." [...] Another screenplay that went unproduced was a Kneale original, a drama involving a wave of teenage suicides called The Big Giggle, or The Big, Big Giggle. Written in 1965 while Kneale was suffering from a mystery illness and forced to stay in bed for a long period, the concept started life as a drama serial for the BBC, before the corporation had second thoughts {{about the nature of}} the storyline and the possibility of copycat suicides; Kneale later agreed that they were <b>probably</b> <b>right</b> not to make it for television. The production was nearly made as a film by 20th Century Fox, but John Trevelyan, Chief Executive of the British Board of Film Censors, forbade the script's production.|$|E
500|$|Krause {{deemed the}} revelation of Adele's moving on [...] "an {{interesting}} twist, with unexpected repercussions", whereas Stevens' offering Bailey the money to open the free clinic, was negatively reviewed; looked upon as the most predictable event of the episode. Krause noted that both medical cases were confusing, assessing that [...] "it {{would have been nice}} {{to learn more about the}} severe dehydration that caused the runner's legs to swell." [...] In addition, Krause explained how the Amish angle was unexpected, but significantly helpful to the entertainment level, while a lack of realism in the medical case was highlighted: [...] "No one bothered to really mention that it would have been nice, had it been caught earlier. It was, but she allowed herself to deteriorate." [...] The fight between Grey and Shepherd was deemed [...] "a tiff that Derek was entirely responsible for", but also a proof of [...] "how damaged Meredith really is". Krause expressed disappointment in the storyline involving O'Malley proposing to Torres: [...] "Callie certainly didn't look thrilled. If she believes George is proposing as a means to get over his grief, she's <b>probably</b> <b>right</b> and should likely run in the opposite direction." [...] Considering each of the attending physcians' chances of becoming the chief of surgery, Krause noted the possibility of Sloan being chosen as [...] "hilarious, but a tad unbelievable", whereas assessing that Montgomery's [...] "great traits" [...] might suffer, due to her relationship with Karev, which was described as [...] "certainly bringing into question her ability to stay on the straight and narrow". Krause characterized the whole as [...] "one of those guilty pleasures that many may not admit to".|$|E
2500|$|Jacques Vallée {{attempted}} to interest Spielberg in an alternative {{explanation for the}} phenomenon. In an interview on Conspire.com, Vallée said, [...] "I argued with him that the subject was even more interesting if it wasn't extraterrestrials. If it was real, physical, but not ET. So he said, 'You're <b>probably</b> <b>right,</b> but that's not what the public is expecting— this is Hollywood and I want to give people something that's close to what they expect.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Churchill {{was widely}} {{blamed for the}} fiasco. He was <b>probably</b> <b>right</b> in saying that had the naval attacks been pressed the Turks, short of {{ammunition}} and low in morale {{would have had to}} abandon the forts and the Fleet could have occupied the Sea of Marmora and with it Constantinople. But it is even more likely that had the Fleet been properly equipped with spotter planes and destroyer minesweepers, the attack on 18 March would have been successful. It is almost certain that a Fleet so equipped and supported by the four divisions made available in April would have cleared the Strait with almost no loss. As the minister responsible, Churchill was the one who did not provide the resources needed. Clement Attlee, who served in the army at Gallipoli, described the campaign as [...] "an immortal gamble that did not come off... Sir Winston had the one strategic idea in the war. He did not believe in throwing away masses of people to be massacred".|$|E
2500|$|In May 1908 Homer {{suffered}} temporary {{impairment of}} his speech and muscular control as {{the effects of a}} mild stroke; on June 4 he wrote his brother Charles that [...] "I can paint as well as ever. I think my pictures better for having one eye in the pot and one eye up a chimney— a new departure in the art world." [...] By July 18 he was able to write that he had regained his abilities with the exception of tying [...] "my neck tie in the way that I have done for the past 20 years....Every four or five days I try to do it but....it has been of no use." [...] Although he never completely recovered, Homer was well enough to attempt a major work, and it is <b>probably</b> <b>Right</b> and Left that he referred to {{in a letter to his}} brother Charles dated December 8, 1908: [...] "I am painting when it is light enough on a most surprising picture".|$|E
2500|$|The Macedonian general, Antipater, now {{advanced}} {{from the}} north, {{but with a}} force very inferior {{to that of the}} confederates. He was defeated in the first action near Thermopylae and compelled to retreat into the small town of Lamia. Leosthenes, keen to finish the war with one blow, prosecuted the siege with the utmost vigour. However, his assaults were repulsed and he was compelled to resort to the slower method of a blockade. While he was engaged in forming the lines of circumvallation, the besieged made a vigorous sally, during which Leosthenes received a blow on the head from a stone and died three days later. His death greatly discouraged the allied Greek cause and Pausanias is <b>probably</b> <b>right</b> in regarding it as the main cause of their ultimate failure. Phocion's remark, on the other hand, is well known, that [...] "he was very well fitted for a short course, but not equal to a long one." ...|$|E
5000|$|Later in the interview, {{after his}} {{previous}} comments received some pushback from the hosts, he stated: [...] "I think the of consent law is <b>probably</b> about <b>right,</b> that is <b>probably</b> roughly the <b>right</b> age ... {{but there are}} certainly people {{who are capable of}} giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them."

2500|$|On 28 January 2012, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, gave {{a speech}} calling on African nations to repeal laws that place {{sanctions}} on homosexual conduct. Speaking to a journalist, African Cardinal Robert Sarah, president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, called the speech stupid. The journalist reported: [...] "Asked if Ban Ki-moon was overstepping his responsibilities, Cardinal Sarah replied: 'Sure, you cannot impose something stupid like that.' He added: 'Poor countries like Africa just accept it because it's imposed upon them through money, through being tied to aid.'" [...] He said that African bishops must react against this move against African culture. Meanwhile, Cardinal Peter Turkson, while recognising {{that some of the}} sanctions imposed on homosexuals in Africa are an [...] "exaggeration", stated that the [...] "intensity of the reaction is probably commensurate with tradition". [...] "Just as there's a sense of a call for rights, there's also a call to respect culture, of all kinds of people", he said. [...] "So, if it's being stigmatized, in fairness, it's <b>probably</b> <b>right</b> to find out why it is being stigmatized." [...] He also called for distinction to be made between human rights and moral issues.|$|E
2500|$|... "Linda was {{a joy to}} work with. I {{remember}} we were doing a tracking shot, a camera car on tracks running about one hundred yards down this field. Linda and I were on this horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's <b>probably</b> <b>right.</b> I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E
