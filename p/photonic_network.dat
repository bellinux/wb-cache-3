Two optical modulation schemes have been compared and the limitations set on laser linewidths are derived. The potential number of network users in each case has been discussed. It has been shown that on the average optical intensity modulation performs better than optical phase modulation. It has also been shown that the SCM/CD networks, using semiconductor lasers, are competitive with other multi-channel approaches above a certain range of the bit-rate per channel. Finally, a discussion on the diverse techniques to reduce the impact of phase noise on coherent <b>photonic</b> <b>networks</b> is provided...|$|R

40|$|Contention {{resolution}} {{has been}} a major concern in the design of burst <b>photonic</b> <b>networks.</b> Previous researches have proven that wavelength conversion is an effective technique for contention resolution. However, it is not realistic under the current technology to assume that all nodes of the network have conversion capabilities. Therefore, burst <b>photonic</b> <b>networks</b> with limited wavelength conversion lead to more practical solutions. Efficient wavelength assignment algorithm is required for such networks. As a simple but effective approach, PWA (Priority-based Wavelength Assignment) tries to avoid contentions beforehand by assigning different wavelengths to bursts sharing one or more common links, using a wavelength priority database where every wavelength is prioritized for each destination based on the history of prior transmissions. In this paper, we extend PWA to be suitable for burst <b>photonic</b> <b>networks</b> with sparse conversion or limited-range conversion and show the validation of our algorithm through simulation results...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{circuit-switched}} onchip <b>photonic</b> interconnection <b>network</b> (CSPIN) architecture. Different from existing circuit-switched <b>photonic</b> <b>networks,</b> CSPIN eliminates the electronic control layer but employs optical signaling {{to control the}} circuit switching functions. To implement CSPIN, the CSPIN router is proposed which uses electro-optical tuned microring resonators. The analysis based on the synthesis result of the CSPIN router shows that significant savings in power and pathsetup latency are achieved by the proposed CSPIN architecture...|$|R

In burst switched <b>photonic</b> <b>networks,</b> contentions caused by multiple bursts intending {{to use the same}} wavelength of the same link at the same time, remarkably increase burst dropping probability and degrade network throughput. As efficient contention resolution methods, the previously presented deflection routing and priority-based wavelength assignment (PWA) work individually but are not compatible with each other. It is therefore desirable to combine these two methods together to make further performance improvement. In this work, we revamped PWA to support deflection routing and show the improved performance of deflection routing-compatible PWA through simulation results...|$|R
