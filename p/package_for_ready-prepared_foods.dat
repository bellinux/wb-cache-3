She {{told the audience}} that 'with more wives and mothers working, speed and ease in food preparation is a [...] "must"'. She continued 'Many women have no training in home making, and packaged and <b>ready-prepared</b> <b>foods,</b> like cereals, cake, pastry and biscuit mixes, canned and frozen foods, make life easier'. A selection of 'hot muffins made with bran' were handed out and Fulton told the listeners that 'These are quick and easy to make and most economical'.|$|R
40|$|Dietary {{patterns}} are a useful summary measure of diet. Few {{studies have examined}} the nutrient profiles underpinning the dietary patterns of young children. The study aim is to determine whether dietary patterns at 6 and 15 months of age are associated with nutrient intakes at 8 and 18 months, respectively. Participants were children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children who had complete dietary pattern and nutrient intake data (n = 725 at 6 – 8 months, n = 535 at 15 – 18 months). The association between tertiles of dietary pattern scores and nutrient intake was examined using a non-parametric test for trend. Scores on the home-made traditional pattern (6 – 8 months) were positively associated with median energy intake. Each dietary pattern had different associations with energy-adjusted intakes of macro- and micro-nutrients. At both times, the discretionary pattern was positively and the <b>ready-prepared</b> baby <b>foods</b> pattern was negatively associated with sodium intake. At 6 – 8 months, calcium and iron intakes decreased across scores on the home-made traditional and breastfeeding patterns, but increased across the <b>ready-prepared</b> baby <b>food</b> patterns. These findings highlight that dietary patterns in infants and toddlers vary in their underlying energy and nutrient composition...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Data {{from the}} Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) have {{previously}} shown that dietary patterns are observable by 3 years. However, {{it is not}} clear when dietary patterns emerge. We aimed to describe dietary patterns in early life and their associations with maternal and infant sociodemographic characteristics. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Principal component analysis was applied to diet questionnaires of ALSPAC participants at 6 months (n= 7052) and 15 months (n= 5610) to extract dietary patterns. The sociodemographic factors associated with dietary patterns were investigated using regression analyses. RESULTS: Four dietary patterns were extracted at both 6 and 15 months. A traditional-style pattern characterized by home-prepared meats, vegetables and desserts, a second pattern characterized by <b>ready-prepared</b> baby <b>foods</b> and a third pattern characterized by discretionary foods such as biscuits, sweets and crisps were identified at both ages. At 6 months, the fourth pattern was characterized predominantly by breastfeeding and at 15 months, by contemporary-style foods including herbs, legumes, nuts, raw fruit and vegetables. Higher maternal age and education, number of siblings and lower body mass index (BMI) was associated with higher scores on the breastfeeding or meat, vegetables and desserts patterns, whereas higher discretionary food pattern scores were associated with younger maternal age, lower education, higher BMI and more siblings. Associations between sociodemographic factors and the <b>ready-prepared</b> baby <b>food</b> pattern scores were inconsistent across ages. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns emerge from infancy and are associated with sociodemographic characteristics. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{relation}} between the increased out-of-home food consumption and the rising of overweight and obesity prevalence rates has been widely assessed, and the a key {{role played by the}} catering sector in ensuring healthy food choices has been recognised. Governments’ healthy eating policies have a wide range of action, influencing consumer behavior, and the socioeconomic and  food environments, with specific actions for the catering sector. Information on the public support for these policies could help policy makers in planning decisions. This study aims to investigate the relationship of out-of-home eating frequency with beliefs about obesity causes, support to healthy eating policies, and with socio-demographic factors. Methods: Data on 3003 individuals from Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Poland and United Kingdom, of both sexes, aged ≥ 16 years, were employed, from the European survey on policy preferences (Eatwell). Data were analysed through Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. Results: Out-of-home eating varied with gender, age, marital status, education, BMI, and by country. Convenience food consumption was positively associated with obesity attribution to genetics, and inversely associated with attribution to lack of willpower. Attributions of obesity to lack of time, and to lack of self-control were associated with increased likelihood to consume fast-food and <b>ready-prepared</b> <b>food</b> respectively. Out-of-home eating people expressed higher support for information-based prevention, and actions aimed at healthier out-of-home eating, and lower support for restrictions and regulations of the food supply environment. Conclusion: Future research on out-of-home food consumers and their support towards public interventions for the catering sector, could have important implications for effective strategies to promote healthy eating...|$|R
