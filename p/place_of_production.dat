5|$|The German Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret state police"), {{known as}} the Gestapo, was {{responsible}} for targeting resistance groups in Belgium. Resistance fighters who were captured could expect to be interrogated, tortured and either summarily executed or sent to a concentration camp. The Gestapo was effective at using informants within groups to betray whole local resistance network and in examining resistance publications for clues about its <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> 2,000 resistance members involved in underground press alone were arrested during the war. In total, 30,000 members of the resistance were captured during the war, of whom 16,000 were executed or died in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The name Book of Kells {{is derived}} from the Abbey of Kells in Kells, County Meath, which was its home for much of the medieval period. The manuscript's date and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> {{have been the subject of}} {{considerable}} debate. Traditionally, the book was thought to have been created in the time of Columba, possibly even as the work of his own hands. This tradition has long been discredited on paleographic and stylistic grounds: most evidence points to a composition date 800, long after St. Columba's death in 597. The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with Viking raids on Iona, which began in 794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their holy relics into Ireland and Scotland. There is another tradition, with some traction among Irish scholars, that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint's death.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of sugar leaves residues that differ substantially {{depending on the}} raw materials used and on the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> While cane molasses is often used in food preparation, humans find molasses from sugar beets unpalatable, and it consequently ends up mostly as industrial fermentation feedstock (for example in alcohol distilleries), or as animal feed.

25|$|Corporations {{set their}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> usually {{in areas with}} little to no labor regulations, {{and as a result}} low labor cost occurs. With the low labor regulations, this is where you start to see mistreatment of workers {{especially}} with women and children. Poor working conditions and sexual harassment {{are just some of the}} mistreatment faced by women in the textile supply chain. Marina Prieto-Carrón shows in her research in Central America that women in sweatshops are not even supplied with toilet paper in the bathroom everyday. The reason it costs corporations more is because people can not work to their full potential in poor conditions, affecting the global marketplace. Furthermore, when corporations decide to change manufacturing rates or locations in industries that employ more women, they are often left with no job nor assistance. This kind of sudden reduction or elimination in hours is seen in industries such as the textile industry and agriculture industry, both which employ a higher amount of women than men. One solution to mistreatment of women in the supply chain is more involvement from the corporation and trying to regulate the outsourcing of their product.|$|E

The 'postindustrial' forest, in which the emphasis placed on timber production is reduced relative to that placed on environmental services (such as biodiversity and recreation), epitomises the character of postproductive forestry. In {{many parts of the}} industrialised world, forests have essentially become <b>places</b> <b>of</b> consumption (of amenity, recreation, and wildlife observation) by a largely urban population, rather than <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> (<b>of</b> timber) for a largely urban population.

The church has reared him amidst rites and pomps, and he carries out the advice which her music gave him, and builds a cathedral needed by her chants and processions. He finds a war raging: it educates him by trumpet, in barracks, and he betters the instruction. He finds two counties groping to bring coal, or flour, or fish, from the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to the place of consumption, and he hits on a railroad. Every master has found his materials collected, and his power lay in his sympathy with his people, and in his love of the materials he wrought in. What an economy of power! and what a compensation for the shortness of life! All is done to his hand. The world has brought him thus far on his way. The human race has gone out before him, sunk the hills, filled the hollows, and bridged the rivers. Men, nations, poets, artisans, women, all have worked for him, and he enters into their labors. Choose any other thing, out of the line of tendency, out of the national feeling and history, and he would have all to do for himself: his powers would be expended in the first preparations. Great genial power, one would almost say, consists in not being original at all; in being altogether receptive; in letting the world do all, and suffering the spirit of the hour to pass unobstructed through the mind.|$|E

Through the analysis of material structures (asylums, prisons, schools, factories and hospitals), that define the relationship between the individual, the community and the modalities of government (that Foucault calls “governmentalities”), the philosopher focuses on the body and corporeity as <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> new and original forms of power. Indeed, around the body a series (almost endless) of structures, symbols, rituals and representations, which aim to conform the subject with disciplinary practices, is built. Nevertheless, breaking the classical continuity of political theories developed starting from Hobbes and Locke, this “series” reveals its intensity no more through the simple bodies conformation, but through their modality of resistance against power pressure. In this way, the essay aims to analyze the relationship between corporeity and subjectivity, creating a connection between some of Foucault’s fundamental works...|$|R
