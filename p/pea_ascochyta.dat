40|$|Intercropping (IC) {{is known}} as an {{agricultural}} practice which can improve the use of environmental resources (light, nutrients and water) resulting in yield advantages compared to sole cropping (SC) (Willey, 1979) particularly in low input systems. But, diseases ands pests can strongly affect both yield and grain quality in such systems. Now, numerous studies have shown significant reductions in harmful insects and on diseases in IC compared to SC {{of the same species}} (Vandermeer, 1989; Kinane and Lyngkjaer, 2002) even if others studies did not confirmed these foundings. The aim of our study was to evaluate the assumption that IC can reduce pea pests (green aphids and weevils), <b>pea</b> <b>ascochyta</b> and main durum wheat diseases (mildew, brown rust, fusarium and septoria) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOn spring <b>pea,</b> <b>ascochyta</b> blight (Mycosphaerellapinodes) {{frequently}} {{appears at}} the plant base on yellowing stipules and disease scores are higher on basal parts of the plants than on the uppermost parts. In order to investigate the relationship between pea plant growth stage and/ororgan age, and ascochyta blight on whole plants and detached stipules and pods, two experiments were conducted in 2009 and 2010 under controlled conditions. This study showed that plant stage does not influence receptivity to ascochyta blight before {{the appearance of the}} first visual signs of senescence (beginning of yellowing). When stipules were green, regardless of the plant stage, no differences of receptivity was observed (except for the youngest stipule(s) {{at the top of the}} plant). Plant stageonly had an effect on receptivity by the way of the importance of the visual senescence of the organs and visual senescence has a more predominant effect on plant receptivity than the plant stage considered alone. An effect of the nodal position, linked with the stipule age, was observed on whole plant inoculation, with a decreasing disease severitygradient from the base to the top of the plant which was explained by a greater receptivity for the basal/ older stipules which had begun yellowing. On detached stipules, a higher receptivity was observed as soon as visual senescence had been observed. On pods, during their filling, few symptoms appeared and severity was important as soon as they began to yellow. The effect of ascochyta blight on induced senescence of the infected stipules was also observed...|$|E

High water volumes are necessary for full coverage of leaves and penetration of the plant canopy.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} barley-legume {{intercrop}} in an organic farming system on disease incidence was investigated. The legumes were lupin, faba bean and pea. Diseases were detected on pea and barley. On <b>pea,</b> only <b>ascochyta</b> blight (Ascochyta pisi) was observed. When either pea variety was intercropped with barley, {{the level of}} ascochyta blight was reduced. Net blotch (Pyrenophora teres), brown rust (Puccinia recondita) and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei) (in order of incidence) were monitored on barley between flag leaf emergence and heading.

40|$|In field <b>peas,</b> <b>ascochyta</b> blight {{is one of}} {{the most}} common fungal {{diseases}} caused by Didymella pinodes. Despite the high diversity of pea cultivars, only little resistance has been developed until to date, still leading to significant losses in grain yield. Rhizobia as plant growth promoting endosymbionts are the main partners for establishment of symbiosis with pea plants. The key role of Rhizobium as an effective nitrogen source for legumes seed quality and quantity improvement is in line with sustainable agriculture and food security programs. Besides these growth promoting effects, Rhizobium symbiosis has been shown to have a priming impact on the plants immune system that enhances resistance against environmental perturbations. This is the first integrative study that investigates the effect of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae (Rlv) on phenotypic seed quality, quantity and fungal disease in pot grown pea (Pisum sativum) cultivars with two different resistance levels against D. pinodes through metabolomics and proteomics analyses. In addition, the pathogen effects on seed quantity components and quality are assessed at morphological and molecular level. Rhizobium inoculation decreased disease severity by significant reduction of seed infection level. Rhizobium symbiont enhanced yield through increased seed fresh and dry weights based on better seed filling. Rhizobium inoculation also induced changes in seed proteome and metabolome involved in enhanced P. sativum resistance level against D. pinodes. Besides increased redox and cell wall adjustments light is shed on the role of late embryogenesis abundant proteins and metabolites such as the seed triterpenoid Soyasapogenol. The results of this study open new insights into the significance of symbiotic Rhizobium interactions for crop yield, health and seed quality enhancement and reveal new metabolite candidates involved in pathogen resistance...|$|R
40|$|Key message: Phenotyping of {{specific}} cellular resistance responses and improvement of previous genetic map allowed {{the identification of}} novel genomic regions controlling cellular mechanisms involved in <b>pea</b> resistance to <b>ascochyta</b> blight and provided candidate genes suitable for MAS. Didymella pinodes, causing ascochyta blight, is a major pathogen of the pea crop and is responsible for serious damage and yield losses. Resistance is inherited polygenically and several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been already identified. However, the position of these QTLs should be further refined to identify molecular markers more {{closely linked to the}} resistance genes. In previous works, resistance was scored visually estimating the final disease symptoms; in this study, we have conducted a more precise phenotyping of resistance evaluating specific cellular resistance responses at the histological level to perform a more accurate QTL analysis. In addition, P 665 × Messire genetic map used to identify the QTLs was improved by adding 117 SNP markers located in genes. This combined approach has allowed the identification, for the first time, of genomic regions controlling cellular mechanisms directly involved in <b>pea</b> resistance to <b>ascochyta</b> blight. Furthermore, the inclusion of the gene-based SNP markers has allowed the identification of candidate genes co-located with QTLs and has provided robust markers for marker-assisted selection. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

50|$|Ascochyta blights occur {{throughout}} the world and can be of significant economic importance. Three fungi contribute to the ascochyta blight disease complex of <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum). <b>Ascochyta</b> pinodes (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella pinodes) causes Mycosphaerella blight. Ascochyta pinodella (synonym: Phoma medicaginis var. pinodella) causes Ascochyta foot rot, and Ascochyta pisi causes Ascochyta blight and pod spot. Of the three fungi, Ascochyta pinodes is of the most importance. These diseases are conducive under wet and humid conditions and can cause a yield loss of up to fifty percent if left uncontrolled. The best method to control <b>ascochyta</b> blights of <b>pea</b> {{is to reduce the}} amount of primary inoculum through sanitation, crop-rotation, and altering the sowing date. Other methods—chemical control, biological control, and development of resistant varieties—may also be used to effectively control ascochyta diseases.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} barley-legume {{intercrop}} in an organic farming system on disease incidence was investigated. The legumes were lupin (‘Prima’), faba bean (‘Columbo’) and pea (‘Bohatyr’ and ‘Agadir’). The barley variety was ’Otira’. Diseases were detected on pea and barley. On <b>pea,</b> only <b>Ascochyta</b> blight was observed. When either pea variety was intercropped with barley, {{the level of}} Ascochyta was reduced. Net blotch (Pyrenophora teres), brown rust (Puccinia recondita) and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei) (in order of incidence) were monitored on barley between flag leaf emergence and heading. The levels of all three diseases were reduced in every intercrop treatment compared to the barley monocrop. However, this reduction was only statistically significant in the Otira plus Bohartyr treatment for net blotch. Barley cv. Otira grown as monocrop with 50 kg N added as urea was also monitored under the same field conditions. The presence of added nitrogen increased levels of rust and mildew. Subsequently glasshouse experiments {{on the effect of}} the availability of N, P or K disease resistance mechanisms were set up. Barley was grown under different nutrient conditions (minus N, P or K). Plants were infected with powdery mildew at the third leaf stage. Plants depleted of nitrogen showed increased resistance to the fungus (effective at penetration). Absence of phosphorous appeared to increase penetration of powdery mildew but the resulting colonies were smaller than control. Depletion of K appeared to increase fungal penetration. ...|$|R
40|$|The endopolygalacturonase (endo-PG) {{inhibitor}} from Pisum sativum (pea) {{was characterized}} {{in terms of}} its effect on PGs from five pathotypes of Ascochyta pisi and seven other species of fungi and its occurrence in 14 pea varieties and species from three other genera. Each pathotype of Ascochyta pisi produced both an exo- and endo-PG and, in each case, the latter enzyme only was affected by the endo-PG inhibitor. Although each of the three other pea pathogens examined here produced an endo-PG, none of these enzymes was sensitive to the endo-PG inhibitor. Of the remaining four fungi, only Phoma solani produced exclusively exo-PG and Colletotrichum lindemuthianum and Aspergillus niger produced endo-PGs that were sensitive to the endo-PG inhibitor from pea. The endo-PG inhibitor occurred at highest concentration in the stipules and leaflets of the pea, and more than 75 % was recovered in a soluble form in extracts of these organs made in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5 · 0). Inhibitor was detected in each pea variety tested, although the yield varied considerably. Inhibitor of Ascochyta pisi endo-PG was similarly extracted from hypocotyls of Phaseolus vulgaris (bean), but was not detected in extracts of cucumber and cabbage seedlings. These results indicate that the endo-PG inhibitor is not directly responsible for the differential resistance of <b>pea</b> varieties to <b>Ascochyta</b> pisi pathovars. In addition, they provide further evidence of similarities between the endo-PGs of C. lindemuthianum and Ascochyta pisi and between the endo-PG inhibitors from pea and bean...|$|R
40|$|Ascochyta blight (blackspot) is a {{significant}} disease of field pea (Pisum sativum) with worldwide distribution, causing grain production losses of 15 % per annum in Australia. Phoma koolunga {{is a relatively new}} pathogen of this complex disease in Australian field pea crops. This thesis reports information about aspects of the epidemiology of this fungus in Australian conditions. The survival of P. koolunga on field pea stubble and as pseudosclerotia buried in field soil was examined. The frequency of recovery of this fungus declined over time and it was not recovered from stubble buried in soil or placed on the soil surface in pots outdoors at months 11 and 15, respectively, and later. Pseudosclerotia were produced in Petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with fluorocytocin or with sand. The maximum longevity of pseudosclerotia buried in soil in pots outdoors was less than 18 months. Infectivity of inoculum of the fungus decreased over time, as the mean number of lesions on plants inoculated with stubble buried or left on the soil surface for up to 6 and 5 months, respectively, and pseudosclerotia retrieved at 14 months and later from field soil did not differ from the water control in a pot bioassay. P. koolunga was isolated from field pea seed samples harvested from South Australia and Victoria. Disease was transmitted to 98 % of seedlings that emerged from artificially inoculated seeds (AIS) in growth room conditions. Seedling emergence rate from AIS at 8 ° C soil temperature was lower than at 12, 16 and 20 ° C and also disease severity on seedlings was greater at the lower temperature. Efficacy of fungicides as seed dressings was examined on AIS. P-Pickel T® and Jockey Stayer® were the most effective fungicides among six tested for reducing disease incidence and severity due to P. koolunga on seedlings that emerged from AIS sown in soil and on germination paper, respectively. The reaction of 12 field pea genotypes to one moderately virulent isolate of P. koolunga was evaluated by spraying a pycnidiospore suspension on plants in controlled conditions and assessing disease severity at 2 - 5 day intervals for 21 days. Sturt, Morgan and Parafield showed more severe disease on leaves than the other genotypes at 21 days post-inoculation (dpi), and Kaspa, PBA Twilight, PBA Oura, PBA Wharton and WAPEA 2211 were less susceptible. When three isolates of P. koolunga which varied in virulence were sprayed on four genotypes of short, semi-leafless type peas, Morgan and WAPEA 2211 showed more disease than Kaspa at 21 dpi. Aggressiveness of isolates of P. koolunga on these four genotypes differed based on % leaf area diseased up to 14 dpi, but this difference had disappeared by 21 dpi. Some isolates of P. koolunga from seeds showed atypical morphology and reproductive behaviour. These cultures had rhizoid form mycelia on growth media such as PDA. Also, some atypical cultures of P. koolunga sectored from typical colonies on PDA. These sectors and cultures were confirmed as P. koolunga by DNA test using P. koolunga-specific primers. Mycelium from these sectors produced small lesions on leaves and stems of field <b>pea</b> seedling resembling <b>ascochyta</b> blight symptoms in controlled conditions. Pycnidium-like structures of these atypical cultures did not contain pycnidiospores, but had many round and hyaline fatty guttulae of different sizes, usually smaller than normal spores of P. koolunga which never germinated. Crossing 19 isolates of P. koolunga in vitro failed to initiate formation of pseudothecia of P. koolunga on pea stem pieces or on several growth media. This fungus might need specific environmental conditions for production of pseudothecia which still are unknown. The results of this study provide information about survival of P. koolunga, transmission to seedlings via infected seed, control of the fungus in seed and also reaction of field pea genotypes to this pathogen in South Australian conditions. These findings improve the understanding of epidemiology of this disease and consequently can help to improve management of this pathogen in the field. Thesis (Ph. D.)
