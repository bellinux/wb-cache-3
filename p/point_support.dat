500|$|At dawn on 28 April, {{the youth}} {{divisions}} Clausewitz, Scharnhorst, and Theodor Körner, attacked from the south-west toward {{the direction of}} Berlin. They were part of Wenck's XX Corps and were made up of men from the officer training schools, making them {{some of the best}} units the Germans had in reserve. They covered a distance of about , before being halted at the tip of Lake Schwielow, south-west of Potsdam and still [...] from Berlin. During the night, General Wenck reported to the German Supreme Army Command in Fuerstenberg that his XII Army had been forced back along the entire front. According to Wenck, no attack on Berlin was possible. At that <b>point,</b> <b>support</b> from the IX Army could no longer be expected. In the meantime, about 25,000 German soldiers of the IX Army, along with several thousand civilians, succeeded in reaching the lines of the XII Army after breaking out of the Halbe pocket. The casualties on both sides were very high. Nearly 30,000 Germans were buried after the battle in the cemetery at Halbe. About 20,000 soldiers of the Red Army also died trying to stop the breakout; most are buried at a cemetery next to the Baruth-Zossen road. These are the known dead, but the remains of more who died in the battle are found every year, so the total of those who died will never be known. Nobody knows how many civilians died {{but it could have been}} as high as 10,000.|$|E
2500|$|General-purpose {{computing}} on GPUs only became {{practical and}} popular after about 2001, {{with the advent}} of both programmable shaders and floating <b>point</b> <b>support</b> on graphics processors. Notably, problems involving matrices and/or vectors especially two-, three-, or four-dimensional vectors were easy to translate to a GPU, which acts with native speed and support on those types. [...] The scientific computing community's experiments with the new hardware began with a matrix multiplication routine (2001); one of the first common scientific programs to run faster on GPUs than CPUs was an implementation of LU factorization (2005).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first known}} solutions for free flexural vibration of Mindlin plates of arbitrary shape with internal <b>point</b> <b>supports.</b> A new approach for modeling the <b>point</b> <b>supports</b> in vibration analysis is proposed. The method {{is based on the}} use of a set of pb- 2 shape functions to account for prescribed boundary conditions of different shapes. Internal <b>point</b> <b>supports</b> are imposed as geometric constraints in the final formulation of the governing eigenvalue equation. The proposed method is employed to determine the vibration frequencies of square and circular plates having an arbitrary number of internal <b>point</b> <b>supports.</b> Comparisons with known thin-plate solutions are carried out, where possible, to verify the accuracy of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimal {{locations}} of rigid <b>point</b> <b>supports</b> {{to maximize the}} fundamental frequency of free vibration of plates. The computational method uses the Rayleigh-Ritz method for the vibration analysis and the simplex method of Neider and Mead for the optimization search of support locations. Optimal results have been obtained for various common shapes of plates with a few <b>point</b> <b>supports.</b> The {{results show that the}} frequency of the plate is sensitive to the locations of the <b>point</b> <b>supports.</b> Moreover, these new optimal results provide useful information to designers seeking to exploit the position of <b>point</b> <b>supports</b> in their plate designs. It has been found that multiple solutions are a common feature of this plate optimization problem...|$|R
