5|$|CSF <b>pressure,</b> <b>as</b> {{measured}} by lumbar puncture, is 10–18 cmH2O (8–15 mmHg or 1.1–2 kPa) {{with the patient}} lying {{on the side and}} 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 mmHg or 2.1–3.2 kPa) with the patient sitting up. In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF <b>pressure</b> <b>as</b> estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the intracranial pressure.|$|E
5|$|A {{sample of}} CSF {{can be taken}} via lumbar puncture.

Cushing demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an area of low <b>pressure</b> <b>as</b> it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, Charley re-intensified under baroclinic instability. The resulting {{storm was}} a very large and fairly strong gale that gradually moved across the northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an atmospheric pressure of 980 mbar, which was lower than its <b>pressure</b> <b>as</b> a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain. The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August 27. While in the North Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise loop, and on August 30 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.|$|E

However, with a barometric pressure of 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg), Rita is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes Camille, Mitch, and Dean share intensities for the seventh strongest Atlantic hurricane at 905mbar (hPa; 26.73inHg). The tenth place for most intense Atlantic tropical cyclone is Hurricane Maria listed to have deepened to a <b>pressure</b> <b>as</b> low as 908mbar (hPa; 26.81inHg).|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the lungs also {{have a number of}} other functions. They are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood <b>pressure</b> <b>as</b> part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{is performed}} {{to measure the}} opening <b>pressure,</b> <b>as</b> well as to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for transient relief (see below). The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, {{all of these are}} within their normal limits in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate {{over the course of the}} normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it may be necessary to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>as</b> well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E

5|$|Pöck {{rejected}} all of Andressen's proposals, since {{none of them}} {{incorporated the}} characteristics specified in the March 1875 meeting. Romako took over the design process in 1878, and prepared the design for Zara, construction of which began on 1 August that year. Romako based his design on the German Zieten, though the German vessel was significantly faster than the Zara class, in part owing {{to the fact that}} Zieten had a longer, finer hull and was more lightly built. In addition, the engines and boilers used in Zara and her sister ships could not tolerate as high a <b>pressure</b> <b>as</b> those in Zieten, and their boilers consumed coal excessively.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which some}} or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces the time that the diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial <b>pressure</b> <b>as</b> there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage is that once the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>as</b> well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E
