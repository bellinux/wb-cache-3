500|$|She {{disagreed}} with Fox News' Chris Wallace in 2006 when Wallace {{asked why the}} American people were beginning to lose confidence in <b>President</b> <b>Bush,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Well, I don't think they are. And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response to me. There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|R
500|$|Bloomberg L.P.'s media critic Craig Seligman wrote {{a scathing}} {{review of the}} book, calling Woodward far too deferential to <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> and <b>saying</b> that [...] "It {{must have been a}} {{challenge}} for him to walk so confidently with Woodward's lips attached to his backside." [...] In a mixed review, conservative magazine National Review labeled Woodward's leaking of the government's eavesdropping program [...] "disgraceful" [...] and stated that it [...] "would be helpful for the United States {{to be in a position}} to know, and to do so without having the fact publicly advertised." ...|$|R
40|$|Many Democrats are {{wringing}} {{their hands}} over the defeat of Sen. Joseph Lieberman, whose long-faithful Connecticut constituents rejected him for his support of the pro-war policies of <b>President</b> <b>Bush.</b> Many pundits <b>say</b> that despite record-low ratings for the current Republican administration the Democratic Party may self-destruct during the coming elections because it’s becoming softer on the war. We’ll {{have to wait until}} November to see if they’re right, but we can say now that incumbents should never take their constituents’ loyalty for granted...|$|R
50|$|Gephardt's {{views on}} {{economic}} policy also {{changed over the}} years. He voted for Ronald Reagan's tax cuts in 1981; in the 2000s, however, he became a staunch opponent of similar tax cuts by <b>President</b> George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>saying</b> that the enormous surplus created during the administration of Bill Clinton should have been spent on health care instead. Gephardt is widely viewed as an economic populist. He supports universal health coverage, fair trade, and progressive taxation. Although he once chaired the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, Gephardt {{in his later years}} in Congress distanced himself from the organization, finding his pro-labor views at odds with the DLC's pro-business positions.|$|R
500|$|Franken {{initially}} {{supported the}} Iraq War but opposed the 2007 troop surge. In {{an interview with}} MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, Franken said that he [...] "believed Colin Powell", whose presentation at the United Nations convinced him {{that the war was}} necessary. However, since then he had come to believe that [...] "we were misled into the war" [...] and urged the Democratic-controlled Congress to refuse to pass appropriations bills to fund the war if they did not include timetables for leaving Iraq. In an interview with Josh Marshall, Franken said of the Democrats, [...] "I think we've gotta make <b>President</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>say,</b> 'OK, I'm cutting off funding because I won't agree to a timetable.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> {{begins by}} <b>saying</b> that the {{greatest}} responsibility of the government is to protect all Americans from terroristic threats. He also highlighted that several {{years had passed since}} the terrorist attacks on September the 11th. While several years had passed [...] "without an attack on American soil", it did not mean that all of the danger was in the past. After September 11, attacks continued around the world in Bali, Jerusalem, Baghdad, and other major regions of the world. The President also focuses on how enemies of the United States are constantly plotting attacks of some form or another. The Patriot Act was mentioned as a point of emphasis for giving the United States Department of Homeland Security all of the necessary resources to find criminals and locate possible attack scenarios. One of the recurring themes of the speech was that [...] "America is on the offensive" [...] and is constantly on the hunt for members of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> then proceeded to discuss how American allies helped to convince several countries to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.|$|R

Instead of focusing on objective facts showing that <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> and his advisers got it 'wrong' -- such as selective use and misuses of intelligence on weapons of mass destruction ... too many left-wing bloggers and Bush-bashing Democratic partisans have tried to prove that <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> and senior administration officials 'lied'.") ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a notable}} event, Karl Rove {{was fired from}} the 1992 George Herbert Walker Bush {{campaign}} for criticizing Mosbacher, {{who was then the}} head of the Texas Victory Committee and a Bush loyalist. This criticism of Mosbacher {{came in the form of}} a negative story that Rove planted with the columnist Robert Novak. In 1992, [...] "Sources close to the former <b>president</b> George H.W. <b>Bush</b> <b>say</b> Karl Rove was fired from the 1992 Bush presidential campaign after he planted a negative story with columnist Robert Novak about dissatisfaction with campaign fundraising chief and Bush loyalist Robert Mosbacher, Jr. It was smoked out, and he was summarily ousted" [...] (Esquire Magazine, January 2003). As Novak provided some evidence of Rove's motive in his column: [...] "Also attending the session was political consultant Karl Rove, who had been shoved aside by Mosbacher". Mosbacher maintains that [...] "Rove is the only one with a motive to leak this. We let him go. I still believe he did it." ...|$|R

"They {{should know}} that the Iranian nation will not yield to {{pressure}} and will not let its rights be trampled on," [...] Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a crowd 31 August 2006, in a televised speech in the northwestern Iranian city of Orumiyeh. In front of his strongest supporters {{in one of his}} provincial power bases, the Iranian leader attacked what he called [...] "intimidation" [...] by the United Nations, which he said was led by the United States. Ahmadinejad criticised a White House rebuff of his offer for a televised debate with <b>President</b> <b>Bush.</b> [...] "They <b>say</b> they support dialog and the free flow of information," [...] he said. [...] "But when debate was proposed, they avoided and opposed it." [...] Ahmadinejad said that sanctions [...] "cannot dissuade Iranians from their decision to make progress," [...] according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency. [...] "On the contrary, many of our successes, including access to the nuclear fuel cycle and producing of heavy water, have been achieved under sanctions." ...|$|R
2500|$|Obama {{supports}} {{embryonic stem}} cell research and was a co-sponsor of the 2005 Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act which was passed by both houses of Congress but vetoed by <b>President</b> <b>Bush.</b> Obama condemned <b>Bush's</b> veto, <b>saying,</b> [...] "Democrats want this bill to pass. Conservative, pro-life Republicans want this bill to pass. By large margins, the American people want this bill to pass. It is only the White House {{standing in the way of}} progress – standing in the way of so many potential cures." [...] He also voted in favor of the 2007 bill lifting restrictions on {{embryonic stem cell}} research that was passed but was also vetoed by <b>President</b> <b>Bush.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, while {{campaigning for}} the Republican {{nomination}} for <b>president,</b> <b>Bush</b> {{has called for}} what he terms [...] "a path to earned legal status" [...] - but not citizenship - {{for people in the}} United States illegally. <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> that his proposal would allow undocumented workers to secure a provisional work permit, and thus avoid deportation, if they met various requirements, such as paying back taxes and an additional fine, receiving work permits, learning English, and not committing crimes. Bush has rejected characterizations of his plan as [...] "amnesty," [...] arguing that his plan is [...] "dignified" [...] and [...] "the most practical way of dealing with this problem." ...|$|R
40|$|At a {{time when}} {{considerable}} attention is being paid to the exceptional, the state of emergency, {{and the relationship between}} sovereignty and law, this article uses a late seventeenth-century appeal to the law-suspending God of Abraham in the lawcourts to probe the Christian and theological roots of the sovereign veto/the dispensing power. It attempts to retrieve deep histories that have been missed because seventeenth-century historians do not generally read Giorgio Agamben, while biblical scholars rarely enter the domains of “secular” history and law. The article also explores some of the crucial watersheds that have been passed on the way to modernity. These mean, among other things, that <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> cannot <b>say,</b> as James II/VII said in 1686, “as the God of Abraham can dispense with his own law, so I, the King/President am able to dispense with the laws that I have made, for all the laws of the constitution are in the gift of the single person of the President/the King”—which {{is not to say that}} modern democracies cannot achieve similar effects by different means. A key transition explored in the article is the gradual replacement of the Absolute Monarchical or Patriarchal Bible with the Whig or Liberal Bible: a Bible of fairly recent invention that is non-exceptional and non-arbitrary and defined by its willingness to devolve absolute power to consensus and law. In looking at changing understandings of the political intentions of the Christian God and Bible, this article attempts to go beyond numerous histories of Bible versions and translations into a new analysis of the changing weight of the Bible in public (political, legal) discourse...|$|R

It is known that freedom-haters don't have defiant spirits {{like those of the}} 19—may God have mercy on them".|$|R
5000|$|In 2003 and 2004, Pilger {{strongly}} criticised {{the policies}} of United States <b>President</b> George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>saying</b> that he had exploited the 9/11 terrorist attacks in his 2003 invasion of Iraq and later occupation. Pilger in 2004 criticised then British Prime Minister Tony Blair as equally responsible for the invasion and the bungled occupation of Iraq. In 2004, as the Iraq insurgency increased, Pilger wrote that the anti-war movement should support [...] "Iraq's anti-occupation resistance:""We cannot afford to be choosy. While we abhor and condemn the continuing loss of innocent life in Iraq, {{we have no choice}} now but to support the resistance, for if the resistance fails, the [...] "Bush gang" [...] will attack another country."His support for the Iraqi insurgency was criticised at the time. Australian commentator Andrew Bolt who described Pilger as an [...] "apologist for terrorists". Oliver Kamm, writing for The Times in 2006, commented: [...] "By reputation the exemplar of radical conscience, Pilger {{turns out to be the}} voice of brutishness" [...] because of his support for opposing forces in Iraq. Kamm has also accused Pilger of [...] "historical revisionism" [...] in his writings about Slobodan Milošević and NATO's actions during the Kosovo War in 1999.|$|R
