5000|$|<b>Pantethine</b> (bis-pantethine or co-enzyme <b>pantethine)</b> is a dimeric form of pantetheine, {{which is}} {{produced}} from pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) {{by the addition}} of cysteamine. <b>Pantethine</b> is composed of two molecules of pantetheine linked by a bridging disulfide. Pantetheine is an intermediate in the production of Coenzyme A by the body. Most vitamin B5 supplements are in the form of calcium pantothenate, a salt of pantothenic acid, with doses in the range of 5 to 10 mg/day.

50|$|Two {{mechanisms}} of action are proposed for <b>pantethine.</b> In the first, <b>pantethine</b> {{serves as the}} precursor for synthesis of coenzyme A. CoA {{is involved in the}} transfer of acetyl groups, in some instances to attach to proteins closely associated with activating and deactivating genes. By this theory, either the genes responsible for cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis are suppressed or the genes governing the catabolism of compounds are turned on. In the second theory, <b>pantethine</b> is converted to two pantetheine molecules which are in turn metabolized to form two pantethenic acid and two cysteamine molecules. Cysteamine is theorized to bind to and thus inactivate sulfur-containing amino acids in liver enzymes involved in the production of cholesterol and triglycerides. What is known is that high doses of the related vitamin - pantothenic acid - has no effect on lipids.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pantethine</b> is {{available}} in the United States as a dietary supplement because of evidence of its health benefits for lowering elevated LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, and raising HDL-cholesterol (the 'good' cholesterol). In multiple clinical trials of patients with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol were decreased by an average of 12%, triglycerides decreased by 19%, and HDL cholesterol was increased by 9%. These clinical trials were conducted with daily intakes ranging from 600 to 1200 mg/day. Within this dose range {{there is no evidence of}} a dose-effect relationship, i.e. changes in lipid concentrations overlapped across the range of doses. Direct dose-response evidence is not available because no trial tested more than one dose. A few trials conducted in Japan tested 300 mg/day and reported decreases in total cholesterol of about 4%, increases in HDL-cholesterol of 5% and inconsistent results for triglycerides. Most of the literature on <b>pantethine</b> and lipids is 20-30 years old, but recent carefully controlled trials of 600 and 900 mg/d doses have shown similar statistically significant lowering of LDL cholesterol in individuals with greatly or moderately elevated levels of blood lipids.|$|E

40|$|We {{report that}} {{administration}} of the low-molecular-weight thiol <b>pantethine</b> prevented the cerebral syndrome in Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected mice.

(2) Decreased pyruvate oxidation in the rat liver mitochondria was still present even though no significant histological changes could be demonstrated microscopically. This might mean that the function of mitochondrial enzymes would not be restored in a shorter time. In the first and fourth weeks of recovery from the acute intoxication, increases of the lactate/pyruvate ratio of the liver were observed. The pyruvate level in the liver did not show any significant change in the recovery from acute and chronic intoxications. (3) Intraperitoneal administration of <b>pantethine</b> (Bis (N-pantotenyl -β aminoethyl) disulfide), a precursor of coenzyme A, to carbontetrachloride-intoxicated rats arrested the progression of fibrosis and the formation of pseudoacinus of the liver.

Recently, we and others presented a PKAN Drosophila model, and we demonstrated that impaired function of pantothenate kinase induces a neurodegenerative phenotype and a reduced lifespan.

In this report, {{emphasis is on the}} penultimate step of the process, i. e. L- 3 -hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. We determined changes in enzyme activity and in circulating ketone body levels in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease.

40|$|Children {{suffering}} from cystinosis, a genetic disease characterized by {{high levels of}} lysosomal cystine, are currently being treated with cysteamine to lower the cystine levels in their cells. In fibroblasts from these patients, cysteamine and its disulfide, cystamine, are equally effective in lowering cystine levels. We recently reported that <b>pantethine,</b> a dietary precursor of coenzyme A, depletes cystine from cultured, cystinotic fibroblasts as effectively as cystamine. To determine the mechanism of action of <b>pantethine,</b> and of cystamine, we have compared the fate of [35 S]cystine-derived metabolites in the presence and absence of these agents. The {{results indicate that the}} ability of <b>pantethine</b> to deplete cystine resides in its being a metabolic precursor of cysteamine. Furthermore, both <b>pantethine</b> and cystamine act by generating the mixed disulfide of cysteamine and cysteine in the lysosomes, which is then rapidly excreted from the cells. The fall in intracellular [35 S]cystine caused by these agents was not accompanied by a comparable increase in any intracellular metabolite; rather, it could be accounted for by the appearance of mixed disulfide in the medium. There was no accumulation of mixed disulfide in the cells. Radioactivity in cytoplasmic glutathione was, however, increased by cystamine or <b>pantethine.</b> Thus, cysteamine (formed intracellularly in these experiments) undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine in the lysosomes, producing cysteamine-cysteine mixed disulfide and free cysteine, which enter the cytoplasm.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>pantethine,</b> glutathione, and {{selected}} chemical reagents on the anti-aggregation activity of α-crystallin was evaluated. Protein aggregation was monitored by light scattering of solutions of denatured βL-crystallin or alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The ratios of βL-crystallin/α-crystallin and ADH/α-crystallin were adjusted so that partial inhibition of protein aggregation at 60 °C or 37 °C, respectively, was observed and modulation of the chaperone action of α-crystallin could be evaluated easily with selected endogenous metabolites. Enhancement of the anti-aggregation {{activity in the}} βL-crystallin assay was strongest with <b>pantethine,</b> which appeared to interact with α-crystallin. Enhancement of the anti-aggregation activity in the ADH assay was strongest with glutathione which appeared to interact with ADH.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness and tolerability of <b>pantethine</b> in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia using all published literature to date. Using Medline (January 1966 through December 2002), all published studies involving human subjects, which examined the effect of <b>pantethine</b> on serum lipids, were obtained by using the search terms in combinations of bpantethine and cholesterolQ and bpantethine and lipids. Q The mean percent differences from baseline at months 1 through 4 were calculated for total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum triacylglycerols. Qualitative and quantitative data on adverse reactions were compiled. Twenty-eight clinical trials were identified providing a pooled population of 646 hyperlipidemic subjects. The average study sample size was 22. 3 subjects {{with a mean age of}} 52. 8 years. The average study trial length was 12. 7 weeks with a median <b>pantethine</b> dosage of 900 mg/d. The mean percent decrease from baseline for total serum cholesterol across months 1 through 4 was 8. 7 %, 11. 6 %, 12. 6 %, and 15. 1 %. The mean percent decrease from baseline for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol across months 1 through 4 was 10. 4 %, 15. 2 %, 17. 7 %, and 20. 1 %.

40|$|<b>Pantethine,</b> {{a natural}} low-molecular-weight thiol, shows broad {{activity}} {{in a large}} range of essential cellular pathways. It has been long known as a hypolipidemic and hypocholesterolemic agent. We showed recently that it exerts a neuroprotective action in mouse models of cerebral malaria and Parkinson's disease through multiple mechanisms. In the present study we looked at its effects on membrane lipid rafts that serve as platforms for molecules engaged in cell activity, therefore providing a target against inappropriate cell response leading to chronic inflammation. We found that pantethine-treated cells showed {{a significant change in}} raft fatty acid composition and cholesterol content, with ultimate downregulation of cell adhesion, CXCL 12 -driven chemotaxis and transendothelial migration of various T cell types, including human Jurkat cell line and circulating effector T cells. The mechanisms involved include the alteration of the following: i) CXCL 12 binding to its target cells; ii) membrane dynamics of CXCR 4 and CXCR 7, the two CXCL 12 receptors; iii) cell redox status, a crucial determinant in the regulation of the chemokine system. In addition, we considered the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) molecule to show that <b>pantethine</b> effects were associated with the displacement from the rafts of the acylated signaling molecules which palmitoylation level was reduced. In conclusion, the results presented here, together with previously published findings, indicate that, due to its pleiotropic action, <b>pantethine</b> can down-regulate the multifaceted process leading to pathogenic T cell activation and migration...|$|E
40|$|To {{consider}} {{the pathogenesis of}} ethanol-induoed fatty liver from the aspect of the drug-metabolizing system, the amount of cytochrome P- 450 and lipid peroxides was measured in the liver tissues of the rats given the ethanol diet mixed with <b>Pantethine</b> (antioxidant). After fed the ethanol diet only for 8 weeks, the rats were fed the ethanol diet mixed with <b>Pantethine</b> for 4 weeks. The rats were divided into 3 groups according to diet as follows; in A group, the ethanol diet containing 200 mg of <b>Pantethine</b> per kg of body weight per day; in group B, the ethanol diet containing 100 mg of Pantethine; in group C, the ethanol diet only. The following results were obtained. 1) The mean value of lipid peroxides was 5. 0 nmol MDA/mg of liver tissue in group A (n= 4), f, 5. 6 nmol MDA/mg in group B (n= 7), and 13. 0 nmol MDA/mg in group C (n= 4). 2) The mean value of cytochrome P- 450 was 0. 82 nmol/mg of liver microsomal protein in group A (n= 4), 0. 63 nmol/mg in group B (n= 7) and 0. 44 nmol/mg in group C(n= 4). 3) The histological examination revealed the degree of steatosis was higher in group C than in group A and B. These facts suggested the pathogenesis of ethanol-induced fatty liver {{was related to the}} mechanism for lipid peroxidation and that the antioxidant was effective to the treatment of alcoholic fatty liver...|$|E
40|$|Several fastidious {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} require a new growth factor, originally termed the Lactobacillus bulgartcu 8 factor (LBF), for growth on synthetic media (Williams, Hoff-Jorgensen, and Snell, 1949; Kitay and Snell, 1950). Highly purified concentrates of this factor contained bound pantothenic acid, a finding {{that led to the}} discovery that LBF was apparently identical with the fragment of coenzyme A obtained by treatment with intestinal phosphatase (Brown, Craig, and Snell, 1950). Amounts of pantothenic acid much higher than those usually added to synthetic media were found to promote growth in place of LBF (Brown et al., 1950; McRorie et al., 1950). More recently, synthesis of a conjugate of pantothenic acid that has LBF activity was achieved (Snell et al., 1950). This conjugate exists in a sulfhydril and disulfide form, termed, re-spectively, pantetheine and <b>pantethine.</b> Preliminary comparisons of chemical and biological properties indicated that <b>pantethine</b> was identical with LBF prepared from natural sources. 2 Since both products have been obtained only in noncrystalline form, further comparisons of the natural and synthetic produc...|$|E
40|$|Astrocytes play {{critical}} {{roles in}} {{central nervous system}} homeostasis and support of neuronal function. A better knowledge of their response may both help understand the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and implement new therapeutic strategies. We used the 5 xFAD transgenic mouse model of AD (Tg thereafter) to generate astrocyte cultures and investigate {{the impact of the}} genotype on metabolic changes and astrocytes activation. Metabolomic analysis showed that Tg astrocytes exhibited changes in the glycolytic pathway and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, compared to wild type (WT) cells. Tg astrocytes displayed also a prominent basal inflammatory status, with accentuated reactivity and increased expression of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β). Compensatory mechanisms were activated in Tg astrocytes, including: i) the hexose monophosphate shunt with the consequent production of reducing species; ii) the induction of hypoxia inducible factor- 1 alpha (HIF- 1 α), known to protect against amyloid-β (Aβ) toxicity. Such events were associated with the expression by Tg astrocytes of human isoforms of both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin- 1 (PS 1). Similar metabolic and inflammatory changes were induced in WT astrocytes by exogenous Aβ peptide. <b>Pantethine,</b> the vitamin B 5 precursor, known to be neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory, alleviated the pathological pattern in Tg astrocytes as well as WT astrocytes treated with Aß. In conclusion, our data enlighten the dual pathogenic/protective role of astrocytes in AD pathology and the potential protective role of <b>pantethine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Endogenous kinase {{activity}} of highly purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from bovine kidney is markedly inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide and by certain disulfides. Inhibition by disulfides is highly specific and is reversed by thiols. 5, 5 '-Dithiobis(2 -nitrobenzoate) {{is the most}} potent inhibitor, showing significant inhibition at a concentration as low as 1 microM. Cystamine, oxidized glutathione, <b>pantethine,</b> lipoic acid, lipoamide, ergothionine, insulin, oxytocin, and vasopressin were ineffective. Hydrogen peroxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide were inactive. The data indicate pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (EC 2. 7. 1. 99) contains a thiol group (or groups) that is involved in maintaining a conformation of the enzyme that facilitates phosphorylation and inactivation of its protein substrate, pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2. 4. 1).

40|$|Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease with unresolved pathophysiology. Previously, we observed reduced Coenzyme A levels in a Drosophila model for PKAN. Coenzyme A is required for acetyl-Coenzyme A synthesis and acyl groups from the latter are transferred to lysine residues of proteins, in a reaction regulated by acetyltransferases. The tight balance between acetyltransferases and their antagonistic counterparts histone deacetylases is a well-known determining factor for the acetylation status of proteins. However, the influence of Coenzyme A levels on protein acetylation is unknown. Here we investigate whether decreased levels of the central metabolite Coenzyme A induce alterations in protein acetylation and whether this correlates with specific phenotypes of PKAN models. We show that in various organisms proper Coenzyme A metabolism is required for maintenance of histone- and tubulin acetylation, and decreased acetylation of these proteins is associated with an impaired DNA damage response, decreased locomotor function and decreased survival. Decreased protein acetylation and the concurrent phenotypes are partly rescued by <b>pantethine</b> and HDAC inhibitors, suggesting possible directions for future PKAN therapy development...|$|E
40|$|Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, {{caused by}} {{mutations}} in the PANK 2 gene, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by dystonia, dysarthria, rigidity, pigmentary retinal degeneration and brain iron accumulation. PANK 2 encodes the mitochondrial enzyme pantothenate kinase type 2, {{responsible for the}} phosphorylation of pantothenate or vitamin B 5 in the biosynthesis of co-enzyme A. A Pank 2 knockout (Pank 2 (-/-)) mouse model did not recapitulate the human disease but showed azoospermia and mitochondrial dysfunctions. We challenged this mouse model with a low glucose and high lipid content diet (ketogenic diet) to stimulate lipid use by mitochondrial beta-oxidation. In {{the presence of a}} shortage of co-enzyme A, this diet could evoke a general impairment of bioenergetic metabolism. Only Pank 2 (-/-) mice fed with a ketogenic diet developed a pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration-like syndrome characterized by severe motor dysfunction, neurodegeneration and severely altered mitochondria in the central and peripheral nervous systems. These mice also showed structural alteration of muscle morphology, which was comparable with that observed in a patient with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. We here demonstrate that <b>pantethine</b> administration can prevent the onset of the neuromuscular phenotype in mice suggesting the possibility of experimental treatment in patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration...|$|E
40|$|Of six {{strains of}} Ruminococcus bromii studied, five grew in a minimal {{chemically}} defined medium containing minerals, NH 4 + as nitrogen source, sulfide or sulfate as sulfur source, fructose as energy and carbon source, isobutyrate or 2 -methylbutyrate and carbonic acid-bicarbonate as additional carbon sources, and the vitamins biotin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, vitamin B 12 (replaced by L-methionine), <b>pantethine,</b> and tetrahydrofolate. The strains also could utilize cysteine or thiosulfate but not methionine; and strain Z 3 failed to use dithiothreitol, thioglycolate, sulfite, or β-mercaptoethanol as sole sources of sulfur. Mixtures of amino acids, peptides (Casitone), urea, nitrate, asparagine, or glutamine failed to replace NH 4 + as N source. Three strains isolated from Americans were identical in nutritional features, whereas {{one from a}} Japanese and one from a South African native differed slightly in having requirements for fewer vitamins. One strain from the cecum of a sow grew well in a rumen fluid-supplemented medium {{but not in the}} various chemically defined media plus Casitone. The nutritional features suggest that the environment which selects R. bromii contains relatively little amino acid nitrogen and a relatively large amount of NH 4 +-N and indicate that these bacteria must depend upon other bacteria such as those that produce NH 4 + from urea or protein and those that produce branched-chain volatile acids to grow...|$|E
