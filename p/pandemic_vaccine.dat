5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu <b>pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E

40|$|Pandemic H 1 N 1 {{influenza}} infection {{was common}} in the UK in 2009 and children were particularly vulnerable. Most cases were mild or subclinical, but there was significant mortality, predominantly in those with pre-existing disease. Despite the rapid development of monovalent <b>pandemic</b> <b>vaccines,</b> and the fast-tracked approval process, these products were not available for large-scale use {{until the end of}} the second wave of infection. Vaccine uptake was relatively low, both among children and health-care workers. The monovalent <b>pandemic</b> <b>vaccines</b> and the 2010 / 2011 trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines were immunogenic and effective, and they probably reduced the impact of the third wave of infection. Vaccines containing novel adjuvants enabled antigen sparing, but safety concerns could limit the future use of these adjuvanted influenza vaccines in children. Public perceptions that the threat of the pandemic was exaggerated by the authorities, and concerns about vaccine safety, might prompt an inadequate response to the next influenza pandemic, potentially compromising public health. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|AbstractA global {{shortage}} and inequitable {{access to}} influenza vaccines has been {{cause for concern}} for developing countries who face dire consequences {{in the event of}} a pandemic. The Global Action Plan for Influenza Vaccines (GAP) was launched in 2006 to increase global capacity for influenza vaccine production to address these concerns. It is widely recognized that well-developed infrastructure to produce seasonal influenza vaccines leads to increased capacity to produce <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccines.</b> This article summarizes the results of a survey administered to 44 manufacturers to assess their production capacity for seasonal influenza and <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> production. When the GAP was launched in 2006, global production capacity for seasonal and <b>pandemic</b> <b>vaccines</b> was estimated to be 500 million and 1. 5 billion doses respectively. Since 2006 there has been a significant increase in capacity, with the 2013 survey estimating global capacity at 1. 5 billion seasonal and 6. 2 billion pandemic doses. Results of the current survey showed that global seasonal influenza vaccine production capacity has decreased since 2013 from 1. 504 billion doses to 1. 467 billion doses. However, notwithstanding the overall global decrease in seasonal vaccine capacity there were notable positive changes in the distribution of production capacity with increases noted in South East Asia (SEAR) and the Western Pacific (WPR) regions, albeit on a small scale. Despite a decrease in seasonal capacity, there has been a global increase of <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> production capacity from 6. 2 billion doses in 2013 to 6. 4 billion doses in 2015. This growth can be attributed to a shift towards more quadrivalent vaccine production and also to increased use of adjuvants. <b>Pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> production capacity is at its highest recorded levels however challenges remain in maintaining this capacity and in ensuring access {{in the event of a}} pandemic to underserved regions...|$|R
50|$|The 2009 flu <b>pandemic</b> <b>vaccines</b> are {{the set of}} {{influenza}} vaccines {{that have been developed}} to protect against the pandemic H1N1/09 virus. These vaccines either contain inactivated (killed) influenza virus, or weakened live virus that cannot cause influenza. The killed vaccine is injected, while the live vaccine is given as an interperineal nasal spray. Both these types of vaccine are usually produced by growing the virus in chicken eggs. Around three billion doses will be produced annually, with delivery from November 2009.|$|R

40|$|Objective: <b>Pandemic</b> {{influenza}} <b>vaccine</b> {{is important}} {{in order to prevent}} dissemination of influenza, to decrease rates of complications and mortality due to influenza, to prevent mutation of virus in case epidemics last for a long time, to decrease the need for intensive care hospitalisation due to disease, to maintain health care services, to prevent school and work day loss and to decrease the economic burden. Our questionnaire was conducted in 3 different centers to evaluate view of health care staff for <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> prior to epidemics. Materials and Methods: Our questionnaire was conducted with health care workers with a possibility of direct exposure to patients including 182 doctors, 158 nurses and 54 management staff, making a total of 394 people. The location of the staff, position, period of office, whether she/he had seasonal influenza vaccine, whether he/she planned to have the <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> and the reason for this were questioned and noted. Results: Of the 394 healthcare staff included in our study, 221 were working in Hacettepe University Hospital, 102 in Ankara University Hospital and 71 in Ankara Hematology and Oncology Hospital. Of the people enrolled in our study, 259 were planning to have the <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> while 135 were not. Of the staff planning to have the <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccine,</b> 77. 6 % were planning because they thought they were in the risk group, 22. 4 % were planning because there was pandemics. Of the staff not planning to have the <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccine,</b> 23 % were not having the vaccine because they did not want be guinea pigs, 30. 9 % were concerned with its side effects and 46 % had concerns because the vaccine was too new. Conclusion: In group vaccination, the opinions of the specialists and determination of health care authorities are very important, so views about vaccines should consider this aspect. Otherwise, even in risk groups, acceptance of the vaccine would be at lower rates...|$|R

40|$|Background: The 2009 - 10 {{influenza}} A(H 1 N 1) pandemic was {{the first}} pandemic influenza {{of the twenty-first century}} and presented the first major opportunity for the use of influenza vaccines en-masse during a pandemic scenario. National anticipatory policies of <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> preparedness were implemented, and vaccine guarantee agreements were activated. Large quantities of vaccines were purchased and made available to identified citizens {{over the course of the}} pandemic. The use of <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccines</b> has been examined in this research. Methods: A comparative health policy approach in five study countries (Sweden, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, and Canada) was conducted. Qualitative interviews (n= 36) were undertaken in each country with key pandemic influenza response personnel (n = 39). Participants included public health officials, policy makers and clinicians engaged at national country response level. Interviews facilitated discussions surrounding the 2009 - 10 influenza A(H 1 N 1) pandemic response and use of vaccines. Documentary examination of available records supplemented the analysis of the interview data. Results: Several interview themes were identified following data analysis of the use of <b>pandemic</b> <b>vaccines</b> in the study countries. Themes of the vaccine use included: single or multiple vaccine supplier routes; hemisphere variation; historical pandemic legacy; targeted populations; setting vaccination priorities; side effect concerns; perceived effectiveness of <b>vaccines</b> during the <b>pandemic</b> influenza response. The themes which were most prominent comprised the sourcing and distribution of the vaccines during the response and the associated communication challenges. The necessary prioritisation of vaccines caused extensive discussions and uneasiness by the pandemic influenza response personnel as the initial vaccines arrived in small quantities and required allocation, especially in circumstances where country’s intended for all/most citizens to eventually have access to the vaccine. The variation in timing of the vaccination campaigns and disease activity would suggest that subsequent influenza wave morbidities and mortalities could have been reduced if vaccines had been available more promptly. The southern hemisphere country, New Zealand, exemplified the circumvention of vaccine safety concerns through the use of a trivalent vaccine inclusive of H 1 N 1. Conclusions: <b>Pandemic</b> <b>vaccines</b> were the cornerstone of two countries responses and were associated with high uptake rates. Vaccine discussions, such as prioritisation and essential workers estimates, can be established during interpandemic phases by pandemic influenza response personnel. The use of annual seasonal influenza vaccines that are inclusive of the novel pandemic influenza strain should play a greater role in future pandemic influenzas, should the vaccination campaign timing be appropriate, as this may reduce public anxiety concerning the perceived safety of novel vaccines. The use of the 2009 - 10 influenza A(H 1 N 1) <b>pandemic</b> <b>vaccines</b> had varied in success and the lessons learnt from this event have important implications for future policy. Pandemic influenza response personnel are recommended to prepare as fully as possible during this interpandemic period...|$|R

50|$|Currently, {{influenza}} vaccine for the annual, seasonal influenza program comes from four manufacturers. However, {{only a single}} manufacturer produces the annual vaccine entirely within the U.S. Thus, if a pandemic occurred and existing U.S.-based {{influenza vaccine}} manufacturing capacity was completely diverted to producing a <b>pandemic</b> <b>vaccine,</b> supply would be severely limited. Moreover, because the annual influenza manufacturing process takes place {{during most of the}} year, the time and capacity to produce vaccine against potential pandemic viruses for a stockpile, while continuing annual influenza vaccine production, is limited. Since supply will be limited, it is critical for HHS to be able to direct vaccine distribution in accordance with predefined groups (see Appendix D); HHS will ensure the building of capacity and will engage states in a discussion about the purchase and distribution of pandemic influenza vaccine.|$|E

The aim of this survey was to document Canadian family physicians' and paediatricians' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) as well as their intentions regarding A(H 1 N 1) <b>pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccines</b> right before the beginning of the largest immunization campaign in Canadian history. Findings A self-administered, anonymous, mail-based questionnaire was sent to a random sample of family physicians and to all paediatricians practicing in Canada. All 921 questionnaires received by October 29 2009 were included in the analysis. Between 72 % and 92 % of respondents agreed with the statements regarding vaccine safety, effectiveness and acceptability.
