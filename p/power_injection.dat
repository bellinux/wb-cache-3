Nowadays, incremental losses or computation of penalty factors has gained a new relevance allocating transmission losses among market participants being integrated in the spot pricing model. Nevertheless, vagueness in <b>power</b> <b>injections</b> from load demand and renewable resources has a fundamental influence on transmission incre-mental losses, and consequently affecting spot prices of the energy. This paper presents a new method to compute Incremental Transmission Loss (ITL) factors {{taking into account the}} effect of uncertainty on <b>power</b> <b>injections</b> due to measurement errors or future estimation. Fuzzy Set Theory is applied to deal with vagueness of information about <b>power</b> <b>injections.</b> The proposed technique provides a broad spectrum of feasibility of incremental losses in order to perform operational planning tasks by Transmission System Operators or network regulators.

40|$|With the {{incremental}} introduction of solar photovoltaic (PV) generators into existing power systems, and their fast-growing {{share in the}} gross electricity generation, system voltage stability has become a critical issue. One of the major concerns is voltage fluctuation, due to large and random penetration of solar PV generators. To suppress severe system voltage deviation, reactive power control of the photovoltaic system inverter has been widely proposed in recent works; however, excessive use of reactive power control would increase both initial and operating costs. In this paper, a method for efficient allocation and control of reactive <b>power</b> <b>injection</b> using the sparse optimization technique is proposed. Based on a constrained linearized model describing the influence of reactive <b>power</b> <b>injection</b> on voltage magnitude change, {{the objective of this}} study is formulated as an optimization problem, which aims to find the best reactive <b>power</b> <b>injection</b> that minimizes the whole system voltage variation. Two types of formulations are compared: the first one is the conventional least-square optimization, while the second one is adopted from a sparse optimization technique, called the constrained least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The constrained LASSO method adds ℓ 1 -norm penalty to the total reactive <b>power</b> <b>injection,</b> which contributes to the suppression of the number of control nodes with non-zero reactive <b>power</b> <b>injection.</b> The authors analyzed the effectiveness of the constrained LASSO method using the IEEE 39 -bus and 57 -bus power network as benchmark examples, under various PV power generation and allocation patterns.
