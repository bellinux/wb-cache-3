50|$|Two {{processes}} {{influencing the}} functionality of a filter are ripening and regeneration.At {{the beginning of}} a new filter run, the filter efficiency increases simultaneously with the number of captured particles in the medium. This process is called filter ripening.

Accumulated solids from the filter bed are removed. During backwashing, water (and air) is pumped backwards through the filter system. Backwash water may partially be reinjected in front of the filter process and generated sewage needs to be discarded. The backwashing time is determined by either the turbidity value behind the filter, which must not exceed a set threshold, or by the head loss across the filter medium, which must also not exceed a certain value.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the response of 18 rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes to callus induction and <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration</b> from immature embryo culture, using three media (MS, LS and N 6). To evaluate callus induction rate, the following criteria were used: callus diameter, callus fresh weight and callus dry weight. Percentage of callus water content was also measured. After transferring the produced calli from the induction media to a regeneration medium (MSR), percentage of <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration</b> was evaluated. A highly significant difference was observed among genotypes for both callus induction and <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration</b> (P&lt; 0. 01). In callus induction phase, “Nemat” and “Cheram- 2 ” cultivars were superior for callus diameter, having 4. 83 and 4. 6 mm callus diameter, respectively. “Nemat”, “Cheram- 2 ”, “Sepidrood” and “Taroum” cultivars as well as “ 33 IRCTN 91 ” and “IRFAON- 30 ” lines were significantly superior to other cultivars for callus fresh weight. Among the genotypes “Nemat”, “Zayandehrood”, “ 33 IRCTN 91 ” had the highest percentage of callus water contents. Based on <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration,</b> “ 33 IRCTN 91 ” line and “Anbarbo”, “Nemat”, “Cheram- 2 ” and “Taroum” cultivars showed highest rate of <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration</b> from callus. Significant differences were observed among media. While MS and N 6 media did not showed any significant differences for callus diameter, callus fresh weight and rate of <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration,</b> they were superior to LS medium (P&lt; 0. 01). According to percentage of callus water content, MS and LS media ranked the best and the most inferior medium, respectively. In the present study, MS and N 6 media were considered as suitable in vitro culture media of rice immature embryos. Among genotypes, “Nemat” and “Cheram- 2 ” cultivars were ranked the best for both callus induction and <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration.</b> Also, the used Japonica rice cultivars were superior for percentage of <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration.</b> The calculated correlation coefficients between traits showed a non-significant correlation between callus induction and <b>plant</b> <b>regeneration,</b> which, in turn, indicated that these traits were independent...|$|E

25|$|In root-tubers, {{there are}} no nodes and internodes or reduced leaves.

The other end of the root tuber is called the distal end, and it normally produces unmodified roots. In stem tubers the order is reversed, with the distal end producing stems. Tuberous roots are biennial in duration: the first year the plant produces root-tubers, {{and at the end of}} the growing season, the plant shoots often die, leaving the newly generated tubers. The next growing season, the root-tubers produce new shoots.
