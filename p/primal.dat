5|$|In 1992, NOU was on {{tour with}} Bikini Kill, {{and when they}} arrived in Memphis, the found that the {{promoter}} for the show hadn't actually promoted the show. So, while {{out on the town}} flyering the streets and ducking into record stores, NOU ran into <b>Primal</b> Scream, a band which had been in town recording their own album. <b>Primal</b> Scream then decided to attend NOU's show at the Antenna Club, and then proceeded to invite NOU to record with them in the studio the next day. Nation of Ulysses then recorded five songs with <b>Primal</b> Scream in nine hours, though of course only after a quick errand for some tin foil to smoke a bit of crack, according to Tim Green. These recordings are known as Memphis Demos, and include the demos of N-Sub Ulysses, 50,000 Watts, Mockingbird, Yeah, and Shakedown.|$|E

5|$|Wizards of the Coast {{was founded}} by Peter Adkison in 1990 just outside Seattle, Washington, and its current {{headquarters}} are located in nearby Renton. Originally the company only published role-playing games such as the third edition of Talislanta and its own The <b>Primal</b> Order. The 1992 release of The <b>Primal</b> Order, a supplement designed for use with any game system, brought legal trouble with Palladium Books suing for references to Palladium's game and system. The suit was settled in 1993.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the <b>Primal</b> Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the <b>Primal</b> Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan is {{the protagonist}} and player {{character}} of StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm. After being deinfested, {{she was taken}} in Valerian Mengsk's hideout to research on her, until the Dominion attacks the facility, she escaped {{along with the rest}} of the facility, except Raynor, who was captured by Nova. She later learned that Raynor was executed and seeks revenge on Arcturus. As she enters a Leviathan, she controls the local Swarm inside, and starts rebuilding her forces from scratch. She later evolved into a <b>Primal</b> Zerg after a confrontation with Zeratul, leading her to the origins of the Zerg. She became a <b>Primal,</b> after absorbing the spawning pool and killing <b>Primal</b> Leaders to collect essence. With her newfound power, she initially takes the fight to the Dominion after subduing countless Queens. She was later shocked after she knows that Raynor survived and held by Dominion as a bargaining chip. She organizes a raid, rescuing Raynor but the man fell into disbelief that the one he saved, returns to being a monster. She also confronted an ancient Shapeshifter creating Hybrids at the behest of her former rival named Alexei Stukov. She later prepared to end Arcturus Mengsk's reign by killing him in his palace in Korhal. She later left to confront the Shapeshifter's master.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} Pokémon {{are capable of}} {{evolving}} into a larger and more powerful creature. The change is accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to {{a wider variety of}} attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called <b>Primal</b> Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and <b>Primal</b> Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or <b>Primal</b> Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species.|$|E
5|$|The Kobold {{tribe in}} La Noscea, angered at the Lominsans' {{encroachment}} upon their ancestral territories, gathers crystals to summon their <b>primal,</b> Titan. In response, the player is dispatched to interview {{former members of}} the Company of Heroes, a band of mercenaries who previously defeated Titan and Leviathan in the Sixth Astral Era, for advice on how to combat the <b>primal.</b> After a series of lessons disguised as menial tasks, the company's leader reveals how to access Titan's domain: by reversing the current through the beastmen's own teleportation crystals. Though the adventurer banishes Titan to the aether, the victory is short-lived. While away, Garlean Tribunus Livia sas Junius had broken into the Scions' headquarters at the Waking Sands with the aid of the Ascians, abducting Minfilia and slaughtering the rest. While performing funerary rites for fallen comrades, the headstrong Alphinaud returns with news of a new <b>primal</b> Garuda being summoned by the Ixal tribe. He hatches a plan to confront Garuda in her own domain, but requires the aid of the amnesiac airship engineer Cid Garlond, currently toiling as a cemetery hand.|$|E
5|$|Brakk was a <b>primal</b> zerg pack {{leader on}} Zerus. When Sarah Kerrigan arrived on Zerus, Brakk {{declared}} that her zerg intruded on his territory. Wishing {{to stop her}} from waking Zurvan, he sent his pack to destroy the quillgor meat that her drones were harvesting. When this was unsuccessful, he personally led an attack on her hive cluster and was killed. The remnants of Brakk's pack were destroyed shortly afterwards by Yagdra's pack.|$|E
5|$|Despite Reich's {{precarious}} mental health, {{his work}} on character {{and the idea of}} muscular armouring contributed to the development of what is now known as ego psychology, gave rise to body psychotherapy, and helped shape the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, the bioenergetic analysis of Reich's student Alexander Lowen, and the <b>primal</b> therapy of Arthur Janov.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{increasing}} {{scrutiny and}} pressure to align {{with one of}} the three allied city-states, the Scions decide to relocate their headquarters to Revenant's Toll, a hub for adventurers in the neutral territory of Mor Dhona. Minfilia reunites with her adoptive mother F'lhaminn, which resolves her remaining doubts about moving away from the Waking Sands in Thanalan. No sooner are they settled when word arrives that a renegade moogle faction has summoned their <b>primal</b> Good King Moggle Mog XII, enabled by the Ascians. After besting the giant moogle, the Warrior of Light encounters a white-robed Ascian named Elidibus who tests the player's might before disappearing. Shortly thereafter, refugees arrive from Doma, a city subjugated by the Garlean Empire, and seek asylum in Ul'dah, which refuses their request. Alphinaud recommends they work as tradesmen and manual labor in the construction of Revenant's Toll. In gratitude, the Doman leader, an Au Ra named Yugiri, accompanies the party to reconnoiter the Sahagin spawning grounds where their <b>primal</b> Leviathan is summoned. The adventurer slays the revived Leviathan using a boatload of corrupted crystals, courtesy of Lominsan warship The Whorleater.|$|E
5|$|More subtle Jewish {{references}} are {{also included in}} {{other aspects of the}} Rugrats franchise. In The Rugrats Movie, the 1998 film based on the series, Tommy is prepared to pour banana baby food on his infant brother Dil, which would attract a group of vicious monkeys who would likely harm the young baby; the scene parallels the Sacrifice of Isaac, a <b>primal</b> covenant in Jewish studies.|$|E

5|$|The same {{statements}} {{hold more}} generally for constraint satisfaction problems (or for relational structures, in other words). The only assumption needed is that constraints can involve only a bounded {{number of variables}} (all relations are of some bounded arity, 2 {{in the case of}} graphs). The relevant parameter is then the treewidth of the <b>primal</b> constraint graph.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shaivism sect, {{the highest}} form of Shiva is formless, limitless, transcendent and unchanging {{absolute}} Brahman, and the <b>primal</b> Atman (soul, self) of the universe. Shiva has many benevolent and fearsome depictions. In benevolent aspects, he {{is depicted as}} an omniscient Yogi who lives an ascetic life on Mount Kailash {{as well as a}} householder with wife Parvati and his two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya. In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi Shiva, regarded as the patron god of yoga, meditation and arts.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises {{the world of}} illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge can not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} <b>primal</b> sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E
5|$|Edward Harrison Norton (born August 18, 1969) is an American {{actor and}} filmmaker.

5|$|It was {{originally}} released as a double LP in 1971 by United Artists. In September 2004, the album, {{along with the}} majority of Can's discography, was remastered and released as a hybrid SACD. The rerelease includes a booklet with commentary on the album by Bobby Gillespie of <b>Primal</b> Scream and David Stubbs, as well as previously unreleased photos of the band. In 2011, for the 40th anniversary of its release, the 2004 remaster was released again with an extra disc of previously unreleased 1972 live performances.|$|E
5|$|Jacob is {{approached}} by a distressed Michael Newman, the man who treated his wound in a medevac helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Paul’s burning car. Newman tells a story of having been a chemist with the Army’s chemical warfare division in Saigon. He designed “the Ladder”, a drug that massively increased aggression, taking people straight to their most <b>primal</b> urges. To test its effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob’s unit – causing them to turn on {{each other in a}} homicidal frenzy. The revelation causes Jacob to fully remember the moment he was attacked in Vietnam, where it is revealed that a fellow American soldier bayoneted him.|$|E
5|$|Of the top 50 {{grossing}} {{movies of}} the year, 37 nominations went to 17 films on the list. Only Jerry Maguire (9th), <b>Primal</b> Fear (27th) and The English Patient (35th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were Independence Day (1st), Twister (2nd), The Rock (4th), The Nutty Professor (7th), The Birdcage (8th), Eraser (13th), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (14th), Star Trek: First Contact (15th), Sleepers (29th), Dragonheart (30th), The Preacher's Wife (32nd), Evita (36th), The Ghost and the Darkness (39th), and Daylight (48th).|$|E
5|$|Pork steaks are {{generally}} {{cut from the}} shoulder of the pig, but can also be cut from the loin or leg of the pig. Shoulder steaks are cut from the same <b>primal</b> cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of producer and director {{was taken over}} by Naoki Yoshida, a staff member at Square Enix who had previously worked on the Dragon Quest series. Among these were other staff changes: Komoto was reassigned to become lead game designer, Akihiko Yoshida became lead scenario concept artist, Hiroshi Takai was appointed as lead artist, and Akihiko Matsui became lead combat system designer. Yoshida's main priority was to make the game a playable experience after the poor launch and subsequent reaction. Through subsequent patches to the game, multiple graphical and gameplay improvements were made: among the most notable were the addition of a job system, personal chocobos, a revamped battle system, greater customization options for gear, and multiple new dungeons and bosses. Yoshida also introduced the official Final Fantasy XIV forums in order to obtain player feedback and suggestions, and stated that interacting with and growing closer to the community would be a high priority. During this period, XIV and XI were taken offline to help with energy conservation {{in the aftermath of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. They went back online one week later as other means were found to reduce their energy usage that did not involve their online services. Due to the earthquake, a planned and partially-developed boss battle with the <b>Primal</b> Titan was cut and replaced by another Primal: the team felt that players might be offended by the <b>Primal</b> and associate beastribe's links with the power of earth in this context.|$|E
5|$|This {{trend was}} {{documented}} by the Dean of Manchester, Reverend William Herbert. He collected samples and compiled information on {{many aspects of}} the saffron crocus. He was concerned about the steady decline in saffron cultivation {{over the course of the}} 17th century and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution; the introduction in Europe of easily grown maize and potatoes, which steadily took over lands formerly flush with corms, did not help. In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla. Only in the south of France or in Italy and Spain, where the saffron harvest was culturally <b>primal,</b> did significant cultivation prevail.|$|E
5|$|When Yagdra {{learned that}} Sarah Kerrigan was {{transforming}} in a chrysalis, it attempted {{to halt the}} process permanently by sending its pack at Kerrigan's brood. In the process, Yagdra also eradicated the last remnants of Brakk's now-leaderless pack, however, it was not successful in killing the Queen of Blades before she hatched from her chrysalis. The opportunity came soon enough, however, when Kerrigan, now the <b>Primal</b> Queen of Blades, set out to challenge the pack leaders for control of Zerus. She came for Yagdra first. Aided by Dehaka's Pack, Kerrigan fought her way through Yagdra's minions and confronted the pack leader himself. Yagdra {{told her that her}} transformation meant nothing. The two fought, and Kerrigan emerged victorious. After slaying Yagdra, she absorbed his essence.|$|E
5|$|Following My Bloody Valentine's disbandment in 1997, Shields {{collaborated with}} a number of artists, {{including}} Yo La Tengo, Dinosaur Jr., The Go! Team, The Pastels, Le Volume Courbe and Spacemen 3. He contributed guitar to two <b>Primal</b> Scream albums, XTRMNTR (2000) and Evil Heat (2002), and became a touring member of the band between 1996and 2006. During this time, Shields composed music for the Canadian contemporary dance group La La La Human Steps and recorded four songs for Sofia Coppola's 2003film Lost in Translation—which earned him nominations for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for Best Film Music, an Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) award for Best Music in a Film, and an Online Film Critics Society award for Best Original Score. In 2008, Shields released The Coral Sea, a collaborative live album with Patti Smith, on which he provided musical accompaniment to Smith's reading of her book of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack in MediEvil: Resurrection is orchestrated, {{unlike the}} first instalment. Approximately {{half of the}} themes from the {{original}} were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. The music is split into two halves; the cues from the first half are largely reminiscent of a select number of cues from the original game {{with the addition of}} extra thematic elements to strengthen them. The other half of the music is original and composed exclusively for Resurrection. The new soundtrack was composed by Bob & Barn and features performances from members of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra that was recorded in the Czech Republic. The orchestra, headed by Nic Raine, consisted of approximately 80 performers and in addition benefits from a 32 piece choir, also recorded in the same venue. This was in similar vain to SCE Cambridge Studio's previous orchestral game <b>Primal,</b> which was also recorded in Prague by the same performers.|$|E
5|$|With Alphinaud and Cid, {{the player}} travels to snowy Coerthas {{in search of}} Cid's lost airship, the Enterprise. By {{uncovering}} a heretic plot, the once-untrusting Ishgardians agree to allow the adventurer to raid the Stone Vigil, a fortress overrun by dragons where the Enterprise was last seen. Lahabrea reappears to taunt the player about their impending doom while facing Garuda. Cid manages to repair the Enterprise and pilot the airship away from the Vigil and {{with the aid of}} the adventurer's Echo, regains his memories as a Garlean engineer, Eorzean defector, and genius inventor. The Enterprise cuts through Garuda's vortex and the adventurer slays the Ixali <b>primal</b> but she is immediately resummoned. Kobold and Amalj'aa prisoners of war also summon their respective primals and the three prepare to face off. However, Garlean Legatus Gaius van Baelsar intercedes with his own Ultima Weapon which proceeds to devour all three, gaining in power each time. Destroying the Ultima Weapon becomes the player's highest priority.|$|E
5|$|As a newly {{inducted}} {{member of}} the Scions, the player follows Thancred to Thanalan to investigate abductions and the theft of crystals along trade routes in the area. The culprits {{are members of the}} Amalj'aa beast tribe who capture the adventurer to be sacrificed to their <b>primal</b> god, Ifrit. The attempt fails as the Echo protects the player from Ifrit's brainwashing. The adventurer counters by defeating Ifrit and is hailed as a hero, with emissaries from all three Grand Companies jockeying for the privilege of recruiting said hero. While attending rallies at each of the three cities honoring the memory of those fallen at Carteneau, the player meets the twins Alphinaud and Alisaie who question the purpose of such nationalist displays. The adventurer's next mission is to forge relations with the Sylphs of the Black Shroud, a peaceful beast tribe whose radical sect once summoned Ramuh to defend the forest from Garlean incursion. While searching for the Sylph elder, the player encounters Lahabrea for the first time—an immortal Ascian bent on destroying the Mothercrystal. The Scions, Thancred in particular, resolve to investigate this new foe.|$|E
5|$|Edward Norton {{flew out}} to Austin and met Malick, {{who had been}} {{impressed}} by the actor's screen test for <b>Primal</b> Fear. Matthew McConaughey reportedly took a day off filming A Time to Kill to see Malick. Others followed, including William Baldwin, Edward Burns, Josh Hartnett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stephen Dorff, and Leonardo DiCaprio; the latter flew up from the Mexico set of Romeo + Juliet to meet Malick at the American Airlines lounge in the Austin airport. Before the casting was finalized, Nicolas Cage had lunch with Malick in Hollywood in February 1996. Malick went off to scout locations and tried calling Cage that summer {{only to find out}} that his phone number had been disconnected. Tom Sizemore, however, was offered a more substantial role in Saving Private Ryan and, when he could not contact Malick for several days, decided to do Steven Spielberg's film instead. Actors Bill Pullman, Mickey Rourke, and Lukas Haas filmed scenes for the movie but were cut from the final film due to time contraints. Publicity stills of Pullman (as Sgt. MacTae, in a scene opposite Brody and Chaplin) can be seen online, Haas is pictured in the booklet of the CD soundtrack, and one of Rourke's scenes was restored for the Criterion Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film.|$|E
5|$|Now united, the nations, {{aided by}} Adventurers, {{successfully}} storm Castrum Novum {{and destroy the}} beacon. Nael, insanely committed to his plan, makes himself into a second beacon. Though he is defeated by the Adventurers, Dalamud has descended too far for it to return into orbit, so Louisoix proposes a final desperate plan: to summon the Twelve, Eorzea's deities, and return Dalamud into orbit. The Adventurers pray to altars dedicated to the Twelve across the land, then rally with the armies of the Eorzean Alliance to fight Nael's legion on the Carteneau Flats, the predicted impact site of Dalamud. In {{the midst of the}} battle, Dalamud disintegrates and reveals itself to have been a prison for the Elder <b>Primal</b> Bahamut. Enraged after its imprisonment, Bahamut begins laying waste to Eorzea. After the attempt to summon the Twelve fails, Louisoix uses the last of his power to send the Adventurers into a time rift, separating them from the flow of time so they can return when Eorzea has recovered. Louisoix then proceeds to sacrifice himself to destroy Bahamut in a final cataclysmic battle, leaving behind a barren, scarred landscape.|$|E
5|$|Originally a Terran ghost {{agent for}} Arcturus Mengsk, she is betrayed and {{abandoned}} to the Zerg, who transform {{her into a}} Terran/Zerg hybrid with vast psionic powers {{under the control of}} the then unknown Amon. Following the death of the Overmind, Kerrigan asserts her independence, striking out at those who betrayed her and who seek to contain her, eventually taking control of the entire Zerg Swarm. Four years later, Kerrigan invades the Dominion in search of a number of Xel'Naga artifacts; these artifacts are instead retrieved by Raynor at the behest of the Moebius Foundation, who assembles them into a device that reverts Kerrigan to a human and releases Amon's grip on her. After her deinfestation, Kerrigan is mercilessly pursued by Arcturus Mengsk, however she successfully escapes Arcturus's Dominion forces. After willingly allowing herself to be reinfested on Zerus, Kerrigan is reborn as the <b>Primal</b> Queen of Blades, after which she successfully reunites the Zerg Swarm and storms the Dominion capital of Augustgrad on the planet Korhal with help from Raynor's Raiders. After a showdown with Arcturus Mengsk inside his Palace, Kerrigan manages to gain the upper hand with help from James Raynor, and kills Acturus by overloading his body with psychic energy, causing him to explode spectacularly. In the aftermath of her victory, Kerrigan gathers the Swarm and departs in search of Amon.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the Waking Sands, {{the heroes}} {{discover}} a few Scions who escaped the attack, {{as well as}} the location of their abducted comrades. They mount a rescue mission to the Garlean Castrum Centri, stealing uniforms and a magitek reaper for disguise. Minfilia and the others are retrieved but they also learn that Lahabrea had possessed Thancred during the course of his investigation into the Ascian threat. Minfilia and Alphinaud barge into a meeting between the three Grand Company leaders who had been considering surrender in the face of Ultima Weapon's power and convince them to fight against Garlean oppression. Using the combined forces of all three nations as well as other allied groups, the Eorzean Alliance executes Operation Archon—a massive counteroffensive that aims to assault every Garlean Castrum simultaneously. The player leads a strike team into the Praetorium where the Ultima Weapon is housed. Using Hydaelyn's blessing of light, the adventurer strips Ultima Weapon of its <b>primal</b> aether. The weapon destroys the Praetorium using Ultima magic but the player's team is protected by Hydaelyn's light and dismantles it. Lahabrea attacks personally but the player fulfills the vision {{at the beginning of his}} or her adventure by striking Thancred free from Lahabrea's possession using a blade of light. With the threat of Garlean invasion lifted, the Grand Company leaders declare the beginning of the Seventh Astral Era. The player's character is hailed as a hero of the same caliber as the Warriors of Light.|$|E
5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the <b>primal,</b> First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of marking sacred areas began in Japan {{as early as}} the Yayoi period (from about 500BC to 300AD) originating from <b>primal</b> religious beliefs. Features in the landscape such as rocks, waterfalls, islands, and especially mountains, were places believed to be capable of attracting kami, and subsequently were worshiped as yorishiro. Originally, sacred places may have been simply marked with a surrounding fence and an entrance gate or torii. Later, temporary structures similar to present day portable shrines were constructed to welcome the gods to the sacred place, which eventually evolved into permanent buildings that were dedicated to the gods. Ancient shrines were constructed according to the style of dwellings (Izumo Taisha) or storehouses (Ise Grand Shrine). The buildings had gabled roofs, raised floors, plank walls, and were thatched with reed or covered with hinoki cypress bark. Such early shrines did not include a space for worship. Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: taisha-zukuri, shinmei-zukuri and sumiyoshi-zukuri. They are exemplified by Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha, respectively, and date from before 552AD. According to the tradition of , the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Skanda Purana which {{talks about}} harmony between Devasena and Valli, the Paripatal – part of Tamil Sangam {{literature}} – speaks about conflict, {{resulting in a}} battle between Devayanai's royal soldiers and Valli's hunter clan, which the latter win. Folk ecal (a folk poem, presented as a dialogue of two persons) tradition also talks about the mistrust and quarrel between the co-wives. In one version - where Devayanai is the elder sister of Valli, Valli tries to woo Murugan, before Devayanai's marriage. As per tradition, the elder sister has to be married off first. Infuriated, Devayanai curses Valli to be born in the forest in her next life, and the curse is then fulfilled when Valli is born as a huntress. In the Jayantipura Mahatmya, the details of which correspond to most of {{those found in the}} Skanda Purana tale, Devasena and Valli are married to Kartikeya from <b>primal</b> times. However, in this version, the god condemns Valli to be born on earth as punishment for mocking her sister Devayanai. The Thirumurugatrupadai from Sangam literature describes Murugan being accompanied by his chaste wife Devayanai and honoured by a procession of gods and rishis (sages).|$|E
5|$|Zelenin and Jimenez {{respectively}} {{side with}} Law and Chaos, while a resurrected Gore becomes Neutral. Depending on the choices {{made during the}} game, the protagonist has the choice of allying with either Law, Chaos or following a Neutral route and continuing with the original mission. If he sides with Law, the protagonist and Zelenin defeat both Jimenez and Mem Aleph before using the Cosmic Eggs to create a World of Law, with Zelenin worshiped as a channel to God for humanity, which is forced to surrender its free will. If he sides with Chaos, he and Jimenez help Mem Aleph and defeat Zelenin, using the Eggs to fulfill the Schwarzwelt's original purpose and create a world where humans and demons live together in a <b>primal</b> world where only the strong survive. In both the Law and Chaos routes, Arthur chooses to destroy his new personality to save the protagonist after the Red Sprite is damaged by Gore. If the protagonist rejects Law and Chaos, Gore transmits the necessary information {{for the destruction of}} the Schwarzwelt to him before truly passing on. After defeating Zelenin, Jimenez, and Mem Aleph, the protagonist and surviving crew escape in the Red Sprite while Arthur sacrifices himself to ensure the destruction of the Schwarzwelt, although there is a chance of it reappearing if humanity continues its abuse of the Earth.|$|E
