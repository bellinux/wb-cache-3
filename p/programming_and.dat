The national program, Head Start, has a complex history, involving many policy decisions made for purposes other than to maximize program effectiveness. But surely scale alone cannot explain the difference between success and failure, and the difference between the Tulsa early childhood <b>program</b> <b>and</b> the Tennessee prekindergarten program is more highly nuanced.|$|R

In response, ABC's media relations head Pat Marcelo-Magbanua reiterated that the subsidiary was a Filipino company which was self-registered and Filipino-run. The concerns became moot in 2010, when Media Prima announced it would divest its ownership in the network to PLDT's broadcasting subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings.|$|E

40|$|We {{define a}} new logic {{language}} with negation by introducing existential and universal quantifiers in the queries. We call Γ <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> Γ goals the <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> the goals in this language. Negation is handled by using two rules: the NAF rule for universally quantified negative queries and the NAI rule for existentially quantified negative queries. We formalize this amalgamation {{in terms of}} NAIF-resolution (SLD-resolution with Negation As Instantiation and Failure), and we prove its correctness w. r. t. the completion semantics. We also show how extended <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> goals, i. e. <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> goals whose body is an arbitrary first-order formula ([11]), can be transformed into Γ <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> goals and then evaluated using our system. 1 Introduction SLD-resolution extended by the NAF rule for treating negative subgoals, (SLDNF-resolution), represents {{the most widely used}} method to compute with general logic <b>programs</b> <b>and</b> goals [...] . ...|$|R
