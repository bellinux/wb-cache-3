According to bathhouse etiquette, it is <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable,</b> even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel {{to feel his}} penis, which, if well received, {{is the first step}} in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E

The American Association for the Advancement of Science describes the film as dishonest and divisive, aimed at introducing religious ideas into public school science classrooms, and the film is being used in private screenings to legislators {{as part of the}} Discovery Institute intelligent design campaign for Academic Freedom bills. Expelled portrays Gonzalez as a victim of religious discrimination and the Discovery Institute campaign asserts that his intelligent design writings should not have been considered in the review. However, Gonzales listed The Privileged Planet as part of his tenure review file.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance attached to reduplication in spoken or written discourse, or acceptability or non-acceptability of a collocation {{with reference to}} formal / informal use of language {{has not yet been}} accounted for. To find out how much reduplication is absorbed and acquired almost unconsciously, and to find out what informal pairs are considered acceptable or unacceptable in the formal use of language, a list of 123 reduplicative words was compiled and presented to fourteen undergraduate students studying a course of Semantics at Petra University. Responses were checked with reference to a three-point scale: acceptable, unacceptable and dubious by two professors of Arabic. The purpose was to pinpoint what collocations could be summoned from the mental lexicon. The objectives of this study are the following: (i) to consider the type of input an adult native speaker of Arabic has been subjected to as far as reduplication is concerned (ii) to determine the ranges of collocates that reduplicative words exhibit in normal everyday speech) iii) to explore acceptability or non-acceptability of reduplicative collocations and (iv) to shed light on differences between the mental lexicon of reduplicates and matching dictionary entries. Judging by the acceptability/unacceptability test conducted, one may conclude that each class of reduplicative verbs has a limited range of collocates and that some collocations are <b>perfectly</b> normal and <b>acceptable,</b> while others were felt to be unacceptable and unusual...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a whole-cell based sensor for arsenite detection coupling biological engineering and electrochemical techniques is presented. This strategy {{takes advantage of the}} natural Escherichia coli resistance mechanism against toxic arsenic species, such as arsenite, which consists of the selective intracellular recognition of arsenite and its pumping out from the cell. A whole-cell based biosensor can be produced by coupling the intracellular recognition of arsenite to the generation of an electrochemical signal. Hereto, E. coli was equipped with a genetic circuit in which synthesis of beta-galactosidase is under control of the arsenite-derepressable arsR-promoter. The E. coli reporter strain was filled in a microchip containing 16 independent electrochemical cells (i. e. two-electrode cell), which was then employed for analysis of tap and groundwater samples. The developed arsenic-sensitive electrochemical biochip is easy to use and outperforms state-of-the-art bacterial bioreporters assays specifically in its simplicity and response time, while keeping a very good limit of detection in tap water, i. e. 0. 8 ppb. Additionally, a very good linear response in the ranges of concentration tested (0. 94 ppb to 3. 75 ppb, R(2) = 0. 9975 and 3. 75 ppb to 30 ppb, R(2) = 0. 9991) was obtained, complying <b>perfectly</b> with the <b>acceptable</b> arsenic concentration limits defined by the World Health Organization for drinking water samples (i. e. 10 ppb). Therefore, the proposed assay provides a very good alternative for the portable quantification of As (III) in water as corroborated by the analysis of natural groundwater samples from Swiss mountains, which showed a very good agreement with the results obtained by atomic absorption spectroscopy...|$|R

Connolly's style, taking two hops with the right foot, is no longer allowed in this event nowadays, but was <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable</b> in 1896. With this style, he outjumped the field, {{finishing}} more than one meter ahead of his nearest opponent by jumping 13.71 m (44ft 11 3/4 in), earning him the first silver medal (gold medals did not yet exist).

25|$|Using {{this many}} landing gear on a swept wing would produce {{considerable}} problems when the aircraft {{tried to turn}} on the ground. It was possible to use steerable landing gear legs for this, but only at the cost of added complexity. An easier solution was to simply use a straight wing so the landing gear were in a line. However, this would limit the design to slower speeds below about Mach 0.7 (see wave drag). This was <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable</b> for short-haul role, where the cruise times were so short that added speed would have little actual effect on round-trip times. By limiting themselves to speeds not much greater than propeller transports, the engineers were free to select a wing designed solely for low-speed high-lift performance. The result looked much more like the wing from a 1930s airliner than a modern jet aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Often, gender {{differences}} in both jealousy and infidelity are attributable to cultural factors. This variation {{stems from the fact}} that societies differ in how they view extramarital affairs and jealousy. An examination of jealousy across 7 nations revealed that each partner in a relationship serves as each other's primary and exclusive source of satisfaction and attention in all cultures. Therefore, when an individual feels jealousy towards another, it is usually because they are now sharing their primary source of attention and satisfaction. However, variation can be seen when identifying the behaviors and actions that betray the role of primary attention (satisfaction) giver. For instance, in certain cultures if an individual goes out with another of the opposite gender, emotions of intense jealousy can result; however, in other cultures, this behavior is <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable</b> and is not given much thought.|$|E
25|$|A regular weekly {{rest period}} {{is a period of}} at least 45 {{consecutive}} hours. An actual working week starts {{at the end of a}} {{weekly rest period}}, and finishes when another weekly rest period is commenced, which may mean that weekly rest is taken in the middle of a fixed (Monday–Sunday) week. This is <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable</b> – the working week is not required to be aligned with the ‘fixed’ week defined in the rules, provided all the relevant limits are complied with. Alternatively, a driver can take a reduced weekly rest period of a minimum of 24 consecutive hours. If a reduction is taken, it must be compensated for by an equivalent period of rest taken in one block before the end of the third week following the week in question. The compensating rest must be attached to a period of rest of at least 9 hours – in effect either a weekly or a daily rest period.|$|E
25|$|However, in verb {{expressions}} {{accompanied by}} an object pronoun, Brazilians normally place it amid the auxiliary verb and the main one (ela vem me pagando but not ela me vem pagando or ela vem pagando-me). In some cases, in order to adapt this use to the standard grammar, some Brazilian scholars recommend that ela vem me pagando should be written like ela vem-me pagando (as in EP), {{in which case the}} enclisis could be totally acceptable if there would not be a factor of proclisis. Therefore, this phenomenon may or not be considered improper according to the prescribed grammar, since, according to the case, there could be a factor of proclisis that would not permit the placement of the pronoun between the verbs (e.g. when there is a negative adverb near the pronoun, in which case the standard grammar prescribes proclisis, ela não me vem pagando and not ela não vem-me pagando). Nevertheless, nowadays, it is becoming <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable</b> to use a clitic between two verbs, without linking it with a hyphen (as in poderia se dizer, or não vamos lhes dizer) and this usage (known as: pronome solto entre dois verbos) can be found in modern(ist) literature, textbooks, magazines and newspapers like Folha de S.Paulo and O Estadão (see in-house style manuals of these newspapers, available on-line, for more details).|$|E

2500|$|Although many {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} EM guns revolve around the assumption that greater muzzle velocity is always better, this is open to challenge. Parametric relationships between range, payload weight, and launch velocity show {{that this is not a}} strong argument for many suggested EM gun applications. For example, due to lower aerodynamic drag at launch, a slower but heavier projectile may actually fly farther than a lighter faster one, making the velocity limitations of chemical propulsion <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable.</b> In addition, explosive fragmentary warhead lethality is largely unaffected by velocity and does not require more demanding hit-to-kill guidance electronics that may not survive extremely high gun launch accelerations. [...] Significantly, explosively formed penetrator and shaped charge warheads already drive what is technically a kinetic energy penetrator to velocities well in excess of EM gun launch capabilities, up to 8 km/s for a shaped charge, upon detonation with the target; and it has been demonstrated that with respect to armor penetration, increased impact velocity much above 2 km/s does not necessarily result in a deeper hole; (although the crater may be wider as more energy is deposited with increased impact velocity).|$|E
2500|$|Vatican dress {{codes for}} both men and women were relaxed early in Pope John Paul II's pontificate.

2500|$|While {{infidelity}} is by {{no means}} exclusive to certain groups of people, its perception can be influenced by other factors. Furthermore, within a [...] "homogeneous culture," [...] like that in the United States, factors like community size can be strong predictors of how infidelity is perceived. Larger communities tend to care less about infidelity whereas small towns are much more concerned with such issues. These patterns are observed in other cultures as well. For example, a cantina in a small, rural Mexican community is often viewed as a place where [...] "decent" [...] or [...] "married" [...] women do not go because of its semi-private nature. Conversely, public spaces like the market or plaza are acceptable areas for heterosexual interaction. A smaller population size presents the threat of being publicly recognized for infidelity. However, within a larger community of the same Mexican society, entering a bar or watering hole would garner a different view. It would be deemed <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable</b> for both married and unmarried individuals to drink at a bar in a large city. These observations can be paralleled to rural and urban societies in the United States as well (Hirsch et al. 2007). Ultimately, these variables and societal differences dictate attitudes towards sexual infidelity which can vary across cultures as well as within cultures.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{linguistic}} {{studies have}} shown that Brazilian Portuguese is a topic-prominent or topic- and subject-prominent language. Sentences with topic are extensively used in Portuguese, perhaps more in Brazilian Portuguese most often by means of turning an element (object or verb) in the sentence into an introductory phrase, on which the body of the sentence constitutes a comment (topicalization), thus emphasizing it, as in Esses assuntos eu não conheço bem– literally, [...] "These subjects I don't know [...] well". Although this sentence would be <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable</b> in Portugal. In fact, in the Portuguese language, the anticipation of the verb or object {{at the beginning of the}} sentence, repeating it or using the respective pronoun referring to it, is also quite common, e.g. in Essa menina, eu não sei o que fazer com ela ("This girl, I don't know what to do with her") or Com essa menina eu não sei o que fazer ("With this girl I don't know what to do"). The use of redundant pronouns for means of topicalization is considered grammatically incorrect, because the topicalized noun phrase, according to traditional European analysis, has no syntactic function. This kind of construction, however, is often used in European Portuguese. Brazilian grammars traditionally treat this structure similarly, rarely mentioning such a thing as topic. Nevertheless, the so-called anacoluthon has taken on a new dimension in Brazilian Portuguese.

2500|$|Dacre became {{chairman}} of the PCC's Editors' Code of Practice Committee in April 2008.

According to Dacre, Eady had [...] "effectively ruled that it was <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable</b> for" [...] Mosley [...] "to pay five women £2,500 to take part in acts of unimaginable sexual depravity with him" [...] which is [...] "the very abrogation of civilised behaviour of which the law {{is supposed to be the}} safeguard".

Referring to a case in 2006 where Eady had blocked the publication of a married man's account of his wife's seduction by a prominent figure involved in sport, Dacre said [...] "the judge - in an unashamed reversal of centuries of moral and social thinking - placed the rights of the adulterer above society’s age-old belief that adultery should be condemned".

2500|$|The Franco-Israeli {{historian}} Saul Friedländer described The Foundations-with its {{theory of}} two [...] "pure" [...] races {{left in the}} world, namely the German and Jewish locked into a war for world domination which could only end with the complete victory of one over the other-as {{one of the key}} texts of [...] "redemptive anti-semitism". Because Chamberlain viewed Jews as a race, not a religion, Chamberlain argued the conversion of Jews was not a [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish Question", stating Jewish converts to Christianity were still Jews. In taking this stance, Chamberlain was going beyond his hero Wagner. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma wrote:Wagner himself, like Luther, still believed that a Jew could, as he put it with his customary charm, [...] "annihilate" [...] his Jewishness by repudiating his ancestry, converting and worshiping at the shrine of Bayreuth. So in theory a Jew could be a German…But to the mystical chauvinists, like Chamberlain, who took a tribal view of Germanness, even radical, Wagnerian assimilation could never be enough: the Jew was an alien virus to be purged from the national bloodstream. The more a Jew took on the habits and thoughts of his gentile compatriots, the more he was to be feared. Chamberlain did not advocate the extermination of Jews in The Foundations, indeed despite his determination to blame all of the world's problems on the Jews, Chamberlain never proposed a solution to this perceived problem. Instead Chamberlain made the cryptic statement that after reading his book, his readers would know best about how to devise a [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish Question". Friedländer has argued that if one were to seriously take up the theories of [...] "redemptive anti-semitism" [...] proposed in The Foundations, and push them to their logical conclusion, then inevitably one would reach the conclusion that genocide might be a <b>perfectly</b> <b>acceptable</b> [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish Question". Friedländer argued that there is an implied genocidal logic to The Foundations as Chamberlain argued that Jews were a race apart from the rest of humanity; that evil was embedded within the genes of the Jews, and so the Jews were born evil and remained evil until they died, indeed a Jew could never stop being evil even if he or she wanted to; and that for these biological reasons alone, the Jews would never cease their endless attempts to destroy all that was good within the world. Inspired by The Foundations, one völkisch writer Josef Remier published Ein Pangermanisches Deutschland in 1905, which used The Foundations to advocate that Germany conquer the Russian Empire, after which special commissions of doctors, anthropologists and [...] "breeding experts" [...] were to divide the population into three categories; ethnic Germans, those capable of being [...] "Germanized" [...] and those incapable of [...] "improvement" [...] with all Slavs and Jews being included in the last category.
