40|$|OBJECTIVE : To {{describe}} laparoscopic ovariectomy and salpingectomy in the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) using single-incision {{laparoscopic surgery}} (SILS). STUDY DESIGN : Prospective cohort. ANIMALS : Female cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) (n ¼ 21). METHODS : Cheetahs were randomly divided to receive either ovariectomy (n ¼ 11) or salpingectomy (n ¼ 10). The use and complications of a SILS port was evaluated {{in all of}} cheetahs. Surgery duration and insufflation volumes of carbon dioxide (CO 2) were recorded and compared across procedures. RESULTS : Laparoscopic ovariectomy and salpingectomy were performed without complications using a SILS port. The poorly-developed mesosalpinx and ovarian bursa facilitated access to the uterine tube for salpingectomy in the cheetah. The median surgery duration <b>for</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> was 24 minutes (interquartile range 3) and for salpingectomy was 19. 5 minutes (interquartile range 3) (P ¼. 005). The median volume of CO 2 used <b>for</b> <b>ovariectomy</b> was 11. 25 L (interquartile range 3. 08) and for salpingectomy was 4. 90 L (interquartile range 2. 52), (P ¼. 001) CONCLUSIONS : Laparoscopic ovariectomy and salpingectomy can be performed in the cheetah using SILS without perioperative complications. Salpingectomy is faster than ovariectomy and requires less total CO 2 for insufflation. NRF grants, AfriCat.

Feasibility, ă intra-and post-operative complications, and quality of the ovarian ă tissue collected were reported. ă Results Height patients were included. No conversion to standard ă laparoscopy or laparotomy was performed and no intra-or post-operative ă complications were reported. Median duration of surgery was 35 min ă (30 - 60). The quality of all the ovarian tissue collected was correct, ă and cryopreservation was possible for all patients. ă Conclusions <b>Ovariectomy</b> <b>for</b> cryopreservation by laparoscopy with SPA ă seems feasible. The advantages of this technique are particularly ă interesting in these patients who require the least aggressive surgical ă technique possible and a rapid convalescence...|$|R

This publication may be freely distributed in its entirety with this copyright notice attached. In many applications of mathematics and computer science, there {{is the need to}} reason about stratified sets of elements of a given nature (such as integers, reals, or lists). These elements can often be encoded as sets, and therefore a set-based reasoner, or decision procedure, is enough from a theoretical point of view. In practice, however, such encoding is very inefficient, and it is much more convenient to rely on specialized decision procedures when reasoning about the elements. It becomes then essential to combine the decision <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> the elements {{with each other and with}} the decision <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> sets. This thesis addresses the problem of combining decision <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> sets with decision <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> objects that are not sets. Its original results include: • a tableau-based decision <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> stratified sets; • two decision <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> a combination of stratified sets with elements, one based on a modification of the Nelson-Oppen combination method, the other based on tableaux; • a decision <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> a combination of stratified finite sets with integers and elements in the presence of a cardinality operator; • a combination <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> a combination of stratified sets (not necessarily finite) with cardinal numbers and elements in the presence of a cardinality operator; • a decision <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> cardinal numbers. ii...|$|R

40|$|We {{characterize}} provability in {{intuitionistic logic}} with equality {{in terms of}} a constraint calculus. This characterization uncovers close connections between provability in intuitionistic logic with equality and solutions to simultaneous rigid E-unification. We show that the problem of existence of a sequent proof with a given skeleton is polynomial-time equivalent to simultaneous rigid E-unifiability. This gives us a proof <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> intuitionistic logic with equality modulo simultaneous rigid E-unification. We also show that simultaneous rigid E-unifiability is polynomial-time reducible to intuitionistic logic with equality. Thus, any proof <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> intuitionistic logic with equality can be considered as a <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> simultaneous rigid E-unifiability.
