40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the European {{experience}} with a basket currency, the ECU. The ECU was initially introduced as a reference unit and later became the anchor of the European Monetary System. Public policy was complemented by private sector initiatives {{and use of the}} ECU for denomination of financial instruments. In practice, it turned out that a basket currency entails considerable unexpected technical complexities. The technical particularities of a basket currency are discussed before we turn to the criteria for determining the shares of <b>participating</b> <b>currencies.</b> We show that there are no iron-clad economic principles and therefore there is some room for political considerations. In Europe three criteria were used for determining the weights: GDP shares, international trade shares, and financial market indicators. In addition, weights will change with exchange rate movements. Appreciating currencies will experience increasing weights and depreciating currencies decreasing weights. This may require a correction mechanism for political acceptability. In Europe, weights were rescaled by political authorities every five years. From an economic viewpoint, weights depend critically on the purpose of the basket currency: is it a reference indicator, is it a currency for international transactions, or is it a parallel currency? Thus, before weights are to be discussed a clear vision {{of the role of the}} basket currency would be desirable. The vastly different growth performance among Asian economies also suggests a preference to forward rather than backward-looking measures. Turning then to the different functions of a basket currency, we examine the use of basket currencies as a divergence indicator, or as a financial instrument in regional fina...|$|R

40|$|Cash {{is still}} the most common means of daily {{payments}}. The large number of cash payments is supported by a costly distribution system in which retailers, banks and central banks <b>participate.</b> <b>Currency</b> is issued in a range of bank note and coin denominations to facilitate efficiency in cash payments. The purpose of this thesis is to study the performance of a currency range in practice. It presents a number of empirical studies on cash payments at the individual payment level, whereby cash payments are viewed as the outcome of a choice process. This type of analysis calls for labor-intensive data collection methods {{and the development of a}} sophisticated econometric model. This thesis introduces such a model for cash payments, and it reviews its application to three unique data sets of cash payments. The data concern payments in the Netherlands before and after the transition from the guilder to the euro in 2002, and payments in an experimental setting. The estimation results allow for an assessment of the use of different bank note and coin denominations in cash payments, and of possible preferences for one of more denominations. Currency research generally approaches currency use from a macroeconomic point of view. The novelty of this thesis is that it contributes to currency research by focusing on individual cash payments. Jeanine Kippers (1973) obtained her master´s degree in econometrics from the Erasmus University Rotterdam in 1997. In the same year she was employed by De Nederlandsche Bank. She participated in the preparations of the cash changeover from guilder to euro in 2002, and contributed to the development of a European cash distribution system and the restructuring of the national distribution system. During her employment at the central bank she started her research on currency use, which resulted in several papers that have been published or are currently under review.

They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound sterling) that day. Due to differences in national conventions for rounding and significant digits, all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of triangulation via the euro.|$|R
40|$|Exchange rate {{stability}} {{has been}} the cornerstone of Danish monetary policy in recent years. It is particularly important in this regard {{to assess the impact}} of the widening of the ERM bands in August 1993 on Danish monetary and exchange-rate strategy. Denmark has always been a defender of the old system of narrow bands for understandable reasons. Before the crisis of 1992 – 93, Denmark tended to make greater use of exchange rate movements within the band, as compared to the other two Basle-Nyborg instruments (namely, interest rate movements and inter-ventions). Denmark relied more than any other ERM country on the use of exchange rate movements, which proved to be stabilising due to the credibility of the limits. When the Danish krone tended to approach the fluctuation limits, self-stabilising capital movements pushed the exchange rate back towards the central parity. Even during the ERM crisis, when the limits proved to be destabilising for most currencies, the Danish krone seemed to enjoy greater credibility. However, on some occasions of generalised turmoil, co-ordinated intramarginal interventions by ERM central banks in favour of the Danish currency were necessary to avoid a realignment. The widening of the bands to ± 15 % in August 1993 changed this envi-ronment. The results of this broadening of the formal limits were some-what paradoxical: short-term volatility of the exchange rates has been reduced for almost all <b>participating</b> <b>currencies,</b> not only compared to the period of tensions (1992 – 93), but also in comparison with the previous phase of stability (1987 – 92) (see Graph 1). This was also true for the Danish krone, as can be seen in Chart 10 of the Danish paper. Another indicator of the – to some extent surprising – greater stability of the new ERM of wider bands, is the reduction of the effective width of the band, defined as the distance between the weakest and the strongest currencies (see Graph 2). For most ERM countries, the widening of the bands appar-ently reduced the destabilising impact of the limits and increased the stabilising effect of the central parities. In the case of Denmark, thes...|$|R

In a two-region general equilibrium model with traded and nontraded goods, lowering the labor income tax rate in response to positive inflation differentials succeeds in compressing inflation differentials.

Regional fiscal policies also have spill-over effects on the volatility of union-wide and foreign inflation in our model. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} a monetary union is the irrevocable fixing of nominal exchange rates of <b>participating</b> countries? <b>currencies.</b> Regions, as sub-units of Member States, {{will not be}} directly affected by such a decision since they have - by definition - no access to nominal exchange rate changes or monetary policy which in any case {{should never have been}} instruments for economic stabilisation at the regional level. Indirectly, however, the reduction of transaction costs as provided by the euro will give all regions of participating countries better access to the Single Market and will affect regions? competitiveness. To the extent that transaction costs between previously different currency areas cease to exist within a single currency area, integration effects occur on goods, capital and labour markets. The so-called "New Economic Geography" gives some indications on the impact of integration on trade and investment, whereas integration effects on the labour market should be marginal. The impact will vary more between regions of different Member States rather than between specific types of regions. Regions in the small, open peripheral Member States participating in EMU are likely to have relatively greater integration effects than regions in the core Member States whose exchange rates with main economic partners have already been stable for a long time. ...|$|R

The analysis is framed within a general equilibrium model of the world economy, composed by a large closed Union and a small (either independent or integrated) open economy.

The tightness of this trade-off {{is found to be}} inversely related to the degree of cross-country symmetry of the shocks.

For symmetric regions, changes in one region’s tax rule that decrease the volatility of its inflation differential also decrease the volatility of its output. The decrease in the volatility of the inflation differential is brought about by an increase in the volatility of tax rates. The effect of the tax rule on output volatility – but not inflation volatility – depends on country size. For a small country lower volatility of inflation differentials is associated with higher volatility of output. This relationship results from the fact that small countries are more open, and hence there is a greater role for traded goods productivity shocks. Fiscal policy; Inflation (Finance) ...|$|R
