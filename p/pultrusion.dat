The measurements under load in fire showed that the phenolic system decayed at a slower rate than the polyester, due mainly to the very shallow glass transition of the phenolic, but also the char forming characteristic of the phenolic.

40|$|The University of Southern Queensland {{along with}} other centre’s {{around the world are}} at the leading edge of fibre {{composite}} research. Many studies have been conducted into the properties and applications of fibre composite and it is the purpose of the research project to apply these findings to a real world design problem. This project aims to analyse and redesign the current SprayCam rig. SprayCam is a selective weed spot spraying system used within the agricultural industry. This technology uses a series of cameras operating in the visual spectrum to identify the weeds within fallowed paddocks. These cameras operate solenoids which subsequently spray only the weeds and not the entire field which occurs during conventional spraying techniques. The SprayCam rig is the mechanism that supports the cameras and the other technology and allows them to operate safely and efficiently. The current design is large and heavy for both its size and also its intended use as a selective weed spot sprayer. It is the belief that the current design overuses materials leading to an over engineered product which also increases manufacturing cost. This project contains two essential facets, the first being the analysis of the current rig design to determine the structural integrity while the second is to investigate the use of fibre composite <b>pultrusions</b> as a means of redesigning the spray rig wing. In order to complete the analysis of the current SprayCam rig it was first necessary to re-produce solid models of the current wing design to create an accurate basis for finite element analysis (FEA). Considerable research was directed into the appropriate loading constraints which have been identified and discussed in full within the report to ensure the validity of the results. A thorough finite element analysis was conducted on current spray rig design which found that the original wing was indeed over engineered for its use as an agricultural sprayer. The loads which the rig could withstand were much greater than those which it will be subjected to within the field. This result shows an inefficiency of the use of materials within the wing design leading to increased manufacturing cost. Therefore a more appropriate design needs to be developed if the product is going to be competitive in the current market. In redesigning the spray rig, investigation of all possible avenues would have required significant time and effort. With the University of Southern Queensland at the leading edge of fibre composite research, it was agreed that fibre composite <b>pultrusions</b> would be investigated as a means of both significantly reducing the weight of the spray rig and overcoming existing design flaws. There is currently a great deal of research conducted into the properties of fibre composite <b>pultrusions</b> and it is the purpose of this project to apply this research to a design situation. Many issues including costing and joining techniques needed to be overcome so that a possible design could be completed. Through use of finite element analysis {{it has been shown that}} fibre composite <b>pultrusions</b> are a feasible alternative to the original steel design.

Therefore, coating the adherend with low-viscosity epoxy resin, prior to bonding, improves wetting and hence increases joint strength.

40|$|Trusses are {{successful}} structural forms {{that have been}} utilised, at extended scale, since the nineteenth century. Fibre composite materials are relatively new to civil engineering applications. The increased interest in using composites in civil applications {{can be attributed to}} advantages when compared to other construction materials that offset their higher costs. Using conventional approaches for truss systems in composite materials can undermine their efficiency. This is mainly due to the stress concentration at connections which usually governs the truss design. The all-composite multi-pultrusion truss (MPT) concept was developed in the Centre of Excellence of Engineered Fibre Composites; University of Southern Queensland, Australia. It combines the usage of <b>pultrusions</b> for the chord and vertical members with diaphragm-type bracing.

40|$|Deployable shelters {{of various}} forms have been {{utilized}} since ancient civilization. The need for these systems has not diminished {{over time and}} development continues for military forces, civilian humanitarian aid, and natural disaster scenarios. Recent developments have focused mainly on tent-type structures, air-beam technology and steel frames supporting soft fabric; yet none of these have fully satisfied the deployability requirements. The Military Modular Shelter System (M 2 S 2) initiative is a research project with the University of Southern Queensland that aims to develop a fibre composite re-deployable arched shelter system with rigid PVC or fabric cladding. The main frames are formed from modular fibre composite truss panels that are connected and stressed into position by prestressing cables. Flexibility in defining the geometry of frames constructed by using this system is achieved by changing the number of panels per frame and the packer sizes between panels. The current study {{is the first to}} investigate a suitable truss system for the M 2 S 2 concept. Accordingly, it was necessary to validate the M 2 S 2 concept by searching the literature for previously developed deployable shelter concepts and locate the currently used fibre composite truss systems. Then try to establish a suitable truss system that fulfils the deployability needs with sound structural performance. An innovative all-composite truss concept, named Multi-Pultrusion Truss-System (MPTS), was developed {{as a result of this}} study. It overcame the classical difficulty of joining composite members by loading each component of the truss in its strength direction. In addition, the system had inherent redundancy that provided alternate load paths after reaching ultimate capacity. The basic idea of this system was to have chord and vertical members formed from a few <b>pultrusions</b> of the same size. The traditional usage of gussets was eliminated by using laminates for the bracing system which directly connected between the <b>pultrusions.</b> This system allowed direct transfer of the bracing forces to the connected members (<b>pultrusions).</b> This layout led to reducing the concentration of stresses in the adhesive layers (due to its continuous nature), while providing symmetric joints with two double-lap joints. All these factors contributed to having failure away from the joint area. The confinement of the bracing system, due to its finite dimensions, was one of the characteristics of this construction technology. Two MPTS alternatives were developed, tested and investigated. The first alternative used a Discrete-Diagonal (DD) bracing system made of sandwich diagonal. Two panels DI-MPTS panels were tested using this configuration, one with the diagonals under tension and the other with the diagonals under compression. The second alternative used a Diaphragm (DI) bracing system. Three different DI-MPTS panels were investigated. The first panel had an empty diaphragm (no core); the second panel had a partially-filled sandwich diaphragm while the third panel had a completely-filled sandwich diaphragm. To achieve understanding of the basic behaviour of each of these panels, finite element (FE) analyses were conducted at micro level. The different components of the panel were included in each model, with idealisations to achieve an efficient analysis process. The FE analysis results were used to investigate the distribution of forces in each of the panel components. Due to the associated costs of micro-model analyses, macro-analysis models are important tools for engineers interested in modelling this system, conduct pre-microanalysis parametric studies and in modelling the overall frame structure. This study ended with presenting simplified analysis procedures for the different panel types. The work conducted in this study has revealed that this new fibre composite truss system suits the characteristics of fibre composites and accordingly provides an efficient solution for general truss applications. It combines simplicity, easiness of manufacturing, high-load carrying capacity and structural redundancy. In addition, its behaviour and failure modes can be accurately predicted by using the currently available finite element software packages...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{new model}} has been {{developed}} for the prediction of thermal profiles for fibre reinforced plastic composites exposed to high heat ux. The model involves expressing the thermal diffusivity of the composite {{as a function of}} temperature. Apparent thermal diffusivity (ATD) can take into account the decomposition of the resin, which is endothermic, as well as the consequent changes in specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the composite. This offers the possibility of significantly simplifying computational procedures needed for modelling thermal behaviour with decomposition. The possibility of extending thermal analyses to two and three dimensional cases was explored. Techniques for the direct measurement of the apparent thermal diffusivity are presented for different composite systems over a wide range of temperatures: from ambient to ~ 600 °C. Two different techniques were needed for different ranges of temperatures: from ambient to 80 °C and from 80 - 100 °C to 600 °C. To measure the ATD in the low range, a step temperature change was applied to the surface of a slab-shaped piece of material. Theta, the difference between the middle plane temperature and the outer surface temperature was recorded. The value of the thermal diffusivity at each temperature was calculated from the values of theta. The high range measurement involved the application of a linear temperature rise to the surfaces of a slab of material. The ATD was calculated by means of the Laplace heat transfer equation. The thermal diffusivity function obtained through these measurements was used to model the Fire behaviour of these materials under different heat transfer conditions. Quasi isotropic glass/polyester slab shaped composite specimens were tested under one dimen- sional heat transfer conditions. A one-sided heat flux was applied to the samples and the remaining surfaces were isolated to obtain repeatable boundary conditions. The temperatures were recorded at different depths within the samples during the exposure. The ATD of this material was mea- sured through the techniques mentioned above and implemented in a one-dimensional heat transfer FORTRAN model. I-beam shaped pultruded sections were subjected to two-dimensional heat transfer conditions. The temperatures were recorded at different locations on the cold side. Thermal properties were determined by means of the apparent thermal diffusivity of the material and implemented in a two-dimensional FE thermal model. Carbon fibres reinforced wing box materials were used to perform three dimensional fire tests. To describe analytically the tests, the ATD was measured along the three principal directions by means of the techniques mentioned before. These data were implemented into finite element models. The suitability of the ATD to model complex cases was verified. The failure of polyester and phenolic <b>pultrusions</b> under tensile and compressive load and a one- sided heat flux of 50 kW/m² was studied. A thermal/mechanical model, based on the Henderson equation and laminate theory, was used to model their behaviour. In tension, significant load- bearing capacity was retained over a period of 800 seconds, due to the residual strength of the glass fibres. However, pultruded composites are susceptible to compressive failure in fire, due to the loss of properties when the resin Tg is reached. The fire reaction properties reported here showed the phenolic <b>pultrusions</b> to perform better than polyesters in all fire reaction properties (time-to-ignition, heat release, smoke and toxic product generation). The measurements under load in fire showed that the phenolic system decayed at a slower rate than the polyester, due mainly to the very shallow glass transition of the phenolic, but also the char-forming characteristic of the phenolic. The behaviour described here for phenolic <b>pultrusions</b> is superior to that reported for some phenolic laminates, the main reason probably being their lower water content. In all cases the experimental data and the predicted temperatures were compared. The ATD modelling proved capable of capturing the main features of the temperature curves that relate with the effects of re exposure of composites. This study allowed to determine the characteristics of the ATD curve at different temperatures and relate it to the phenomena occurring to composites exposed to fire.

A series of tests have been performed to characterize the mechanical performance of the material {{and the effect of}} in-service damage that is likely to occur when the material is used in this application. Moisture damage, indentation damage, and abrasive wear are all recreated in the laboratory and the severity of each is assessed. In particular, the effect of indentation damage on flexural properties is compared against the effect of moisture damage. It is found that while indentation damage can often appear more severe during a visual inspection, it generally has a lesser effect on flexural stiffness and strength compared to moisture damage. While the effect of moisture damage on flexural properties is well documented, the effect of indentation damage is previously less well understood. Both indentation damage and moisture damage significantly increase variance in flexural stiffness, but not flexural strength.

40|$|Polystal [2]) was {{developed}} using glass fibres pultruded with resin {{to form a}} round rod. Much research was carried out to determine the system’s proper-ties, including quantification of the stress-rupture phenomenon. An an-chorage {{was developed}} using a resin cast around bundles of <b>pultrusions</b> in-side a steel tube. This steel tube pro-vided confinement and {{could be used as}} a mechanical fastening. A number of bridges were built using these tendons: a simple footbridge was followed by a two-span continuous structure with internal tendons, both in Düsseldorf. Both are believed to have had considerable amounts of unten-sioned reinforcement and were de-signed as partially prestressed. These examples were followed by a bridge in Berlin with external tendons, and by others elsewhere in Germany and in Austria. Despite the technical success of the system it has not proved a com-mercial success, and production of the tendons has been discontinued. Aramid Rods for Prestressing In the early 1980 s research began in the Netherlands into the use of aramid fib-res for prestressing in the form of pul-trusions, both as flat strips and as round bars, under the name Arapree [3]. The surface of the bars can be indent-ed or coated with sand to improve the bond. As with the Polystal tendons, it is difficult to provide long-term an-chorages for permanent loads, since the force has to be transferred through the resin, which is susceptible to creep and temperature effects. However, an-choring systems have been developed that are adequate for short-term load-ings. These rods are ideally suited for use as pretensioning tendons in pre-cast concrete. The system has been used to build a variety of structures in Europe and Japan. These range from non-structur-al components, such as noise barriers and fish-weir planks, to housing com-ponents and principal elements of quayside developments. The system has also been used in cantilever sup-port brackets on a highway scheme in Barcelona. During early trials, some problems were noted with the transverse expan-sion of the tendons due to thermal ef-fects [4]. Cracking of the concrete along the line of the tendon was noted when the tendons were close to the surface.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of {{lightweight}} composite materials in road freight trailer design {{as a means of}} reducing the emissions of the road freight industry. A comprehensive review of previous lightweight composite trailers and related projects was conducted; it concluded that the application of composites in trailers to-date has largely been limited by relatively high material and production costs. The review highlighted that the trailer industry could learn from the success of composites in the bridge construction industry. A statistical weight analysis of two road freight fleets and an energy consumption estimation, via a drive cycle analysis, were used to identify trailers that are particularly suited to lightweighting. Hardwood trailer decking was identified as a prime subcomponent for composite replacement. However, there is little literature on how conventional hardwood trailer decks react to in-service loadings. This problem was addressed through a comprehensive deck damage study, which was used to benchmark novel lightweight deck systems. Several lightweight replacement composite sandwich panels were designed, built and tested. Two different pultruded GFRP decks were also examined. While <b>pultrusions</b> do not offer the same level of weight savings as sandwich panels, the highly cost-driven nature of the trailer industry could dictate that their integration is the most reasonable first step to introducing composites into structural subcomponents. The final part of the thesis explores options for lightweighting the trailer chassis holistically. Trailer load cases were investigated through finite element modelling in Abaqus. A parametric model of a typical longitudinal trailer I-beam was developed using Python scripting and Abaqus. The model was expanded to analyse composite trailer structures. It showed that approximately 1, 300 kg of weight could be saved by shape and material optimisation in a composite trailer. In summary, this research has shown that short-term trailer weight reductions can be effectively achieved through subcomponent replacement, while more significant reductions can be achieved in the long-term by a ‘clean slate’ composite redesign of the trailer chassis. The lightweighting strategies presented here are poised to have an increasingly important role in reducing the emissions of the road freight industry.
