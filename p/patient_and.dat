5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care.

Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E

5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the <b>patient,</b> <b>and</b> the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E

40|$|Background:There {{is a lack}} of {{data about}} the {{information}} preferences of <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their partners after a myocardial infarction. Aim:This paper explores anxiety, depression, coping and the desire to be actively involved in care in relation to age, gender and education level in myocardial infarction <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> partners. Methods:One hundred <b>and</b> twenty-eight <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their partners answered the Swedish version of the Krantz Health Opinion Survey, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Mastery Scale one year after the patient's myocardial infarction. Results:More active roles in decision-making during care were desired by females, younger <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> partners, <b>and</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> partners with higher education levels. Female partners reported more anxiety than male partners, <b>and</b> female <b>patients</b> reported more depression than male patients. No differences between groups were detected in coping; overall coping was rated high. Conclusions:Secondary prevention should consist of person-centred support to both the <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their partners, since factors such as age, gender and education level can influence information preferences during patient care...|$|R

5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today {{subjective}} {{position of}} a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence {{is related to the}} primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E
5|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the <b>patient)</b> <b>and</b> hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} research on stroke patients' and caregivers' educational needs. Methods: A search of the literature prior to and including the year January 2009 was conducted using Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library, yielding 959 articles. Of these, 21 studies {{were included in the}} review. Results: Stroke <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> caregivers reported many and diverse educational needs, which often were not met. The educational needs of stroke <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> caregivers concerned knowledge about the clinical aspects of stroke, prevention, treatment and functional recovery. The most commonly reported needs of caregivers involved patients' moving and lifting, exercises, psychological changes <b>and</b> nutritional issues. <b>Patients</b> <b>and</b> caregivers wanted information that was tailored to their situation. Conclusion: <b>Patients</b> <b>and</b> caregivers have many unmet educational needs. The findings call for improved education of <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> caregivers on various issues that are specific to the various recovery phases after stroke. Practice implications: The findings of this review can be used to develop educational interventions for stroke <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> caregivers. Further research is needed to investigate the feasibility and effects of educational interventions and whether they meet the educational needs of <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> caregivers.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 63) Cancer is {{a devastating}} disease. The {{realities of the}} illness and its treatment, however, are {{only a part of}} the cancer patient???s life. Cancer causes a whirlpool of emotional and social problems in the lives of both <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their families. Cancer <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their families need to manage their emotional reactions to this life-threatening disease, get through treatment, and redefine their life priorities. They may be challenged to adjust to new family roles, and reestablish their social support systems. Such problems cannot be resolved with a simple prescription. In addition to medical support, cancer <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their families need psychosocial support. 	This project features a workbook designed for mental health professionals who will be, or are interested in, working with cancer <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their families. This project contains a literature review of previous studies and research regarding psychosocial support for cancer <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their families. Such studies indicate that although concepts of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) are more socially accepted, and thus, more psychosocial support for caner <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their families is available, there still are many cancer <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> families who struggle with difficult cancer-related problems, and feel isolated and hopeless. 	The purpose of this workbook is to help mental health professionals support cancer <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their families. This workbook includes, therefore, useful information about cancer, psycho-oncology, psychosocial needs of cancer <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> their families, and psychotherapeutic interventions to meet such needs.

5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the <b>patient,</b> <b>and</b> the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy.

A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
