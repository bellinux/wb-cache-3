5|$|Advanced Gemini is {{a number}} of {{proposals}} that would have extended the Gemini <b>program</b> <b>by</b> the addition of various missions, including manned low Earth orbit, circumlunar and lunar landing missions. Gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated by NASA, and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as Agena Target Vehicles, and allowing the crew to perform tethered extra-vehicular activities.|$|E
5|$|After {{determining}} which eligibility requirements {{participation in a}} program requires, the recipient must also assure that individual program participant or group eligibility was correctly determined by keeping evidence of such compliance, such as maintaining documentation in participant files (e.g., copies of HIV/Aids diagnosis, copies of federal income tax returns, etc.). Furthermore, the recipient must assure that only eligible individuals or groups participated in the <b>program</b> <b>by</b> establishing strict controls of program funds to avoid non-eligible persons from receiving the specific assistance.|$|E
40|$|Ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> {{different}} synonymous codons {{also differ}} in discriminating among near-cognate aminoacylated tRNAs. In the initial {{step of the}} recognition reaction ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> UUC discriminate less well than ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> UUU against ternary complexes containing three types of Leu-tRNA, and ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> CUC discriminate less well than ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> CUU against ternary complexes containing Phe-tRNA. Furthermore, in the proofreading step ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> UUC discriminate less well than ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> UUU against two of three near-cognate Leu-tRNAs, and ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> CUC discriminate less well than ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> CUU against near-cognate Phe-tRNA. The codon-induced change in reaction rate with near-cognate ternary complexes is greater than that with cognate ternary complexes: the most efficient codon is, therefore, the least accurate. Because the efficient, but inaccurate, codon UUC is used preferentially in highly expressed mRNAs of Escherichia coli, maximization of translational accuracy apparently has not been significant {{in the evolution of}} this particular biased codon choice in E. coli...|$|R

5|$|After the war, Groves {{remained}} {{in charge of}} the Manhattan Project until responsibility for nuclear weapons production was handed over to the United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1947. He then headed the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, which had been created to control the military aspects of nuclear weapons. He was given a dressing down by the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, and told that he would never be appointed Chief of Engineers. Three days later, Groves announced his intention to leave the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant general just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the bomb <b>program.</b> <b>By</b> a special Act of Congress, his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the Trinity nuclear test.

5|$|During {{his short}} time as chancellor, Corbally faced crises {{spurred on by}} civil unrest {{surrounding}} the Vietnam War and race relations. Tolley, his predecessor, was a proponent of military education on campus; this included {{the establishment of a}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) <b>program.</b> <b>By</b> the time Tolley left office, the university faced major financial issues and there was uncertainty regarding the future of the ROTC program. Corbally advocated for keeping the program and its academic accreditation, an idea which was opposed by students hostile to a military presence on campus, some of whom participated in a sit-in of the ROTC building in February 1970. The matter was referred to the school senate, a democratic body composed of students, faculty, and administrators, which voted to keep the program open, a move which many students felt was forced by the chancellor.|$|E
