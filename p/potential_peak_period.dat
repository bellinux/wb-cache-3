40|$|While {{there are}} {{a growing number of}} {{observational}} instruments to assess the built and social dimensions of the neighborhood environment, there are few reliable and validated instruments; there are no instruments that assess the neighborhood environment during nighttime hours, a <b>potential</b> <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of health and safety risk. The purpose of this investigation is to establish the metric properties of Neighborhood Inventory for Environmental Typology (NIfETy) Instrument nighttime ratings. Reliability of the scale was measured by internal consistency reliability and test re-test correlation. Validity was evaluated through correlation with the daytime NIfETy rating and regression models with local violent crime data. The nighttime items had good internal consistency (3 ̆b 1 =. 81 - 82) for the total scale and acceptable internal consistency for a seven-item nighttime disorder scale (3 ̆b 1 =. 66 -. 71). Future investigations will examine the nighttime NIfETy and its association with specific risk behaviors to evaluate changes in neighborhood environment.

40|$|The {{capability}} of copper-platinum (Cu/Pt) electrode {{system as a}} Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) chemical oscillation monitor was {{compared with that of}} the normally used SCE/Pt electrode system, by testing it on three BZ systems, which were obtained by varying the oscillator in the combination bromate, oscillator and malonic acid. The oscillators, used separately, were cerium(IV), manganese(II) and ferroin [iron (II) - 1, 10 -phenanthroline complex]. Cu/Pt electrode gave essentially identical values of oscillation characteristics (oscillation <b>period,</b> <b>peak</b> <b>potential,</b> induction <b>period,</b> <b>peak</b> width) except <b>peak</b> <b>potentials.</b> This indicated that the Cu/Pt electrode system would be more useful than the SCE/Pt electrode system (which had chloride leakage problem), in electrical applications of chemical oscillations, such as electrical switches, which would depend only on the on/off frequency...|$|R
40|$|PJM System Operations has {{developed}} the following operating procedure {{to mitigate the}} potential operational impacts of delays in reinforcements identified in the planning horizon. Specifically, high load conditions in northern New Jersey, coupled {{with a lack of}} new generation have necessitated a baseline system upgrade. The Susquehanna-Roseland 500 kV upgrade project was designed to alleviate these issues as part of the Regional Transmission Expansion Planning (RTEP) process. According to PJM planning studies, the project has a required in-service date of June 1, 2012 to ensure continued reliability of the PJM system. Delays have pushed the project’s expected in-service date back to June 1, 2015 creating <b>potential</b> summer <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> congestion issues.

40|$|Peak {{electricity}} demand poses a particular challenge both to network operators and to energy suppliers. A reduction in peak demand would allow existing networks to accommodate load growth with lower investment, and {{also reduce the}} cost of electricity generation during <b>peak</b> <b>periods.</b> To explore the <b>potential</b> for <b>peak</b> reduction, the Customer-Led Network Revolution project has trialled a Time of Use (ToU) tariff scheme. By increasing electricity prices during the weekday <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> (4 pm- 8 pm) for throughout the year and reducing prices in off-peak periods, the tariff incentivises a shift in consumption out of the <b>peak</b> <b>period.</b> A static ToU tariff was used – that is, the tariff remained constant and did not change dynamically depending on expected network loading. Based on smart meter data and survey responses, test cell (TC) 9 a investigated the electricity use patterns of 574 domestic users on a ToU tariff between October 2012 and September 2013 and compared them to those of the control group (test cell 1 a). The impact of demographic profile on customers’ responses to the ToU tariff was also considered. On average, when compared to consumers in the control cell TC 1 a, customers on the ToU tariff had lower consumption during the <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> on weekdays, and higher consumption at other times – indicating that the tariff achieved the intended behaviour change. There was a small net reduction (0. 8...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the case}} of peak spreading, the {{traditional}} static analysis on the duration of congestion using peak 15 minutes of hour has lost its meaning. To deal with congestion, we need dynamic analysis on the onset and dissipation of congestion. This paper aims to reflect the severity of congestion, even the spatial interaction of congestion, by the relative size of <b>peak</b> <b>period.</b> Two thresholds, the minimum value in the peak hour and 95 percent of peak hour volume respectively, were chosen to define the peak using archived stop-bar detector data.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on the phenomenon of peak rail demand and its management. Major cities in Australia are experiencing heavy demand growth for rail passenger transport, especially in the morning and afternoon <b>peak</b> <b>periods</b> during which radially-configured rail systems experience heavy commuter traffic catering to the standard workday. Passenger rail systems customarily focus attention on meeting peak demand – through investment in infrastructure, rolling stock and provision of services. Allocating extensive resources for use during only a few hours each day is not efficient. The paper looks at the literature on peak rail demand. Firstly, the phenomenon itself is described, along with the methods that might be used to track and measure demand levels. Secondly, common and <b>potential</b> <b>peak</b> spreading or shifting or demand management approaches, issues and ideas are reviewed – including: network planning responses, differential pricing, policy and strategy and passenger location-balancing strategies.
