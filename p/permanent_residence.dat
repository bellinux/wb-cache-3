5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care before finding their <b>permanent</b> <b>residence.</b> It is particularly hard for adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E

5|$|On January 1, 1800 Hudson and {{his family}} left Goshen for the township, their new <b>permanent</b> <b>residence.</b> The family stopped in Bloomfield, New York, where they met {{with the rest of}} the settlers. Hudson {{purchased}} livestock and a year's worth of supplies for $2,000, giving the livestock to four men to drive overland to the settlement. On April 30, the remaining settlers embarked on eight boats, arriving on May 20. On October 28, Anna Hudson gave birth to Anne Maria, the first person born in the settlement.|$|E

5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of <b>Permanent</b> <b>Residence</b> Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment. People left rural areas to escape poverty, and females left {{due to the lack}} of local opportunities for women. In the cities, women could find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female migrant workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the migrant women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} defences were {{in place}} by the time of Ranulph's death in 1232, there were no living quarters, and neither were there on the death of Ranulph's {{successor}} John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and used it as a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|Desperate for {{materials}} and short on funds, the palace was initially built {{entirely out of}} wood, its various structures surrounded by a simple log palisade. On 10 June 1782, the king ceremonially crossed the river from Thonburi to take <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> in the new palace. Three days later on 13 June, the king held an abbreviated coronation ceremony, thus becoming the first monarch of the new Rattanakosin Kingdom. Over {{the next few years}} the king began replacing wooden structures with masonry, rebuilding the walls, forts, gates, throne halls and royal residences. This rebuilding included the royal chapel, which would come to house the Emerald Buddha.|$|E

5|$|Haynes and {{his wife}} toured the American West after his retirement, indulging {{themselves}} while searching for a <b>permanent</b> <b>residence.</b> Some of the general's friends suggested Wichita Falls, the city of his last military post, but he left to assess the possibility of living in Taos, New Mexico, {{where he and his}} airman son hiked and explored ancient human settlements. Deciding against Taos, Haynes {{and his wife}} continued in their tour, soon finding Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to their liking. There, he bought two adjoining lots on North Carmelo Street with one existing house. Rather than accepting any of the offers he received promising an executive career in the aeronautics industry, he relaxed by hunting and fishing.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family <b>permanent</b> <b>residence.</b> Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
5|$|Paoli {{continued}} to perform {{around the world}} with performances in Greece, Palestine, Poland, Egypt, Spain and Italy, where he established his <b>permanent</b> <b>residence.</b> In 1910, the singer was signed as the First Tenor by La Scala, Milan, the most prestigious opera company in the world at the time. Paoli received a contract to inaugurate Teatro Col√≥n, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he sang Otello and Di quella pira. He also performed in Russia, Poland, Egypt, Hungary, Belgium, Cuba, Chile, Haiti, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Canada, and the United States.|$|E

5|$|Barnard's Inn, {{originally}} {{known as}} Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, {{was established in}} 1454 as an Inn of Chancery. A large Inn, Barnard's had 112 students a year {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I with 24 in <b>permanent</b> <b>residence.</b> When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he got something wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year, who was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.|$|E

In the USSR, Lasker renounced his German citizenship and received Soviet citizenship. He took <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> in Moscow, and was given a post at Moscow's Institute for Mathematics and a post of trainer of the USSR national team.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February 1722, Cantillon married Mary Mahony, {{daughter}} of Count Daniel O'Mahony‚Äîa wealthy merchant and former Irish general‚Äîspending {{much of the}} remainder of the 1720s travelling throughout Europe with his wife. Cantillon and Mary had two children, a son who died at an early age and a daughter, Henrietta, who would go on to marry William Howard Earl of Stafford in 1743. Although he frequently returned to Paris between 1729 and 1733, his <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> was in London. In , his residence in London was burned to the ground, and it is generally assumed that Cantillon died in the fire. While the fire's causes are unclear, the most widely accepted theory is that Cantillon was murdered. One of Cantillon's biographers, Antoine Murphy, has advanced the alternative theory that Cantillon staged his own death to escape the harassment of his debtors, appearing in Suriname under the name Chevalier de Louvigny.|$|E

5|$|Constantine {{considered}} Constantinople his {{capital and}} <b>permanent</b> <b>residence.</b> He {{lived there for}} {{a good portion of}} his later life. In 328 the emperor Constantine the Great inaugurated the Constantine's Bridge (Danube) at Sucidava, (today Celei in Romania) in hopes of reconquering Dacia, a province that had been abandoned under Aurelian. In the late winter of 332, Constantine campaigned with the Sarmatians against the Goths. The weather and lack of food cost the Goths dearly: reportedly, nearly one hundred thousand died before they submitted to Rome. In 334, after Sarmatian commoners had overthrown their leaders, Constantine led a campaign against the tribe. He won a victory in the war and extended his control over the region, as remains of camps and fortifications in the region indicate. Constantine resettled some Sarmatian exiles as farmers in Illyrian and Roman districts, and conscripted the rest into the army. The new frontier in Dacia was along the Brazda lui Novac line supported by new castra. Constantine took the title Dacicus maximus in 336.|$|E
5|$|John Michael Wright (May 1617 ‚Äì July 1694) was a {{portrait}} painter in the Baroque style. Described variously as English and Scottish, Wright trained in Edinburgh under the Scots painter George Jamesone, and acquired a considerable {{reputation as an}} artist and scholar during a long sojourn in Rome. There he was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca, and was associated with some of the leading artists of his generation. He was engaged by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, to acquire artworks in Oliver Cromwell's England in 1655. He took up <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> in England from 1656, and served as court painter before and after the English Restoration. A convert to Roman Catholicism, he was a favourite of the restored Stuart court, a client of both Charles II and James II, and was a witness to many of the political maneuverings of the era. In the final years of the Stuart monarchy he returned to Rome as part of an embassy to Pope Innocent XI.|$|E
5|$|On {{becoming}} king in 1272, Edward I reestablished royal power, overhauling {{the royal}} finances and {{appealing to the}} broader English elite by using Parliament to authorise the raising of new taxes and to hear petitions concerning abuses of local governance. This political balance collapsed under Edward II and savage civil wars broke out during the 1320s. Edward III restored order once more {{with the help of}} a majority of the nobility, exercising power through the exchequer, the common bench and the royal household. This government was better organised and on a larger scale than ever before, and by the 14th century the king's formerly peripatetic chancery had to take up <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> in Westminster. Edward used Parliament even more than his predecessors to handle general administration, to legislate and to raise the necessary taxes to pay for the wars in France. The royal lands‚Äîand incomes from them‚Äîhad diminished over the years, and increasingly frequent taxation was required to support royal initiatives. Edward held elaborate chivalric events in an effort to unite his supporters around the symbols of knighthood. The ideal of chivalry continued to develop throughout the 14th century, reflected in the growth of knightly orders (including the Order of the Garter), grand tournaments and round table events.|$|E
