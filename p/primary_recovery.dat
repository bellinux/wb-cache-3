25|$|Conventional {{crude oil}} is {{normally}} {{extracted from the}} ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although artificial lift and techniques such as horizontal drilling, water flooding and gas injection are often required to maintain production.

However, {{with much of the}} easy-to-produce oil already recovered from U.S. oil fields, producers have attempted several tertiary, or enhanced oil recovery, techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir's original oil in place.|$|E

50|$|Enhanced oil {{recovery}} (abbreviated EOR) is {{the implementation of}} various techniques for {{increasing the amount of}} crude oil that can be extracted from an oil field. Enhanced {{oil recovery}} is also called tertiary recovery (as opposed to <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>recovery).</b> According to the US Department of Energy, there are three primary techniques for EOR: thermal recovery, gas injection, and chemical injection. Sometimes the term quaternary recovery is used to refer to more advanced, speculative, EOR techniques.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{completed}} which examined the technical, operational and safety issues associated with subsea production and subsea well systems. The rapidly accelerating shift to subsea production represents {{a significant departure from}} conventional production operations. The subsea environment is perhaps the most remote and unexplored on earth. This remoteness makes monitoring and intervention much more difficult and raises unique environmental issues. Historically, subsea production and subsea well systems have had a good track record. However, these systems are now being deployed in ways rarely encountered in previous development schemes, presenting a number of technical challenges. One of the key challenges is to address the expected poor <b>primary</b> <b>recoveries</b> from subsea wells. Subsea production systems require the transportation of a multiphase mixture of oil, water and gas for many miles from the producing well to a distant processing facility. Industry and regulators are increasingly becoming aware that, while reducing up-front capital outlays, long, multiphase flowlines add additional backpressure, reducing flow rates and ultimate recoveries. For example, conventional production operations routinely drawdown wellhead pressures to 10 - 20 bar, while subsea completed wells may have abandonment wellhead pressures over 100 bar due to the backpressure added by the long multiphase flowline. One of the challenges posed by subsea production is how to reduce wellhead pressure to allow effective recovery of hydrocarbon resources. To address this issue, there is growing interest in processing the produced fluids subsea, to achieve improved recoveries and greater efficiencies. A goal {{of this study is to}} provide decision makers with the information necessary to assess the conservation impact associated with various subsea production strategies; strategies that may or may not consider subsea processing or subsea multiphase pumping. The objectives of this study are shown to th...|$|R

Recent work has shown that retransmissions in failure-prone, for exam-ple, wireless ad hoc, networks can cause heavy tails and long delays. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon showing that PS-based scheduling induces complete instability with zero throughput {{in the presence of}} retransmissions, regardless of how low the traffic load may be. This phenomenon occurs even when the job sizes are bounded/fragmented, for example, deterministic. Our analytical results are further validated via simulation experiments. Moreover, our work demonstrates that schedul-ing one job at a time, such as first-come-first-serve, achieves a larger stability region and should be preferred in these systems...|$|R
