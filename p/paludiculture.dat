50|$|<b>Paludiculture</b> is the {{cultivation}} of marshland. The main focus of <b>paludiculture</b> is on {{the preservation of the}} marshes and the increasing of peat in marshlands. A secondary objective is the production of biomass so it can be used energetically (for heat/power).|$|E
40|$|Peatland {{drainage}} causes peat degradation, {{which results}} in high greenhouse gas emissions and ongoing subsidence of the ground surface. To avoid further land degradation, the rewetting of peatlands is essential. The new land use concept of <b>paludiculture</b> - the use of wet and rewetted peatlands for agriculture and forestry - now offers possibilities for landowners and land managers to continue using these sites under wet conditions. But new challenges arise due to the limited bearing capacity of wet soils, which restricts accessibility for machinery. Whilst many site-specific technical solutions for harvesting on wet peatland are available, it remains unclear whether current machinery is suitable {{for use in the}} large-scale implementation of <b>paludiculture.</b> Repeated crossings of the same ground can easily disturb the upper peat layer and cause serious problems for the removal of biomass. In this article we present available machinery and approaches to biomass harvesting; and explore how the number of transport runs required for biomass removal varies with productivity of the site, cargo capacity and working width of the harvesting machinery. The results are used in a discussion of logistics and infrastructure requirements to facilitate the implementation of <b>paludiculture.</b> Whilst there is still considerable scope for improvement of harvesting technologies, our results show that a peat-conserving harvest from wet and rewetted peatlands is possible with adjustments to harvesting technique, logistics and site infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|Combining {{peatland}} rewetting with biomass cropping (<b>paludiculture)</b> is {{one strategy}} to remove nutrientsurpluses from soil/water and stimulate peat-forming vegetation. This approach was {{tested in the}} Mas-saciuccoli Lake Basin (Tuscany, Italy), a coastal floodplain artificially drained for agricultural purposessince 1930, where land reclamation and continuous cropping have contributed to considerable peatdegradation and water eutrophication due to nutrient enrichment of surface waters. An experimentaltrial was established in spring 2012 with three perennial rhizomatous grasses (PRG) (Phragmites aus-tralis, Miscanthus × giganteus, Arundo donax) and two woody species managed as short-rotation coppice(SRC) (Salix alba “Dimitrios”, Populus × canadensis “Oudenberg”), aimed to provide biomass for variousbioenergy supply chains. A conventionally cultivated annual crop (maize) was the control. The aim of thisstudy was to compare the sustainability of the proposed <b>paludiculture</b> systems to that of conventionalannual crops {{on the basis of}} yield and nutrient-removal capability. This two-year field study evaluatedyields, nutrient concentrations and uptake (N and P) of the crops. Over the two years, A. donax had thehighest mean biomass yield (35 Mg ha− 1), N uptake (367 kg ha− 1), and P uptake (54 kg ha− 1). SRCs hadthe lowest nutrient uptake in both years. Among grasses, the highest N concentration was recorded inA. donax leaves in 2013 (N: 2. 41 %), while P concentration was greater in S. alba branches (P: 0. 39 %). Theaverage aboveground biomass of maize was 17. 5 Mg ha− 1, while the nutrient uptakes were equal to 194 and 27 kg ha− 1 for N and P, respectively. Thus, the performances of <b>paludiculture</b> systems were generally encouraging and could represent animportant alternative for restoring and managing former drained peatlands in a suitable product chain...|$|E
30|$|Thirdly, {{provisioning}} {{services are}} often {{connected with the}} production of food such as urban agriculture, fishing, forestry and gardening. Such activities, however, make up {{only a small part}} of the supply of resources required by local residents. The more valuable part of urban provisioning services consists of resources supplied by ecosystems such as water for drinking and production, raw materials (fibers, timber) as well as renewable energy (hydropower, biogas, firewood, etc.). This latter resource is of increasing importance, especially in Germany. Familiar ecosystem products that are becoming more and more popular in cities include honey and fruits from meadows with scattered trees. These examples show how the sustainable use of ES can be combined with the conservation of valuable green spaces if such utilization is not oriented towards the optimization of only one kind of product. Mining cities often encompass areas that are not suited to the development of housing or industrial activities; alternatively, they have the potential to generate renewable forms of energy. In cases where former mining areas cannot be used for food production, they can be redeveloped with short rotation coppices or other kinds of plantation to provide renewable raw materials or energy crops. Biofuel crops can also be planted on polluted soils if the problem of residues and emissions can be resolved. The introduction of such biofuel crops can serve to establish a new industrial profile, and can be combined with other forms of renewable sources of energy such as solar power, wind power as well as hydropower or storage. Another development option particularly applicable to areas afflicted by post-mining subsidence is to establish so-called <b>paludicultures</b> (Wichtmann et al. 2016). This is the cultivation of wetlands and shallow lakes with adapted plants such as reeds and willows.|$|R

Since 2001 {{we have been studying}} peatmoss cultivation (‘Sphagnum farming’) in greenhouse and ﬁeld experiments, paying special attention to propagation, propagule storage, establishment, productivity and regeneration.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{cultivation of}} drained peatland causes peat oxidation, soil subsidence, nutrient loss, increasing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and biodiversity reduction. <b>Paludiculture</b> {{has been identified as}} an alternative management strategy consisting in the cultivation of biomass on wet and rewetted peatlands. This strategy can save these habitats and restore the ecosystem services provided by the peatlands both on the local and global scale. This paper illustrates the most important features to optimise the crop choice phase which is the crucial point for the success of <b>paludiculture</b> systems. A multi-adaptive framework was proposed. It was based on four points that should be checked to identify suitable crops for paludicultural cropping system: biological traits, biomass production, attitude to cultivation and biomass quality. The main agronomic implications were explored with the help of some results from a plurennial open-field experimentation carried out in a paludicultural system set up in the Massaciuccoli Lake Basin (Tuscany, Italy) and a complete example of the method application was provided. The tested crops were Arundo donax L., Miscanthus×giganteus Greef et Deuter, Phragmites australis L., Populus×canadensis Moench. and Salix alba L. The results showed a different level of suitability ascribable to the different plant species proving that the proposed framework can discriminate the behaviour of tested crops. Phragmites australis L. was the most suitable crop whereas Populus×canadensis Moench and Miscanthus×giganteus Greef et Deuter (in the case of biogas conversion) occupied the last positions in the ranking...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of harvest time (from May to September) and dry matter partitioning on biomethane potential and methane yield per unit area of Phragmites australis cultivation under <b>paludiculture</b> conditions. The experimental site {{is part of a}} larger experimental platform (San NiccolÃ², Pisa) located within the Massaciuccoli Lake Basin in Central Italy (Tuscany, IT). The study also took into account the double cut strategy by evaluating the regrowth from June to September. Biomethane potentials ranged from 384 to 315 and from 412 to 283 Â NLÂ CH 4 Â kgÂ VSâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21 (normal liters of methane per kg of volatile solids) for leaves and stems, respectively. About digestion kinetics, maximum daily production rate (Rmax) was significantly affected by harvest time and not by plant partitioning. Along the harvest season, biomethane yield per unit area was mostly driven by the biomass yield showing an increasing trend from May (1659 Â Nm 3 Â haâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21) to September (3817 Â Nm 3 Â haâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21). The highest value was obtained with the double harvest option (4383 Â Nm 3 Â haâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21), although it was not statistically different from the single harvest carried out in September. Owing to its remarkably lower yields, P. australis cannot be considered along the same lines as crops conventionally used for biogas production, but it may represent an interesting option for <b>paludiculture</b> cropping systems by coupling peatland restoration with bioenergy production. September harvest management seemed the most feasible option, although further investigation on crop lifespan is needed...|$|E
40|$|Large {{areas of}} peatlands have {{worldwide}} been drained to facilitate agriculture, which has {{adverse effects on}} the environment and the global climate. Agriculture on rewetted peatlands (<b>paludiculture)</b> provides a sustainable alternative to drainage-based agriculture. One form of <b>paludiculture</b> is the cultivation of Sphagnum moss, which {{can be used as a}} raw material for horticultural growing media. Under natural conditions, most Sphagnum mosses eligible for <b>paludiculture</b> typically predominate only in nutrient-poor wetland habitats. It is unknown, however, how the prevailing high nutrient levels in rewetted agricultural peatlands interfere with optimal Sphagnum production. We therefore studied the effect of enriched nutrient conditions remaining even after top soil removal and further caused by external supply of nutrient-rich irrigation water and (generally) high inputs of atmospheric nitrogen (N) to habitat biogeochemistry, biomass production and nutrient stoichiometry of introduced Sphagnum palustre and S. papillosum in a rewetted peatland, which was formerly in intensive agricultural use. Airborne N was responsible for the major supply of N. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were mainly supplied by irrigation water. The prevailing high nutrient levels (P and K) are a result of nutrient-rich irrigation water from the surroundings. Peat porewater (10 cm below peatmoss surface) CO 2 concentrations were high, bicarbonate concentrations low, and the pH was around 4. 2. Provided that moisture supply is sufficient and dominance of fast-growing, larger graminoids suppressed (in order to avoid outshading of Sphagnum mosses), strikingly very high biomass yields of 6. 7 and 6. 5 t DW ha− 1 yr− 1 (S. palustre and S. papillosum [including S. fallax biomass], respectively) were obtained despite high N supply and biomass N concentrations. Despite high P and K supply and uptake, N:P and N:K ratios in the Sphagnum capitula were still low. Sphagnum mosses achieved high nutrient sequestration rates of 34 kg N, 17 kg K and 4 kg P ha− 1 yr− 1 from May 2013 to May 2014, which shows that the site acted as an active nutrient sink. Nutrient management still needs further improvement to reduce the competitive advantage of fast growing peatmoss species (cf. S. fallax) at the expense of slower growing but preferred peatmosses as horticultural substrate (S. palustre and S. papillosum) to optimize the quality of biomass yields. In conclusion, Sphagnum farming is well able to thrive under high N input provided that there is a simultaneous high input of P and K from irrigation water, which facilitates high production rates. Due to the lack of suitable, nutrient poor sites, it seems to be useful to remove the topsoil (mainly P removal) prior to start growing Sphagnum mosses. In addition, bicarbonate concentrations have to stay sufficiently low to ensure a low pH, CO 2 supply from the peat soil should be sufficiently high to prevent C limitation, and graminoids should be mown regularly...|$|E
40|$|Many {{protected}} {{wetlands and}} (especially) fen peatlands in Poland require vegetation management to restore and maintain them as breeding areas for endangered bird species. The current practice of harvesting, baling and transporting grasses, reeds and other vegetation using tracked snow groomers and wheeled farm tractors can {{conflict with the}} nature conservation goals for these sites through disturbance of the ground surface and accidents leading to spillage of oil. To address these problems, the Industrial Institute of Agricultural Engineering (PIMR) is developing new-generation agricultural machinery that will also be applicable in formal <b>paludiculture.</b> This article describes an innovative method for towing large bales of harvested biomass across wetlands that minimises ground pressure using any vehicle, {{and the development of}} amphibian tracked (ATV) and hovercraft vehicles for biomass harvesting operations in wetlands...|$|E
40|$|Cultivation of {{bioenergy}} {{crops in}} rewetted peatland (<b>paludiculture)</b> is {{considered as a}} possible land use option to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, bioenergy crops like reed canary grass (RCG) can have a complex influence on GHG fluxes. Here we determined the effect of RCG cultivation on GHG emission from peatland rewetted to various extents. Mesocosms were manipulated to three different ground water levels (GWLs), i. e. 0, − 10 and − 20 cm below the soil surface in a controlled semi-field facility. Emissions of CO 2 (ecosystem respiration, ER), CH 4 and N 2 O from mesocosms with RCG and bare soil were measured at weekly to fortnightly intervals with static chamber techniques {{for a period of}} 1 year. Cultivation of RCG increased both ER and CH 4 emissions, but decreased the N 2 O emissions. The presence of RCG gave rise to 69, 75 and 85 % of total ER at − 20, − 10 and 0 cm GWL, respectively. However, this difference was due to decreased soil respiration at the rising GWL as the plant-derived CO 2 flux was similar at all three GWLs. For methane, 70 – 95 % of the total emission was due to presence of RCG, with the highest contribution at − 20 cm GWL. In contrast, cultivation of RCG decreased N 2 O emission by 33 – 86 % with the major reductions at − 10 and − 20 cm GWL. In terms of global warming potential, the increase in CH 4 emissions due to RCG cultivation was more than offset by the decrease in N 2 O emissions at − 10 and − 20 cm GWL; at 0 cm GWL the CH 4 emissions was offset only by 23 %. CO 2 emissions from ER were obviously the dominant RCG-derived GHG flux, but above-ground biomass yields, and preliminary measurements of gross photosynthetic production, showed that ER could be more than balanced due to the photosynthetic uptake of CO 2 by RCG. Our results support that RCG cultivation could be a good land use option in terms of mitigating GHG emission from rewetted peatlands, potentially turning these ecosystems into a sink of atmospheric CO 2...|$|E
