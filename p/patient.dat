5|$|Occasionally {{a hospice}} {{will be unable}} to provide care to a <b>patient,</b> either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the <b>patient</b> or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive behavior from the <b>patient</b> or other persons in the patient's home or refusal to cooperate with the hospice program. Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E
5|$|Once a <b>patient</b> is {{enrolled}} in hospice, the hospice becomes the insurance payor for that <b>patient</b> for any hospice-related illnesses. In other words, if a <b>patient</b> is on hospice for end-stage congestive heart failure, the hospice {{is responsible for}} all care related to the heart failure. However, if the <b>patient</b> were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance.|$|E
5|$|Social Worker: Every <b>patient</b> is {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the <b>patient</b> and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a <b>patient</b> is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the <b>patient</b> to receive hospice care.|$|E

5|$|A <b>patient</b> may be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the <b>patient</b> chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the <b>patient</b> may remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|Home Health Aide: The home health, or hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a hospice patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every <b>patient</b> on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by the <b>patient</b> and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the <b>patient,</b> including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with the <b>patient,</b> due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{data from}} 50 {{consecutive}} <b>patients</b> with unresectable hilar tumors situated at or proximal {{to the common}} hepatic duct were retrospectively analyzed {{to aid in the}} selection of appropriate palliative measures. Thirty- four <b>patients</b> had cholangio-enteric bypass (CEB) to either left (28 <b>patients),</b> right (3 <b>patients),</b> or both (3 <b>patients)</b> intrahepatic ductal systems. Sixteen <b>patients</b> had nonoperative drainage (NOD) established either endoscopically (4 <b>patients),</b> percutaneously (9 <b>patients),</b> or using a combined endoscopic-percutaneous approach (3 <b>patients).</b> When compared with <b>patients</b> with CEB, <b>patients</b> with NOD had more frequent medical problems (p < 0. 03) and lower serum albumin levels on admission (p < 0. 03). While comparable postprocedural complications (13 CEB <b>patients</b> versus 4 NOD <b>patients)</b> were observed, <b>patients</b> with NOD had a significantly higher hospital mortality (9 CEB <b>patients</b> versus 9 NOD <b>patients,</b> p < 0. 05). Excluding the 12 <b>patients</b> (6 CEB <b>patients</b> versus 6 NOD <b>patients)</b> who died within 30 days after drainage, the quality of survival of the remaining 38 <b>patients</b> was analyzed with reference to 6 objective parameters. Although <b>patients</b> with NOD had significantly more frequent admissions relating to their catheters (p < 0. 02), there was no qualitative difference in the survival rate between the two groups of <b>patients.</b> For selected high-risk <b>patients</b> with limited life expectancy, NOD should be offered.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This article {{describes}} the retrospective analysis of the <b>patients</b> who presented with a drug-related intoxication to the emergency department of the Erasmus Medical Centre in 2000. METHODS: Data were collected from the emergency department's electronic database and the medical charts of the <b>patients.</b> RESULTS: A total of 243 <b>patients</b> were seen with a drug-related intoxication caused by ingestion {{of one or more}} medical substances, drugs of abuse (DOA) or combinations with alcohol. Mono-intoxication occurred in 58 % of the <b>patients,</b> predominantly caused by DOA (56 <b>patients),</b> analgesics (17 <b>patients)</b> or benzodiazepines (14 <b>patients).</b> Benzodiazepines (55 <b>patients),</b> analgesics (42 <b>patients),</b> alcohol (42 <b>patients),</b> DOA (40 <b>patients)</b> and antidepressants (23 <b>patients)</b> were predominant in combined intoxications. More than half of the <b>patients</b> (142) were discharged after being treated in the emergency department and 80 <b>patients</b> were admitted to the wards. Eighteen <b>patients</b> were admitted elsewhere and three <b>patients</b> were lost to follow-up. Eventually, 70 <b>patients</b> were discharged after having been admitted, five <b>patients</b> were admitted to other institutions, two <b>patients</b> died and three <b>patients</b> were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: DOA, benzodiazepines, analgesics, alcohol and antidepressants accounted for approximately 65 % of the drug-related intoxications in 2000 and in a third of the presenting <b>patients,</b> toxicity was such that admission to the wards was warranted...|$|R
5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the <b>patient</b> is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the <b>patient,</b> and the <b>patient</b> can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E

5|$|Physician: Physicians {{involved}} in <b>patient</b> care may include the primary physician, {{who can provide}} valuable information about <b>patient</b> medical history, and physicians connected to the hospice team. These primarily provide support to other hospice team members, but may also treat the <b>patient</b> directly. The physician subspecialty of Hospice and Palliative Medicine was established in 2006, to provide expertise {{in the care of}} patients with life-limiting, advanced disease and catastrophic injury; the relief of distressing symptoms; the coordination of interdisciplinary <b>patient</b> and family-centered care in diverse settings; the use of specialized care systems including hospice; the management of the imminently dying patient; and legal and ethical decision making in end-of-life care.|$|E

5|$|Should a <b>patient</b> be {{transferred}} to an assisted living facility, nursing home, or hospital, the hospice would continue to provide care to the <b>patient</b> which is on par with the services provided under the routine home care benefit. In this way, {{the only difference between}} respite and routine care is that the hospice pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a <b>patient</b> receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to what other patients of the hospice unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} can {{be difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the <b>patient</b> is suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed that a <b>patient</b> is experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the <b>patient</b> is given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is tested by evaluating {{the function of}} the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles.
