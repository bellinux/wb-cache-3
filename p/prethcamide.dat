50|$|An {{analeptic}}, in medicine, is {{a central}} nervous system stimulant. The term analeptic typically refers to respiratory analeptics (for example, doxapram). Analeptics are central nervous system stimulants that include {{a wide variety of}} medications used to treat depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and respiratory depression. Analeptics can also be used as convulsants, with low doses causing patients to experience heightened awareness, restlessness and rapid breathing.The primary medical use of these drugs is as an anesthetic recovery tool or to treat emergency respiratory depression.Other drugs of this category are <b>prethcamide,</b> pentylenetetrazole, and nikethamide. Nikethamide is now withdrawn due to risk of convulsions. Analeptics have recently been used to better understand the treatment of a barbiturate overdose. Through the use of agents researchers were able to treat obtundation and respiratory depression. Various analeptics contain epononymous names. E.g. Etamivan has the tradname of Analepticon & synephrine is called Analeptin.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} oral <b>prethcamide</b> (Micoren) (a mixture of two related amides of crotonyl N′ butyric acid) was {{compared}} with a placebo preparation in 13 patients with established chronic ventilatory failure. Part I of the study comprised a double-blind single cross-over trial with an initial assessment and two further assessments {{at the end of}} each period of one month. <b>Prethcamide</b> was taken in 200 -mg. doses four times daily. No subjective or objective changes were noted, and in particular the resting Pco 2 showed no change...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} drugs {{have been used}} to treat {{asphyxia}} in new-born calves and the aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of commonly-used stimulant drugs on ventilation, arterial blood gas and acid base variables. A group (n = 18) of new-born (3 – 15 h old) calves were treated in a randomised sequence with doxapram (40 mg, IV), lobeline (5 mg, IV) or <b>prethcamide</b> (5 mL, consisting of 375 mg crotethamide and 375 mg cropropamide, buccally). Blood and spirometric measurements, using an ultrasonic spirometer, were collected prior to and 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90 min after administration of each drug. Doxapram caused {{a significant increase in the}} respiratory rate, peak inspiratory and expiratory flow and minute volume (Vmin) during the 90 -min post-treatment study period, although maximum values occurred 1 min after treatment. The Vmin increased from 13. 8 ± 5. 0 L to 28. 5 ± 12. 3 L. <b>Prethcamide,</b> but not lobeline, also caused significant increases in inspiratory and expiratory volumes. The effects of doxapram on ventilation were accompanied by an increase in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) (77. 7 ± 18. 8 mm Hg to 93. 2 ± 23. 7 mm Hg), a decrease in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) (42. 6 ± 4. 9 mm Hg to 33. 1 ± 6. 6 mm Hg), a significant increase in pH and a decrease in bicarbonate concentration and base excess 1 min after treatment. <b>Prethcamide</b> caused a gradual increase in PaO 2 and decrease in PaCO 2 over 90 min, whereas lobeline had no measurable effect on the investigated variables. Of the three treatments, only doxapram had a distinct stimulatory effect on respiration in healthy neonatal calves and may therefore be useful in the treatment of calf asphyxia...|$|E
40|$|The {{ventilatory}} {{effects of}} intravenous injections and infusions of <b>prethcamide</b> {{have been investigated}} with healthy young adult male volunteers. Ventilatory changes due to the drug were measured at constant inspired Pco 2 or constant alveolar Pco 2, and {{in relation to the}} response to changes in alveolar Pco 2. The experiments show that the drug is a mild and somewhat inconstant respiratory stimulant, slow and prolonged in action and liable to give rise to a variety of unpleasant side-effects...|$|E
