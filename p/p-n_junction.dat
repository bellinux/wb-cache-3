5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E

30|$|A {{composite}} nanostructure for high-efficiency {{solar cells}} that axially connects nanowire core-shell <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> is proposed. By axially connecting the <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> in one nanowire, the solar spectrum is separated and {{absorbed in the}} top and bottom cells with respect to the wavelength. The unique structure of nanowire <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> enables substantial light absorption along the nanowire and efficient radial carrier separation and collection. A coupled three-dimensional optoelectronic simulation is used to evaluate the performance of the structure.

However, even with the fast progress of graphene technology {{for more than ten}} years, it remains conspicuously difficult to generate nanoscale and atomically-sharp <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> in graphene. Here, we employ monolayer-vacancy-island engineering of Cu surface to realize nanoscale <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> with atomically-sharp boundaries in graphene monolayer. The variation of graphene-Cu separations {{around the edges of the}} Cu monolayer-vacancy-island affects the positions of the Dirac point in graphene, which consequently lead to atomically-sharp <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> with the height as high as 660 meV in graphene. The generated sharp <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> isolate the graphene above the Cu monolayer-vacancy-island as nanoscale graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in a continuous graphene sheet. Massless Dirac fermions are confined by the <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> for a finite time to form quasi-bound states in the GQDs. By using scanning tunneling microscopy, we observe resonances of quasi-bound states in the GQDs with various sizes and directly visualize effects of geometries of the GQDs on the quantum interference patterns of the quasi-bound states, which allow us to test the quantum electron optics based on graphene in atomic scale.

25|$|Operation of a {{solar cell}} can be {{understood}} from the equivalent circuit at right. Light, of sufficient energy (greater than the bandgap of the material), creates mobile electron–hole pairs in a semiconductor. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> in thermal equilibrium (a contact potential creates the field). This charge separation between positive holes and negative electrons across a <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> (a diode) yields a forward voltage, the photo voltage, between the illuminated diode terminals. As has been noted earlier in the terminology section, the photo voltage is {{sometimes referred to as}} the photo emf, rather than distinguishing between the effect and the cause. The charge separation causes a photo voltage that drives current through any attached load.|$|E

25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> diodes.
