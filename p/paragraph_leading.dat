30|$|At {{first the}} method {{parameters}} N, Δ t and α are considered. It {{turned out that}} the multiplier α of the boundary term as in the <b>paragraph</b> <b>leading</b> to Equation (35) did not show any noticeable influence on the monitored quantities, and is thus omitted {{from the rest of the}} discussion. The left picture of Fig.  11 shows the eccentricity e plotted over the time of analysis 0 < t < 20 for the variation of N, the number of elements per direction. One can clearly see that there is a fluctuation of the values throughout time and the amplitude of this fluctuation diminishes with increasing values of N. This becomes more clear, when looking at the time-averaged values of e andθ in the right picture. Here a̅ denotes the average of the quantity a over the time interval 5 < 20. The values of the average angle and the average eccentricity tend towards a specific value with increasing N, see Fig.  11. Similar observations are made for the time step variations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Paragraphs are the {{building}} blocks of essays. A sound knowledge of paragraph structuring leads to well-written and readable essays. On the contrary, a lack of paragraph writing skills culminates into a farrago of ideas scattered haphazardly in the essay, thereby affecting paragraph unity and coherence, which in turn impacts negatively on the packaging of ideas in the essay. This study has been prompted by my observation over the years of paragraph construction difficulties polytechnic students face in their academic writing, and also the paucity of research in polytechnic writing. As a result, this paper set to investigate how students structure their paragraphs in terms of topic sentence use and support sentences. A corpus of 120 essays was collected from four departments in Kumasi Polytechnic, Kumasi, Ghana and using Bain’s paragraph principles as a benchmark to analyse them, the results revealed that 66 % of the essays employed definite paragraph format. The study also found numerous one-sentence <b>paragraphs</b> <b>leading</b> to the creation of indentations, with reckless abandon. The results of the study have implications for the teaching of writing skills in polytechnics...|$|R

6000|$|A {{few years}} back the public was satiated with {{accounts}} of the happy condition of the slaves in our colonies, and the great encouragements and facilities afforded to such of them, as by industry and foresight laboured to better their situation. With what truth this is stated as the general tone of feeling among our planters, and their agents, may be conjectured from the following sentences, which made part of what in England we call the <b>leading</b> <b>paragraph</b> of the same newspaper:-- ...|$|R
25|$|The {{history and}} descent {{of the main}} {{characters}} are given as the <b>leading</b> <b>paragraphs</b> of the book, and the back story is elaborated upon in The Silmarillion. It begins five hundred years before {{the action of the}} book, when Morgoth, a Vala and the prime evil power, escapes from the Blessed Realm of Valinor to the north-west of Middle-earth. From his fortress of Angband he endeavours to gain control of the whole of Middle-earth, unleashing a war with the Elves that dwell in the land of Beleriand to the south.|$|R
5000|$|Of Aristotle's four kinds or {{explanatory}} modes, only one, the 'efficient cause' is a {{cause as}} defined in the <b>leading</b> <b>paragraph</b> of this present article. The other three explanatory modes might be rendered material composition, structure and dynamics, and, again, criterion of completion. The word that Aristotle used was [...] For the present purpose, that Greek word would be better translated as [...] "explanation" [...] than as [...] "cause" [...] as those words are most often used in current English. Another translation of Aristotle is that he meant [...] "the four Becauses" [...] as four kinds of answer to [...] "why" [...] questions.|$|R
60|$|Our very sign-boards, (said an illustrious {{friend to}} me,) give evidence, {{that there has}} been a Titian in the world. In like manner, not only the debates in parliament, not only our proclamations and state papers, but the essays and <b>leading</b> <b>paragraphs</b> of our {{journals}} are so many remembrancers of Edmund Burke. Of this the reader may easily convince himself, if either by recollection or reference he will compare the opposition newspapers at the commencement and during the five or six following years of the French revolution with the sentiments, and grounds of argument assumed in the same class of journals at present, and for some years past.|$|R
50|$|Cody’s ad, headlined Do You Make These Mistakes in English? led with class-conscious {{examples}} of mistakes in English and concluded its <b>leading</b> <b>paragraph</b> {{by noting that}} “Every time they talk or write” many people “show themselves lacking in the essential points of English.” Later Cody’s account was managed by Sackheim protégé Victor Schwab, who treated it {{as an example of}} the scientific approach to advertising. Schwab referred to it as “An Advertisement That is Never Changed,” and he gave a ten-year comparison of responses to two different headlines—Do You Make These Mistakes in English? and How to Speak and Write Masterly English, showing that the response rate was near three times better for the ad asking speakers about their mistakes.|$|R
40|$|Although artfully drafted, the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) is unreadable.  Sentences are {{excessively}} long – one rambles on {{for nearly}} two pages.  The DGCL sometimes follows the standard convention that divides complex statutory sentences into multiple paragraphs.  But more often the DGCL defies convention by burying several sentences on different topics in a single paragraph.  Roman numerals denoting list items hide undifferentiated {{in the midst of}} long block paragraphs.  Although the DGCL’s section headings are informative, sections are sometimes long and subsection headings are non-existent.  Add to these problems the inherent difficulty in all statutory interpretation, the complexity of corporate law, and the excruciating explicitness of the Delaware drafters, and the result is an impenetrable law.  All but the most determined readers simply bounce off. This pamphlet presents a readable version of the DGCL (RDGCL).  Some readability is through standard typographical techniques.  The RDGCL employs running heads, squares and indents entire paragraphs rather than merely the first lines of <b>paragraphs,</b> uses <b>leading</b> to visually separate paragraphs, and bolds paragraph and subparagraph numbers – including those troublesome list denoters. But what most enhances the RDGCL’s readability is the application of a grammar-based marking system (VisiLaw) to the statutory text.  The markings visually separate sentences, and clauses within sentences, making it possible to see where each begins and ends.  This ability to see structure at a glance makes it possible to read clauses one at a time without losing orientation in the overall structure.  Within each constituent clause, underlining identifies a skeletal sentence – subject, verb, direct object and a few other words.  The underlining enables the reader to quickly get the gist, and understand the structure, of the constituent clause.  Marks are catalogued in a single-pageKey to Visilaw Markingsand the system is explained in a lengthierIntroduction to the VisiLaw Marking System...|$|R
60|$|Be this as it may, I am {{persuaded that}} the Morning Post proved {{a far more}} useful ally to the Government in its most {{important}} objects, in consequence of its being generally considered as moderately anti- ministerial, than {{if it had been}} the avowed eulogist of Mr. Pitt. The few, whose curiosity or fancy should lead them to turn over the journals of that date, may find a small proof of this in the frequent charges made by the Morning Chronicle, that such and such essays or <b>leading</b> <b>paragraphs</b> had been sent from the Treasury. The rapid and unusual increase in the sale of the Morning Post is a sufficient pledge, that genuine impartiality with a respectable portion of literary talent will secure the success of a newspaper without the aid of party or ministerial patronage. But by impartiality I mean an honest and enlightened adherence to a code of intelligible principles previously announced, and faithfully referred to in support of every judgment on men and events; not indiscriminate abuse, not the indulgence of an editor's own malignant passions, and still less, if that be possible, a determination to make money by flattering the envy and cupidity, the vindictive restlessness and self-conceit of the half-witted vulgar; a determination almost fiendish, but which, I have been informed, has been boastfully avowed by one man, the most notorious of these mob-sycophants! From the commencement of the Addington administration to the present day, whatever I have written in THE MORNING POST, or (after that paper was transferred to other proprietors) in THE COURIER, has been in defence or furtherance of the measures of Government.|$|R
6000|$|The Champion {{had been}} the first to give tongue, and the other journals, on the plea that the {{mischief}} was out, one after the other took up the cry. On Monday, April 15, the Sun printed Fare Thee Well, and on Tuesday, April 16, followed with A Sketch. On the same day the Morning Chronicle, protesting that [...] "the poems were not written for the public eye, but as having been inserted in a Sunday paper," [...] printed both sets of verses; the Morning Post, with an ugly hint that [...] "the noble Lord gives us verses, when he dare not give us circumstances," [...] restricted itself to Fare Thee Well; while the Times, in a <b>leading</b> <b>paragraph,</b> feigned to regard [...] "the two extraordinary copies of verses ... the whining stanzas of Fare Thee Well, and the low malignity and miserable doggerel of the companion Sketch," [...] as [...] "an injurious fabrication." [...] On Thursday, the 18th, the Courier, though declining to insert A Sketch, deals temperately and sympathetically with the Fare Thee Well, and quotes the testimony of a [...] "fair correspondent" [...] (? Madame de Staël), that if [...] "her husband had bade her such a farewell she could not have avoided running into his arms, and being reconciled immediately--'Je n'aurois pu m'y tenir un instant';" [...] and on the same day the Times, having learnt to its [...] "extreme astonishment and regret," [...] that both poems were indeed Lord Byron's, maintained that the noble author had [...] "degraded literature, and abused the privileges of rank, by converting them into weapons of vengeance against an inferior and a female." [...] On Friday, the 19th, the Star printed both poems, and the Morning Post inserted a criticism, which had already appeared in the Courier of the preceding day. On Saturday, the 20th, the Courier found itself compelled, in the interests of its readers, to print both poems. On Sunday, the 21st, the octave of the original issue, the Examiner devoted a long article to an apology for Byron, and a fierce rejoinder to the Champion; and on the same day the Independent Whig and the Sunday News, which favoured the [...] "opposition," [...] printed both poems, with prefatory notices more or less favourable to the writer; whereas the Tory Antigallican Monitor, which also printed both poems, added the significant remark that [...] "if everything said of Lord Byron be true, {{it would appear that the}} Whigs were not altogether so immaculate as they themselves would wish the world to suppose." ...|$|R
