5|$|Critics gave very {{favorable}} reviews to the MS-DOS and Macintosh version, which were praised for the level design and technological advances. The PlayStation version {{was criticized for}} having poor graphics and slow frame rates, reducing <b>playability.</b> A sequel to Dark Forces, , followed in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Johann Christoph Denner is {{generally}} {{believed to have}} invented the clarinet in Germany around the year 1700 by adding a register key to the earlier chalumeau. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and <b>playability.</b>|$|E
5|$|The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave varying {{praise to}} the Lynx version's {{controls}} and graphics, but concurred {{that on the}} smaller portable screen Desert Strike loses much of its impact and <b>playability,</b> as {{it is difficult to}} identify enemies or even see the bullets the player character fires.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{found the}} Game Gear port {{to be well}} done given the system's less {{powerful}} technology. Electronic Gaming Monthly staff called {{it one of the}} best portable action games. Richard Leadbetter of Sega Magazine believed that since much of the Genesis verions's <b>playability</b> came from the system's technical capabilities, the Game Gear version suffers in that sense; however, he still believed Treasure was able to create a fun 8-bit port.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} created and {{designed}} by brothers Dave and Bob Thomas, with Ultimate founders Tim and Chris Stamper otherwise being uninvolved in development. Entombed took considerably longer to develop {{due to the}} re-programming of its game engine. It received positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise being directed at its <b>playability</b> and graphics. It {{was followed by a}} sequel, Blackwyche, which was released later in the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} the first game to be {{developed}} by the newly re-branded Rare, whereas the first game to be released under the company was Solar Jetman, earlier in 1990. The game received mixed reviews upon release, with praise directed at its <b>playability</b> but was criticised for its poor graphics and presentation. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|First {{announced}} in June 2014, Spider-Man Unlimited was released for Apple iOS, Android and Windows Phone on September 10, 2014. Starting in October 2014, Gameloft released seven updates that added new chapters {{to the story}} mode, Spider-Man and Spider-Woman, enemies, events and stages. Since its release, it has been downloaded 30 million times and has been well received by gaming critics. Reviewers praised the game's controls, sound, animation and the variety of characters, while criticizing its energy system, which they considered a limit to the <b>playability.</b>|$|E
5|$|United Front Games cut 120 {{staff with}} the company's {{solvency}} in doubt until August when Square Enix acquired the publishing {{rights to the}} game. Square Enix did not buy the True Crime intellectual property, and renamed the game Sleeping Dogs. Square Enix London Studios general manager Lee Singleton said he recognized the game's <b>playability</b> and potential. United Front Games' President Stefan Wessels stated he was excited to work with Square Enix London Studios. Sixty people {{were added to the}} development team and the game was released in late 2012.|$|E
5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the <b>playability</b> of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest note of the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Mario explores Princess Peach's {{castle and}} must rescue her from Bowser. As {{one of the}} earlier 3D {{platform}} games, Super Mario 64 is based on open world <b>playability,</b> degrees of freedom through all three axes in space, and relatively large areas which are composed primarily of true 3D polygons as opposed to only two-dimensional (2D) sprites. The game established a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as Super Mario Bros. did for 2D sidescrolling platformers. In the evolution from two dimensions to three, Super Mario 64 places an emphasis on exploration within vast worlds that require the player to complete multiple diverse missions, {{in addition to the}} occasional linear obstacle courses as in traditional platform games. While doing so, it still preserves many gameplay elements and characters of earlier Mario games, and the same visual style.|$|E
5|$|The studio {{released}} a free expansion and patch {{to the game}} on 3 June 2014, which in addition to fixing game-breaking issues, added new goat models, a new map to explore based on a seaside town with a carnival, more game-breaking issues, and local multiplayer for up to 4 players via split-screen. Ibrisagic believes that adding multiplayer support atop Steam Workshop support will allow creative users to develop new gameplay modes that will extend the title's <b>playability.</b> The patch also adds in additional controls that the player can use to make the goat perform various freestyle tricks comparable to those in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The studio {{released a}} second free patch to the game on 20 November 2014 including elements that parody massive multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft, though remains a single player or local multiplayer experience.|$|E
5|$|Chahi {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Another Worlds intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's <b>playability</b> could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming {{certain parts of the}} script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions. In July 2005, almost {{a decade and a half}} after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions. In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5.0 OS or later in QVGA (320×240 resolution). Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio. The administrator's letter to stakeholders mentions that its assets will be sold, but does not indicate to whom or mention Another World assets by name.|$|E
5|$|A new Zelda {{title was}} first hinted at in April 2008, when Miyamoto {{stated that the}} Zelda {{development}} team were reforming to create new games. Miyamoto later confirmed at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that a new Zelda was in development for the Wii. The game was officially unveiled at E3 2009, although its official title remained unknown. Due to its in-development state, Miyamoto could not show off gameplay as he had wished. Instead, he showed promotional art featuring Link and Fi. He also announced the game's use of Wii MotionPlus, along with its planned 2010 release window. In a later interview, Aonuma's comments on the game's <b>playability</b> brought this release window into doubt. He also noted that his wish {{to focus on the}} new game meant that the release date of Spirit Tracks was shifted to the end of 2009 rather than its initial projected release in early 2010. The game's official title was announced at the event, along with its revised release period in 2011 and a playable demonstration. According to Miyamoto, the game was delayed from its planned 2010 release window as the staff felt that they would be releasing an unfinished product if they put the convenience of the company ahead of creating a quality experience. They used the extra year to both finish the core elements and polish up the game as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Federation Commander {{is largely}} based on Star Fleet Battles (SFB), and carries over many of its basic rules and game dynamics. It was {{designed}} to be a game which would be similar to Star Fleet Battles, but which would provide more ease of learning and <b>playability.</b> It provides a balance between tactical nuance and ease of <b>playability,</b> in order to provide a game which is more accessible for newer gamers, or those with limited time constraints.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{demands on}} {{capabilities}} of instruments and {{players in the}} 19th century—particularly larger concert halls requiring greater volume {{and the rise of}} virtuoso composer-performers—spurred further refinement. Increased sophistication, both in manufacturing techniques and acoustical knowledge, made possible great improvements in the instrument's <b>playability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whether a game {{is solved}} is not {{necessarily}} the same as whether it remains interesting for humans to play. Even a strongly solved game can still be interesting if its solution is too complex to be memorized; conversely, a weakly solved game may lose its attraction if the winning strategy is simple enough to remember (e.g. Maharajah and the Sepoys). An ultra-weak solution (e.g. Chomp or Hex on a sufficiently large board) generally does not affect <b>playability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The reboot {{launched}} in January 2015 {{to a positive}} response from toy critics and fans of the original Bionicle franchise, who praised the <b>playability</b> of the new sets and the inspiration taken from the theme's first toy waves. The sets themselves utilized the CBBS taken from Hero Factory. The Bionicle website was also relaunched with material detailing the new story. Despite a plan to release new sets through to at least 2017, Lego discontinued Bionicle yet again {{after the release of}} their Summer 2016 wave of sets.|$|E
25|$|Since her debut, Chun-Li {{has become}} a {{mainstay}} of the franchise {{and one of its}} most popular figures, appearing in nearly all subsequent installments of the series and several Capcom spinoff games, in addition to featuring prominently in Street Fighter-related media such as two feature films, multiple anime and comic book productions, and other official series merchandise. She has earned much positive fan and critical reception for factors such as her backstory, athleticism, and in-game <b>playability,</b> in addition to being considered a trailblazer for female characters in fighting titles and in general video gaming.|$|E
25|$|Russia {{has hosted}} {{international}} fixtures {{at a number}} of venues around the country. These include the rugby hotbed of Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, where the national side played its first full test against a foundation union, versus Ireland in 2002. Other games have been played in Moscow, normally at Slava Stadium in the city centre, Penza, and most recently at the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Sochi was selected as a case of convenience, as climatic conditions in other venues have proved too severe to guarantee <b>playability</b> during the ENC's February–March window. Support in Sochi is minimal and it is hoped that the completion of a stadium for the VVA-Podmoskovye club in Monino, Moscow region, with full undersoil heating will allow international fixtures to be played closer to Russian rugby's support bases. Sports Minister Vitaliy Mutko has promised this will be completed by 2013.|$|E
25|$|TSA rules {{state that}} the range-jumping generals cannot capture an equal or higher-ranking piece, not just that they cannot jump over them. This gives a huge {{advantage}} to Black, so that Black can win every game if played right, but is not supported by Japanese articles on tenjiku shogi and has been largely abandoned in the West as unplayable. This {{is due to the}} very terse wording of the historical documents, that do not make it clear if the capture of an equal or higher-ranking piece is allowed even if such a piece cannot be jumped over. The presence of the king in the hierarchy suggested the TSA rules, since the king cannot jump-capture at all, and in any situation where the enemy king could be jumped over it would not happen in practice as it would simply be captured. Due to the resulting <b>playability</b> problem, it was suggested that capturing would be allowed but not jumping, but this allowed for smothered mates in the opening and again gives a huge advantage to Black. However, the rule used in this article and The Chess Variant Pages, which allows the capture of equal or higher-ranking pieces except kings or princes, removes this advantage to Black.|$|E
25|$|Croteam used {{an array}} of {{automated}} and in-place tools to help rapidly design, debug, and test the game for <b>playability.</b> In one aspect, they recognized {{in the development of}} a puzzle game was that while puzzles could be designed with specific solutions, the process of creating the video game around the puzzle could create unsolvable situations or unforeseen shortcuts. To address this, they used a bot, developed by Croteam member Nathan Brown who had previously developed bots for other games including the ones incorporated into ports of Serious Sam 3 for consoles. The bot, named Bot, would watch the playthrough of a puzzle by a human player in terms of broad actions such as placing boxes on a switch for the completion of a puzzle. Then, as the puzzle's environment was tuned and decorated, they would have Bot attempt to solve the puzzle, testing to make sure it did not run into any dead-ends. If it did encounter any, Bot reported these through an in-house bug reporting system and then used game cheats to move on and finish out testing, which took between 30 and 60 minutes for the full game. As such, they were able to quickly iterate and resolve such problems when new features were introduced to the game. Overall, Croteam estimates they logged about 15,000 hours with Bot before the release of the public test version, and expect to use similar techniques in future games. They also used human playtesters to validate other more aesthetic factors of the games prior to the title's release.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{revolution}} {{came in the}} mid-to-late 1990s, which saw the rise of 3D computer graphics and optical discs in fifth generation consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous—longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which {{is considered one of}} the most influential games of all time, akin to that of Star Wars in the movie industry. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million, the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its more expansive world to explore, much longer quest, more numerous sidequests, dozens of minigames, and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay, effectively integrated throughout the game. Gameplay innovations included the materia system, which allowed a considerable amount of customization and flexibility through materia that can be combined in many different ways and exchanged between characters at any time, and the limit breaks, special attacks that can be performed after a character's limit meter fills up by taking hits from opponents. The materia system is similar to, but more sophisticated than, the slotted item system in Diablo II (2000). Final Fantasy VII continues to be listed among the best games of all time, for its highly polished gameplay, high <b>playability,</b> lavish production, well-developed characters, intricate storyline, and an emotionally engaging narrative that is much darker and sophisticated than most other RPGs. The game's storytelling and character development was considered a major narrative jump forward for video games and was often compared to films and novels at the time.|$|E
500|$|ZX Computing {{praised the}} game's <b>playability</b> and replay-value, stating that Jetpac was [...] "a very well put {{together}} piece of software". The game was {{number one in}} the first Spectrum sales chart published by CVG.|$|E
500|$|The <b>playability</b> and [...] "life-span" [...] of {{the game}} also gained mixed views. Rignall praised the game's <b>playability</b> and [...] "lastability", stating that the game is [...] "easy to get into" [...] and was addictive. Regarding its replay value, Rignall {{asserted}} that {{the large number of}} levels in the game would keep the player occupied and provided an [...] "enjoyable challenge". Jarrett stated the game requires [...] "a lot of patience" [...] and found certain aspects of it frustrating at times, especially the time limit required to progress to the next level. Jarrett also noted the number of levels to be [...] "excessive", and stated that he suspected [...] "players may not want to dig that deep".|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release. Richard Blaine of Your Sinclair praised the game's <b>playability</b> and value for money, stating {{that it provides}} an [...] "interesting challenge". Philippa Irving of Crash, however, criticised the <b>playability</b> and tank mechanics as [...] "stunningly badly designed" [...] and [...] "unplayable", whilst also stating that it was [...] "rather unatmospheric". Gary Rook of Sinclair User summarised that Tobruk was [...] "pretty disappointing" [...] and [...] "nowhere near as successful" [...] as its direct predecessor, Bismarck. Rook criticised the interface of the game as [...] "clumsily" [...] executed and not [...] "half as good" [...] as that of other strategy games {{at the time of}} release. Regarding the arcade sequences of the game, Michael Sandford of ZX Computing recommended any player to avoid them, as its difficulty would affect gameplay. However, Sandford praised the overall experience of the game, stating that it was [...] "one of the best" [...] wargames and endorsed it to anybody interested in the genre.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} of ZX Computing {{praised the}} game's difficulty, {{suggesting that it}} was [...] "recommended" [...] for advanced gamers in the wargame genre. Irving criticised the game's value for money and <b>playability,</b> stating that £12.95 was [...] "a lot" [...] of {{money to spend on}} a game that the player would most likely dislike. However, Rook heralded the gameplay as [...] "smooth" [...] and [...] "challenging", contrary to other critics.|$|E
500|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament {{was well}} received. Critics were {{impressed}} with the J-Cart and the extra tracks and vehicles. Mark Patterson of Computer and Video Games praised the Mega Drive version's J-Cart enabling more than two players without extra hardware, and described the game as [...] "bloody brilliant!". Edge reviewer commented that the extra vehicles, tracks, and game modes increase re-playability of both single-player and multiplayer. The reviewers of GamesMaster lauded its addictiveness and commented that it is amongst the best or highest-rated games they have played. A reviewer from Mean Machines Sega believed the game exceeded their expectations, and echoed other opinions by praising the re-playability provided by the extra levels and vehicles. [...] reviewer eulogised the animation, saying it lacks slowdown, and <b>playability.</b> Reviewers from Sega Magazine were highly positive: Richard Leadbetter and Tom Guise lauded the multiplayer mode, saying it is [...] "untouchable". The <b>playability</b> were also given high praise, and was described as [...] "superb". Leadbetter believed the game is [...] "totally brilliant and well worth the asking price".|$|E
500|$|Most clarinetists buy {{manufactured}} reeds, {{although many}} make adjustments to these reeds, and some {{make their own}} reeds from cane [...] "blanks". Reeds come in varying degrees of hardness, generally indicated {{on a scale from}} one (soft) through five (hard). This numbering system is not standardized—reeds with the same number often vary in hardness across manufacturers and models. Reed and mouthpiece characteristics work together to determine ease of <b>playability,</b> pitch stability, and tonal characteristics.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Sinclair User {{stated that}} the graphics were of [...] "arcade and cartoon" [...] quality, and criticised the game's concept, suggesting that the player would lose interest after completing a few levels. Mangham, however, praised its <b>playability,</b> heralding that it was [...] "great fun" [...] to play and easy to adapt to. Sinclair User opined that first impressions of the game were important to the customer, and {{stated that the}} player may feel cheated due to the game's similarities to Pssst.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} written by Chris Stamper and {{graphics}} were designed by Tim Stamper. Jetpac {{was one of the}} very few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing [...] "instantaneous" [...] loading of the game when the normal method of cassette loading took minutes. The game was met with critical acclaim upon release, with reviewers praising the game's presentation and <b>playability.</b> It later won the [...] "Game of the Year" [...] title at the Golden Joystick Awards in 1983.|$|E
500|$|Two reviewers of Mean Machines {{praised the}} sprites and {{background}} drops, calling both [...] "cleverly animated" [...] and [...] "atmospheric". However, the other reviewer criticised the game's hard difficulty. Robert Swan of Computer and Video Games criticised the <b>playability</b> of the ZX Spectrum version, calling it [...] "less playable" [...] {{due to its}} presentation in monochrome and hard difficulty. Reviewing the GX4000 port, Swann praised the [...] "colourful" [...] graphics, but expressed scepticism over the difficulty. Fielder also praised the game's soundtrack as [...] "mystifying".|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, an in-browser HTML5 {{version of}} Angry Birds was {{released}} in beta form. The game uses WebGL or Canvas and is distributed through the Chrome Web Store for use with Google's Chrome web browser. It runs on any WebGL- or Canvas-enabled browser, and features exclusive content when played on Chrome, such as exclusive levels and the so-called [...] "Chrome Bombs". The version includes offline <b>playability</b> and features 60 FPS gameplay with a selection of graphics settings to accommodate a variety of hardware capabilities.|$|E
500|$|Mark Reed of Computer Gamer {{asserted}} that Tobruk was [...] "undoubtedly {{one of the}} most enjoyable wargames ever" [...] and heralded its originality and <b>playability.</b> Irving, however, criticised its authenticity; stating that the game was lacking in both [...] "elusive quality" [...] and atmosphere. Rook found that the developers' intention of attempting to [...] "marry strategy gaming with arcade gaming" [...] was unsuccessful and produced negative results. A 1993 Computer Gaming World survey of wargames agreed while giving the game one-plus stars out of five, stating that [...] "the simulation and arcade aspects denigrate each other's appeal".|$|E
500|$|During development, the {{developers}} obtained extensive information and statistics of military strength from the Ministry of Defence and the Soviet embassy in London. Theatre Europe gained national controversy upon release, receiving criticism {{from both the}} Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and The Sun newspaper. Some high street retail chains refused to sell the game upon release. Despite the controversy, the game received critical acclaim from reviewers. Praise was directed at its accuracy, <b>playability</b> and value for money. It won the [...] "Best Strategy Game" [...] award at the 1985 Golden Joystick Awards and was nominated for the [...] "Game of the Year" [...] title.|$|E
500|$|Logg modeled the player's ship, the five-button control scheme, and {{the game}} physics after Spacewar!, which he had played {{as a student at}} the University of California, Berkeley, but made several changes to improve <b>playability.</b> The ship was {{programmed}} into the hardware and rendered by the monitor, and was configured to move with thrust and inertia. The hyperspace button was not placed near Logg's right thumb, which he was dissatisfied with, as he had a problem [...] "tak his hand off the thrust button". Drawings of asteroids in various shapes were incorporated into the game. Logg copied the idea of a high score table with initials from Exidy's Star Fire.|$|E
500|$|Other {{versions}} {{were also}} well received. Reviewing the NES version, [...] praised the scrolling and controls. GamePro reviewer {{stated that the}} racing scenario variety and the vehicles being based on Galoob's Micro Machines toys made the game original. Mean Machines reviewer liked the presentation and <b>playability,</b> but described the sprites as [...] "inconsistent". In {{a review of the}} SNES version, GamePro lauded the [...] "cartoony" [...] graphics and [...] "cheerful" [...] sound effects, along with the lack of car customisation to keep the gameplay [...] "basic". Coming Soon Magazine's reviewer criticised the PC version's [...] "simple" [...] graphics, but thought highly of its addictiveness and [...] "well-produced" [...] animation.|$|E
