5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve <b>Paul</b> <b>Volcker</b> {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|Monetarism {{attracted}} the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the Phillips curve performed better during stagflation and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in macroeconomics, and by the late-1970s central banks in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a monetarist policy of targeting money supply instead of interest rates when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for central banks because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when <b>Paul</b> <b>Volcker</b> took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the money supply and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity but clearly demonstrated the importance of money supply in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied monetarist predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. Monetarist methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and method of analysis lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in money supply cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.|$|E

5000|$|In {{economic}} [...] "expectations models" [...] of inflation, peoples' {{expectations of}} future inflation {{lead them to}} spend more today and demand higher nominal interest rates for any savings, since they expect that prices will be rising.

25|$|On {{a broader}} front, the economy {{initially}} recovered {{at a brisk}} pace from the 1973–75 recession. Incoming president Jimmy Carter instituted a large fiscal stimulus package in 1977 in order to boost the economy. However, inflation began a steep rise beginning in late 1978, and rose by double digits following the 1979 energy crisis. In order to combat inflation, Carter appointed <b>Paul</b> <b>Volcker</b> to the Federal Reserve, who raised interest rates and caused a sharp recession {{in the first six}} months of 1980. In March 1980, Carter introduced his own policies for reducing inflation, and the Federal Reserve brought down interest rates to cooperate with the initiatives.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Reagan administration, the United States economy {{experienced}} {{a decade of}} rising unemployment and inflation (known as stagflation).

Much {{of the credit for}} the resolution of stagflation is given to two causes: a three-year contraction of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board under <b>Paul</b> <b>Volcker,</b> initiated {{in the last year of}} Jimmy Carter's presidency, and long-term easing of supply and pricing in oil during the 1980s oil glut.|$|E
