40|$|Telegraphy {{originated}} in the 1830 s and 40 s and flourished in the following decades, but with a patchwork of electrical standards. Electromotive force was {{for the most part}} measured in units of the predominant Daniell cell. Each company had their own resistance standard. In 1862 the British Association for the Advancement of Science formed a committee to address this situation. By 1873 they had given definition to the electromagnetic system of units (emu) and defined the practical units of the ohm as ${ 10 }^ 9 $ emu units of resistance and the volt as ${ 10 }^ 8 $ emu units of electromotive force. These recommendations were ratified and expanded upon in a series of international congresses held between 1881 and 1904. A proposal by Giovanni Giorgi in 1901 took advantage of a coincidence between the conversion of the units of energy in the emu system (the erg) and in the practical system (the joule) in that the same conversion factor existed between the cgs based emu system and a theretofore undefined MKS system. By introducing another unit, X (where X could be any of the <b>practical</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>units),</b> Giorgi demonstrated that a self consistent MKSX system was tenable without the need for multiplying factors. Ultimately the ampere was selected as the fourth unit. It took nearly 60 years, but in 1960 Giorgi's proposal was incorporated as the core of the newly inaugurated International System of Units (SI). This article surveys the physics, physicists and events that contributed to those developments. Comment: 7 pages, 1 table.

5000|$|The only {{significant}} international {{use of the}} meridional definition of the metre, apart from Méchain and Delambre's original survey, was the initial work conducted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (B.A.) on <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> which was {{to lead to the}} International System of <b>Electrical</b> and Magnetic <b>Units.</b> It was often claimed that the international <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> formed a coherent set of absolute units in the quadrant-eleventh-gram-second system (aka [...] "QES system" [...] or [...] "Q.E.S. system"), where the unit length was the quadrant of the Earth's polar circumference, the unit mass was the [...] "eleventh-gram" [...] or 10−11 grams and the unit time was the second.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the numerical}} {{value of the}} Planck constant depends on the system of units used to describe it. Its value in SI units is known to 12 parts per billion but its value in atomic units is known exactly, {{because of the way}} the scale of atomic units is defined. The same is true of conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>units,</b> where the Planck constant (denoted h90 to distinguish it from its value in SI units) is given bywith KJ-90 and RK-90 being exactly defined constants. Atomic <b>units</b> and conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> are very useful in their respective fields, because the uncertainty in the final result does not depend on an uncertain conversion factor, only on the uncertainty of the measurement itself.|$|R

2500|$|In 1861, during {{discussions about}} standardising <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> of measure, Charles Bright and Latimer Clark {{proposed}} the units of measure be named, not {{in relation to}} what they are used for, or common objects, but after eminent scientists; with the <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> of resistance, potential difference and capacitance being named the ohm, volt and farad in honour of Georg Ohm, Alessandro Volta and Michael Faraday respectively. [...] This proposal {{had the support of}} William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who had been instrumental in forming the Committee of Electrical Standards of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The use of scientists' names for the naming of units of measure was subsequently extended for other units including the watt named after James Watt and the degree Celsius named after Anders Celsius.|$|R
50|$|In 1901 Giorgi {{published}} {{a proposal for}} building a coherent set of units based on four base units - the metre, kilogram, second and one <b>electrical</b> <b>unit</b> (ampere, volt or ohm). In 1921 the Convention was extended to permit the promotion of standards relating to any physical quantity which greatly increased {{the scope of the}} CIPM's remit and implicitly giving it freedom to exploit Giorgi's proposals. The 8th CGPM (1933) resolved to work with other international bodies to agree standards for <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> that could be related back to the international prototypes. This was agreed in principle by the International Electrotechnical Commission at its congress in Brussels in 1935 subject to the choice of the fourth unit being agreed with, amongst others, the appropriate consultative committee of the CIPM.|$|R
