50|$|The {{skull of}} Sinornithoides is {{elongated}} and pointed. However, {{the head is}} relatively short compared to the body as a whole. The praemaxilla is short. There is a fenestra promaxillaris, a small opening {{in the front of}} the maxilla side, which is rare among troodontids. There are four premaxillary and about twenty-three maxillary teeth. The maxillary teeth have no serrations on their front edge; the denticles on the concavely curved rear edge are small. The maxillary teeth are rather recurved. The lacrimal bone lacks a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>channel.</b> In the braincase the subotic recess is large. The tips of the lower jaws do not curve towards each other but touch at their inner sides. The external mandibular fenestra is large. The dentary, lower jaw, teeth are quite pointed and have no front edge denticles; their rear edge is very straight. The holotype preserves a furcula and a basket of fifteen pairs of gastralia. The arms are weakly developed, with a slender humerus and ulna. The front top of the third metatarsal is not fully overgrown by the second and fourth metatarsals. The sickle claw of the second toe is relatively large and long for a troodontid.|$|E

40|$|The powered-lift Channel Wing {{concept has}} been {{combined}} with pneumatic Circulation Control aerodynamic and propulsive technology {{to generate a}} <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Channel</b> Wing (PCW) configuration intended to have Super-STOL or VSTOL capability while eliminating many of the operational problem areas of the original Channel Wing vehicle. Wind-tunnel development and evaluations of a PCW powered model conducted at Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) have shown substantial lift capabilities for the blown configuration (CL values of 10 to 11). Variation in blowing of the channel was shown to be more efficient than variation in propeller thrust in terms of lift generation. Also revealed was the ability to operate unstalled at very high angles of attack of 40 deg - 45 deg, or to achieve very high lift at much lower angle of attack to increase visibility and controllability. In order to provide greater flexibility in Super-STOL takeoffs and landings, the blown model also displayed the ability to interchange thrust and drag by varying blowing without any moving parts. A preliminary design study of this pneumatic vehicle based on the two technologies integrated into a simple <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Channel</b> Wing configuration showed very strong Super-STOL potential. This paper presents these experimental results, discusses variations in the configuration geometry under development, and addresses additional considerations to extend this integrated technology to advanced design studies of PCW-type vehicles...|$|E

The QCEE allows for the automatic interconnection of up to three independent <b>pneumatic</b> <b>channels</b> for gripper actuation.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. In this paper a common design for soft {{actuators}} with internal pneumatic networks is analysed {{for the application}} of passively compliant soft gripper fingers, which can effectively grasp complex and delicate objects. The behaviour of a soft finger upon actuation is primarily determined through its predefined morphology. Hence, understanding the effects of key design parameters on the desired bending response is essential to design improved soft fingers. An experiment was designed to analyse the effects of two dimensionless design parameters defining the geometry of the internal <b>pneumatic</b> <b>channels,</b> on measurable parameters that describe the bending response of soft fingers as well as the generated contact forces. Soft finger samples were designed and produced based on combinations of different levels of the studied parameters, with the same outer dimensions and material. The experiment setup utilises a pneumatic control board for controlling the actuation and a vision system for measuring the bending response, which can be modified to analyse other designs of soft actuators. The results of the experiment identified the best performing soft finger design, explaining the effect of the studied factors in enhancing its desired response. The outcome of this work serves as a step towards a more structured design guideline that can be followed to create soft fingers with an enhanced and more predictable grasping behaviour...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} assembly issues {{encountered in}} optical and fluidic microsystem applications. In optics, the first subject concerns the active alignment of components in optical fibersystems. A solution {{for reducing the}} cost of optical component assembly while retaining submicron accuracy is to integrate the alignment mechanism onto the optical substrate. A polymer V-shaped actuator is presented that can carry {{the weight of the}} large components - on a micromechanical scale - and that can generate movement with six degrees of freedom. The second subject in optics is the CMOS-compatible fabrication of monocrystalline silicon micromirror arrays that are intended to serve as CMOS-controlled high-quality spatial light modulators in maskless microlithography systems. A wafer-level assembly method is presented that is based on adhesive wafer bonding whereby a monocrystalline layer is transferred onto a substrate wafer in a CMOS-compatible process without needing bond alignment. In fluidics, a hybrid assembly method is introduced that combines two separately micromachined structures to create hotwire anemometers that protrude from a surface with minimum interference with the air flow. The assembled sensor enables one to make accurate time-resolved measurements of the wall shear stress, a quantity that has previously been hard to measure with high time resolution. Also in the field of hotwire anemometers, a method using a hotwire anemometer array is presented for measuring the mass flow, temperature and composition of a gas in a duct. In biochemistry, a bio-analysis chip is presented. Single nucleotide polymorphism scoring is performed using dynamic allele-specific hybridization (DASH). Using monolayers of beads, multiplexing based on single-bead analysis is achieved at heating rates more than 20 times faster than conventional DASH provides. Space and material eÂ±ciency in packaging are the focus of the other two projects in fluidics. The first introduces an assembly based on layering conductive adhesives for the fabrication of miniature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. The fuel cells made with this low-cost approach perform among the best of their type to date. The second project concerns a new cross-flow microvalve concept. Intended as a step towards the mass production of large-flow I/P converters, the silicon footprint area is minimized by an out-of-plane moving gate and in-plane, half-open <b>pneumatic</b> <b>channels.</b> QC 2010101...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{introduce}} a new, instrument controlled valving scheme for the centrifugal platform {{which is based}} upon dissolvable film (DF) technology. Liquid, restrained at any point upon the disc, is prevented from wetting a DF via a trapped gas pocket. From this pocket a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>channel</b> runs to a sealed vent located on the top surface of the disc. Controlled scouring of this seal by a robotic knifecutter permits venting of the trapped gas, and thus actuation of the valve. To demonstrate the potential of these valves, we present a disc developed towards a biplex liver assay panel...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{pneumatically}} actuated silicone module, resembling soft tissue, with three pneumatic chambers is considered and optimized in this study {{with the aim of}} using it in a soft robot arm for robotic surgery applications. Three types of silicone materials, Ecoflex 0030 and 0050 and Dragonskin 0030, have been investigated, and a constitutive model has been derived for each of them. Design optimization of the silicone module was based on finite element analysis (FEA) that was validated against experimental data of one-degree bending under one-channel actuation. This was followed by FEA parametric studies for module design optimization to minimize the ballooning effect in one-degree bending as well as reduce the actuation pressure. Modules made from Ecoflex 0030 and Ecoflex 0050 exhibited the same bending shape in FEA, but about three times higher actuation pressure was required for the harder Ecoflex 0050. Design parameters under investigation in the parametric FEA studies included the shape of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>channel</b> cross section, the ratio of channel length to module length, the distance of channel from the module wall, and the ratio of channel to module cross-sectional area. After FEA design optimization yielded least ballooning for pneumatic chambers of semicircular cross section, an internal dragonskin structure was added internally below the module surface to enable and guide the bending under one-channel pneumatic actuation and further contain the ballooning effect: the benefits of this design were successfully verified under both FEA and experimental analysis...|$|E
40|$|Microtubules {{driven by}} kinesin motors have been {{utilised}} as "molecular shuttles" in microfluidic environments with potential applications in autonomous nanoscale manipulations such as capturing, separating, and/or concentrating biomolecules. However, the conventional flow cell-based assay has difficulty in separating bound target molecules from free ones even with buffer flushing because molecular manipulations by molecular shuttles {{take place on}} a glass surface and molecular binding occurs stochastically; this {{makes it difficult to}} determine whether molecules are carried by molecular shuttles or by diffusion. To address this issue, we developed a microtubule-based transport system between two compartments connected by a single-micrometre-scale channel array that forms dynamically via pneumatic actuation of a polydimethylsiloxane membrane. The device comprises three layers - a control channel layer (top), a microfluidic channel layer (middle), and a channel array layer (bottom) - that enable selective injection of assay solutions into a target compartment and dynamic formation of the microchannel array. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>channel</b> also serves as a nitrogen supply path to the assay area, which reduces photobleaching of fluorescently labelled microtubules and deactivation of kinesin by oxygen radicals. The channel array suppresses cross-contamination of molecules caused by diffusion or pressure-driven flow between compartments, facilitating unidirectional transport of molecular shuttles from one compartment to another. The method demonstrates, for the first time, efficient and unidirectional microtubule transport by eliminating diffusion of target molecules on a chip and thus may constitute one of the key aspects of motor-driven nanosystems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{examine the}} {{longitudinal}} migratory force required to cause disconnection of the bifurcated distal body component from the tubular proximal {{body of a}} fenestrated stent-graft. MethodsUsing a previously reported mathematical model distal distraction forces were calculated prior to performing inÂ vitro pullout testing. The top end of the proximal body and the iliac limbs of the distal body were attached to the grips of a tensile tester via plastic sealing plugs and <b>pneumatic</b> clamps. <b>Channels</b> within the plugs allowed pressurisation of {{the inside of the}} stent-graft. Pullout tests were conducted in the vertical plane. Force and displacement data were recorded and tests repeated 8 times at room temperature with the stent-grafts either dry or wet and unpressurized, at 100 Â mmHg or at 120 Â mmHg. ResultsThe median maximum pullout force was 2. 9 Â N (2. 6 â 4. 1) when dry, 3. 9 Â N (3. 5 â 5. 4) when wet and unpressurized, 6. 3 Â N (4. 8 â 8. 3) when wet and pressurized at 100 Â mmHg and 6. 5 Â N (4. 8 â 7. 2) when wet and pressurized at 120 Â mmHg. There was a significant difference between pressurized and unpressurized conditions (PÂ <Â  0. 01). ConclusionsThe force required to distract the distal bifurcated component of a fenestrated stent graft is much lower than the reported proximal fixation strength of both a standard and fenestrated Zenith stent graft. Although this helps protect the fenestrated proximal body from the effects of longitudinal migration forces inÂ vivo the current strength of the body overlap zone may actually be unnecessarily weak and requires careful surveillance in follow up...|$|R
30|$|Many {{studies of}} on-chip microvalves have been {{previously}} reported. Electrostatic microvalves can be fabricated by silicon-based micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) processes and easily integrated into microfluidic chips [9]â[11]. For single cell applications, however, they have possibility of mechanical damage to cells {{passing through the}} valve {{because they have a}} solid and complex mechanical structure associated with the microfluidic <b>channel.</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> microvalves can be fabricated from soft materials such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and can reduce mechanical damage to cells [12]â[14]. However, each microvalve requires independent gas pressure control. This makes the whole system complex, {{and it is difficult to}} integrate many pneumatic microvalves into one chip. Magnetic microvalves can also be fabricated from soft materials. They are actuated by permanent magnets or electromagnets [15]â[18]. It is difficult to integrate many magnetic microvalves into one chip because the magnetic fields interfere with each other. Gel microvalves based on the thermoresponsive gels mixed with a solution in microfluidic channels are also reported such as poly(ethylene oxide)x-poly(propylene oxide)y-poly(ethylene oxide)x and Poly-(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) [19]â[26]. For example, by using the combination of the gel mixed solution and microelectrodes on the substrate of the microchannel, we can expect high-speed response of gel microvalves within several tens milliseconds [19],[24],[25]. These thermo-responsive gels are biocompatible material. The soft structure of such valves protects cells from mechanical damage [26]. Moreover, these valves can be actuated by local heating of the channel by microheaters or laser irradiation. The actuation mechanism is quite simple and can be easily integrated into a chip. However, conventional gel microvalves require mixing of thermoresponsive polymer into the culture medium.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new membrane-based {{pneumatic}} micropump with new serpentine-shape (S-shape) pneumatic channels intended for achieving high-throughput pumping in a microfluidic system {{at a relatively}} low pumping rate and a board flow rate range. The key feature of this design {{is the ability to}} modulate the pumping rates by fine-tuning the fluidic resistance of injected compressed air in the designed pneumatic microchannels and the chambers of the micropump. In the study, several S-shape pneumatic micropumps with various layouts were designed and fabricated based on thick-film photoresist lithography and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replication processes. To investigate designs with a suitable pumping performance, S-shape pneumatic micropumps with varied lengths (1000, 5000 and 10 000 Î½m), varied widths (20, 40 and 200 Î½m) of the pneumatic microchannel bridging two rectangular pneumatic chambers, and different numbers of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>channel</b> bends (two and four U-shape bends) were designed and evaluated experimentally by using high-speed CCD-coupled microscopic observation of the movement of PDMS membrane pulsation and pumping rate measurements. The results revealed that under the experimental conditions studied, the layout of the S-shape pneumatic micropump with three rectangular pneumatic chambers, 5000 Î½m long and 40 Î½m wide pneumatic microchannel and four U-shape bends in the pneumatic microchannel was found to be capable of providing a broader pumping rate range from 0 to 539 Î½l h- 1 compared to the other designs. As a whole, the experimental results demonstrate the use of fluidic resistance of injected air in a pneumatic micropump with S-shape layout to control its pumping performance, which largely expands the flexibility of its pumping application in a microfluidic system.
