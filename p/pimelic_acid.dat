40|$|A {{family of}} 4 -hydroxybenzamide-dicarboxylic acid cocrystals has been {{designed}} and subsequently isolated and characterized. The design strategy follows from an understanding of synthon modularity in crystal structures of monocomponent crystals such as gamma-quinol, 4, 4 '-biphenol and 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid. These monocomponent structures contain infinite O-H center dot center dot center dot O-H center dot center dot center dot O-H center dot center dot center dot cooperative synthons linked with molecular connectors such as phenyl and biphenyl, and supramolecular connectors such as the acid dimer in 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid.

Effectively, the acid-amide and phenol synthons are insulated. The short axis of such a structure will be around 5. 12 angstrom and this is borne out in 2 : 1 cocrystals of 4 -hydroxybenzamide with oxalic, succinic, fumaric, glutaric (two forms) and <b>pimelic</b> <b>acids.</b> Hydrated variations of this structure type are seen in the cocrystals obtained with adipic and sebacic acids...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} and drug release behavior were studied for three biodegradable polyester matrices (polycaprolactone, poly(nonamethylene azelate) and the copolymer derived from 1, 9 -nonanediol and an equimolar mixture of azelaic and <b>pimelic</b> <b>acids)</b> reinforced with polylactide (PLA) fibers. Electrospinning {{was used to}} produce suitable mats constituted by fibers of different diameters (i. e. from micro- to nanoscale) and a homogeneous dispersion of a representative hydrophobic drug (i. e. triclosan). Fabrics were prepared by a molding process, which allowed cold crystallization of PLA micro/nanofibers and hot crystallization of the polyester matrices. The orientation of PLA molecules during electrospinning favored the crystallization process, which was slightly enhanced when the diameter decreased. Incorporation of PLA micro/nanofibers led to {{a significant increase in}} the elastic modulus and tensile strength, and in general to a decrease in the strain at break. The brittle fracture was clearer when high molecular weight samples with high plastic deformation were employed. Large differences in the release behavior were detected depending on the loading process, fiber diameter size and hydrophobicity of the polyester matrix. The release of samples with the drug only loaded into the reinforcing fibers was initially fast and then became slow and sustained, resulting in longer lasting antimicrobial activity. Biocompatibility of all samples studied was demonstrated by adhesion and proliferation assays using HEp- 2 cell cultures...|$|R
40|$|The {{adipic acid}} {{complexes}} of DL-arginine and L-arginine {{are made up}} of zwitterionic, singularly positively charged arginium ions and doubly negatively charged adipate ions, with a 2 : 1 stoichiometry. One of the two crystallographically independent arginium ions in the L-arginine complex has a conformation hitherto unobserved in crystal structures containing the amino acid. In the present study the structural data on arginine complexes of saturated dicarboxylic acids with 0 - 5 C atoms separating the two carboxyl functions are given. In terms of molecular aggregation, formic and acetic acid complexes behave in a similar way to those involving fairly long carboxylic acids such as adipic acid. By and large, the supramolecular assembly in complexes involving dicarboxylic acids with 3 or more C atoms separating the carboxyl groups (glutaric, adipic and <b>pimelic</b> <b>acids),</b> and those involving formic and acetic acids, have common features. The aggregation patterns in complexes involving oxalic, malonic and maleic acids do not share striking features among themselves (except for the mode of hydrogen-bonded dimerization of arginium ions) or with those involving larger dicarboxylic acids. Complexes of succinic acid, the shortest linear dicarboxylic acid, share features with those involving shorter as well as longer dicarboxylic acids. The difference in the behaviour of long and short dicarboxylic acids and the ambiguous behaviour of succinic acid can be broadly related to their lengths...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the degradation of lipidic paint binders induced by irradiation with UV light (365 nm), exposure to urban air pollutants such as NOx and SO 2 and combinations of the various treatments. The characterisation of lipidic binders has been performed by a GC-MS procedure on a series of non-pigmented paint specimens prepared at the Opificio delle Pietre Dure-Firenze (Italy) and submitted to accelerated ageing. The results show that UV irradiation and exposure to NOx and SO 2 increased the polymerisation and cross-linking of the paint thus facilitating the cleavage of fatty acid chains as a result of progressed oxidation up to the formation of oxalic acid. The presence of oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, <b>pimelic,</b> OH-octadecenoic <b>acids</b> and cholestenes describes the behaviour of aged paint layers.

Based on the data obtained for these two APIs, further analysis was conducted on budesonide to see if results could be generalised to other compounds.

Chemical analysis of the organic compounds was conducted using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS) for dicarbonyls and long-chain carboxylic acids and ion chromatography for short-chain carboxylates. Long-term records of the carboxylic acids and dicarbonyls, {{as well as their}} source apportionment, are reported for western Europe. This is the first study comprising long-term trends of dicarbonyls and long-chain dicarboxylic acids (C 6 –C 12) in Alpine precipitation. Source assignment of the organic species present in the ice core was performed using principal component analysis. Our results suggest biomass burning, anthropogenic emissions, and transport of mineral dust to be the main parameters influencing the concentration of organic compounds. Ice core records of several highly correlated compounds (e. g., p -hydroxybenzoic <b>acid,</b> pinic <b>acid,</b> <b>pimelic,</b> and suberic <b>acids)</b> can be related to the forest fire history in southern Switzerland. P -hydroxybenzoic acid was found to be the best organic fire tracer in the study area, revealing the highest correlation with the burned area from fires. Historical records of methylglyoxal, phthalic acid, and dicarboxylic acids adipic acid, sebacic acid, and dodecanedioic acid are comparable with that of anthropogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The small organic acids, oxalic acid and formic acid, are both highly correlated with calcium, suggesting their records to be affected by changing mineral dust transport to the drilling site...|$|R

40|$|Two new genes whose {{products}} {{are involved in}} biodegradation of the organic solvent tetralin were identified. These genes, designated thnE and thnF, are located downstream of the previously identified thnD gene and code for a hydratase and an aldolase, respectively. A sequence comparison of enzymes similar to ThnE showed the significant similarity of hydratases involved in biodegradation pathways to 4 -oxalocrotonate decarboxylases and established four separate groups of related enzymes. Consistent with the sequence information, characterization of the reaction catalyzed by ThnE showed that it hydrated a 10 -carbon dicarboxylic acid. The only reaction product detected was the enol tautomer, 2, 4 -dihydroxydec- 2 -ene- 1, 10 -dioic acid. The aldolase ThnF showed significant similarity to aldolases involved in different catabolic pathways whose substrates are dihydroxylated dicarboxylic acids and which yield pyruvate and a semialdehyde. The reaction products of the aldol cleavage reaction catalyzed by ThnF were identified as pyruvate and the seven-carbon <b>acid</b> <b>pimelic</b> semialdehyde. ThnF and similar aldolases showed conservation of the active site residues identified by the crystal structure of 2 -dehydro- 3 -deoxy-galactarate aldolase, a class II aldolase with a novel reaction mechanism, suggesting that these similar enzymes are class II aldolases.

The heterometallic complex [UO 2 Mn(C 7) 2 (phen) 2] (3) is formed in the presence of manganese(II) cations, and it crystallizes as a two-dimensional (2 D) assembly in which manganese dimers display weak antiferromagnetic coupling (J = − 1. 2 cm − 1). Another 2 D network is found in [NH 4] 2 [(UO 2) 2 (C 7) 3]· 2 H 2 O (4), where ammonium cations are generated in situ; in this case, parallel polycatenation of the highly convoluted 2 D layers generates a 3 D lattice.

P. blakesleeanus produces biotin, desthiobiotin, biotin-d-sulfoxide, biocytin, and an unknown biotin vitamer. The latter has been identified as an amino acid by electrophoretic analysis. It is avidin-uncombinable, and does not support the growth of Lactobacillus arabinosus (L. plantarum) or Neurospora crassa...|$|E
40|$|The β-nucleated PP {{with high}} β-PP content was {{prepared}} by a novel supported β-nucleating agent, which was prepared with <b>pimelic</b> <b>acid</b> supported on nano-CaCO 3 as support. The influences {{of the content}} of the support and supported β-nucleating agent, pre-melting temperature (Tmelt) and scan rates on crystallization behavior and melting characteristics, and the β-PP content of β-nucleated PP were determined by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD). The results indicated that the addition of supported β-nucleating agent markedly increased the crystallization temperature (Tc) of PP. Increasing the content of supported β-nucleating agent slightly increased the Tc, but had no influence on the melting temperatures (Tm) of β-nucleated PP. The Tc and Tm of β-nucleated PP decreased slightly with increasing the content of the support nano-CaCO 3. The effects of scan rates and multiple scans with different Tmelt on the crystallization and melting behavior of PP nucleated by supported β-nucleating agent are similar to that of PP nucleated by calcium pimelate (CaHA). The β-PP content above 90 percent was obtained in PP nucleated by supported β-nucleating agent and was not influenced by the content of nano-CaCO 3. The supported β-nucleating agent prepared by supporting <b>pimelic</b> <b>acid</b> on nano-CaCO 3 is a β-nucleating agent with high efficiency and selectivity, and low cost. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|The {{yields of}} exudate were {{enhanced}} by exogenous humic acids, whereas its profile remained unaltered {{in comparison with}} non-treated plants, as shown by 1 H NMR spectra. Conversely, the gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight high resolution mass spectrometry revealed {{a change in the}} molecular distribution of exudate and, in particular, an increase in concentration of compounds related to phenyl propanoids pathway (hydroxycinnamic, cinnamic, and ferulic acid), TCA cycle (malic, succinic, citric, and aconitic acids), amino acids (homoserine, citrulline, aspartic acid), lipids (linoleic acid, caprylic acid, <b>pimelic</b> <b>acid),</b> and carbohydrates (xylolactone, tagatose, sophorose, maltose, glucose- 6 -phosphate, and erythritol).|$|E
