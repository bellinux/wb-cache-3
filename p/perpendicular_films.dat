40|$|Abstract—We have {{investigated}} the magnetic and structural properties of CoCrPt <b>perpendicular</b> <b>films</b> with respect to in situ interdiffusion of CrMn from top layers. We have observed a coercivity of 5700 Oe in the films with a thin CrMn overlayer, which is greater than two {{times larger than the}} similar type of films without a CrMn overlayer. This increment is attributed to the decoupling of grains by diffusion of CrMn from top layer through the grain boundaries.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of dot arrays made of CoPt/Ru <b>perpendicular</b> <b>films</b> (20 nm thickness) were examined {{as a function}} of Pt content. The CoPt dot arrays with a dot size of 140 nm showed a single domain state, after removal of the applied field equal to. decreased from 5. 2 kOe to 3. 0 kOe as the Pt content decreased from 20 at % to 14 at%. The angular dependence of for these dot arrays indicated coherent rotation of the magnetization during nucleation. The effective magnetic anisotropy, including the demagnetizing energy due to the dot shape, e, decreased as the Pt content decreased, resulting in the reduction. The values of the switching volume for nucleation, sw, evaluated from the stabilizing energy barrier 0, were a few percent of the dot volume. The switching diameter for nucleation, sw, increased slightly as the Pt content decreased, which was qualitatively in good agreement with the increase in the exchange length of magnetization. The value of 0 (is the Boltzmann constant and is the absolute temperature) reduced as the Pt content decreased; however, 0 still had a high of 440 even at 14 at % Pt content. We successfully demonstrated the reduction of for CoPt/Ru patterned films on reducing the Pt content, while simultaneously maintaining a high thermal stability.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} techniques for the magnetic characterization of perpendicular recording media. Such measurements made using traditional techniques, {{such as the}} vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and alternating gradient force magnetometer (AGFM), have to be corrected for the sample shape demagnetizing factor, which is often found not to be equal to - 4 p. For measurements other than the simple hysteresis loop, such as remanence curves, this correction {{must be carried out}} in real time and {{we describe}} the method by which this can be achieved and the process for achieving the correct demagnetization of <b>perpendicular</b> <b>films</b> prior to measurements of the isothermal remanent magnetization curve. A further complication is that real perpendicular media have a soft underlayer beneath the recording layer, which swamps and confuses signals from instruments such as VSM or AGFM. Hence, we describe the construction and use of a magnetooptical Kerr effect magnetometer, which does not penetrate significantly into the soft layer and enables the perpendicular layer to be measured independently. We describe the properties of a traditional alloy perpendicular medium and a Co-Pd multilayer system, which in the latter case exhibits multiple switching behavior. We also address the issue of the effect of the soft underlayer on the coupling in similar longitudinal films and find that the presence of the underlayer induces significant additional coupling effects that may well give rise to an increase in noise in recorded signal...|$|E
40|$|Pronounced {{effect of}} under layers on the {{squareness}} and slope T of the perpendicular loops of very thin CoCr films was observed. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that, {{depending on the}} film microstructure, there are two origins on the anomalous shearing of perpendicular loops of Cc-based perpendicular films: the columnar shape anisotropy and the wall-motion-like magnetization reversal process. For films with larger intercolumnar separation, {{the contribution of the}} columnar shape anisotropy to the total demagnetizing factor is mainly responsible for the deshearing of the loops. For continuous <b>perpendicular</b> <b>films,</b> the intergranular exchange coupling controls the magnetization reversal process and the wall-motion-like reversal explains the anomalous shearing of the hysteresis loop. The square and desheared perpendicular loops of very thin CoCr films originated from their strong perpendicular anisotropy and large intergranular nonmagnetic separation. Study of the orientation relationship between the Co-based films and their underlayers suggested that the texture of the very thin CoCr and CoCrTa films is determined by the thermodynamic nature of hcp Co crystal itself {{and the nature of the}} underlayers or substrates on which it grows. Amorphous underlayers provide "neutral" substrate surfaces for. the [0002] self-oriented growth of hcp Co-based films. Hcp Ti and [111] textural fee Pt, Au underlayers favour the [0002] oriented epitaxial growth. [100] or [110] textural bee Cr underlayers favour the [1010] oriented growth. The perpendicular coercivity of a Co-based medium is determined by its crystalline anisotropy and intergranular exchange coupling, and can be largely affected by the morphology of its underlayers. The larger perpendicular coercivity of the CoCrTa films on Ti underlayers was mainly due to the large grain diameter which results in a reduction in the intergranular exchange coupling constant. The difference between the surface and bulk coercivity of the CoCrTa films on Ti underlayers was attributed to the improvement of the crystallographic orientation of the hcp Co crystals and the development of large grains as the film grows thicker, which causes the reduction in the surface intergranular exchange coupling due to large grains as well as large intergranular separation. Co 84 Nb 12 Fe 4 amorphous films were investigated as back-layers for double layer media. Very low coercivity down to 0. 0125 Oe was achieved for films of 10000 Å-thick with a saturation magnetic induction of 11 kG. The thickness dependence of coercivity follows the Neel formula for films thicker than 400 Å. A D 5 o density of 160 KFRPI was achieved for the 2000 Å-thick medium on Pt underlayers using MIG heads of gap length 0. 15 µm. Experimental and theoretical analyses of the read/write processes show both the achieved D 5 o density and the reproduced output level for these media were head field and head-medium spacing limited. Lower medium noise and higher SNR were achieved by the media with Ti underlayers, which supports the intergranular exchange coupling noise theory.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} measurements of magnetic viscosity or time dependence in magnetic thin films {{suitable for use}} as perpendicular recording media. Generally, such effects cannot be measured using conventional magnetometry techniques due {{to the presence of}} a thin (0. 1 m) soft underlayer (SUL) in the media necessary to focus the head field. To achieve our results we have de-veloped an ultrastable MOKE magnetometer, the construction of which is described.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that in thin ferromagnetic film {{with a net}} magnetization <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>film</b> the collinear arrangement of spins is unstable in an in-plane field H smaller than its saturation value H_c.

The noncollinear (stripe) phase is discussed using the technique of the Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons. Some previously unknown results are observed concerning the stripe phase. Evolution is established of the spin arrangement in the noncollinear phase upon the field rotation within the plane.
