2500|$|Tape echoes became commercially {{available}} in the 1950s. An echo machine is the early name for a sound <b>processing</b> <b>device</b> used with electronic instruments to repeat the sound and produce a simulated echo. The device was popular with guitarists and was used by Brian May, Jimmy Page and Syd Barrett among others. One example is the Echoplex which used a tape loop. [...] The length of delay was adjusted by changing {{the distance between the}} tape record and playback heads. [...] Another example is the Roland Space Echo with a record and multiple playback tape heads and a variable tape speed. [...] The time between echo repeats was adjusted by varying the tape speed. [...] The length or intensity of the echo effect was adjusted by changing the amount of echo signal was fed back into the pre-echo signal. [...] Different effects could be created by combining the different playback heads. [...] Some models also included a spring reverb.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{series of}} {{approaches}} {{was designed and}} patented by Leonard R. Kahn. [...] The various Kahn systems removed the hard limit imposed {{by the use of}} the strict log function in the generation of the signal. Earlier Kahn systems utilized various methods to reduce the second-order term through the insertion of a predistortion component. [...] One example of this method was also used to generate one of the Kahn independent-sideband (ISB) AM stereo signals. [...] It was known as the STR-77 exciter method, having been introduced in 1977. [...] Later, the system was further improved by use of an arcsine-based modulator that included a 1-0.52E term in the denominator of the arcsin generator equation. [...] E represents the envelope term; roughly half the modulation term applied to the envelope modulator is utilized to reduce the second-order term of the arcsin [...] "phase"-modulated path; thus reducing the second-order term in the undesired sideband. [...] A multi-loop modulator/demodulator feedback approach was used to generate an accurate arcsin signal. [...] This approach was introduced in 1984 and became known as the STR-84 method. [...] It was sold by Kahn Research Laboratories; later, Kahn Communications, Inc. of NY. [...] An additional audio <b>processing</b> <b>device</b> further improved the sideband structure by selectively applying pre-emphasis to the modulating signals. [...] Since the envelope of all the signals described remains an exact copy of the information applied to the modulator, it can be demodulated without distortion by an envelope detector such as a simple diode. [...] In a practical receiver, some distortion may be present, usually at a low level (in AM broadcast, always below 5%), due to sharp filtering and nonlinear group delay in the IF filters of the receiver, which act to truncate the compatibility sideband – those terms that are not the result of a linear process of simply envelope modulating the signal as would be the case in full-carrier DSB-AM – and rotation of phase of these compatibility terms such that they no longer cancel the quadrature distortion term caused by a first-order SSB term along with the carrier. [...] The small amount of distortion caused by this effect is generally quite low and acceptable.|$|E

40|$|RNA is a {{rich and}} {{versatile}} substrate {{for the construction of}} information <b>processing</b> <b>devices.</b> These devices detect the levels of specified intracellular biomolecules and control cellular behavior accordingly. With few superficial constraints on the identity of the recognized biomolecule or the targeted gene, RNA-based information <b>processing</b> <b>devices</b> can be rapidly implemented toward various applications in medicine and biotechnology. To advance the design and implementation of RNA-based information <b>processing</b> <b>devices,</b> we delineated general design principles and applied these principles to the construction of devices that operate through RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi represents an endogenous enzymatic pathway present in humans and other eukaryotes that mediates targeted gene silencing. The pathway has garnered recent interest as a revolutionary biological research tool and as a targeted therapeutic strategy. While RNAi has left an indelible mark on the scientific community, exerting greater control would advance the applicability and safety of this already impressive gene silencing mechanism. Toward this goal, we engineered ligand control of three types of RNAi effectors in mammalian cells: small interfering (si) RNAs, small hairpin (sh) RNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs). Engineering frameworks enabled facile replacement of the biomolecule sensory and gene targeting domains, thus lending to rapid implementation as biosensors or autonomous control devices. Experimental and computational characterization studies provided a comprehensive understanding of device behavior, thereby facilitating forward design. Naturally-occurring analogs of RNA-based information <b>processing</b> <b>devices</b> are riboswitches. Riboswitches predominantly mediate dynamic feedback in metabolism and share many traits with current examples of engineered information <b>processing</b> <b>devices.</b> Various experimental characterization studies of riboswitches showed that kinetics underlying events such as conformational switching and ligand binding have a substantial impact on device performance, although these factors remain to be comprehensively evaluated or considered when formulating design principles for synthetic riboswitch construction. We explored the contribution of kinetic factors to riboswitch performance in silico, where model predictions matched experimental observations, including results from our ligand-responsive RNAi effectors. From our modeling results, we developed a general set of design principles that guide riboswitch assembly and performance tuning. </p...|$|R
