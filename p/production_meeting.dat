500|$|Director Winrich Kolbe {{had some}} {{ideas about how}} the {{engineering}} set, suggesting {{that it should be}} a dangerous place with the Voyager crew looking down on the engine core. Braga compared the idea to the Foucault pendulum in the rotunda at Griffith Observatory. James' designs were not as elaborate as Kolbe suggested, but together with visual effects supervisor Ronald B. Moore they worked out a means of enabling the director to film from above. They raised the set [...] over a blue screen to enable it to be backlit properly. Kolbe had a further impact on the design of the set; he suggested in a <b>production</b> <b>meeting</b> on February 25 that the change of lighting suggesting by James for the bridge should shift from the Starfleet colors to orange in order to maximise the alien effect. James produced a foamcore model of the Dauntless bridge, to both illustrate the final construction and to enable Kolbe to plan out his camera angles while it was still being built.|$|E
500|$|Ken Kragen chaired a <b>production</b> <b>meeting</b> at a {{bungalow}} off Sunset Boulevard on January 25, 1985. There, Kragen and {{his team}} discussed where the recording sessions with the supergroup of musicians should take place. He stated, [...] "The single most damaging piece of information is where we're doing this. If that shows up anywhere, we've got a chaotic situation that could totally destroy the project. The moment a Prince, a Michael Jackson, a Bob Dylan—I guarantee you!—drives up and sees a mob around that studio, he will never come in." [...] On the same night, Quincy Jones' associate producer and vocal arranger, Tom Bahler, was given the task of matching each solo line with the right voice. Bahler stated, [...] "It's like vocal arranging in a perfect world." [...] Jones disagreed, stating that the task was like [...] "putting a watermelon in a Coke bottle". The following evening, Lionel Richie held a [...] "choreography" [...] session at his home, where it was decided who would stand where.|$|E
500|$|On 14 June 1991, {{the first}} tour <b>{{production}}</b> <b>meeting</b> was held, with Williams, the band, manager Paul McGuinness, artist Catherine Owens, and production managers Steve Iredale and Jake Kennedy in attendance. Williams presented his ideas, {{which included the}} Trabant lighting system and the placement of video monitors all over the stage; both notions were well received. Eno's original idea {{was to have the}} video screens on wheels and constantly in motion, although this was impractical. Williams and the group proposed many ideas that did not make it to the final stage design. One such proposal, dubbed [...] "Motorway Madness", would have placed billboards advertising real products across the stage, similar to their placement beside highways. The idea was intended to be ironic, but was ultimately scrapped out of fear that the band would be accused of selling out. Another proposed idea building a giant doll of an [...] "achtung baby", complete with an inflatable penis that would spray on the audience, but it was deemed too expensive and was abandoned.|$|E

500|$|The Xindi shuttle set {{had been}} {{constructed}} for [...] "", while {{a new set}} was constructed for {{the bridge of the}} Enterprise-J which consisted mostly of a green screen. The future Enterprise was designed by Doug Drexler, who drew the first design only two days prior to the <b>production</b> <b>meeting</b> for the episode. The computer generated model was created in a few hours, and Drexler later said that they would have finished it differently. He imagined that the vessel was so large that there would be universities and entire parks on board, with the turbolifts replaced by short range transporters. More than one design was created, with the final version created with elements from different designs. One of the elements incorporated into the version seen on screen was a reduction {{in the size of the}} warp nacelle supports as Drexler said that he didn't like that they had increased in size. John Eaves also created a number of designs for aquatic Xindi vessels for use in the episode, as well as a rejected design for the superweapon.|$|E
500|$|When {{the novel}} was first published, NASA invited Weir {{to tour the}} Johnson Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. When Scott began {{preparing}} the film, Weir contacted NASA to collaborate on the film. When Scott and producer Mark Huffam had their first <b>production</b> <b>meeting,</b> they called NASA and spoke with its film and television liaison Bert Ulrich. NASA decided to assist the filmmakers with depicting the science and technology in The Martian since it saw potential in promoting space exploration. Key NASA staff members that joined the partnership were James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division, and Dave Lavery, the Program Executive for Solar System Exploration. Scott conversed with Green twice before filming started. Over {{a period of a}} month, NASA answered hundreds of questions—on a weekly basis—on everything from radioisotope systems to the look of potential [...] "habs"—the residences for future Mars astronauts. The questions were answered by Green or passed on to the right expert, and then came back to Scott's team to make their way into the production. The space agency also sent hundreds of files of real images of Mars and images of control centers, down to what the computer screens look like, to the production team. Green arranged a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston for production designer Arthur Max, who met with individual specialists, taking hundreds of photos as he went for eight hours. The production designers created a futuristic, heavily modernized Mission Control as a studio set; Ars Technica described its depiction as [...] "the space agency that we all dream of" [...] and the opposite of the real Johnson Center's appearance as [...] "a run down college campus".|$|E

Afterward, final changes {{were made to the}} script. The final rewrite would take place in a [...] "small, red, poorly ventilated room" [...] until 6:45p.m. Before interviewing his guests, Colbert met with them in the green room and acknowledged that he was playing a character, noting that the persona is [...] "willfully ignorant of what you know and care about" [...] and urging the guest to [...] "honestly disabuse me of what you see as my ignorance." [...] Emily Lazar, a producer for the interview segments, advised guests to talk with Colbert as though he were a [...] "harmless drunk at the next bar stool." [...] Guests would typically take their seats around 7 p.m., when a warm-up comedian (perhaps Jared Logan or Paul Mercurio) delivered jokes. Colbert, out of character, held a brief question and answer session with the audience prior to taping. Taping lasted as long as three hours but usually ended around 9 p.m., at which point the show was edited and sent to Comedy Central for broadcast. As the show was being edited, the staff met one last time to work through details for the next show.|$|E

2500|$|The first <b>production</b> <b>meeting</b> between U2 {{and their}} {{creative}} {{team for the}} Innocence + Experience Tour was held in March 2013. Although Songs of Innocence was still in progress {{at the time and}} did not yet have a title, the autobiographical narrative that would characterise the album was already a driving idea for their tour. The band wanted {{to tell the story of}} their adolescence in Dublin in the 1970s and how they were [...] "trying to figure out how they fit into the often violent and disrupted world outside" [...] their homes. The manifesto for the tour was summarized by two phrases: [...] "I can't change the world, but I can change the world in me", and [...] "I can the change the world, but I can't change the world in me." [...] The first is a lyric from the band's 1981 song [...] "Rejoice" [...] and represents the mindset of a teenage Bono feeling powerless to make a difference in a world plagued by the Troubles, who instead views personal psychological changes as a possibility; the second phrase represents the modern-day realization that the same person could make a difference in the world through philanthropic efforts but still struggle with the complexities of internal change. Devlin said, [...] "The space between these two statements is the territory of the album and of the show." [...] The band intended to stage shows in pairs and alternate the setlist between [...] "innocence" [...] and [...] "experience" [...] motifs night to night. Williams said, [...] "The artfulness in this tour is in the ideas, not the hardware".|$|E

Hex said that during the playing of games and filming she became quite attached to her avatars and wanted to show off what her own character did. Hex says, [...] "We've tried our best on the show to present both sides of the argument in any stories we've done". Bajo explained: [...] "Mondays we finish of reviews, log footage, swap games, read scripts and sub everything after a <b>production</b> <b>meeting,</b> Tuesdays we make GG and GG: Pocket, Wednesdays are GGSP and any green screen stuff, then Hex and I are off to review for the rest of the week, while the gang shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show.
