Dates and times of receiver outages at <b>submerged</b> <b>orifice</b> gates and main entrances are reported in Figure 2. We evaluated the total number of known fishway approaches, entrances, and exits for adult Chinook salmon and steelhead at John Day Dam. Unknown approaches, entrances, and exits resulting from a missed antenna or receiver outages were excluded from the summary as were entrances and exits following a fallback event to account for bias that could result from non-naive fish. Approaches, entrances and exits at John Day Dam were observed for 755 radio-tagged adult Chinook salmon and 415 radio-tagged adult steelhead during 2003. The locatio...|$|R

40|$|Extreme {{rainfall}} events {{associated with}} global warming {{are likely to}} produce {{an increasing number of}} flooding scenarios. A large magnitude of hydrologic events can often result in <b>submerged</b> <b>orifice</b> flow (also called pressure flow) or embankment and bridge overtopping flow, in which the foundation of a bridge is subjected to severe scour at the sediment bed. This phenomenon can cause bridge failure during large floods. However, current laboratory studies have focused on only cases of free-surface flow conditions, and they do not take bridge submergence into account. In this study, abutment scour experiments were carried out in a compound channel to investigate the characteristics of abutment scour in free-surface flow, <b>submerged</b> <b>orifice</b> flow, and overtopping flow cases. Detailed bed contours and three components of velocities and turbulent intensities were measured by acoustic Doppler velocimeters. The results show that the contracted flow around an abutment because of lateral and/or vertical contraction and local turbulent structures at the downstream region of the bridge are the main features of the flow responsible for the maximum scour depth around an abutment. The effects of local turbulent structures on abutment scour are discussed in terms of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles measured {{in a wide range of}} flow contraction ratios. The experimental results showed that maximum abutment scour can be predicted by a suggested single relationship even in different flow types (i. e., free, <b>submerged</b> <b>orifice,</b> and overtopping flow) if the turbulent kinetic energy and discharge under the bridge can be accurately measured.

40|$|A <b>partially</b> <b>submerged</b> {{propeller}} {{theory was}} developed by employing a singularity distribution method. Unsteady pressure doublets and pressure sources represented the blade camber and blade-and-cavity thickness respectively. The induced velocities were derived by reducing the formula to a lifting-line configuration. The free-surface effect was considered by use of the image method. The induced velocities contained the singular integrals of 5 th order, which are usually numerical unstable. An {{effort was made to}} derive numerically stable formulae from these singular equations by applying a method similar to the induction-factor method of Morgan & Wrench (1965) and Lerbs (1952) used for steady-state fully wetted propeller problems. These new formulae are not only applicable to the present <b>partially</b> <b>submerged</b> ventilated propeller problem, but also to general unsteady subcavitating and cavitating propeller problems such as propeller starting-up and non-periodic loading problems. By combining the two-dimensional water entry-and-exit theory of Wang (1979), the thrust and torque coefficients were calculated for representative <b>partially</b> <b>submerged</b> propellers and favourably compared with the experimental data...|$|R
