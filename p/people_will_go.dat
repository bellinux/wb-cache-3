Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country.

Marge, of course, sees straight through Burns and uses Blinky the three-eyed fish to demonstrate his lack of conviction." [...] Phil Rosenthal of the Los Angeles Daily News called the episode a [...] "wonderful stab" [...] at American politics and the [...] "media machine that drives it", and added: [...] "The message is so subtle, the makers of The Simpsons might deny it is there at all for fear of turning off a portion of its audience. Truth is, you {{may very well be}} so busy laughing and taking in the fine details, such as the references to Citizen Kane, to notice." [...] Hal Boedeker of The Miami Herald said the episode took [...] "some well-aimed satirical jabs at American politics and the publics' short attention span. The episode has the wit of the best of All in the Family, and benign mother Marge becomes a force for good, in the Edith Bunker tradition." [...] Virginia Mann of The Record called the episode [...] "terrific", though she believed its social and political [...] "overtones" [...] were more likely to appeal to adults than children. Tom Shales of the Washington Post described the episode as [...] "a bull's-eye political satire".|$|E

Explaining that being from the North of England; the people that the band know [...] "won't take crap" [...] while also stating that the title means that it doesn't matter where you're from (geographically) you can still [...] "get involved" [...] with the band's music. Guitarist Welsh added that the title reflects the UK underground scene and how <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> to see a local band who are their friends and leave before seeing other bands– saying that [...] "that's not the way it should be." [...] In an interview in 2011, Welsh explained that the lyrics on [...] "My Conscience, Your Freedom" [...] are about the government– specifically noting on the line [...] "our coins can pay for the crime."

[...] In that same period, she {{also won the}} demonstration events for wheelchair racing in the 800meter race at the Olympic games. The 800meter event does not require that athletes stay in their lanes after the first turn. [...] For this reason, athletes like Sauvage are required to wear helmets when racing. In 2000, Sauvage won the Olympic demonstration event and was expected to win the Paralympic gold. [...] She was upset by Canadian Chantal Petitclerc. The Australian delegation appealed the result, claiming the race was not fair because another racer, Ireland's Patrice Dockery, was disqualified for leaving her lane too early. The appeal was rejected, because Dockery was too far behind the front runners to impact the results. Sport academics who research the Paralympic Games consider this protest to be pivotal, because it shows the passion of athletes to win and the extent that sports <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> to claim gold. It also highlighted that the rivalries in the sport were real. Petitclerc said of her rivalry with Sauvage that [...] "I dream more about Louise than I do my boyfriend." [...] In 2002, Petitclerc beat Sauvage again at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, where the 800meter event was a full medal event at the games for the first time.
