By exercising media and functional <b>polyvalences,</b> Efrém has been accumulating a number of functions previously distributed separately, as well as incorporating technological innovations in his production process.

Because of the script's <b>polyvalence,</b> transliteration requires certain choices of the transliterating scholar, who must decide {{in the case}} of each sign which of its several possible meanings is intended in the original document. For example, the sign DINGIR in a Hittite text may represent either the Hittite syllable an or may be part of an Akkadian phrase, representing the syllable il, it may be a Sumerogram, representing the original Sumerian meaning, 'god' or the determinative for a deity.

Analyzing his own position in the painting titled The Painter, Roy summarizes Syncretism as an omnivore's passion for the textural integrity of disparate elements in (philosophical) diets and (kinaesthetic) desires, one that simultaneously expands away from the limitations of rote traditionalism to encompass a world of gestures and ideas, summoning in their unitary resurturing another world that is ideal, whole, and free.|$|E
50|$|Many {{elements}} have {{a common}} valence related to {{their position in the}} periodic table, and nowadays this is rationalised by the octet rule.The Greek/Latin numeral prefixes (mono-/uni-, di-/bi-, tri-/ter-, and so on) are used to describe ions in the charge states 1, 2, 3, and so on, respectively. <b>Polyvalence</b> or multivalence refers to species that are not restricted to a specific number of valence bonds. Species with a single charge are univalent (monovalent). For example, the Cs+ cation is a univalent or monovalent cation, whereas the Ca2+ cation is a divalent cation, and the Fe3+ cation is a trivalent cation. Unlike Cs and Ca, Fe can also exist in other charge states, notably 2+ and 4+, and is thus known as a multivalent (polyvalent) ion.|$|E

After the founding Assembly a platform and organizational plan were forged under the working title Projekt 2010-2014.

FK Sarajevo's management at the time, witnessing the association's <b>polyvalence,</b> quickly invited members to join the club's assembly and board, which they did. On 14 July 2012 the new club statute was voted into power, enabling Malaysian businessman, investor and Chairman of Berjaya Group, Vincent Tan, who had earlier been lobbied by Scotiabank director and association member Feđa Kusturica, to buy majority stocks and become de facto owner of the club.|$|E
5000|$|... “Movement {{within the}} study of {{literature}} concerned with {{the study of}} literature as a social system of interactions. The main question {{is what happens to}} literature: it is written, published, distributed, read, censored, imitated, etc. The empirical study of literature originated as a reaction to, and an attempt at, solving the basic problem of hermeneutics; that is, how the validation of literary interpretation can be demonstrated. From reception theory it had already become clear that interpretations are not only tied to the text, but also, and even to a great extent, to the reader — both in terms of the individual and of social conventions. This led to the theory of radical (cognitive) constructivism, based on the thesis that the subject largely construes its empirical world itself. The logical consequence of all this, to be seen in the work of Siegfried J. Schmidt, is the separation of interpretation and the strictly scientific study of literature based on radical constructivism. The literary system of actions is observed from the outside — not experienced — and roughly characterized as depending on two conventions (hypotheses) that are tested continually. These conventions are the aesthetic convention (as opposed to the convention of facts in the daily language of reference) and the <b>polyvalence</b> convention (as opposed to the monovalency in the daily empirical world). Thus, the object of study of the empirical study of literature is not only the text in itself, but the roles of action within the literary system, namely, production, distribution, reception, and the processing of texts. The methods used are primarily taken from the social sciences, reception theory, cognitive science, psychology, etc. In general the steps to be taken in empirical research are the formation of a hypothesis, putting it into practice, testing, and evaluation. More concretely, for the study of reader response a wide array of techniques are used, ranging from protocol techniques and thinking aloud protocol to pre-structured techniques, such as the semantic seven point scale (C. Osgood) and the classification technique (card sorting), and forms of content analysis, discourse analysis, association techniques, etc. Some objections often raised to the empirical study of literature are the triviality of many of its research results such as confirmation of what was already known or suspected or its reductionism (artificiality of the framework and set-up, and limitation to reader response instead of the study of the text). It is clear, however, that the empirical study of literature by its specific approach of the object and its focus on methodology is an outstanding way to explore the socio-cultural aspects of the literary system. It makes an irreplaceable contribution {{to the development of a}} more rational, scientific, and socially relevant study of literature.” ...|$|E

The main question we are addressing in this paper is how the professionals with more and better developed competencies (<b>polyvalence</b> professionals) increase efficiency of the product development process. We presume that the efficiency of the product development process is significantly influenced by the matching rate between the competencies of professionals and the task requirements of the process. The hypothesis was tested in an international study in which five footwear companies from three European countries participated. By analysing variances and using correlation and regression analyses, we prove the influence of <b>polyvalence</b> professionals on the product development process efficiency.

40|$|In view of {{the problem}} of {{interpretation}} as a partial set of an Empirical Science of Literature (ESL) there are differences between N. Groeben 2 ̆ 7 s and S. J.

40|$|Após a introdução de modificações no sistema produtivo e na forma de gestão pessoal implementada nas três empresas de autopeças pesquisadas, os trabalhadores avaliam que houveram ganhos, mas, também, que passaram a estar sujeitos a maiores pressões mentais e físicas. Os ganhos provêm, principalmente, da introdução de inovações tecnológicas que tornaram o trabalho mais leve e fácil. O aumento das pressões derivam da intensificação do ritmo de trabalho, que tem aumentado os casos de LER, e da operalização da questão da multifuncionalidade. Homens e mulheres avaliaram diferentemente os efeitos da multifuncionalidade no seu trabalho na fábrica. É possível que, quando as mulheres afirmam que "nada mudou" no seu trabalho após a introdução da multifuncionalidade, elas estejam tomando como referência o espaço doméstico, onde lhes é "natural" o desempenho de múltiplas tarefas, às quais sempre podem ser acrescentadas mais algumas.

40|$|The Spanish missionary entrada (A. D. 1769 to 1833) {{along the}} California coast created {{a series of}} complex {{encounters}} between multiple cultural discourses. The Franciscan mission system directly brought colonial and indigenous cultural metaphorical understandings into play. Missionary and indigenous discourse interacted largely via the media of material culture, animals, embellished architecture, and landscape— media interpreted through preexisting cultural metaphors and understandings. Investigating how metaphors {{played a role in}} constituting colonial entanglements is important in understanding cultural interactions and change. Metaphors structured colonial interactions, simultaneously hindering and enabling missionary-indigenous relationships. These relationships created parameters for unforeseen transitory configurations: a process best theorized under the term <b>polyvalence.</b> By adopting <b>polyvalence,</b> the processes of colonialism can be approached without usage of ethnic or racialized terms such as creolization, hybridity, or amalgamation. In the case of indigenous south-central California, it is suggested here that widely different forms of evidence can be better appreciated without recourse to terms laden with racial or ethnic connotations. The evidence suggests that while missions may have failed to create entirely new ethnic groups, missionary endeavors did result in unanticipated outcomes, presenting problems and creative opportunities for indigenous groups living within immediate coastal and extended interior populations...|$|E
