This issue is one visible throughout society, creating complications within day to day communication at home, in the work place, and within schools. As new generations seek to define themselves as something apart from the old, they adopt new lingo and slang, allowing a generation {{to create a sense of}} division from the previous one.

50|$|Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming {{surfaces}} {{or higher}} load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost <b>parallel</b> <b>gap</b> for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, {{the motion of}} the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary lubrication regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the lubricant film thickness.|$|E

Tests on tension and suspension types of CI/PAG were thus carried out in the artificial climate chamber to investigate their DC icing flashover performance. The influences of <b>parallel</b> air <b>gap,</b> ice thickness, pollution severity and air pressure on DC negative 50 % flashover voltage (U 50 %) of CI/PAG were investigated. Test results show that the <b>parallel</b> air <b>gap</b> affected both the discharge path and U 50 %. With increasing ice thickness, U 50 % declined by up to 52 %; this effect was more evident when the breakdown occurred in the air gap. The pollution severity affected U 50 % only when the flashover happened along insulator surface. With a decrease of atmospheric pressure, U 50 % decreased. U 50 % and the ratio of air pressure were in a power function relationship with a positive characteristic exponent which was relevant to the discharge path...|$|R
30|$|In summary, we have {{presented}} solution-based fabrication of extremely enhanced and reproducible large-area SERS substrates with uniform cross-arrays of AgNWs on Au; these arrays were produced using microliter volumes of AgNW suspension. The AgNWs were aligned by the shear stress {{applied to the}} meniscus of a droplet of AgNW suspension injected between the deposition plate and the coating plate. The regularly assembled AgNW films demonstrated better structural homogeneity and SERS intensity 1.8 – 36 -fold higher than random, drop-casted AgNW films. The increased SERS intensity was attributed {{to an increase in}} SERS multiple plasmon couplings among AgNWs (crossed and <b>parallel</b> <b>gaps)</b> and between the Au film and the AgNWs. We have demonstrated that the SERS enhancement brought about by the cross-AgNW films was optimized at C- 14 (Au/cross-AgNW films). Therefore, the cross-AgNW-based SERS substrate is sufficient to fabricate a highly sensitive SERS system. This approach has great potential for use {{in a wide range of}} applications in optoelectronics, nanoelectronics, and sensors.|$|R
40|$|Abstmet-Three <b>parallel</b> <b>gaps</b> in robust {{feedback}} control theory are examined: sufficiency versus necessity, deterministic versus stochastic uncertainty modeling, and stability versus performance. Deterministic and stochastic output-{{feedback control}} problems are considered with both static and dynamic controllers. The static and dynamic robust stabilization problems involve deterministically modeled bounded but unknown measurable time-varying parameter variations, while the static and dynamic stochastic optimal control problems feature state-, control-, and measurement-dependent white noise. General sufficiency conditions for the deterministic problems are obtained using Lyapunov’s direct method, while necessary conditions for the stochastic problems are derived {{as a consequence of}} minimizing a quadratic performance criterion. The sufficiency tests are then applied to the necessary conditions to determine when solutions of the stochastic optimization problems also solve the deterministic robust stability problems. As an additional application of the deterministic result, the modified Riccati equation approach of Petersen and Hollot is generalized in the static case and extended to dynamic compensation.

Methods Online pandemic plans from national, provincial and territorial government websites were reviewed to identify: plans {{for children and}} families, and psychosocial and ethical issues. A survey was administered to gather participants' perspectives on the needs in pediatric planning, as well as important elements of their organizations' and regions' pandemic plans. A thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative survey responses. Results The majority of existing plans did not adequately address {{the unique needs of}} pediatric populations, and mainly focused on medical and policy concerns. Several gaps in plans were identified, including the need for psychosocial supports and ethical decision-making frameworks for children and families. Similarly, survey respondents identified <b>parallel</b> <b>gaps,</b> in their organization's or region's plans.
