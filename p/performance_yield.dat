40|$|Abstract—With {{the move}} to deep {{submicron}} processes, the design-productivity gap has continued to widen for RTL-based design methodologies. High-level synthesis has been touted {{as a solution to}} the design-productivity gap by allowing designers to move up to a higher level of abstraction where they focus on the functionality of the circuit instead of the low level details. However, at the same time, {{the move to}} deep submicron processes has led to increased levels of process variation, which must be considered during synthesis so that the <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> of the circuit meets design specifications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> optimization during the scheduling task of high-level synthesis. We formulate the problem of <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> optimization for scheduling as an integer linear programming problem (ILP) and offer the following contributions: 1) a totally unimodular ILP formulation for <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> maximization and 2) a variation-aware and layout-driven iterative algorithm for <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> improvement. Experimental results show that we can obtain significant gain in <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> compared to a state-ofthe-art variation-aware high-level synthesis tool FastYield. I...|$|E

40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} transistor {{variability in}} CMOS technology, {{it is essential}} to integrate variation-aware performance analysis into the task allocation and scheduling process to improve its <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> when building today’s multiprocessor system-ona-chip (MPSoC).

In addition, a unified task schedule is constructed at design stage and applied to all products with various variation effects, which restricts the maximum <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> that can be achieved for MPSoC products. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present a novel quasi-static scheduling algorithm. Based on a more accurate <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> estimation method, a set of variation-aware schedules is synthesized off-line and, at run time, the scheduler will select the right one based on the actual variation for each chip, such that the timing constraint can be satisfied whenever possible.

40|$|Abstract—Near-Threshold Computing (NTC) shows poten-tial {{to provide}} {{significant}} energy efficiency improvements as it alleviates {{the impact of}} leakage in modern deep sub-micron CMOS technology. As the gap between supply and threshold voltage shrink, however, the energy efficiency gains come {{at the cost of}} device performance variability. Thus, adopting near-threshold in modern CAD flows requires careful consideration when addressing commonly targeted objectives. We propose a process variation-aware near-threshold voltage (PV-Nvt) gate sizing framework for minimizing power subject to <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> constraints.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the new problem of timing variation-aware (TV) task scheduling and binding (TSB) for multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) architecture in the system-level design, where tasks {{have the full}} flexibilities of resource (i. e. processor) sharing to meet the design constraints. With the timing variation of processors ’ clock speed, {{it has been observed}} that the consideration of the effect of resource sharing on the resulting <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> computation is critically important for accurate design space exploration and evaluation in the system-level design. Nevertheless, unfortunately the previous statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) in the system level has never considered the resource sharing in the <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> computation, or has overly simplified it by employing the gate-level SSTAs. In this work, we overcome this limitation of the previous work. Specifically, under the data of clock speed variation of each processor, we propose an effective technique of SSTA, called TSB-SSTA, on TSB in the presence of resource sharing and develop a TV framework, calledTSB-TV, of TSB that tightly integratesTSB-SSTA. Through experimentation with the benchmark designs, we have tested the effectiveness of our approach. In summary, compared with the results by the conventional TV TSB, TSB-TV enhances the <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> of designs by 30 % on average...|$|E

Highlevel synthesis has been touted {{as a solution to}} these problems, as it can significantly reduce the number of man hours required for a design by raising the level of abstraction. In this paper, we propose a new variation-aware high-level synthesis binding/module selection algorithm, named FastYield, which takes into consideration multiplexers, functional units, registers, and interconnects. Additionally, FastYield connects with the lower levels of the design hierarchy through its inclusion of a timing driven floorplanner guided by a statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) engine which is used to modify/enhance the synthesis solution. FastYield is able to incorporate spatial correlations of process variations in its optimization, which are shown to affect <b>performance</b> <b>yield.</b> On average, FastYield achieves a clock period that is 14. 5 % smaller, and a <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> gain of 78. 9 %, when compared to a variation-unaware algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{proposes a}} new yield {{computation}} technique dedicated to HLS, {{which is an}} essential component in timing variationaware HLS research field. The SSTAs used by the current timing variation-aware HLS techniques cannot support the following two critical factors at all: (i) non-Gaussian delay distribution of ‘module patterns ’ used in scheduling and binding and (ii) correlation of timing variation between module patterns. However, without considering these factors, the synthesis results would be far less accurate in timing, being very likely to fail in timing closure. Even though there are advances in the logic level for SSTAs that support (i) and (ii), the manipulation and computation of (i) and (ii) {{in the course of}} scheduling and binding in HLS are unique in that there are no concepts of module sharing and <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> computation in the logic level. Specifically, we propose a novel yield computation technique to handle the non-Gaussian timing variation of module patterns, where the sum and max operations are closed-form formulas and the timing correlation between modules used in computing <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> is preserved to the first-order form. Experimental results show that our synthesis using the proposed yield computation technique reduces the latency by 24. 1 % and 28. 8 % under 95 % and 90 % <b>performance</b> <b>yield</b> constraints over that by the conventional HLS, respectively. Further, it is confirmed that our synthesis results are near optimal with less than 3. 1 % error on average. I...|$|E

A total of 1200, 1 -day-old female quails were raised up to 42 days of age. The completely randomized design consisted of four treatments with six replicates each and with 50 quails in each cage. Treatments consisted of four levels of sorghum replacement in the diet (0, 40, 60, and 100 % sorghum). All birds were weighed to assess the weight gain. Feed conversion was calculated as the relationship between feed intake and weight gain. Mortality was reported daily and calculated at the end of each week. At 42 days, the birds were slaughtered and the carcass, thigh and drumstick, and breast yields were assessed. Mineral matter, ether extract, and crude protein analyses were performed using breast cuts and thigh + drumstick cuts.
