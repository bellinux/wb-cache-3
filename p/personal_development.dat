40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThis thesis investigates <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> in online learning environments and the impact that personal values have on it. <b>Personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> was investigated {{from the perspective of}} Nonaka’s SECI model of organisational knowledge creation. This model served as the basis for an adapted model that conceptualises <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> in online learning at the individual level. The personal value types of the Schwartz Value Survey and the Portrait Values Questionnaire were adopted to measure personal values and their impact on <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> in online learning environments. Three data collection approaches were used. First, an exploratory study was conducted which elicited online learners’ experiences of their <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> in online learning; this study used online discussion forums for data collection. Second, a Delphi study was carried out. Experts were asked which of the ten individual-level value types by Schwartz are likely to be particularly relevant in the context of online learning. Third, an online survey was created. Its aim was to measure the impact that personal values and background variables, such as gender and age, have on <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> in online learning. A measurement instrument was devised that measures three of the SECI modes, namely Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation. This instrument measures the magnitude of online learners’ Externalisation and Combination activities as well as their level of Internalisation, i. e. the outcomes of <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development.</b> Results of the exploratory study show that there are widely diverging experiences of <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> in online learning. The literature review suggests that the cultural situatedness of an online learning environment is an important influencing factor on <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development.</b> The results of the Delphi study suggest that Self-Direction, Stimulation, and Achievement are particularly relevant value types in the context investigated here. Finally, the online survey confirms this view, as all three value types were found to be positively correlated with Externalisation, Combination, and Internalisation, {{with the exception of the}} Achievement-Combination relationship. A modified version of the SECI model is proposed, which extends the applicability of the original SECI model from the organisational to the individual level. It is argued that this model is suitable to describe <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> in the context of online learning. The study also contributes to closing the gap in research on the impact of personal values in the context investigated in this study. Moreover, a measurement instrument was created that can be used to measure Externalisation and Combination, i. e. <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> processes, and Internalisation, i. e. <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> outcomes...|$|R

5|$|Moore {{used the}} story {{as a means to}} reflect {{contemporary}} anxieties and to deconstruct and parody the superhero concept. Watchmen depicts an alternate history where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the <b>personal</b> <b>development</b> and moral struggles of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.|$|E

It is based on Nonaka‘s SECI model of organisational knowledge creation. It is argued that Socialisation is not a relevant mode {{in the context of}} online learning and was therefore not covered in the measurement instrument. Therefore, the remaining three of SECI‘s knowledge conversion modes, namely Externalisation, Combination, and Internalisation were used and a measurement instrument was created which also examines the interrelationships between the three modes. Data was collected using an online survey, in which online learners report on their experiences of <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> in online learning environments. In other words, the instrument measures the magnitude of online learners‘ Externalisation and combination activities as well as their level of internalisation, which is the outcome of their <b>personal</b> knowledge <b>development</b> in online learning...|$|R
