In this paper I present a survey on the recent research and standardization of ADSL transceivers. I propose to model and simulate an ADSL transceiver using Synchronous Data Flow (SDF). 1...|$|R

I implemented a Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) model for an ADSL transceiver’s data transmission subsystem in LabVIEW. My implementation enables designers to simulate and optimize different ADSL transceiver designs. The overall implementation is compliant with the European Telecommunications Standards Institute’s ADSL specification. 1...|$|R

40|$|Negotiations on the {{liberalisation}} {{of telecommunications}} form {{an important part}} of service negotiations in the Doha Round. The negotiations cover all aspects of the telecoms sector, including fixed <b>line</b> <b>public</b> <b>networks,</b> mobile networks and the full range of value-added network services (VANS) such as Internet and virtual private networks. Liberalisation of trade in these sub-sectors involves removing entry barriers into the market (market access) and any discriminatory practices against foreign operators (national treatment). It applies to all forms of operations- whether it is a commercial presence in the host country or offering a cross-border service such as international voice or data traffic. Liberalisation does not include privatisation (public companies can continue to exist in a competitive environment) and does not eliminate ability to regulate the industry in a fair and impartial manner. In fact, negotiations in telecoms include a Reference Paper that lays down principles of fair regulation that countries can be asked to commit to. The Reference Paper covers regulatory principles in competitive safeguards, interconnection regulation, the allocation of scarce resources (like spectrum), universal service obligations, formation of an independent regulator and the public availability of licensing criteria.

30|$|To further see the {{real-world}} potential of EC codes, we then evaluate the performance for a near-optimal chunk transmission scheme over line-topology (<b>line)</b> <b>networks</b> [18]. As most practical routing schemes are single-path based, <b>line</b> <b>networks</b> have attracted {{a lot of}} interest [19 – 21]. Also, the chunked code scheme for <b>line</b> <b>networks</b> can be extended to general network scenarios, including general unicast networks [14, 18], two-way relay networks [22], and wireless broadcast networks [23]. For a wide range of the packet loss rates, with proper optimization of the transmission scheme, EC codes achieve rates very close to those of the coded chunked codes and about 91 %∼ 97 % of the theoretical upper bounds. Besides, we show by simulation that EC codes perform much better than the existing overlapped chunked codes in <b>line</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|R
