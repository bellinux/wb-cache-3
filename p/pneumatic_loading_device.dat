40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} undergoes {{cycles of}} compressive loading during joint movement, leading to its cyclical deformation and recovery. This loading {{is essential for}} chondrocytes to perform their normal function of maintenance of the extracellular matrix. Various lines of evidence suggest {{the involvement of the}} cytoskeleton in load sensing and response. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to describe the 3 -dimensional (3 D) architecture of the cytoskeleton of chondrocytes within their extracellular matrix, and to examine cytoskeletal responses to experimentally varied mechanical conditions. Uniformly sized explants of articular cartilage were dissected from adult rat femoral heads. Some were immediately frozen, cryosectioned and labelled for filamentous actin using phalloidin, and for the focal contact component vinculin or for vimentin by indirect immunofluorescence. Sections were examined by confocal microscopy and 3 D modelling. Actin occurred in all chondrocytes, appearing as bright foci at the cell surface linked to an irregular network beneath the surface. Cell surface foci colocalised with vinculin, suggesting the presence of focal contacts between the chondrocyte and its pericellular matrix. Vimentin label occurred mainly in cells of the deep zone. It had a complex intracellular distribution, with linked networks of fibres surrounding the nucleus and beneath the plasma membrane. When cartilage explants were placed into organ culture, where in the absence of further treatments cartilage imbibes fluid from the culture medium and swells, cytoskeletal changes were observed. After 1 h in culture the vimentin cytoskeleton was disassembled, leading to diffuse labelling of cells. After a further hour in culture filamentous vimentin label reappeared in deep zone chondrocytes, and then over the next 48 h became more widespread in cells of the explants. Actin distribution was unaffected by culture. Further experiments were performed to test the effects of load on the cytoskeleton. Explants were placed in culture and immediately subjected to static uniaxial radially unconfined compressive loads of 0. 5, 1, 2 or 4 MPa for 1 h using a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loading</b> <b>device.</b> Loads greater than 0. 5 MPa maintained the vimentin organisation over the culture period. At 0. 5 MPa, the chondrocytes within the explant behaved as in free-swelling culture. The rapid change in vimentin organisation probably relates to rapid swelling of the explants—under free-swelling conditions, these reached their maximum swollen size in just 15 min of culture. The chondrocytes' response to change in tissue dimensions, and thus to their relationship to their immediate environment, was to disassemble their vimentin networks. Loading probably counteracts the swelling pressure of the tissue. Overall, this work suggests that chondrocytes maintain their actin cytoskeleton and modify their vimentin cytoskeleton in response to changing mechanical conditions...|$|E
40|$|Musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and {{sensorimotor}} deconditioning {{have been}} observed consistently in astronauts and cosmonauts following long-duration spaceflight. Studies in bed rest, a spaceflight analog, have shown that high intensity resistive or aerobic exercise attenuates or prevents musculoskeletal and cardiovascular deconditioning, respectively, but complete protection has not been achieved during spaceflight. Exercise countermeasure hardware used during earlier International Space Station (ISS) missions included a cycle ergometer, a treadmill, and the interim resistive exercise device (iRED). Effectiveness of the countermeasures may have been diminished by limited loading characteristics of the iRED as well as speed restrictions and subject harness discomfort during treadmill exercise. The Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) and the second generation treadmill were designed to address many {{of the limitations of}} their predecessors, and anecdotal reports from ISS crews suggest that their conditioning is better preserved since the new hardware was delivered in 2009. However, several countermeasure devices to protect different physiologic systems will not be practical during exploration missions when the available volume and mass will be severely restricted. The combined countermeasure device (CCD) integrates a suite of hardware into one device intended to prevent spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and sensorimotor deconditioning. The CCD includes <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loading</b> <b>devices</b> with attached cables for resistive exercise, a cycle for aerobic exercise, and a 6 degree of freedom motion platform for balance training. In a proof of concept test, ambulatory untrained subjects increased muscle strength (58 %) as well as aerobic capacity (26 %) after 12 -weeks of exercise training with the CCD (without balance training), improvements comparable to those observed with traditional exercise training. These preliminary results suggest that this CCD can concurrently improve musculoskeletal and cardiovascular conditioning in ambulatory subjects, but further work is required to validate its use as countermeasure to spaceflight-induced deconditioning...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} detrimental {{processes such as}} corrosion and stress corrosion cracking (SCC), ageing embrittlement, creep and fatigue etc., which may significantly affect the materials performance in specific water chemistry environments, is of fundamental importance {{for the development of}} the Supercritical Water (SCW) reactor concept. In particular, SCC crack growth rate testing is difficult to perform due to complex requirements for the experimental facilities which include water chemistry loops equipped with relevant pH, conductivity, dissolved O 2 and H 2 sensors, autoclaves with mechanical <b>loading</b> <b>devices,</b> incorporating crack growth rate measurement by direct current potential drop (DCPD) and displacement measurement by linear variable differential transducers (LVDT). All these requirements significantly advance the total materials qualification costs. JRC in cooperation with VTT has been working on a new type of <b>loading</b> <b>devices</b> which are expected to decrease these costs and at the same time guarantee enough reliability and flexibility for both SCC and future irradiation assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC) testing to be performed in SCW environments. This paper summarizes the first results of SCC crack growth rate measurements in SCW by using a <b>pneumatic</b> bellows based <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> developed in the frame of JRC-VTT cooperation. Furthermore, the results of crack growth rates in SCW (550 oC, 8000 ppb of dosed oxygen) are compared to those measured by using the same <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> in 288 oC subcritical water.

40|$|AbstractThe first {{successful}} {{application of the}} high precision <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loading</b> system for advanced material testing was developed at VTT in 1995. The <b>pneumatic</b> servo-controlled <b>loading</b> system is capable of operating {{in a range of}} extreme conditions such as high temperature, pressurised water or steam, Super Critical Water (SCW) and irradiation environments. The main benefit of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loading</b> system {{is that there is no}} moving parts (loading lead-throughs) required for loading a specimen inside a pressure vessel or otherwise demanding containment (water, gas, radioactive), only pressure lines and electrical feedback connections together with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loading</b> unit, bellows are required. Also, the pneumatically powered testing device itself can be far away from the control units and regulating servo valves. The HIPS, previously used for tensile testing, stress corrosion cracking, fatigue, in-pile creep fatigue (copper), and other test variants with combined environmental impact, has now been modified to perform load and strain controlled testing at temperatures in the creep range for steels. For the high temperature applications where creep is an active damage mechanism, the HIPS technology opens new applications for creep and fatigue related testing types such as standard creep-fatigue (with and without hold time), relaxation and slow strain rate tensile testing. The main focus of this paper is to present the current status of the development work of the HIPS technology for high temperature applications, presently conducted in air atmosphere. Also some initial creep-fatigue results and creep-fatigue behavior comparisons are presented for some austenitic stainless steels (316 L, 347 H, 321) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} novel countermeasure protocols {{in a space}} flight analog prior to validation on the International Space Station (ISS), NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) is sponsoring a multi-investigator bedrest campaign that utilizes a combination of commercial and custom-made exercise training hardware to conduct daily resistive and aerobic exercise protocols. This paper will describe these pieces of hardware {{and how they are}} used to support current bedrest studies at NASA's Flight Analog Research Unit in Galveston, TX. Discussion: To implement candidate exercise countermeasure studies during extended bed rest studies the following analog hardware are being utilized: Stand alone Zero-Gravity Locomotion Simulator (sZLS) [...] a custom built device by NASA, the sZLS allows bedrest subjects to remain supine as they run on a vertically-oriented treadmill (0 - 15 miles/hour). The treadmill includes a <b>pneumatic</b> subject <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> to provide variable body loading (0 - 100 %) and a harness to keep the subject in contact with the motorized treadmill to provide a ground reaction force at their feet that is quantified by a Kistler Force Plate. Supine Cycle Ergometer [...] a commercially available supine cycle ergometer (Lode, Groningen, Netherlands) is used for all cycle ergometer sessions. The ergometer has adjustable shoulder supports and handgrips to help stabilize the subject during exercise. Horizontal Squat Device (HSD) [...] a custom built device by Quantum Fitness Corp (Stafford, TX), the HSD allows for squat exercises to be performed while lying in a supine position. The HSD can provide 0 to 600 pounds of force in selectable 5 lb increments, and allows hip translation in both the vertical and horizontal planes. Prone Leg Curl [...] a commercially available prone leg curl machine (Cybex International Inc., Medway, MA) is used to complete leg curl exercises. Horizontal Leg Press [...] a commercially available horizontal leg press (Quantum Fitness Corporation) is used for leg press and heel raise exercises. Minor modifications were made to the device including adding 200 lbs to the weight stack, raising the frame by 12 inches, making the footplate adjustable, and providing removable handles.

40|$|Single-molecule {{mechanical}} manipulation {{has enabled}} the quantitative {{understanding of the}} kinetics of bond ruptures as well as protein unfolding mechanism. Single-molecule experiments with theoretical models have allowed one to gain insight into free energy landscape for chemical bond and/or protein folding. For mechanically induced bond rupture, the bond-rupture kinetics may be governed by <b>loading</b> <b>device.</b> However, the role of <b>loading</b> <b>device</b> on the kinetics of mechanical rupture has been rarely received much attention until recently. In this work, we have theoretically and/or computationally studied the effect of loading-device stiffness on the kinetics of mechanical unfolding. Specifically, we have considered a one-dimensional model for a bond rupture whose kinetics is depicted by Kramers' theory. It is elucidated that the kinetics of bond rupture is determined by force constant of <b>loading</b> <b>device.</b> The Brownian dynamics simulation of a bond rupture is considered in order to validate our theory.

Moreover, we have taken into account the computational simulation of mechanical unfolding of a small protein, i. e. β-hairpin.
