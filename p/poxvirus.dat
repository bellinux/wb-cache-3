5|$|Microscopically, poxviruses produce {{characteristic}} cytoplasmic inclusions, {{the most}} important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies, and are the sites of viral replication. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all <b>poxvirus</b> infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox. The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E

In 2005, Rich and his colleagues pinned down what E3L does for the <b>poxvirus.</b> When expressed in human cells, E3L increases by five- to 10-fold the production of several genes that block a cell's ability to self-destruct in response to infection.|$|E
25|$|After {{smallpox}} {{was declared}} eradicated by WHO in December 1979, vaccination programs were terminated. A re-emergence {{of the disease}} either by accident or {{as a result of}} biological warfare would meet an unprotected population and could result in an epidemic that could be difficult to control. Mass vaccination would be unethical, as the only efficient vaccines against smallpox include live vaccinia virus with severe adverse effects on rare occasions. As one protective measure, large amounts of vaccine are kept in stock, but an efficient drug against smallpox has high priority. One possible approach would be to use the specificity of the thymidine kinase of <b>poxvirus</b> for the purpose, in a similar way that it is used for drugs against herpesvirus. One difficulty is that the <b>poxvirus</b> thymidine kinase belongs to the same family of thymidine kinases as the human thymidine kinases and thereby is more similar chemically. The structure of <b>poxvirus</b> thymidine kinases has therefore been determined to find potential antiviral drugs. The search has, however, not yet resulted in a usable antiviral drug against poxviruses.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of <b>poxviruses</b> is {{complicated}} by having multiple infectious forms, with differing mechanisms of cell entry. <b>Poxviruses</b> are unique among DNA viruses in that they replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell {{rather than in the}} nucleus. In order to replicate, <b>poxviruses</b> produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other DNA viruses, the most important of which is a viral-associated DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.|$|R

25|$|MC {{is caused}} by a <b>poxvirus</b> called the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). The virus is spread either by direct contact {{including}} sexual activity or via contaminated objects such as towels. The condition can also be spread to other areas of the body by the person themselves. Risk factors include a weak immune system, atopic dermatitis, and crowded living conditions. Following one infection, it is possible to get reinfected. Diagnosis is typically based on the appearance.|$|E
25|$|This {{concept was}} applied in topical {{administration}} of pDNA encoding IL-10. Plasmid encoding B7-1 (a ligand on APCs) successfully enhanced the immune response in tumour models. Mixing plasmids encoding GM-CSF and the circumsporozoite protein of P. yoelii (PyCSP) enhanced protection against subsequent challenge (whereas plasmid-encoded PyCSP alone did not). It was proposed that GM-CSF caused dendritic cells to present antigen more efficiently and enhance IL-2 production and TH cell activation, thus driving the increased immune response. This {{can be further}} enhanced by first priming with a pPyCSP and pGM-CSF mixture, followed by boosting with a recombinant <b>poxvirus</b> expressing PyCSP. However, co-injection of plasmids encoding GM-CSF (or IFN-γ, or IL-2) and a fusion protein of P. chabaudi merozoite surface protein 1 (C-terminus)-hepatitis B virus surface protein (PcMSP1-HBs) abolished protection against challenge, compared to protection acquired by delivery of pPcMSP1-HBs alone.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>poxviruses</b> pioneered {{the field of}} {{vaccinology}} after Jenner’s remarkable discovery that ‘vaccination’ with the phylogenetically related cowpox virus conferred immunity to the devastating disease of smallpox. The study of <b>poxviruses</b> continues to enrich the field of virology because the global eradication of smallpox provides a unique example of the potency of effective immunization. Other <b>poxviruses</b> have since been developed as vaccine vectors for clinical and veterinary applications and include modified vaccinia virus strains such as modified vaccinia Ankara and NYVAC {{as well as the}} avipox viruses, fowlpox virus and canarypox virus. Despite the empirical development of poxvirus-based vectored vaccines, it is only now becoming apparent that we need to better understand how the innate arm of the immune system drives adaptive immunity to <b>poxviruses,</b> and how this information is relevant to vaccine design strategies, which are the topics addressed in this article.

40|$|Understanding the {{protective}} mechanism {{in the liver}} induced by recombinant vaccines against the pre-erythrocytic stages of malaria is important for vaccine development. Most studies in mice have focused on splenic and peripheral blood T cells and identified gamma interferon (IFN-) -producing CD 8 + T cells as correlates of protection, which can be induced by prime-boost vaccination with recombinant <b>poxviruses.</b> Invariant natural killer T (V 14 iNKT) cells can also protect against liver stage malaria, when activated, and are abundant in the liver. Since <b>poxviruses</b> have nonspecific immunomodulating effects, which are incompletely understood, we investigated whether recombinant <b>poxviruses</b> affect {{the protective}} properties of hepatic V 14 iNKT cells and thus vaccine efficacy. We show that intradermal vaccination with recombinant <b>poxviruses</b> activated V 14 iNKT cells and NK cells in the livers of BALB/c mice while inducing IFN [...] and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) -producing pre-erythrocytic stage antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells. Greater numbers of hepatic V 14 iNKT cells secreted interleukin- 4 than IFN-. Vaccinated V 14 iNKT-cell-deficient mice had lower, but still protective levels of hepatic and splenic IFN-+ and TNF-+ CD 8 + T cells and better protection rates later after challenge with Plasmodium berghei sporozoites. Therefore, vaccine-activated hepatic V 14 iNKT cells help in generating specific T cells but are not required for protection induced by recombinant <b>poxviruses.</b> Furthermore, double-positive INF-+/TNF-+ CD 8 + T cells were enriched in protected livers, suggesting that cells expressing both of these cytokines may be most relevant for protection...|$|R

500|$|Lady Mary Wortley Montagu {{observed}} smallpox inoculation {{during her}} {{stay in the}} Ottoman Empire, writing detailed accounts of the practice in her letters, and enthusiastically promoted the procedure in England upon her return in 1718. In 1721, Cotton Mather and colleagues provoked controversy in Boston by inoculating hundreds. In 1796, Edward Jenner, a doctor in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, rural England, discovered that immunity to smallpox could be produced by inoculating a person with material from a cowpox lesion. Cowpox is a <b>poxvirus</b> {{in the same family}} as variola. Jenner called the material used for inoculation vaccine, from the root word vacca, which is Latin for cow. The procedure was much safer than variolation, and did not involve a risk of smallpox transmission. Vaccination to prevent smallpox was soon practiced all over the world. During the 19th century, the cowpox virus used for smallpox vaccination was replaced by vaccinia virus. [...] Vaccinia is in the same family as cowpox and variola, but is genetically distinct from both. The origin of vaccinia virus and how it came to be in the vaccine are not known. According to Voltaire (1742), the Turks derived their use of inoculation to neighbouring Circassia. Voltaire does not speculate on where the Circassians derived their technique from, though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it [...] "these hundred years".|$|E
