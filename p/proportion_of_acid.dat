40|$|BACKGROUND—Treatment of {{acromegaly}} with octreotide {{increases the}} <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> deoxycholic <b>acid</b> in, and the cholesterol saturation of, bile and induces {{the formation of}} gallstones. Prolongation of intestinal transit has been proposed as the mechanism for {{the increase in the}} <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> deoxycholic <b>acid</b> in bile.  AIMS—To study the effects of octreotide on intestinal transit in acromegalic patients during octreotide treatment, and to examine the relation between intestinal transit and bile acid composition in fasting serum.  METHODS—Mouth to caecum and large bowel transit times, and the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> deoxycholic <b>acid</b> in fasting serum were measured in non-acromegalic controls, acromegalic patients untreated with octreotide, acromegalics on long term octreotide, and patients with simple constipation. Intestinal transit and the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> deoxycholic <b>acid</b> were compared in acromegalic patients before and during octreotide.  RESULTS—Acromegalics untreated with octreotide had longer mouth to caecum and large bowel transit times than controls. Intestinal transit was further prolonged by chronic octreotide treatment. There were significant linear relations between large bowel transit time and the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> deoxycholic <b>acid</b> in the total, conjugated, and unconjugated fractions of fasting serum.  CONCLUSIONS—These data support the hypothesis that, by prolonging large bowel transit, octreotide increases the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> deoxycholic <b>acid</b> in fasting serum (and, by implication, in bile) and thereby the risk of gallstone formation. ...|$|R

Methods: One hundred consecutive patients with BE (75 short-segment BE, 25 long-segment BE), 50 with EE and 48 HV underwent multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH off-therapy. We quantified esophageal acid exposure, characteristics, and proximal extension of reflux episodes. Key Results: Total and acid reflux episodes gradually increased from HV [28 (17. 5 - 43) and 18 (8 - 31) ] to EE [73. 5 (54 - 96) and 52 (39 - 68) ], short-segment BE (SSBE) [83 (73. 2 - 131) and 65 (43. 3 - 95) ] and long-segment BE (LSBE) [105 (102 - 187) and 77 (75 - 107) ].

40|$|Background: The {{ecological}} plaque hypothesis explains caries {{development as}} the result of the enrichment of acid tolerant bacteria in dental biofilms in response to prolonged periods of low pH. Acid production by an acid tolerant microflora causes demineralisation of tooth enamel and thus, individuals with a greater <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> tolerant bacteria would be expected to be more prone to caries development. Biofilm acid tolerance could therefore be a possible biomarker for caries prediction. However, little is known about the stability of biofilm acid tolerance over time in vivo or the distribution throughout the oral cavity. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess intra-individual differences in biofilm acid-tolerance between different tooth surfaces and inter-individual variation as well as stability of acid tolerance over time. Results: The majority of the adolescents showed low scores for biofilm acid tolerance. In 14 of 20 individuals no differences were seen between the three tooth sites examined. In the remaining six, acid-tolerance at the premolar site differed from one of the other sites. At 51 of 60 tooth sites, acid-tolerance at baseline was unchanged after 1 month. However, acid tolerance values changed over a 1 -year period in 50 % of the individuals. Conclusions: Biofilm acid tolerance showed short-term stability and low variation between different sites in the same individual suggesting that the acid tolerance could be a promising biological biomarker candidate for caries prediction. Further evaluation is however needed and prospective clinical trials are called for to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background 10 - Hydroxy- 2 -decenoic acid, an {{unsaturated}} {{fatty acid}} is the most active and unique component to the royal jelly that has antimicrobial properties. Streptococcus mutans is associated with pathogenesis of oral cavity, gingivoperiodontal diseases and bacteremia following dental manipulations. In the oral cavity, S. mutans colonize the soft tissues including tongue, palate, and buccal mucosa. When considering the role of supragingival dental plaque in caries, the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> producing bacteria (particularly S. mutans), has direct relevance to the pathogenicity of the plaque. The genes that encode glucosyltransferases (gtf s) especially gtfB and gtfC are important in S. mutans colonization and pathogenesis. This study investigated the hydroxy-decenoic acid (HDA) effects on gtfB and gtfC expression and S. mutans adherence to cells surfaces. Methods Streptococcus mutans was treated by different concentrations of HPLC purified HDA supplied by Iran Beekeeping and Veterinary Association. Real time RT-PCR and western blot assays were conducted to evaluate gtfB and gtfC genes transcription and translation before and after HDA treatment. The bacterial attachment to the cell surfaces was evaluated microscopically. Results 500 [*]μg[*]ml - 1 of HDA inhibited gtfB and gtfC mRNA transcription and its expression. The same concentration of HDA decreased 60 % the adherence of S. mutans {{to the surface of}} P 19 cells. Conclusion Hydroxy-decenoic acid prevents gtfB and gtfC expression efficiently in the bactericide sub-concentrations and it could effectively reduce S. mutans adherence to the cell surfaces. In the future, therapeutic approaches to affecting S. mutans could be selective and it’s not necessary to put down the oral flora completely. </p...|$|E

40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungi colonise a {{wide range}} of plant species and are especially common in soils with a relatively high pH, where phosphorus availability is a limiting factor for primary production. The aim of this thesis was to study the ecophysiology of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi when exposed to different environments. Development of AM fungi and their host plants were investigated with focus on the activity and the location of phosphatases associated with the AM fungal extraradical and intraradical mycelium. Plants and AM fungal mycelium were grown in substrates varying in soil origin, phosphorus content, or pH. The use of the Enzyme-Labelled Fluorescence (ELF) phosphatase substrate in AM fungal research was investigated. The studies in this thesis have led to the following findings. The ELF substrate method is a sensitive method in the determination of acid and alkaline phosphatase activity associated with mycorrhizal mycelium. The AM root colonisation is positively related to the biomass of the extraradical mycelium, however, locally the extraradical mycelium biomass production can respond to the conditions of certain patches. I found no active release of phosphatase activity by AM fungi, indicating that mineralisation of organic P in soil by AM fungi is not through the release of phosphatases. Staining for phosphatase activity is more intense in the intraradical than in the extraradical mycelium. In the intraradical mycelium the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> phosphatase-active mycelium seems greater than the alkaline phosphatase-active proportion, while in the extraradical mycelium it seems smaller. The high proportion of phosphatase-active arbuscules indicate the importance of phosphatases for the P metabolism in arbuscules and thus for the P transfer to the plant. A tubular vacuole system is present in the extraradical mycelium of a Glomus isolate and a high P content in the growth substrate decreases its motility. Phosphatases associated with the extraradical and intraradical mycelium of AM fungi seem {{to be related to the}} phosphorus uptake by the fungi and phosphorus transfer to the host plant. In this thesis some possible roles of these phosphatases in phosphorus metabolism of AM fungal plants are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Investigations on springwater acidity {{were carried}} out in the Vosges {{mountains}} (north-eastern France). Acid or poorly buffered spring and streamwaters were detected in the same area. The <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> springwaters (pH < 5. 6) is about 20 % among 220 springs. The springwater pH on granite are equally spread between 5. 0 and 6. 8 whereas on sandstone a majority of springs is in the range 5. 6 to 6. 2. As a whole, but mainly on sandstone, from the 1960 's to 1990 's, the shape of the pH distributions shifts toward greater acidity. In the sandstone area, trends in pH, alkalinity, total hardness (corresponding to divalent cations), sulfate and nitrate were considered over the 30 yr period (1963 - 1996) in relation to the bedrock chemical composition. Kendall seasonal tau coefficients indicate that decreasing trends were significant for the first three parameters. Linear regression on the smoothed mean value revealed 18 and 90 % decrease for pH and alkalinity respectively, for springwaters draining poor-base cation sandstone whereas only 8 and 30 % decrease respectively, was observed on clay-enriched sandstone. On silica-enriched sandstone, alkalinity began to decrease in the early 70 's as well as pH. Loss of alkalinity only occurred in the early 80 's for springs draining clay enriched sandstone. This can be interpreted as a titration process by acid atmospheric inputs of the buffering capacity of weathering and exchange processes in the soils and the catchment bedrock. The nitrate presents an increasing step in the early seventies but possibly as a result of change in analytical technics and/or increase in atmospheric inputs mainly resulting from increase in fertiliser inputs in agricultural areas or in car traffic. Surprisingly no change in sulfate was noticed in any groups of springs probably {{as a result of the}} adsorption/mobilisation in the soils. These long-term trends in spring waters (1963 - 1996) confirmed the soil and streamwater acidification trends already mentioned in this region, in relation to acid atmospheric inputs since no climate nor forestry practice changes have been detected over the period. Moreover, in spite of acid atmospheric input reductions, no recovery can presently be detected...|$|E
40|$|The {{tertiary}} to Mid-Quaternary Setberg volcano {{in western}} Iceland {{consists of two}} centres. The northern, Centre 1 is tholeiitic and defined by cone sheets, a caldera and a gabbro intrusion. The southern, Centre 2 is chemically transitional between a tholeiitic and an alkalic basalt series, and contains a cone sheet swarm, gabbroic ring features and a major granophyric cone sheet. Each centre {{can be related to}} a minor magmachamber at a depth of 2 - 3 km. General hydrothermal alteration around both centres has resulted in aureoles of epidotization and the development of greenstones, containing garnet in the central areas. Late-Quaternary volcanism in the Setberg area has produced an alkalic basalt succession, ranging from alkalic olivine baalts to benmoreites. This activity is related to the E-W Snaefellsnes volcanic zone and its causes are explained in terms of Icelandic plate tectonics. The tholeiitic seies of centre 1, form a differentiated sequence from olivine tholeiites to rhyolites, contaning a Ca-poor pyroxene and augite in the basic and intermediate rocks, and a large compositional interval devoid of olivine. Plagioclase is the sole feldspar phase. The transistional series of Centre 2 is olivine-bearing throughout, with augite and rare phenocrysts of orthopyroxene in the basalts. Two lineages of differentiated rocks of this series are typified either by iron-enrichment (to icelandites) or by alkali enrichment (to rhyodacites and alkalic-rhyolites). The latter contains anorthoclase and potassic oligoclase or sanidine, as well as sodic pyroxene. Rocks of the alkalic series are olivine and pyroxene-bearing, with anorthoclase appearing in the benmoreites, while phlogopite and hornblende have been found in some of the lavas. Apatite occurs as a phenocryst in members of both the transitional and alkalic series. The origin of the transitional basalt magma is discussed according to two hypotheses. Its formation is accounted for by solidification from above in a magma reservoir of great vertical dimensions, leading, to confinement of the magma to depths where orthopyroxene replaces olivine on the liquidus, resulting in a trend towards undersaturation. The chemistry of the Late-Quaternary alkalic basalts of Setberg and Snaefeilsnes is related to magma generation at greater depths than {{in the case of the}} tholeiitic basalts of the Icelandic central volcanic zone. The volume, bimodal distribution and diversity of acid and intermediate magmas in Iceland are discussed. The high <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> to basic volcanic rocks in eastern Iceland is contrasted with 3 - 4 % in the rest of the country. Two types of acid centres are identified: centres of Thingmuli type, where tholeiitic basalts are associated with low-alkalic rhyolites; and alkalic centres, containing comendites, quartz- trachytes, alkalic-rhyolites and associated alkalic basalts or transitional basalts. Peralkaline acid rocks are identified and described from Iceland for the first time. Their genesis is discussed and related to fractionation from alkalic-rhyolites and trachytes by the "plagioclase effect". No evidence has been unearthed in this study which contravenes the hypothesis that the Icelandic acid rocks are a product of fractionation from basic magma...|$|E

Supplementation of the seed oil significantly increased the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> a-linolenic <b>acid</b> in plasma neutral lipids (p < 0. 01) and total n- 3 fatty acids in plasma hospholipids and neutral lipids (p < 0. 05). Increases in the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> a-linolenic <b>acid,</b> linoleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma phospholipids by the seed oil treatment were close to significant (0. 05 < p < 0. 1). The pulp oil treat-ment increased the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> palmitoleic <b>acid</b> and lowered the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> pentadecanoic <b>acid</b> in both plasma phospholipids and neutral lipids (p < 0. 01). Seed oil treatment slightly increased the level <b>of</b> docosapentaenoic <b>acid</b> (22 : 5 n- 3) and decreased the level <b>of</b> palmitic <b>acid</b> (16 : 0) in skin glycero-phospholipids (0. 05 < p < 0. 1).

40|$|In {{metabolism}} Mg {{plays an}} important role because it affects many cellular enzymes in the body. The energy metabolism and protein synthesis are dependent on Mg as an enzyme activator, Mg is also involved in the synthesis of RNA and DNA. Absorption of Mg primarily takes place over the ruminal epithelium in ruminants. The main storage of Mg is in the bones but that can only be reached if the cow is in great need of calcium or phosphorus, it's a hormonal regulated process that induces catabolism of bones. Free and available sources of Mg are found in soft tissues and in the extra cellular fluids that includes cerebrospinal fluids and blood. Free Mg in serum is present in two forms, either bound to protein or free and ionized. The majority of absorption takes place through the ruminal epithelium by trans-cellular and para-cellular systems. Every epithelium membrane has a potential difference across the membrane. The para-cellular system is a passive transport based on Mg travelling through tight junctions or through the intracellular surface between cells. The diffusion occurs mainly when the rumen contains high concentrations of Mg in the rumen. There is an active transport of Mg across the membrane in the trans-cellular system, which occurs by the exchange of ions across the membrane, thereby maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the membrane. For the trans-cellular and para-cellular systems to function is requires that Mg is dissolved in the ruminal fluid. There are several factors that affect the absorption of Mg. High levels of K impairs digestibility of Mg, witch makes it harder for Mg to cross the epithelium. High concentrations of K in the ruminal fluid depolarize lumen membrane, resulting in that the driving forces for Mg transport over the membrane is reduced, which decrease Mg absorption. Another factor affecting the absorption of Mg is whether {{there is a lack of}} Na. There is an equilibrium between Na and K, so if there is a lack of Na, this means in turn that there is an increased concentration of K in the ruminal fluid that inhibits Mg absorption. The relationship between forage and concentrates can affect how well the Mg can be absorbed. A diet, which consists largely of cereals and limited quantities of forage, can lead to high production of acid in the gastrointestinal area. A high <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> in the rumen lowers pH, that is positive for Mg absorption because pH regulate solubility and how well Mg can absorb over the membrane. Generally, Mg absorption is sensitive to differences in the balance of ions and pH changes in the rumen. When ruminants are not getting enough of Mg they may develop a disease state called grass tetany that lead to metabolic disorders. Characteristic of the disease is that the animal is grinding teeth, have increased salivation and stop eating which may cause problems in the fermentation process and milk production. If the cows have a serious deficiency of Mg, they can also suffer from muscle cramps, which at worst can lead to death...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—Octreotide {{inhibits}} {{gall bladder}} emptying and prolongs intestinal transit. This leads {{to increases in}} the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> deoxycholic <b>acid</b> in, and cholesterol saturation of, gall bladder bile, {{factors that contribute to}} the pathogenesis of octreotide induced gall stones.  AIMS—To see if an intestinal prokinetic, cisapride, could overcome these adverse effects of octreotide and if so, be considered as a candidate prophylactic drug for preventing iatrogenic gall bladder stones.  METHODS—A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design was used {{to examine the effects of}} cisapride (10  mg four times daily) on gall bladder emptying, mouth to caecum and large bowel transit times, and the <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> deoxycholic <b>acid</b> and other bile acids, in fasting serum from: (i) control subjects (n= 6), (ii) acromegalic patients not treated with octreotide (n= 6), (iii) acromegalics on long term octreotide (n= 8), and (iv) patients with constipation (n= 8).  RESULTS—Cisapride had no prokinetic effect on the gall bladder. In fact, it significantly increased both fasting and postprandial gall bladder volumes. However, it shortened mouth to caecum (from 176  (13) to 113  (11) minutes; p< 0. 001) and large bowel (from 50  (3. 0) to 31  (3. 4) h; p< 0. 001) transit times. It also reduced the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> deoxycholic <b>acid</b> in serum from 26  (2. 3) to 15  (1. 8) % (p< 0. 001), with a reciprocal increase in the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> cholic <b>acid</b> from 40  (3. 5) to 51  (3. 8) % (p< 0. 01). There were significant linear relationships between large bowel transit time and the <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> deoxycholic <b>acid</b> (r= 0. 81; p< 0. 001) and cholic acid (r=− 0. 53; p< 0. 001) in fasting serum.  INTERPRETATION/SUMMARY—Cisapride failed to overcome the adverse effects of octreotide on gall bladder emptying but it countered octreotide induced prolongation of small and large bowel transit. Therefore, if changes in intestinal transit contribute to the development of octreotide induced gall bladder stones, enterokinetics such as cisapride may prevent their formation.    Keywords: cisapride; deoxycholic acid; octreotide; acromegaly; gall bladder stones; large bowel transit tim...|$|R
