40|$|Crop {{residues}} (CR) {{have become}} a limited resource in mixed crop-livestock farms. As {{a result of the}} increasing demand and low availability of alternative resources, CR became an essential resource for household activities, especially for livestock keeping; a major livelihood element of smallholder farmers in the developing world. Farmers' decisions on CR use are determined by farmers' preferences, total crop production, availability of alternative resources and demand for CR. Interaction of these determinants can result in <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> trade-offs of CR use. Determinants, <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> trade-offs are shaped by the specific socio-economic and agro-ecological context of these mixed farms. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a comparative analysis of the determinants of CR use and to examine some options to cope with <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> trade-offs in 12 study sites across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Drawing on socio-economic data at household and village level, we describe how cereal intensification and livestock feed demand influence use, <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> trade-offs of CR use across study sites, specifically cereal residue. Our results show that in low cereal production and livestock feed demand sites, despite a low demand for CR and availability of alternative biomass, <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> trade-offs of CR use are common particularly in the dry season. In sites with moderate cereal production, and low-moderate and moderate livestock feed demand, alternative biomass resources are scarce and most residues are fed to livestock or used to cover household needs. Subsequently, <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> potential trade-offs are stronger. In sites with low cereal production and high livestock feed demand, <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> trade-offs depend on the availability of better feed resources. Finally, sites with high cereal production and high livestock feed demand have been able to fulfil most of the demand for CR, limiting <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> trade-offs. These patterns show that agricultural intensification, better management of communal resources and off-farm activities are plausible development pathways to overcome <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> trade-offs of CR use. Although technologies can largely improve these trends, research and development should revisit past initiatives so as to develop innovative approaches to tackle the well-known problem of low agricultural production in many smallholder mixed systems, creating more sustainable futures. </p...|$|R

5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>and</b> constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
