5000|$|Neutral-beam {{injection}} {{involves the}} introduction of high energy (rapidly moving) atoms (molecules) into an ohmically heated, magnetically confined plasma within the tokamak. The high energy atoms (molecules) originate as ions in an arc chamber before being extracted through a high voltage grid set. The term [...] "ion source" [...] is used to generally mean the assembly consisting {{of a set of}} electron emitting filaments, an arc chamber volume, and a set of extraction grids. The extracted ions travel through a neutralizer section of the beamline where they gain enough electrons to become neutral atoms (molecules) but retain the high velocity imparted to them from the ion source. Once the neutral beam enters the tokamak, interactions with the main plasma ions occur which significantly heat the bulk plasma and bring it closer to fusion-relevant temperatures. Ion source extraction voltages are typically of the order 50-100 kV, and high voltage, negative ion sources (-1 MV) are being developed for ITER. The ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility in Padova will be the first ITER facility to start operation. While neutral beam injection is used primarily for <b>plasma</b> <b>heating,</b> it can also be used as a diagnostic tool and in feedback control by making a pulsed beam consisting of a string of brief 2-10 ms beam blips.

Although these supplements have been extensively characterized in their chemical composition, only recently it has been possible to provide by high throughput protein analysis, a comprehensive profile of the soluble factors contributing to cell survival. This study analyzed and compared the presence of 100 proteins including chemokines, cytokines and soluble factors in six different types of media supplements: serum, <b>plasma,</b> recalcified <b>plasma,</b> <b>heat</b> inactivated serum, <b>heat</b> inactivated <b>plasma</b> and <b>heat</b> inactivated recalcified <b>plasma.</b> Methods Serum, plasma, recalcified <b>plasma,</b> and <b>heat</b> inactivated supplements were prepared from ten healthy subjects. The levels of 100 soluble factors were measured in each sample using a multiplexed ELISA assay and compared by Eisen hierarchical clustering analysis. Results A comparison of serum and plasma levels of soluble factors found that 2 were greater in plasma but 18 factors were greater in serum including 11 chemokines. The levels of only four factors differed between recalcified <b>plasma</b> and <b>plasma.</b> <b>Heat</b> inactivation had the greatest effect on soluble factors. Supervised Eisen hierarchical clustering indicated that the differences between heat inactivated supplements and those that were not were greater than the differences within these two groups. The levels of 36 factors differed between <b>heat</b> inactivated <b>plasma</b> and plasma. Thirty one of these factors had a lower concentration in <b>heat</b> inactivated <b>plasma</b> including 12 chemokines, 4 growth factors, 4 matrix metalloproteases, and 3 adhesion molecules. <b>Heat</b> inactivated decalcified <b>plasma</b> is often used in place of heat inactivated serum and the levels of 19 soluble factors differed between these two supplements.
