40|$|More {{and more}} high rising {{buildings}} emerged in modern cities, but emergency evacuation of tall buildings {{has been a}} worldwide difficult problem. In this paper, a new evacuation device for high rising buildings in fire accident was proposed and studied. This device mainly consisted of special spiral slideway and shunt valve. People in this device could fast slide down {{to the first floor}} under gravity without any electric power and physical strength, which is suitable for various emergency evacuation including mobility-impaired persons. The plane simulation test has shown that human being in alternative clockwise and counterclockwise movement will not become dizzy. The evacuated people should wear <b>protection</b> <b>pad,</b> which can prevent slider from being injured by surface friction with the slide, and eliminate the friction coefficient difference caused by different clothes and slide surface. The calculation results show that the evacuation speed of the new device is much faster than traditional staircases. Moreover, such new evacuation device can also be used as a means of vertical transportation in high-rise buildings partly. People can take it from any floor to ground floor directly, which not only save time for waiting for the lifts but also save the power. The new evacuation system is of simple structure, easy to use, and suitable for evacuation and partly used as vertical downwards traffic, which shows light on solving world-wide difficulties on fast evacuation in high-rise buildings...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports a}} {{design of a}} bonding pad {{oriented}} square-shape ESD (electrostatic discharge) protection structure. The novel ESD protection structure provides adequate protection for IC chips against ESD pulses in all directions. The structure features deep snapback symmetric characteristics, low discharging impedance, low holding voltage, and flexible triggering voltage. It passed 14 KV HBM zapping and 15 KV air gap IEC stressing. The pad-oriented design substantially reduces Si area consumed by ESD structures on a chip, therefore generates less parasitic effects that degrade IC performance. The new design is especially suitable for very deep sub-micron (VDSM) mixed-signal and RF IC applications. Key Words: ESD, <b>protection,</b> bonding <b>pad,</b> mixed-signal, IC, SCR. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of collecting disease-specific and generic data {{on the impact of}} surgery on the social lives of women with stress incontinence; to describe the social impact of surgery in a representative group; and to determine the effect of timing on the assessment of outcome. Design Longitudinal study: questionnaires before and three, six, and twelve months after surgery. Setting: Eighteen hospitals in North Thames region. Participants: Four hundred and forty-two women undergoing surgery for stress incontinence between January 1993 and June 1994. Main outcome measures: Post-operative recovery time, stress incontinence symptom impact index, activities of daily living, and cost of protection. Results: Post-operative recovery was uneventful for most women, but three months after surgery 24 % of those in paid employment beforehand were still on sick or unpaid leave. Most women (75 %) reported that stress incontinence had less adverse impact on their lives three months after surgery, though 18 % reported no change, and 7 % felt life was worse. The likelihood of improvement was similar regardless of whether pre-operative urodynamic studies had been conducted. The extent of improvement was dependent on pre-operative severity. Similar findings were obtained six and twelve months after surgery. After an initial slight but nonsignificant deterioration in their ability to carry out activities of daily living, women gained a slight benefit from surgery (proportion with no or only slight limitation rose from 72 % to 82 %; P= 0. 0001). The mean cost of <b>protection</b> (<b>pads</b> and towels) fell from £ 8. 59 a month before surgery to £ 2. 99 a month one year after surgery, by which time 68 % of women were not using protection. In contrast, 11 % were still spending over £ 10 a month. Conclusions: It is possible to collect standard data on the impact of surgery on social functioning and, thus, provide women with better information on likely outcomes. The benefits of pre-operative urodynamic investigations need to be assessed. The stability of the outcome measures over the first post-operative year suggest that outcomes need to be assessed only once and at any time from three to twelve months after the operation...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical EngineeringWilliam KuhnWhen enough charges {{accumulate}} on two objects, the air dielectric {{between them}} breaks down {{to create a}} phenomenon known as electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD is of great concern in the integrated circuit industry because of the damage it can cause to ICs. The problem will only become worse as process components become smaller. The three main types of ESD experienced by an IC are the human body model (HBM), the charged device model (CDM), and the machine model (MM). HBM ESD has the highest voltage while CDM ESD has the highest bandwidth and current of the three ESD types. Integrated circuits generally include ESD protection circuitry connected to their pads. Pads are {{the connection between the}} IC and the outside world, making them the required location for circuitry designed to route ESD events away from the IC's internal circuitry. The most basic <b>protection</b> <b>pads</b> use diodes connected from I/O to VDD and I/O to ground. A voltage clamp between VDD and ground is also necessary to protect against CDM and MM event types where the device may not yet have a low impedance supply path connected. The purpose of this research is to investigate the performance of ESD circuits and to develop a method for detecting the occurrence of an ESD event in an integrated circuit by utilizing IC fuses. The combination of IC fuses and detection circuitry designed to sense a broken fuse allows the IC to perform a built-in self-test (BIST) for ESD to identify compromised ICs, preventing manufacturers from shipping damaged circuits. Simulations are used to design an optimized protection circuit to complement the proposed ESD detection circuit. Optimization of an ESD pad circuit increases the turn-on speed of its voltage clamps and decreases the series resistance of its protection diodes. These improvements minimize the stress voltage placed on internal circuitry due to an ESD event. An ESD measurement setup is established and used to verify voltage clamp operation. This research also proposes an ESD detection circuit based on IC fuses, which fail during an ESD event. A variety of IC fuses are tested using the ESD measurement setup as well as a TLP setup {{in order to determine the}} time and current needed for them to break. Suitable IC fuses have a resistance less than 5 Ω and consistently break during the first trial...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} lightning <b>protection</b> {{system at}} <b>Pad</b> 39 B for the Space Shuttle is {{an outgrowth of}} a system that was put in place for the Apollo Program. Dr. Frank Fisher of Lightning Technologies was a key participant in the design and implementation of that system. He conveyed to the NESC team that the catenary wire provision was put in place quickly (as assurance against possible vehicle damage causing critical launch delays) rather than being implemented as a comprehensive system designed to provide a high degree of guaranteed protection. Also, the technology of lightning protection has evolved over time with considerable work being conducted by groups such as the electric utilities companies, aircraft manufacturers, universities, and others. Several accepted present-day methods for analysis of lightning protection were used by Drs. Medelius and Mata to study the expected lightning environment for the Pad 39 B facility and to analyze the degree of protection against direct lightning attachment to the Space Shuttle. The specific physical configuration directly affects the vulnerability, so cases that were considered included the RSS next to and rolled back from the Space Shuttle, and the GOx Vent Arm both extended and withdrawn from the ET.

50|$|The company’s origins {{began in}} 1969 {{when the first}} widely used lateral {{protective}} knee brace for athletes was designed and produced by Dr. Robert F. McDavid, {{the father of the}} company founder. In 1980 his son, Bob McDavid, officially co-founded the company McDavid Inc. to sell his braces and other sports equipment, alongside Terence Fee (currently vice-president of operations.) The company was founded in Bellwood, Illinois and run out of the co-founder’s basement. Bob McDavid remains the CEO of the company. McDavid first produced prophylactic braces for joints including the ankle, knee, upper extremities, neck, and eventually most other at risk areas of the body. By the mid-1980s McDavid had revenues of about $1 million, selling knee and ankle braces mainly to athletes from the high school to professional level. It {{was one of the first}} companies to produce single-hinge braces as opposed to those with a double-hinge sold by McDavid competitors. In addition to braces, McDavid also produces a line of sports clothing, pads, and sports equipment sold in three lines: SportMed (composed of braces, sleeves, wraps, guards, and straps), Sports <b>Protection</b> (for <b>pads,</b> supports, and other cushioning products), and Performance Apparel (its sports clothing and equipment line). Hex technology items, where closed cell foam padding is sewn directly into the fabric of sports clothing to protect at-risk parts of the body. In April 2014 NBA player DeAndre Jordan became a spokesperson for McDavid. Dwyane Wade was also a spokesperson for the company.|$|R
40|$|Terminally {{ill people}} with disabilities face {{multiple}} barriers when seeking physician aid in dying (PAD) in the United States. The first is legality.

40|$|Different uses {{of memory}} {{protection}} schemes have different needs {{in terms of}} granularity. For example, heap security can benefit from chunk separation (by using protected ”padding ” boundaries) and meta-data protection. However, such protection can be done at different granularity(eg. perword, per-block, or per-page), with different performance, cost and memory overhead tradeoffs for different applications. In this paper, we explore these tradeoffs {{for the purpose of}} heap security in order to discover whether the ”right” granularity exists and how the granularity of protection affects design decisions. We evaluate such tradeoffs based on the current heapsecurity approaches in a single address space operating system. The access control granularities we use are word, 8 -byte, 16 -byte, 32 -byte, and page. We find that none of these schemes is optimal across all applications. In some applications, excessive padding degrades caching performance for coarse-granularity schemes, while in others, large-block permission changes introduce large overheads for finer granularities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new twogranularity scheme, which uses word- and page-granularity <b>protection</b> to eliminate <b>padding</b> but allow fast page-size permission changes for large memory blocks. On all applications, this new scheme performs as well or better than the best single-granularity scheme. It also performs on par with the more complex Mondrian Memory Protection, which uses a complex trie structure and multiple permissions caching mechanisms to support a hierarchy of protection granularities...|$|R
40|$|With {{the age of}} {{hypersonic}} flight imminent {{just beyond}} the horizon, researchers are working hard at designing work-arounds for all the major problems {{as well as the}} minor quirks associated with it. One such issue, seemingly innocuous but one that could be potentially deadly, is the problem of interference heating due to surface protuberances. Although an ideal design of the external surfaces of a high-speed aircraft dictates complete smoothness to reduce drag, this is not always possible in reality. Control surfaces, sheet joints, cable <b>protection</b> <b>pads</b> etc. generate surface discontinuities of varying geometries, in the form of both protrusions as well as cavities. These discontinuities are most often small in dimension, comparable to the local boundary layer thickness at that location. Such protuberances always experience high rates of heat transfer, and therefore should be appropriately shielded. However, thermal shielding of the protrusions alone is not a full solution to the problem at hand. The interference caused to the boundary layer by the flow causes the generation of local hot spots {{in the vicinity of the}} protuberances, which should be properly mapped and adequately addressed. The work presented in this thesis aims at locating and measuring the heat flux values at these hot spots near the protrusions, and possibly formulating empirical correlations to predict the hot spot heat flux for a given set of flow conditions and protrusion geometry. Experimental investigations were conducted on a flat plate model and a cone model, with interchangeable sharp and blunt nose tips, with attached 3 D protuberances. Platinum thin-film sensors were placed around the protrusion so that the heat fluxes could be measured in its vicinity and the hottest spot located. These experiments were carried out at five different hypersonic free stream flow conditions generated using two shock tunnels, one of the conventional type, and the other of the free-piston driven type. The geometry of the protrusions, i. e., the height and the deflection angle, was also parametrically varied to study its effect on the hot spot heat flux. The results thus obtained for the flat plate case were compared to existing correlations in the open literature from a similar previous study at a much higher Reynolds number range. Since a mismatch was observed between the results of the current experiments and the existing correlations, a new empirical correlation has been developed to predict the hot spot heat flux, that is valid within the range of flow conditions studied here. A similar attempt was made for the case of the cone model, for which no previous correlations exist in the open literature. However, a global correlation covering the entire range of flow conditions used here could not be formed. A correlation that is valid for just one out of the five flow conditions used here is presented for the cones with sharp and blunt nose tips separately. Schlieren flow visualization was carried out to obtain a better understanding of the shock structures near the protuberances on both models. For most cases, where the protrusion height and deflection angle were large enough to cause flow separation immediately upstream of the protuberance, a separation shock was manifested which deflected some part of the boundary layer above the protuberance, while the rest of the fluid in the boundary layer entered a recirculating region in the separated zone before escaping to the side. Some preliminary computational analysis was conducted which confirmed this qualitatively. However, the quantitative match of surface heat flux between the simulations and experiments were not encouraging. Schlieren visualization revealed that for the flat plate case, the foot of the separation shock was located at a distance of 10. 5 to 12 times the protrusion height ahead of it, whereas in the case of the sharp cone, it was at a distance of 9 to 10. 5 times the protrusion height. The unsteady nature of the separation shock was also captured and addressed. Some preliminary experiments on boundary layer tripping were also conducted, the results of which have been presented here. From this analysis, it has become evident that a single global correlation cannot be formed which could be used for a wide range of flow conditions to predict the hot spot heat flux in interference interactions. The entire range of conditions that may be encountered during hypersonic flight has to be broken down into sections, and the interference heating pattern should be studied in each of these sections individually. By doing so, a series of different correlations can be formed at the varying flow conditions which will then be available for high-speed aircraft designers...|$|R

A stay on Mars is envisioned to last several months, and it would be cost prohibitive to take all the requirements for such a stay from earth. Therefore, future exploration missions will be required to be self-sufficient and utilize the resources available at the mission site to sustain human occupation.

50|$|Hobbs then {{switched}} {{his research}} focus to vehicle safety and, in 1985, he designed a demonstration Pedestrian Safety Car (based on a Mini Metro). (16-21) He later modified this Pedestrian Safety Car to incorporate current thinking in Frontal and Side impact protection. (22,23) For side impact, conventional wisdom held that protection came from strengthening {{the side of}} the car and providing <b>padding</b> <b>protection</b> {{on the inside of the}} door. Hobbs expressed his concern that many manufacturers were simply fitting door beams, located where they could increase the risk of injury. (24-31) Hobbs's modifications did improve the car, but the car still did not provide good protection or meet the proposed side impact test requirements. Elsewhere in France, Germany, and the UK another vehicle was tested. Although much weaker than the modified Metro, this car performed better. Amazed, Hobbs set out to find out why and to truly understand the side impact injury process. He discovered that a lighter door rather than a heavier door bounces off the impacting car and starts moving the occupant earlier, increasing the time the body has to absorb the impact, so reducing the severity of injuries. He also discovered that when the door is controlled to move in vertically, it spreads the load over the chest, abdomen and pelvis consequently avoiding its concentration on the vulnerable chest area, reducing the possibility of a fatal injury. The provision of padding, Hobbs also concluded, had to be very soft to help spread the load and cushion the impact. (32-35) These conclusions and research directly contributed to the development of the European Side Impact Directive.|$|R
