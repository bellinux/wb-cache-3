40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the fluoride concentration in the public water supply and the prevalence of dental fluorosis in schoolchildren between 7 and 15 years old, living in a peripheral district of the municipality of Bauru. Material and Methods: For this, fifty two water samples were collected on three different days of one week. These samples were analyzed for fluoride by means of the ion-sensitive electrode method (Orion 9609) coupled to a potentiometer (Procyon, model 720). In this method, 1. 0 mL of TISAB II (Orion) was added to 1. 0 mL of the sample. For the epidemiological survey of fluorosis, 52 schoolchildren of both genders, aged between 7 and 15 were assessed, with prior authorization from their caretakers. Only one <b>person</b> <b>examined</b> the children, after supervised toothbrushing and drying with cotton wool rolls. The TF index was used. Results: The fluoride concentrations in the water samples ranged from 0. 62 to 1. 20 mg/L, with a mean of 0. 9 mg/L. The prevalence of dental fluorosis was 33 %, with severity ranging from TF 1 to TF 4 (Kappa of 0. 73 and concordance of 83. 33 %). Conclusions: The results from the analysis of water samples indicated a fluoride concentration greater than recommended for Bauru.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{investigate}} the changes in macular function and macular morphology of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), due to photocoagulation, using the multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods: Thirty-five volunteers were in the control group, with one eye per <b>person</b> <b>examined</b> with the mfERG. Both the mfERG and OCT were conducted on 30 patients with diabetes who had severe NPDR before, and two, seven and 14 days after, treatment with photocoagulation. Results: Compared with the control group, the P 1 and N 1 response densities in the patients with NPDR appeared to decrease significantly at rings 2 - 3 and rings 3 - 4, respectively, whereas no difference was seen in the implicit times. At two days after photocoagulation, the P 1 and N 1 response densities decreased significantly in ring 1 and they were still lower than the pre-photocoagulation values at 14 days after photocoagulation. In addition, no change was found in the implicit times before and after photocoagulation. There was no obvious difference in the macular thickness after treatment. At two days after treatment, the P 1 response density in ring 1 negatively correlated with the corresponding macular thickness. Conclusion: The para-macular function was significantly impaired in those patients with severe NPDR and photocoagulation reduced the central macular function. Even after 14 days, the central macular function had not returned to pre-photocoagulation levels. School of Optometr...|$|E

More sensitive alternatives, such as mini-anion exchange centrifugation technique (mAECT) or capillary tube centrifugation (CTC), are more expensive. We used formal decision analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative HAT confi rmation algorithms in terms of cost per life saved. The effectiveness of the standard method, a combination of lymph node puncture (LNP), fresh blood examination (FBE), and thick blood fi lm (TBF), was 36. 8 %; the LNP-FBE-CTC-mAECT sequence reached almost 80 %. The cost per <b>person</b> <b>examined</b> ranged from € 1. 56 for LNP-FBE-TBF to € 2. 99 for LNP-TBF-CTC-mAECT-CATT (card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis) titration.

40|$|During {{the years}} 1991 - 1993, from May till October, specialists from the Federal Republic of Germany {{investigated}} both {{the environmental and}} population radiation exposure due to the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the former Soviet Union. In the survey an area of approximately 100, 000 km" 2 extending from Tula in Russia to Rovno in the Ukraine was investigated. This area included regions of low and high contamination levels in the three post-Soviet republics of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Up to seven environmental measuring vans from different German institutions {{took part in the}} field study on the determination of the local dose rates and of the burden of environmental samples and foodstuffs. The results agreed fairly well with those obtained by Russian scientists. The body content of radioactive cesium of more than 300, 000 individuals was examined. Up to 7 mobile whole-body counting laboratories were operational with a total number of 20 counters. Each <b>person</b> <b>examined</b> received an official certificate giving the result of the measurement. Observed activity levels were generally much less and in no case higher than the annual limit of intake acceptable for professional radiation workers. Only for about 2 % of the people examined did the results suggest the necessity of further observation by health physicists and physicians similar to the regular medical examination professional radiation workers undergo. The project was supplemented by the individual measurement of external doses. About 7000 thermoluminescence dosemeters were distributed and evaluated in the years 1992 and 1993. The results show a dependence on social and location factors. To complete the programme, blood samples from 100 Ukrainian individuals were investigated in 1993.

Dental caries data were collected in surveys by using the widely accepted DMF index (counting the number of decayed = D, missing due to decay = M, and filled = F teeth or tooth surfaces found in the mouth of each <b>person</b> <b>examined).</b> Selected data from three recent oral health studies in the United States were used in the publication. Comparisons with findings from the 1991 Indian Health Service (IHS) Patient Survey of Oral Health were used. Sampling methods and participant ages varied in each of the studies: 1) The 1990 World Health Organization (WHO) International Collaborative Study (Native American sample only, 3 age groups 12 - 13, 35 - 44, and 65 - 74); 2) The 1987 NIDR Dental Caries Prevalence Survey of U. S. School Children (approx. 40, 000 children 5 to 17 years of age); and 3) The 1985 NIRD Oral Health Survey of U. S. Employed and Seniors (20, 818 participants). The findings indicated the rate of dental caries declined in each age group since 1984. Children experienced the greatest reduction in DMF teeth, ranging from 47 percent for those aged 5 - 13 to 36 percent among those aged 14 - 19 years. Additionally, analysis of the data suggest that adults and children have benefited from the progress made by tribal and IHS programs providing sealant on occlusal surfaces, and water fluoridation during the past decade. Oral health objectives were proposed for Native American communities including: 1) reducing dental caries for the entire population; 2) increasing use of protective sealant on occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth; 3) reducing the prevalence of gingivitis, destructive periodontal disease, and permanent tooth loss; and 4) educating parents and caregivers of feeding practices that prevent baby bottle tooth decay...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of goiter and the median urinary iodine concentration {{are the most}} important indicators for assessing iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) and for defining criteria of the severity of any associated public health problem (1). For years, palpation has been the single method available for defining thyroid volume. A slight modification (2) of the method of Perez et al. (3) has been most commonly used: by definition, ‘a thyroid gland whose lateral lobes have a volume greater than the terminal phalanges of the thumbs of the <b>person</b> <b>examined</b> will be considered as goitrous’. When this criterion is met, overall thyroid volume is at least four to five times greater than normal (3). However, as technology progressed, ultrasonography became to be considered the most reliable method for the estimation of thyroid volume (4 – 7). School-age children are the most useful target group for IDD surveillance (1); consequently, normative values for thyroid volume measured by ultrasonography in iodine-replete schoolchildren were needed. After a few pre-liminary studies (Table 1), the normative values proposed by Gutekunst & Martin-Teichert (8) were those most commonly used. A major change as compared with palpation was that the criterion for goiter was now a thyroid volume above the 97 percentile of the reference population. The criteria of Gutekunst & Martin-Teichert (8) were also used during the early phase of a collaborative study on thyroid volume and urinary iodine conducted by Delange et al. (9) at 57 locations in 12 European countries and including 7599 schoolchildren aged 6 – 17 years. In this population as a whole there was, as could be expected, a highly significant inverse correla-tion between urinary iodine and the {{prevalence of}} goiter. However, an unexpected observation was that, when these criteria were used, the prevalence of goiter was systematically largely above the cut-off point of 5 % considered as the upper limit of normal (1) at all the locations of investigation, even when the median urinary iodine concentration was above the cut-off point of 100 mg/l. Therefore, the suitability of the criteria of Gutekunst & Martin-Teichert (8) was questioned, and updated normative values were derived from a cluster made of 3265 European schoolchildren from 23 differen...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. This {{dissertation}} is {{the analysis}} of sections 64, 65, 66 and 152 of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936. Sections 414 to 418 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 are also touched upon {{in so far as}} they relate to these sections of the Insolvency Act. These sections entail the compulsory attendance of the creditors 'meetings by the insolvent. At these meetings the interrogation of the insolvent regarding his insolvent estate is conducted. Its purpose is to ensure that the insolvent accounts for the assets of his estate and supply reasons for his bankruptcy. The information gathered thereat will assist in the due and fair distribution of his assets amongst his creditors. The purpose of this research is to examine whether the application of these sections to the insolvent person (juristic or natural) is in compliance with the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. The provisions provided for by this sections appears to be good, however there is another viewpoint. The fact that the insolvent and any other person interrogated may be compelled to divulge certain privilege information, even to the extent of incriminating himself (themselves) in the process seems to be violating certain rights of the person interrogated, for example, one's right not to incriminate himself This right especially comes to mind when one considers the fact that information divulged at the interrogations may be used against the person giving it in subsequent proceedings relating to perjury, administration of the insolvent estate, taking of oath and so forth. These sections also provides for the detention of the person who fails to comply with the provisions of this Act. The detention {{is said to be a}} mechanism that the legislature needs to ensure compliance and is not regarded as detention without trial. However, the detention has to be ordered by a judicial officer presiding over the meeting of creditors and not a person from the executive organ of the state. Case law has however indicated that there is nothing unconstitutional about these sections as long as they are applied with precautionary measures, taking into consideration the rights of the interrogatee or <b>person</b> <b>examined</b> as entrenched in the Bill of Rights. The principles of justice also require that every one shall be entitled to fair proceedings. Master...|$|E
