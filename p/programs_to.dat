We will present the basic ideas behind three of these applications: that of linear <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> probabilistic logic, that of nonlinear <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> Bayesian logic, and that of integer <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> Dempster-Shafer theory. A mathematical programming approach not only provides a practical means of computing inferences, as in probabilistic logic and Dempster-Shafer theory, but it can suggest new types of logic for dealing with uncertainty, as in the cas [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Consequently, Taiji's bid {{to expand}} their school lunch <b>programs</b> <b>to</b> include dolphin and whale meat brought about much controversy. An {{estimated}} 150kg (330lbs) of dolphin meat was served in Taiji school lunches in 2006. In 2009, dolphin meat was taken off school menus because of the contamination. The levels of mercury and methylmercury taken from samples of dolphin and whale meat sold at supermarkets {{most likely to be}} providing the schools' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry. The mercury levels were so high that the Okuwa Co. supermarket chain in Japan permanently removed dolphin meat from its shelves.|$|E
