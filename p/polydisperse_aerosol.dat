2500|$|For a {{monodisperse}} aerosol, {{a single}} number—the particle diameter—suffices {{to describe the}} size of the particles. However, more complicated particle-size distributions describe the sizes of the particles in a <b>polydisperse</b> <b>aerosol.</b> This distribution defines the relative amounts of particles, sorted according to size. One approach to defining the particle size distribution uses a list of the sizes of every particle in a sample. However, this approach proves tedious to ascertain in aerosols with millions of particles and awkward to use. Another approach splits the complete size range into intervals and finds the number (or proportion) of particles in each interval. One then can visualize these data in a histogram with the area of each bar representing the proportion of particles in that size bin, usually normalised by dividing the number of particles in a bin by the width of the interval so that the area of each bar is proportionate to the number of particles in the size range that it represents.

The model, formulated in the multi-species and compressible framework, is solved using the sectional discretization of the droplet size distribution function to accurately capture size-dependent aerosol dynamics such as droplet drift, gravitational settling and diffusion. These three mechanisms are implemented in a consistent way in the model, guaranteeing that the total droplet mass as given by the droplet size distribution is always equal to the total droplet mass due to the mass concentration fields. To validate the model, we simulate monodisperse glycerol aerosol deposition inside the lung cast, for which experimental data is available.

40|$|Cloud {{droplet size}} {{distributions}} (CDSDs), which {{are related to}} cloud albedo and lifetime, are usually broader in warm clouds than predicted from adiabatic parcel calculations. We investigate a mechanism for the CDSD broadening using a Lagrangian bin-microphysics cloud parcel model that considers the condensational growth of cloud droplets formed on <b>polydisperse,</b> sub-micrometer <b>aerosols</b> in an adiabatic cloud parcel that undergoes vertical oscillations, such as those due to cloud circulations or turbulence. Results show that the CDSD can be broadened during condensational growth {{as a result of}} Ostwald ripening amplified by droplet deactivation and reactivation, which is consistent with Korolev (1995). The relative roles of the solute effect, curvature effect, deactivation and reactivation on CDSD broadening are investigated. Deactivation of smaller cloud droplets, which is due to the combination of curvature and solute effects in the downdraft region, enhances the growth of larger cloud droplets and thus contributes particles to the larger size end of the CDSD. Droplet reactivation, which occurs in the updraft region, contributes particles to the smaller size end of the CDSD. In addition, we find that growth of the largest cloud droplets strongly depends on the residence time of cloud droplet in the cloud rather than the magnitude of local variability in the supersaturation fluctuation. This is because the environmental saturation ratio is strongly buffered by smaller cloud droplets. Two necessary conditions for this CDSD broadening, which generally occur in the atmosphere, are: (1) droplets form on <b>polydisperse</b> <b>aerosols</b> of varying hygroscopicity and (2) the cloud parcel experiences upwards and downwards motions. Therefore we expect that this mechanism for CDSD broadening is possible in real clouds. Our results also suggest {{it is important to consider}} both curvature and solute effects before and after cloud droplet activation in a cloud model.

The {{remote sensing}} problem of <b>polydispersed</b> <b>aerosols</b> {{in the single}} {{scattering}} approximation is a classical example of the first kind Fredholm integral equation. Assuming that the prediction errors due to arbitrarily small perturbations in the complex aerosol refractive index or the upper radius bounds are negligible, one can form the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the kernel matrix {{in terms of the}} singular value of the kernel matrix and the number of measurement wavelengths. The smoothness of the kernel matrix and the information potentialities vary, depending on the choice of a combination of sounding channels. The optimal choice is the one that provides the largest SNR. A numerical simulation with 11 samples of possible combinations is conducted in order to demonstrate that the prediction of aerosol extinction measurements using singular value decomposition is comparable with reference values. If two similar prediction results (e. g. one with SNR 2. 019 and the other 2. 132) are obtained, the higher value is apparently better, however, a drawback in this case is that the prediction errors increase with the increasing number of sounding channels used. In conclusion, it is noted that the information on the smoothness and potentialities of the kernel matrix has to be factorized in order to increase the success rate of the prediction.

40|$|An {{existing}} equilibrium absorptive partitioning {{model for}} calculating the equilibrium gas and particle concentrations of multiple semi-volatile organics within a bulk aerosol is extended {{to allow for}} multiple involatile aerosol modes of different sizes and chemical compositions. In the bulk aerosol problem, the partitioning coefficient determines the {{fraction of the total}} concentration of semi-volatile material that is in the condensed phase of the aerosol. This work modifies this definition for multiple <b>polydisperse</b> <b>aerosol</b> modes to account for multiple condensed concentrations, one for each semi-volatile on each involatile aerosol mode. The pivotal assumption in this work is that each aerosol mode contains an involatile constituent, thus overcoming the potential problem of smaller particles evaporating completely and then condensing on the larger particles to create a monodisperse aerosol at equilibrium. A parameterisation is proposed in which the coupled non-linear system of equations is approximated by a simpler set of equations obtained by setting the organic mole fraction in the partitioning coefficient to be the same across all modes. By perturbing the condensed masses about this approximate solution a correction term is derived that accounts for many of the removed complexities.

Both monodisperse and <b>polydisperse</b> <b>aerosols</b> were produced within the CAIMAN facility to challenge the instruments. The monodisperse test aerosols were selected in the 15 - 400 nm diameter range using a differential mobility analyser (DMA), and presented number concentrations of between 6. 10 2 and 2. 10 5 cm- 3. The <b>polydisperse</b> test <b>aerosols</b> presented modal diameters of between 8 and 270 nm and number concentrations between 4. 10 3 to 10 6 cm- 3. The behavior of the different devices is expressed as (1) the ratio of the reported diameter to the reference diameter, and (2) the ratio of the reported number concentration to the reference concentration. These results are displayed as boxplots to better represent the statistical distribution of the experimental results. For the group of electrical mobility spectrometers, a good agreement between SMPS and FMPS and the reference was demonstrated. A slight tendency for the Nanoscan to underestimate particle size distribution for particles above around 100 nm was observed. The data reported for the group of diffusion chargers demonstrate that all, except the Nanotracer, show a tendency to underestimate particle diameter, by a factor around- 40 % to- 10 %. In the case of particle concentration, larger deviations were observed. Ce poster présente une étude sur les performances des appareils portables dédiés à la mesure en temps réel de la concentration en nombre de particules et la (distribution en) taille de particules dispersées dans l’air. Des <b>aérosols</b> monodispersés et <b>polydispersés,</b> consistant en des métaux (carbone, titane, constantan, argent), des sels (chlorure de sodium, chlorure de césium) et composés organiques (DEHS) ont été produits pour étudier les performances des instruments. Jusqu'à présent, les instruments suivants ont été étudiés : NanoScan (TSI, 3 spécimens), DiSCmini (TESTO, 6 spécimens), nanotracer (Philips Aerasense, 1 spécimen). Le comportement des différents dispositifs sera discuté dans la présentation...|$|R
40|$|For {{nanoparticles}} with nonspherical morphologies, e. g., open agglomerates or fibrous particles, it {{is expected}} that the actual density of agglomerates may be significantly different from the bulk material density. It is further expected that using the material density may upset the relationship between surface area and mass when a method for estimating aerosol surface area from number and mass concentrations (referred to as "Maynard's estimation method") is used. Therefore, it is necessary to quantitatively investigate how much the Maynard's estimation method depends on particle morphology and density. In this study, aerosol surface area estimated from number and mass concentration measurements was evaluated and compared with values from two reference methods: a method proposed by Lall and Friedlander for agglomerates and a mobility based method for compact nonspherical particles using well-defined <b>polydisperse</b> <b>aerosols</b> with known particle densities. <b>Polydisperse</b> silver <b>aerosol</b> particles were generated by an aerosol generation facility. Generated aerosols had a range of morphologies, count median diameters (CMD) between 25 and 50 nm, and geometric standard deviations (GSD) between 1. 5 and 1. 8. The surface area estimates from number and mass concentration measurements correlated well with the two reference values when gravimetric mass was used. The aerosol surface area estimates from the Maynard's estimation method were comparable to the reference method for all particle morphologies within the surface area ratios of 3. 31 and 0. 19 for assumed GSDs 1. 5 and 1. 8, respectively, when the bulk material density of silver was used. The difference between the Maynard's estimation method and surface area measured by the reference method for fractal-like agglomerates decreased from 79 % to 23 % when the measured effective particle density was used, while the difference for nearly spherical particles decreased from 30 % to 24 %. The results indicate that the use of particle density of agglomerates improves the accuracy of the Maynard's estimation method and that an effective density should be taken into account, when known, when estimating aerosol surface area of nonspherical aerosol such as open agglomerates and fibrous particles.
