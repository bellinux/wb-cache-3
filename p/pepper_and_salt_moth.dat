40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{resolution}} {{and reduce the}} noise in image, a framework of Multi-image super resolution reconstruction with <b>Pepper</b> <b>and</b> <b>Salt</b> noise is pro-posed. In the low resolution imaging model, the processes of movement, blur, down-sampling <b>and</b> <b>Pepper</b> <b>and</b> <b>Salt</b> noise are considered. Firstly, for the multiple low resolution images, the <b>Pepper</b> <b>and</b> <b>Salt</b> noise in each image is reduced through median filtering method. Then, super resolution reconstruction is carried out on the multiple de-noised low resolution images through iterative back projection al-gorithm. Experiments show that the visual effect and the peak {{signal to noise ratio}} (PSNR) of the super resolution reconstructed image is improved greatly...|$|R
