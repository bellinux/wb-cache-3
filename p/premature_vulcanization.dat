40|$|The {{effect of}} carbon black P 803 {{different}} manufacturers on the complex properties of rubber for {{the manufacture of}} molded rubber products. Pick up objects and methods. As objects of study chosen rubber mixture based {{on a combination of}} rubber SKI- 3 and SKD, and rubber compounds based on natural rubber. Found that the use of carbon black P 803 from different manufacturers have different effects on the viscosity index, resistance to aging under static compressive strain on the kinetics of vulcanization of rubber mixtures in which it was determined that the most extensive period of induction are rubber compounds using carbon black products P 803 JSC “Tuymazytechcarbon” and rubber mixture with its addition have low curing rate due to a low pH aqueous suspensions. The studies show that the carbon black producer JSC “Ivanovo techcarbon and rubber” having a high pH value of an aqueous suspension, the rate of vulcanization of the rubber composition is quite high, as well as an increase in pH increases the activity of the carbon black at the time of mixing and causes <b>premature</b> <b>vulcanization</b> of rubber mixtures. The results obtained allowed to propose a rubber composition based on a combination of rubber SKI- 3 and SKD with the addition of carbon black P 803 producer of JSC “Tuymazytechcarbon” for the production of shock absorbers, which can be manufactured by JSC “Belarus’rezinotekhnika” without changing the production scheme of molded rubber products...|$|E
