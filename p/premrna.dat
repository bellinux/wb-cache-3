This transformation is largely {{manifested in the}} expression of hybrid fibers, in which both slow MHC and either fast type IIx or fast type IIa MHC become simultaneously co-expressed. These observations suggest that the slow MHC is targeted for degradation, evidenced by the net loss in slow MHC in the atrophying muscle (fibers), {{while at the same}} time, according to <b>premRNA</b> and mRNA analyses, up-regulation of the faster MHC genes by transcriptional and/or pretranslational processes occurs. More recent studies on this topic clearly suggest that the type IIx MHC, which is a faster isoform than the IIa type, is more abundantly expressed.

The isolation of nuclear matrix included the removal of chromatin and of 0. 4 M KCl-soluble material. HnRNP, isolated by a standard method was also treated by 0. 4 M KCl. Both isolation procedures caused the removal of DNA, histones, a fraction of small nuclear RNA and of nonhistone proteins including the hnRNP proteins in the 30 000 - 40 000 mol. wt. range. High resolution autoradiography showed that hnRNA remained associated with the residual fibrils in both structures. They both contained the same <b>premRNA</b> and maturation products as shown by the analysis of the transcripts of the early region 3 of adenovirus 2. In addition, the small nuclear RNA and protein of the salt-resistant complexes were also present in the matrix. The results are compatible with the idea that the salt-resistant complexes from hnRNP constitute the fibrils associated with <b>premRNA</b> in the nucleoplasmic matrix.

40|$|We {{examine the}} IFN-α/β-independent {{activation}} of cellular transcription that constitutes an early antiviral response of cells against influenza A and B viruses, which cause widespread epidemics in humans. We show that influenza B virus induces the synthesis in human cells of several mature mRNAs encoded by genes containing an IFN-α/β-stimulated response element (ISRE). Consequently, the IFN regulatory factor- 3 transcription factor, which {{is required for}} the transcription of ISRE-controlled genes, is activated after influenza B virus infection. The production of these cellular mRNAs, some of which encode antiviral proteins, is independent of not only IFN-α/β, but also viral protein synthesis. These mature cellular antiviral mRNAs are not produced after infection with influenza A virus, but IFN regulatory factor- 3 is activated and the transcription of the ISRE-controlled p 56 gene is induced. Consequently, like other newly synthesized cellular <b>premRNAs</b> in influenza A virus-infected cells, the posttranscriptional processing of <b>premRNAs</b> encoded by ISRE-controlled genes is inhibited. Previous work has established that such posttranscriptional inhibition is mediated by the viral NS 1 A protein. This unique, global countermeasure against the early, IFN-α/β-independent antiviral response of cells may be an important factor in the pathogenicity of influenza A virus infection...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{expression}} in mitochondria of kinetoplastid protozoa requires RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process which involves insertion or deletion of uridine residues at specific sites within mitochondrial <b>premRNAs.</b> Sequence specificity of the RNA editing process is mediated by oligo-uridylated small, noncoding RNAs, designated as guide RNAs (gRNAs). In this study, we have analyzed the small ncRNA transcriptome from kinetoplast mitochondria of Leishmania tarentolae by generating specialized cDNA libraries encoding size-selected RNA species. Through this screen, {{a significant number}} of novel oligo-uridylated RNA species, which we have termed oU-RNAs, has been identified. Most novel oU-RNAs are present as stable RNA species in mitochondria as assessed by northern blot analysis. Thereby, novel oU-RNAs show similar expression levels and sizes as previously reported for canonical gRNAs. Several oU-RNAs are transcribed from both strands of the maxicircle and minicircles components of the mitochondrial genome, from regions where up till now no transcription has been reported. Two stable oU-RNAs exhibit an anchor sequence in antisense orientation to known gRNAs and thus might regulate editing of respective <b>premRNAs.</b> A number of oU-RNAs map in antisense orientation to non-edited protein-coding genes suggesting that they might function by a different mechanism. In addition, our screen shows that all kinetoplast-derived RNAs are prone to some degree of uridylation...|$|R

These differences do not simply correlate with the complexity, nuclear abundance, or position within overall nuclear space.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the function of}} hnRNP in the splicing of <b>premRNA,</b> we studied {{the distribution of the}} transcripts from the early region 3 of adenovirus- 2 in hnRNP from infected HeLa cells. In addition to premRNAs and mRNAs, we detected excised IVS 1 and the products of cleavage of <b>premRNA</b> at the 5 ' splice site of IVS 1 (free leader 1 and IVS 1 -exon 2). All these molecules were present in hnRNP and persisted in the salt-resistant complexes after a 400 mM KCl treatment. None of them was exclusively part of the salt dissociable monoparticles. The precursors, intermediates and products of the splicing reaction were associated with both monoparticles and salt resistant complexes. This eliminates the possibility that one of the classes of RNP is exclusively involved in one of the steps of RNA processing. Whereas the size of hnRNP was related to that of its RNA for most molecules, the small molecules free leader 1 and excised IVS 1 were found in the large hnRNP containing <b>premRNA</b> as well as in small size hnRNP. A probable interpretation of these results is that the cleavage products are associated with the premRNP complex immediately after cleavage and are then released {{in the form of an}} individual RNP...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear {{transcripts}} {{of the early}} region 3 from adenovirus- 2 were studied {{for the presence of}} the cleavage products of <b>premRNA</b> at the 5 ' splice site of the first intervening sequence.

The intron of the intron-exon 2 molecule is at least partially in a lariat form. A study of the time course of appearance of the 2 molecules shows that their formation occurs after the synthesis of <b>premRNA,</b> the lag period being no more than 1 - 2 min and before the formation of mature mRNA which starts accumulating after 3 - 4 min.

40|$|Sex-lethal (Sxl), {{the master}} {{regulatory}} gene of Drosophila somatic sex determination, is stably maintained in an on or an off state by autoregulatory control of Sxl <b>premRNA</b> processing. Establishment {{of the correct}} Sxl splicing pattern requires the coordinate regulation of two Sxl promoters. The first of these promoters, SxlPe, responds to the female dose of two X chromosomes to produce a pulse of Sxl protein that acts on the <b>premRNA</b> products from the second promoter, SxlPm, to establish the splicing loop. SxlPm is active in both sexes throughout most of development, but nothing is known about how SxlPm is expressed during the transition from X signal assessment to maintenance splicing. We found that SxlPm is activated earlier in females than in males {{in a range of}} Drosophila species, and that its expression overlaps briefly with that of SxlPe during the syncytial blastoderm stage. Activation of SxlPm depends on the scute, daughterless, and runt transcription factors, which communicate X chromosome dose to SxlPe, but is independent of the X signal element sisA and the maternal co-repressor groucho. We show that DNA sequences regulating the response of SxlPe to the X chromosome dose also control the sex-differential response of SxlPm. We propose that co-expression of Sxl protein and its <b>premRNA</b> substrate facilitates the transition from transcriptional to splicing control, and that delayed activation of SxlPm in males buffers against the inappropriate activation of Sxl by fluctuations in the strength of the X chromosome signal...|$|E

40|$|How {{splicing}} {{factors are}} recruited to nascent transcripts in the nucleus {{in order to}} assemble spliceosomes on newly synthesised pre-mRNAs is unknown. To address this question, we compared the intranuclear trafficking kinetics of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNP) and non-snRNP proteins in the presence and absence of splicing activity. Photobleaching experiments clearly show that spliceosomal proteins move continuously throughout the entire nucleus independently of ongoing transcription or splicing. Using quantitative experimental data, a mathematical model was applied for spliceosome assembly and recycling in the nucleus. The model assumes that splicing proteins move by Brownian diffusion and interact stochastically with binding sites located at different subnuclear compartments. Inhibition of splicing, which reduces the number of pre-mRNA binding sites available for spliceosome assembly, was modeled as {{a decrease in the}} on-rate binding constant in the nucleoplasm. Simulation of microscopy experiments before and after splicing inhibition yielded results consistent with the experimental observations. Taken together, our data argue against the view that spliceosomal components are stored in nuclear speckles until a signal triggers their recruitment to nascent transcripts. Rather, the results suggest that splicing proteins are constantly diffusing throughout the entire nucleus and collide randomly and transiently with <b>premRNAs...</b>|$|R

Here {{we show that}} YTHDC 1 promotes exon inclusion in targeted mRNAs through recruiting pre-mRNA splicing factor SRSF 3 (SRp 20) while blocking SRSF 10 (SRp 38) mRNA binding. Transcriptome assay with PARCLIP-seq analysis revealed that YTHDC 1 -regulated exon-inclusion patterns {{were similar to those}} of SRSF 3 but opposite of SRSF 10. In vitro pull-down assay illustrated a competitive binding of SRSF 3 and SRSF 10 to YTHDC 1. Moreover, YTHDC 1 facilitates SRSF 3 but represses SRSF 10 in their nuclear speckle localization, RNA-binding affinity, and associated splicing events, dysregulation of which, as the result of YTHDC 1 depletion, can be restored by reconstitution with wild-type, but not m(6) A-bindingdefective, YTHDC 1.

According to current evidence the long (CUG) n segment is involved in entrapment of muscleblind (Mbnl) proteins in ribonuclear aggregates and stabilized expression of CUG binding protein 1 (CUGBP 1), causing aberrant <b>premRNA</b> splicing and associated pathogenesis in DM 1 patients. Here, {{we report on the}} use of antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) in a therapeutic strategy for reversal of RNA-gain-of-function toxicity. Using a previously undescribed mouse DM 1 myoblast−myotube cell model and DM 1 patient cells as screening tools, we have identified a fully 2 ′-O-methyl-phosphorothioate-modified (CAG) 7 AON that silences mutant DMPK RNA expression and reduces the number of ribonuclear aggregates in a selective and (CUG) n-length-dependent manner. Direct administration of this AON in muscle of DM 1 mouse models in vivo caused a significant reduction in the level of toxic (CUG) n RNA and a normalizing effect on aberrant <b>premRNA</b> splicing.

Here, we use Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show a way by which trans-spliced mRNAs can be generated. We demonstrate that a pretRNA inserted into a <b>premRNA</b> context directs the splicing reaction precisely to the sites of the tRNA intron. A suppressor pretRNA gene was inserted, in cis, into the sequence encoding the third cytoplasmic loop of the Ste 2 or Ste 3 G protein-coupled receptor. The hybrid RNAs are spliced at the specific pretRNA splicing sites, releasing both functional tRNAs that suppress nonsense mutations and translatable mRNAs that activate the signal transduction pathway. The RNA molecules extracted from yeast cells were amplified by RT-PCR, and their sequences were determined, confirming {{the identity of the}} splice junctions. We then constructed two fusions between the <b>premRNA</b> sequence (STE 2 or STE 3) and the 5 ′- or 3 ′-pretRNA half, so that the two hybrid RNAs can associate with each other, in trans, through their tRNA halves. Splicing occurs at the predicted pretRNA sites, producing a chimeric STE 3 -STE 2 receptor mRNA. RNA trans-splicing mediated by tRNA sequences, therefore, is a mechanism capable of producing new kinds of RNAs, which could code for novel proteins...|$|E
40|$|RNA editing inserts and deletes uridylates (U’s) in kinetoplastid {{mitochondrial}} pre-mRNAs by {{a series}} of enzymatic steps. Small guide RNAs (gRNAs) specify the edited sequence. Editing, though sometimes extensive, is precise. The effects of mutating pre-mRNA and gRNA sequences in, around, and upstream of the editing site on the specificity and efficiency of in vitro insertion editing were examined. U’s could be added opposite guiding pyrimidines, but guiding purines, particularly A’s, were required for efficient ligation. A base pair between mRNA and gRNA immediately upstream of the editing site was not required for insertion editing, although it greatly enhanced its efficiency and accuracy. In addition, a gRNA/mRNA duplex upstream of the editing site enhanced insertion editing when it was close to the editing site, but prevented cleavage, and hence editing, when immediately adjacent to the editing site. Thus, several aspects of mRNA-gRNA interaction, as well as gRNA base pairing with added U’s, optimize editing efficiency, although they are not required for insertion editing. In kinetoplastid RNA editing, uridylates (U’s) are inserted and removed at specific sites in mitochondrial (mt) <b>premRNAs</b> {{by a series}} of enzymatic steps to form mature, functional mRNAs (for recent reviews, see references 13, 17, and 37).

40|$|Abstract. As {{they are}} transcribed, RNA {{polymerase}} II transcripts (hnRNAs or pre-mRNAs) associate with hnRNP proteins and snRNP particles, and {{the processing of}} pre-mRNA occurs within these ribonucleoprotein complexes. To better {{understand the relationship between}} hnRNP proteins and snRNP particles and their roles in mRNA formation, we have visualized them as they associate with nascent transcripts on the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster salivary glands. Simultaneous pairwise detection of the abundant hnRNP proteins hrp 36, hrp 40, and hrp 48 by direct double-label immunofluorescence microscopy reveals all of these proteins are bound to most transcripts, but their relative amounts on different tran-scripts are not fixed. Numerous differences in the relative amounts of snRNP particles and hnRNP proteins on nascent transcripts are also observed. These observations directly demonstrate that individual hnRNP proteins and snRNP particles are differentially associated with nascent transcripts and suggest that different pre-mRNAs bind different combinations of these factors to form transcript-specific, rather than a single type of, hnRNA-hnRNP-snRNP complexes. The distinct and specific constellation of hnRNP proteins and snRNP particles that assembles on different <b>premRNAs</b> is likely to affect the fate and pathway of processing of these transcripts.

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster {{is one of}} {{the most}} well studied genetic model organisms; nonetheless, its genome still {{contains}} unannotated coding and non-coding genes, transcripts, exons and RNA editing sites. Full discovery and annotation are pre-requisites for understanding how the regulation of transcription, splicing and RNA editing directs the development of this complex organism. Here we used RNA-Seq, tiling microarrays and cDNA sequencing to explore the transcriptome in 30 distinct developmental stages. We identified 111, 195 new elements, including thousands of genes, coding and non-coding transcripts, exons, splicing and editing events, and inferred protein isoforms that previously eluded discovery using established experimental, prediction and conservation-based approaches. These data substantially expand the number of known transcribed elements in the Drosophila genome and provide a high-resolution view of transcriptome dynamics throughout development. Drosophila melanogaster is an important non-mammalian model system that has had a critical role in basic biological discoveries, such as identifying chromosomes as the carriers of genetic information and uncovering the role of genes in development. Because it shares a substantial genic content with humans, Drosophila is increasingly used as a translational model for human development, homeostasis and disease. High-quality maps are needed for all functional genomic elements. Previous studies demonstrated that a rich collection of genes is deployed during the life cycle of the fly. Although expression profiling using microarrays has revealed the expression of, 13, 000 annotated genes, it is difficult to map splice junctions and individual base modifications generated by RNA editing using such approaches. Single-base resolution is essential to define precisely the elements that comprise the Drosophila transcriptome. Estimates of the number of transcript isoforms are less accurate than estimates of the number of genes. Whereas, 20 % of Drosophila genes are annotated as encoding alternatively spliced <b>premRNAs,</b> splice-junction microarray experiments indicate that this number is at least 40 % (ref. 7). Determining the diversity of mRNAs generated by alternative promoters, alternative splicing and RNA editing will substantially increase the inferred protein repertoire. Non-coding RNA genes (ncRNAs) including short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAS (miRNAs) (reviewed in ref. 10), and longer ncRNAs such as bxd (ref. 11) and rox (ref. 12), have important roles in gene regulation, whereas others such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are important components of macromolecular machines such as the ribosome and spliceosome. The transcription and processing of these ncRNAs must also be fully documented and mapped. As part of the modENCODE project to annotate the functional elements of the D. melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes, we used RNA-Seq and tiling microarrays to sample the Drosophila transcriptome at unprecedented depth throughout development from early embryo to ageing male and female adults.

40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A 2 /B 1 gene {{participates in}} at least six cellular processes: telomere biogenesis and maintenance, packaging of nascent <b>premRNAs,</b> alternative splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA cytoplasmic trafficking and translation initiation. At {{the start of this}} project the mouse gene had not yet been described, however, the human gene was known to produce two protein isoforms, A 2 and B 1, but the functional boundaries between these two proteins were ill defined. The characterisation of the mouse hnRNP A 2 /B 1 gene and its protein isoforms was, therefore, undertaken to facilitate research in mouse which would help to define functional differences between the protein isoforms. The mouse gene was found to be a 14 kb, single-copy gene located on chromosome 6 B 3, comprised of 12 exons and 11 introns. This gene was regulated by a housekeeping-style promoter which was predicted to be affected by processes such as cell differentiation and maturation, cell cycle progression and stress responses. Transcription from this gene, and the human orthologue, gave rise to a number of RNAs that encoded four protein isoforms through alternative splicing of exons 2 and 9 : B 1, A 2, B 1 b and A 2 b. In mouse, the expression and alternative splicing of the hnRNP A 2 /B 1 transcripts were influenced by tissue-type and age. A subset of these transcripts also exhibited alterations to their 3  UTRs such as retention of the 11 th intron, alternative polyadenylation and 3  UTR extension. The extended 3  UTR region, intron 11 and sequence flanking the alternatively spliced exons were highly conserved between mouse and human (over 90 %) and were predicted to contain regulatory motifs that governed post-transcriptional modifications to the RNA messages. The mouse genome was also shown to conta{{in at least}} six processed pseudogenes derived from the hnRNP A 2 /B 1 gene, five of which were unlikely to be functional due to frequent variations from the real gene sequence, including insertions, deletions and rearrangements. The remaining pseudogene, pseudogene 1, could give rise to an independent source of A 2 proteins and its status is yet to be determined. To date, it is unclear what role each of the four hnRNP A 2 /B 1 protein isoforms play in the cell. It was proposed that protein isoforms with a unique functional role would exhibit differences in subcellular localisation and expression patterns. In order to test this hypothesis, a number of biological tools were developed to distinguish between the highly similar proteins. In addition to two rabbit polyclonal antibodies previously raised in our lab that recognised all four protein isoforms (HA 2) and isoforms B 1 and B 1 b (HB 1), another four polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits and chickens. These antibodies were raised to recognise the following combinations: all four proteins (chicken HA 2), A 2 and A 2 b (chicken Hx 1 / 3), B 1 and A 2 (rabbit Hx 9) and A 2 b and B 1 b (rabbit Hx 8 / 10). These antibodies were demonstrated to be suitable for Western analyses and immunostaining studies, although antibodies Hx 1 / 3, Hx 8 / 10 and chicken HA 2 will require further purification to reduce nonspecific signals seen in immunostaining experiments. A number of fluorescently tagged fusion proteins were also engineered for each of the A 2 /B 1 protein isoforms. Western analyses showed that in mouse tissues and a number of immortalised cell lines, A 2 and B 1 were the major hnRNP A-type proteins present. Their abundance varied between tissue- and cell-type, but both were constitutively expressed. In contrast, A 2 b was only present in younger mouse tissues and was absent from most immortalised cell lines, while B 1 b was not detected in the samples examined. Localisation studies showed that in the immortalised cell lines, HaCaT and PC 12, the expressed protein isoforms and related fusion proteins localised to the cell nucleus but were excluded from the nucleoli and exhibited distinct perinucleolar staining. Little difference was observed between the localisation patterns of the protein isoforms A 2 and B 1 in these cell types. Interestingly in oligodendrocytes, a cell type known to carry out A 2 -dependent mRNA trafficking, B 1 was localised to the nucleus, A 2 was predominantly nuclear but also exhibited some cytoplasmic localisation and A 2 b was distributed almost evenly between the nucleus and cytoplasm (M. Maggipinto and R. Smith, personal communication). Hence, differences were observed in the localisation of these proteins but were cell-type dependent. In conclusion, the hnRNP A 2 /B 1 splice variants and their protein products were differentially expressed temporally and spatially, suggesting that these highly similar protein isoforms were likely to possess unique functional roles. Future research using the biological tools developed and described in this thesis, will be directed towards further defining the different roles each of the protein isoforms may have in the cellular processes associated with the hnRNP A 2 /B 1 gene. Lastly, the hnRNP A 2 /B 1 gene belongs to a sub-family of hnRNP genes that have arisen through chromosomal duplication events and include hnRNPs A 1 and A 3. Comparisons of their gene structures and subsequent RT-PCR assays have revealed that, in addition to the two previously described splice variants of the hnRNP A 3 gene, A 3 a and A 3 b, the eighth exon of the A 3 transcript was also alternatively spliced in humans and gave rise to two new variants termed A 3 c and A 3 d...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{maturation}} involves {{several steps}} prior to export of the mRNA {{out of the}} nucleus and translation in the cytoplasm. <b>PremRNA</b> 3 ’end processing is one of such steps, and comprises the endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation of the 3 ’end of the <b>premRNA.</b> These two steps involve more than 14 processing factors that coordinate multiple proteinprotein and proteinRNA interactions necessary to coordinate efficient cleavage and polyadenylation. To date, many of these interactions have been investigated biochemically and require additional structural characterization both to confirm and highlight key residues involved in substrate contacts. Further structural characterization will also open investigation into the mechanism of 3 ’end processing by providing structural insight into the coordination of multiple binding components. The cleavage factor Im, CF Im, is {{a component of the}} 3 ’end processing machinery and plays an important role early, during endonucleolytic cleavage, and additionally to increase polyadenylation efficiency and regulate poly(A) site recognition. CF Im is composed of a small 25 kDa subunit, CF Im 25, and a large, either 58 kDa, 68 kDa, or 72 kDa subunit. The 25 kDa subunit of CF Im interacts with both the RNA and other processing factors such as the poly(A) polymerase, Clp 1, and the larger subunit of CF Im. It is our goal to crystallize CF Im 25 alone and in complex with one of its interacting partners to better understand CF Im 25 contributions to <b>premRNA</b> 3 ’end processing. The structural investigation of CF Im 25 and its binding partners has accomplished four major objectives: 1) Characterized the crystal structure of CF Im 25 alone and bound to diadenosine tetraphosphate, 2) Provided insight into the oligomeric state of the CF Im complex, 3) Determined the binding properties of the Nudix domain of CF Im 25 and its function in 3 ’end processing, 4) Further characterize the interactions between CF Im 25 and PAP, CF Im 68, and Clp 1. These results demonstrate CF Im 25 is a dimer both in solution and in the crystal suggesting that {{it is likely to be}} a dimer in the CF Im complex. The nucleotide binging capability of CF Im 25 has no apparent role in 3 ’end processing in vitro but may provide a function outside of 3 ’end processing or may directly be involved in RNA recognition.

Strikingly, the reaction uses one of 3 branch points located 51, 55 or 59 residues upstream of the 3 ' splice site, a distance which is unusually long since all the branch points mapped up to now are located between 18 - 37 nucleotides of the 3 ' splice site. The dramatic accumulation of the corresponding lariat intermediates, likely related to this long spacing indicates that the second splicing step is relatively unefficient. The second kind of reaction analysed is a cryptic splicing which uses a 3 ' splice site generated by the junction of the 13 S mRNA exons, and leads to the formation of psi 12 S and psi 9 S mRNAs. In vitro, this reaction occurs only from a 13 S mRNA transcript, and not from the 13 S mRNA newly formed in the splicing assay, consistent with what has been observed in vivo. Thus, both the well known alternative and the minor reactions occurring in vivo from E 1 A <b>premRNA</b> and mRNAs are detected in vitro, implying that most of the alternative splicing machinery is reconstituted in the in vitro system...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of chalcone synthase A transgenes into petunia plants {{can result in}} degradation of chalcone synthase A RNAs and loss of chalcone synthase, a process called cosuppression or post-transcriptional gene silencing. Here we show that the RNA degradation is associated with changes in <b>premRNA</b> processing, i. e. loss of tissue specificity in transcript cleavage patterns, accumulation of unspliced molecules, and use of template-specific secondary poly(A) sites. These changes can also be observed at a lower level in leaves but not flowers of nontransgenic petunias. Based on this, a model is presented of how transgenes may disturb the carefully evolved, developmentally controlled post-transcriptional regulation of chalcone synthase gene expression by influencing the survival rate of the endogenous and their own mRNA...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Patients {{with type}} 2 {{diabetes}} have {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular disease and show abnormalities in the coagulation cascade. We investigated whether increased synthesis of tissue factor (TF) by platelets could contribute to the hypercoagulant state. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Platelets from type 2 diabetic patients and matched control subjects were adhered to different surface-coated proteins, and TF <b>premRNA</b> splicing, TF protein, and TF procoagulant activity were measured. RESULTS—Different adhesive proteins induced different levels of TF synthesis. A mimetic of active clopidogrel metabolite (AR-C 69931 MX) reduced TF synthesis by 56 � 10 %, an aspirinlike inhibitor (indomethacin) by 82 � 9 %, and the combination by 96 � 2 %, indicating that ADP release and thromboxane A 2 production followed by activation of P 2 Y 12 and thromboxane receptors mediate surface-induced TF synthesis.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of gene expression and regulation has undergone tremendous strides {{over the past}} several decades due to the successes of many laboratories in elucidating the control of transcription. But of course, the control of gene expression in mammalian cells extends to many levels beyond transcription and occurs in the nucleus and cytoplasm. For example, in the nucleus, pre-mRNA molecules undergo modifications involving the addition of a 5 � cap structure and for most, the addition of a 3 � poly(A) tract. These two modifications improve the translation and stability of mRNAs. Some genes encode alternative polyadenylation sites, the choice of which can determine the sequence of the 3 � noncoding region of the mRNA. Many <b>premRNA</b> molecules must also be processed by the splicing machinery to remove introns. In some cases, pre-mRNA...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies from}} {{independent}} laboratories have decisively disclosed {{the identity of}} the long-sought 3 – 5 ′ RNA exonuclease that trims posttranscriptionally the oligouridine tail of U 6, which is the small catalytic non-coding RNA promoting <b>premRNA</b> splicing within the spliceosome. This exonuclease, dubbed Mpn 1 or Usb 1, is a highly conserved enzyme that specifically removes uridines from the 3 ′ end of U 6, and directly generates terminal 2 ′, 3 ′ cyclic phosphate groups. Mutations in the human gene encoding hMpn 1 have been reported in patients diagnosed with the rare genodermatosis Clericuzio-type poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN). Mpn 1 -associated functions in U 6 small nuclear RNA posttranscriptional regulation suggest the existence of sophisticated cellular pathways involved in surveillance and stabilization of U 6. In this light, PN pathology {{might turn out to be}} a consequence of disturbed quality control of RNAs involved in crucial biological events...|$|E
40|$|Identifying protein–protein {{interactions}} {{is crucial}} for understanding cellular functions. Genomic data provides opportunities and challenges in identifying these interactions. We uncover the rules for predicting protein–protein interactions using a frequent pattern tree (FPT) approach modified to generate a minimum set of rules (mFPT), with rule attributes constructed from the interaction features of the yeast genomic data. The mFPT prediction accuracy is benchmarked against other commonly used methods such as Bayesian networks and logistic regressions under various statistical measures. Our study indicates that mFPT outranks other methods in predicting the protein–protein interactions for the database used. We predict a new protein–protein interaction complex whose biological function is related to <b>premRNA</b> splicing and new protein–protein interactions within existing complexes based on the rules generated. Our method is general {{and can be used}} to discover the underlying rules for protein–protein interactions, genomic interactions, structure-function relationships, and other fields of research...|$|E
40|$|Splicing factor 1 is {{a protein}} with several isoforms {{produced}} by alternative splicing {{of a single}} <b>premRNA.</b> These isoforms share a common N-terminal half and have distinct C-terminal portions. In this study, isoforms of SF 1 in different cell lines and tissues were identified, and their composition was investigated in different tissues. The results suggest that SF 1 isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The function of SF 1 and its isoforms is not clear. To provide information towards that, we used fluorescence microscopy and demonstrated that SF 1 is a new component of paraspeckles. Paraspeckles are formed around non-coding RNAs and although their function is not known, their protein content points to a role in transcriptional control and RNA metabolism. SF 1 has been shown previously to bind {{to a number of}} ncRNAs. Results from this thesis support the above finding and show that ncRNAs present in paraspeckles associate with SF 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceJmjd 6 (jumonji-domain-containing protein 6) is an Fe(II) - and 2 OG (2 -oxoglutarate) -dependent oxygenase that catalyses {{hydroxylation}} of lysine residues in proteins {{involved in}} <b>premRNA</b> splicing. Jmjd 6 plays {{an essential role}} in vertebrate embryonic development and has been shown to modulate alternative splicing in response to hypoxic stress. In the present study we show that an alternatively spliced version of Jmjd 6 lacking the polyS (polyserine) domain localizes to the nucleolus, predominantly in the fibrillar centre. Jmjd 6 with the polyS domain deleted also interacts with nucleolar proteins. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments and F 2 H (fluorescent 2 -hybrid) assays demonstrate that Jmjd 6 homo-oligomerization occurs in cells. In correlation with the observed variations in the subnuclear distribution of Jmjd 6, the structure of Jmjd 6 oligomers in vitro changes {{in the absence of the}} polyS domain, possibly reflecting the role of the polyS domain in nuclear/nucleolar shuttling of Jmjd 6. Key words: Fe(II) - and 2 -oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase, JmjC, lysine hydroxylation, nucleolus, polyserine domain, pre-mRNA splicin...|$|E
40|$|Circadian clocks allow organisms {{to adjust}} {{multiple}} physiological and developmental processes {{in anticipation of}} daily and seasonal changes in the environment. At the molecular level these clocks consist of interlocked feedback loops, involving transcriptional activation and repression, but also post-translational modifications. In a recently published work we provided evidence that PRMT 5, a protein arginine methyl transferase, {{is part of a}} novel loop within the circadian clock of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana by regulating alternative splicing of key clock mRNAs. We also found evidence indicating that PRMT 5 has a role in the regulation of alternative splicing and the circadian network in Drosophila melanogaster, although the clock connection in the latter is more elusive and seems to be at the output level. We conclude that alternative precursor messenger RNA (<b>premRNA)</b> splicing is part of the circadian program and could be a main actor in the fine-tuning of biological clocks. Here, we embrace the alternative splicing process as part of the circadian program and discuss the possibility that this mechanism is of fundamental relevance for the fine-tuning of biological clocks...|$|E
40|$|Here, {{we study}} an insect hnRNP M protein, {{referred}} to as Hrp 59. Hrp 59 is relatively abundant, has a modular domain organization containing three RNA-binding domains, is dynamically recruited to transcribed genes, and binds to <b>premRNA</b> cotranscriptionally. Using the Balbiani ring system of Chironomus, we show that Hrp 59 accompanies the mRNA from the gene to the nuclear envelope, and is released from the mRNA at the nuclear pore. The association of Hrp 59 with transcribed genes is not proportional {{to the amount of}} synthesized RNA, and in vivo Hrp 59 binds preferentially to a subset of mRNAs, including its own mRNA. By coimmunoprecipitation of Hrp 59 –RNA complexes and microarray hybridization against Drosophila whole-genome arrays, we identify the preferred mRNA targets of Hrp 59 in vivo and show that Hrp 59 is required for the expression of these target mRNAs. We also show that Hrp 59 binds preferentially to exonic splicing enhancers and our results provide new insights into the role of hnRNP M in splicing regulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We report {{studies using}} an {{enhanced}} experimental system to investigate organization of nuclear pre-mRNA metabolism. It {{is based on}} the powerful genetic system and polytene nuclei of Drosophila. We observe (at steady state) movement of a specific <b>premRNA</b> between its gene and the nuclear surface. This movement is isotropic, at rates consistent with diffusion and is restricted to a small nuclear subcompartment defined by exclusion from chromosome axes and the nucleolus. Bulk polyadenylated nuclear pre-mRNA precisely localizes in this same subcompartment indieating that most or all pre-mRNAs use the same route of intranuclear movement. In addition to association with nascent transcripts, snRNPs are coconcentrated with pre-mRNA in this subcompartment. In contrast to constitutive splices, at least one regulated splice occurs slowly and may undergo execution remotely from the site of pre-mRNA synthesis. Details of our results suggest that retention of incompletely spliced pre-mRNA {{is a function of the}} nuclear surface. We propose a simple model-based on channeled diffusion-for organization of intranuclear transport and metabolism of pre-mRNAs in polytene nuclei. We argue that this model can be generalized to all metazoan nuclei. M ETAZOAN nuclei contain specific substructures implicated in pre-mRNA metabolism (see, for example...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotes {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} splicing mechanisms to remove introns {{that would otherwise}} destroy the protein-coding capacity of genes. Nuclear <b>premRNA</b> splicing requires sequence motifs in the intron and is mediated by a ribonucleoprotein complex, the spliceosome. Here we demonstrate {{the presence of a}} splicing apparatus in the protist Trichomonas vaginalis and show that RNA motifs found in yeast and metazoan introns are required for splicing. We also describe the first introns in this deep-branching lineage. The positions of these introns are often conserved in orthologous genes, indicating they were present in a common ancestor of trichomonads, yeast, and metazoa. All examined T. vaginalis introns have a highly conserved 12 -nt 3 ′ splice-site motif that encompasses the branch point and is necessary for splicing. This motif is also found in the only described intron in a gene from another deep-branching eukaryote, Giardia intestinalis. These studies demonstrate the conservation of intron splicing signals across large evolutionary distances, reveal unexpected motif conservation in deep-branching lineages that suggest a simplified mechanism of splicing in primitive unicellular eukaryotes, and support the presence of introns in the earliest eukaryote...|$|E
40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, pre-mRNAs undergo several transformation {{steps to}} generate mature mRNAs. Recent {{studies have demonstrated}} that a diet containing a genetically modified (GM) soybean can induce modifications of nuclear constituents involved in RNA processing in some tissues of young, adult and old mice. On this basis, we have investigated the ultrastructural and immunocytochemical features of pre-implantation embryos from mice fed either GM or non- GM soybean in order to verify whether the parental diet can affect the morpho-functional development of the embryonic ribonucleoprotein structural constituents involved in <b>premRNA</b> pathways. Morphological observations revealed that the general aspect of embryo nuclear components is similar in the two experimental groups. However, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization results suggest a temporary decrease of pre-mRNA transcription and splicing in 2 -cell embryos and a resumption in 4 - 8 -cell embryos from mice fed GM soybean; moreover, pre-mRNA maturation seems to be less efficient in both 2 -cell and 4 - 8 -cell embryos from GM-fed mice than in controls. Although our results are still preliminary and limited to the pre-implantation phases, {{the results of this study}} encourage deepening on the effects of food components and/or contaminants on embryo development...|$|E
