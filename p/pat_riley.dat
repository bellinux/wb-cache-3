25|$|The Lakers {{were coming}} off a {{stunning}} second round loss to the Phoenix Suns in the playoffs.

5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president <b>Pat</b> <b>Riley</b> {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E

Following the season, Gill {{signed as a free agent}} with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Jackson and Strickland were both released, and Gatling retired.|$|R
50|$|One of Los Angeles Lakers {{head coach}} <b>Pat</b> <b>Riley's</b> most famous moments {{came when he}} promised the crowd a repeat {{championship}} during the Lakers' 1986-87 championship parade in downtown Los Angeles. With every {{team in the league}} now gunning for them, the Los Angeles Lakers still found a way to win, taking their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title. While the 1988 Lakers did not produce as many wins in the regular season as the 1987 Lakers, they were just as successful in the playoffs, becoming the first team in 19 years to repeat as champions. The Lakers met the physical Detroit Pistons in the 1988 NBA Finals.|$|R
5|$|In the 2006–07 season, Wade {{missed a}} total of 31 games due to injury. He was elected to his third {{straight}} All-Star Game and received All-NBA honors. He became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing at least 31 games in a season since Pete Maravich of the Utah Jazz earned Second Team honors during the 1977–78 season. Despite Wade's play, the Heat struggled {{early in the season}} with injuries and were 20–25 on February 1, 2007. But with Shaquille O'Neal healthy and <b>Pat</b> <b>Riley</b> returning to the bench after undergoing hip and knee surgeries respectively, the Heat seemed poised to surge into {{the second half of the}} season. However, during a game against the Houston Rockets on February 21, 2007, while attempting to steal the ball from Shane Battier, Wade dislocated his left shoulder and was assisted off the court in a wheelchair. After the injury, he was left with the decision to either rehabilitate the shoulder or undergo season-ending surgery. Wade later announced that he would put off the surgery and rehabilitate his shoulder with the intention of rejoining the team in time for the playoffs. After missing 23 games to recover from the injury, Wade returned to the active roster in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. Sporting a black sleeve to help protect his dislocated left shoulder, Wade played 27minutes and recorded 12 points and 8 assists, in an 111–103 overtime loss. For the season, Wade averaged 27.4 points, 7.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.1 steals per game shooting 50% from the field, and finished the season as the NBA's leader in PER (Player efficiency rating).|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2016, Wade announced, in {{a letter}} to Miami, that he had agreed to join the Chicago Bulls on a two-year deal worth $47.5 million. Wade said he felt {{unwanted}} and under-appreciated by Heat president <b>Pat</b> <b>Riley,</b> and noted that his relationship with Riley was in tatters by the end of negotiations. On July 15, he officially signed with the Bulls. He made his debut for the Bulls in their season opener on October 27, scoring 22 points with four made three-pointers in a 105–99 win over the Boston Celtics. The next day, Wade was fined $25,000 for making a throat slash gesture after a game-sealing three-point shot. On November 4, he scored 35 points on 12-of-20 shooting in a 117–104 loss to the New York Knicks. He made five three-pointers to give him 10 in five games in 2016–17; he had a total of seven in 2015–16. On January 21, 2017, he had 30 points and two key steals in the final minute of the Bulls' 102–99 win over the Sacramento Kings. After questioning the desire of the team's younger players following a loss to the Atlanta Hawks on January 25, Wade was fined and held out of the starting lineup against Miami on January 27 as punishment. On March 16, 2017, Wade underwent an MRI for a right elbow injury suffered {{in the fourth quarter of}} the Bulls' game against the Memphis Grizzlies the previous night. The results of the MRI showed a sprain and a small fracture in the elbow. Wade returned to action on April 8, 2017, scoring 14 points in a 107–106 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.|$|E

50|$|The 1987-88 season saw the Lakers {{win their}} {{eleventh}} NBA championship, defeating the Detroit Pistons in a seven-game final {{to become the}} NBA’s first repeat champions since the Boston Celtics {{did it in the}} 1968-69 NBA season. In doing so, the Lakers made good on <b>Pat</b> <b>Riley's</b> famous promise to repeat as champions. “I'm guaranteeing everybody here,” Riley said at the civic celebrations following the Lakers’ 1987 championship win, “next year we’re gonna win it again.” Before the Lakers could make good on Riley's guarantee, they swept the San Antonio Spurs in the opening round of the playoffs. The following two rounds however would not be as easy for the Lakers, but they still managed to get through a tough seven-game series against both the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Semis and the Dallas Mavericks Western Conference Finals.|$|R
