An investigation conducted on typical shredder hammer tips revealed the cutting edges getting worn out in service because the sugarcane is typically mixed with silica sand and rocks. This leads to enhanced erosion, and increased abrasion and impact causing catastrophic failures. In extreme cases a composite comprising sintered carbide vacuum fused between a mild steel backup plate and a high chrome alloy <b>powder</b> <b>block,</b> {{is used as a}} replaceable tip. This geometry acts as a twin cutter, where the initial compressive load is divided by the top sintered alloy, which enables the tungsten carbide to take the balance load with much higher efficiency, better cutting ratio and longer edge retention.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different experimental gnawing blocks as cage enrichment in rabbits. One hundred and five pregnant rabbit does housed in conventional wire cages were distributed according to their parity number in 4 homogenous treatment groups. Throughout one complete reproductive cycle (from day 18 of pregnancy till weaning of the litter), does either received no enrichment (controls) or a gnawing block hung from a wire on the cage wall. The 3 different blocks had the same basal components (wheat, molasses and oligoelements), but additionally wood mash (WM), wood mash+chicory pulp (ChP) or wood mash and inulin syrup (I) were respectively incorporated. After weaning, each litter continued to receive the same blocks as before and block consumption was measured as well as the performance of the fatteners. Weight development during the lactation was comparable except in does that received the wood <b>powder</b> <b>blocks.</b> These females had a significantly lower weight (P< 0. 05) at different time points compared to controls. Litter weight or kit weight was not significantly different at any of the time points measured, but again the treatment with wood <b>powder</b> <b>blocks</b> presented the lowest weight. The consumption of blocks during the whole reproduction cycle (42 d) was 11. 0 ± 1. 1; 6. 8 ± 1. 0 and 4. 4 ± 0. 7 g/d per cage for wood mash, chicory pulp or inulin enriched blocks, respectively. A very high variability in consumption of blocks was observed between females. This varied between 1 and 5 (I or ChP group) or even 1 and 9 blocks (WM group) per reproductive cycle. In fatteners, daily block consumption was significantly different (P< 0. 05) and reached on average 7. 0 ± 0. 5; 3. 9 ± 0. 5 and 2. 2 ± 0. 2 g/d per fattener, respectively for WM, ChP and I. Five females with a block and 5 females without a block were observed for 1 h 3 d before the expected parturition and at 2 time points during lactation. Distinction was made between 15 different behaviours. Although the presence of a block did not significantly increase the total number of behavioural transitions, locomotion and intake behaviour were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased when a gnawing block was available. The observation period influenced the frequency of many behavioural transitions and before parturition was significantly higher than post parturition, respectively 56. 1 ± 11. 1 vs. 13. 7 ± 3. 8 (Week 1, P< 0. 01) and 25. 1 ± 5. 5 (Week 2, P< 0. 01). However, a very large variability was observed between does and, moreover, some does were mostly inactive after parturition during the observation period. Based on the consumption pattern and behaviour, these gnawing blocks could be considered as cage enrichment and those with the chicory pulp best fulfilled the objective of a suitable gnawing material...|$|R

40|$|The large lattice {{constant}} {{observed in the}} region be-yond 40 % Sn is inexplicable. I f tin atoms are incorpora-ted as substitutional dopants, the {{lattice constant}} would be smaller than that of undoped sample because of the smaller size of Sn ions. One {{possible explanation is that}} tin atoms act as interstitial dopants, so that neighboring indium atoms are stretched apart due tQ the repulsion of the interstitial tin ions. Conclusions In this work, a simple evaporation process for produc-ing ITO films was developed, namely, deposit ion by di-rect co-evaporation of metall ic indium and tin. No in-dium tin oxide powder is required. Under the fol lowing deposit ion condit ions: (i) sub-strate temperature, 300 ~ (ii) deposit ion rate, 20 - 40 A/rain; (iii) oxygen pressure, 1 • 10 - 4 torr; (iv) Sn/(Sn + In) weight ratio, 75 %; and (v) film thickness, 1100 /~; a good quality ITO film having the fol lowing properties was produced, i. e. : (i) sheet resistance, 15 ~/D; (it) aver-age transmittance, 90 %; (iii) resistivity, 1. 8 • 10 - 4 s (iv) mobility, 30 cm~/V- 2; and (v) tarrier concentration, 1 • 1021 /cm~. The improvement in resistivity results mainly from increasing the tin contents in the evaporation source, which is believed to be a doping process. The major advantage of directly evaporating metal in-dium and tin over other methods (13, 14) is that no elabo-rate arrangement of In 20 ~ powder in evaporation source nor any expensive E-beam equipment is needed. The use of the Mo boat is better than the use of the crucible be-cause it does not have the problem of spil l ing of In 203 <b>powder,</b> <b>blocking</b> in the opening of the crucible by In 203 powder, or cracking during high deposition rate. In addi-tion, by controll ing the amount of metal indium, the av-erage deposit ion rate is so stable that no careful moni-toring of deposit ion rate is required during deposition. As a result, direct evaporat ion of meta l ind ium and tin makes it attractive in most applications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{microstructural}} changes on a 2 year-old cement paste, unprotected from contact with air, heated to various temperature regimes up to 1000 °C {{in steps of}} 100 °C for a constant period of 6 h. This work {{has been carried out}} using a thermal analysis technique and XRD. The parameter involved in this study is the state of the samples: <b>powdered</b> samples and <b>blocks</b> of paste. As a result, it is possible to monitor the major features of the experiments, i. e. the phase's existence domains and their growing of hydrated calcium silicate, portlandite, calcite as well as their decaying: alite, belite and lime. The result shows higher amounts of portlandite and carbonate calcium for the aged cement paste compared to fresh OPC. The carbonation is more marked for the blocks of paste while the crystallinity degree is higher for the powdered cement paste samples. The new portlandite formed during cooling continues to exist until the 1000 °C temperature plateau. Nevertheless, this portlandite is less crystalline than the original one, and its temperature of thermal decomposition gets lower. An increase in the total weight loss and in the crystallinity at 900 and 1000 °C, compared to 800 °C is also noted. The CSH dehydration to ²-C 2 S and C 3 S become significant above 600 °C and the corresponding rate increases with increasing temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of uric acid in blood is often unsatisfactory, and substances commonly present in blood, other than uric acid, may react with the reagents to give false values. This difficulty may {{be overcome by}} the use of uricase (Blauch and Koch, 1939; Bulger and Johns, 1941; Block and Geib, 1947), although in these methods some uric acid is probably lost during protein precipitation. The error due to unrelated substances may be equivalent to 0. 32 - 1. 54 mg. uric acid / 100 ml. (Block and Geib, 1947; Blauch and Koch, 1939). This paper describes uric acid values found in normal and pathological bloods before and after treatment with uricase, and indicates the error due to non-uric acid reacting substances. Method The procedure of Block and Geib (1947) has been modified by substituting for their arsenophospho-tungstic acid reagent, which gives too weak colours, the colour-developing reagents described by Brown (1945). By this method a linear relationship is obtained between uric acid concentration and optical density up to about 12 mg. uric acid/ 100 ml. plasma. As the intensity of the colour gradually increases even after one hour, all colours were read precisely the same number of minutes after adding the reagents. This was achieved by adding the phosphotungstic acid reagent to successive tubes at one-minute intervals. Reagents. -The following were used: (1) uricase <b>powder</b> (Buchanan, <b>Block,</b> and Christman, 1945); (2) uricase extract (Block and Geib, 1947); (3) 10 'A-(w/v) sodium tungstate; (4) 2 / 3 N H 2 SO 4; (5) lithium chloride solution, made by dissolving 7. 5 g. lithium chloride in water to which 35 ml. concentrated HCI has been added, and diluting to one litre; (6) 2. 90 °,. (w/v) silver nitrate; (7) 50 % (w/v) urea; (8) 120 z. (w/v) recrystallized sodium cyanide (made immedi-ately before use, otherwise blanks will have too great a density); (9) phosphotungstic acid reagent (Folin, 1934); (10) stock uric acid solution (Folin, 1930), but without methyl orange; (11) standard uric acid solu-tions made by diluting 2, 4, 6, and 8 ml. each of stock uric acid solution to 1, 000 ml., which. when used as described below, are equivalent to 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg. uric acid/ 100 ml; (12) N/ 3 HCI...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{manufacture}} {{refers to}} those processes {{in which a}} component can be manufactured {{without the need for}} specific tooling. This reduces the time between the design stage and production of finished parts compared with traditional methods such as forging or casting. There are a number of laser based rapid manufacture processes currently available such as selective laser sintering and direct laser deposition which are both based on adding powder form material to a substrate in a layer-by-Iayer fashion. Subtractive methods such as laser milling have been developed to a lesser extent but are lirriited by low removal rates and problems caused by heat affected zones. Here, three new subtractive methods of laser rapid manufacture of near net shape titanium components were developed. Each was investigated and the most promising was chosen for further research. The chosen method is based on water assisted laser processing of partially sintered titanium <b>powder.</b> A <b>block</b> is made by partial sintering of titanium powder in a furnace such that it has the properties of being strong enough to be handled but still porous, with the powder particles retaining their spherical shape. The block is then soaked in liquid so that the interconnected pores become filled. A laser is used to irradiate the surface of the block which causes material removal from the irradiation site in a predictable way. The process was characterised by investigating the influence of process parameters: sintering temperature, laser energy density, powder particle size, laser repetition rate and type of liquid used to soak the blocks. The process was also analysed using high-. speed photography, emission spectroscopy and the probe-beam extinction technique to gain an understanding of the material removal mechanism. A computational model of the process was proposed based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method. It was found that the mechanism of material removal is based on the explosive boiling of the liquid in the pores of the partially sintered block caused by heating from the laser. The rapid expansion of the exploding water creates a pressure which breaks the weak bonds between particles and ejects them from the surface. The new method can be faster than the current additive laser based rapid manufacture techniques and uses lower laser powers than the current laser milling processes. This is achieved through the choice of experimental conditions and laser parameters. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Researchers have {{investigated}} several therapeutic approaches to treat non-union fractures. Among these, bioactive glasses and glass ceramics {{have been widely}} used as grafts. This class of biomaterial has the ability to integrate with living bone. Nevertheless, bioglass and bioactive materials have been used mainly as <b>powder</b> and <b>blocks,</b> compromising the filling of irregular bone defects. Considering this matter, our research group has developed a new bioactive glass composition that can originate malleable fibers, which can offer a more suitable material to be used as bone graft substitutes. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the morphological structure (via scanning electron microscope) of these fibers upon incubation in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) after 1, 7 and 14 days and, also, evaluate the in vivo tissue response to the new biomaterial using implantation in rat tibial defects. the histopathological, immunohistochemistry and biomechanical analyzes after 15, 30 and 60 days of implantation were performed to investigate the effects of the material on bone repair. the PBS incubation indicated that the fibers of the glassy scaffold degraded over time. the histological analysis revealed a progressive degradation of the material with increasing implantation time and also its substitution by granulation tissue and woven bone. Histomorphometry showed a higher amount of newly formed bone area in the control group (CG) compared to the biomaterial group (BG) 15 days post-surgery. After 30 and 60 days, CG and BG showed a similar amount of newly formed bone. the novel biomaterial enhanced the expression of RUNX- 2 and RANK-L, and also improved the mechanical properties of the tibial callus at day 15 after surgery. These results indicated a promising use of the new biomaterial for bone engineering. However, further long-term studies should be carried out to provide additional information concerning the material degradation in the later stages and the bone regeneration induced by the fibrous material.
