25|$|One {{of the key}} {{drivers of}} the IoT is data. The success {{of the idea of}} {{connecting}} devices to make them more efficient is dependent upon access to and storage & <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> For this purpose, companies working on IoT collect data from multiple sources and store it in their cloud network for further processing. This leaves the door wide open for privacy and security dangers and single point vulnerability of multiple systems. The other issues pertain to consumer choice and ownership of data and how it is used. Presently the regulators have shown more interest in protecting the first three issues identified above.|$|E

ISO 13616:1997 was subsequently withdrawn and replaced by ISO 13616:2003. The standard was revised again in 2007 when it was split into two parts. ISO 13616-1:2007 [...] "specifies the elements of an international bank account number (IBAN) used to facilitate the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> internationally in data interchange, in financial environments as well as within and between other industries" [...] but [...] "does not specify internal procedures, file organization techniques, storage media, languages, etc. {{to be used in}} its implementation".

This paper addresses the issue <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> <b>data</b> that have been encrypted while the data are in an encrypted mode. It develops a new approach for encryption models that can facilitate the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> such <b>data.</b> The advantages <b>of</b> this approach are reviewed, and a basic algorithm is developed to prove the feasibility of the approach. 1...|$|R
