Blossoms and fruits were classified as healthy or deformed and the immature and adults stages of the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> and associated predatory mites were counted. Observational data indicated that the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> does not have a negative influence on the lemon harvest and that the interaction between its populations and the host plant is a mutual symbiosis in which mite populations use the buds as a resource and repay the host plant by positively regulating its productive system. In both lemon groves, three stigmaeid mites [Zetzellia mali (Ewing), Z. graeciana Gonzalez and Agistemus collyerae Gonzalez] were also collected and their density was compared with that of the A. sheldoni.

40|$|Eriophyoid big <b>bud</b> <b>mites</b> are key pests of {{hazelnuts}} {{throughout the}} world, although {{little is known}} of the identity and impact of the species on New Zealand hazelnut crops. The key objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the species of mite present on New Zealand crops, explore a method of monitoring mite emergence from overwintering big buds, determine the phenology of mites in relation to tree phenology and weather, and identify the optimum timing for control measures. The presence of both Phytoptus avellanae (Nalepa 1889) (Acari: Phytoptidae) and Cecidophyopsis vermiformis (Nalepa 1889) (Acari: Eriophyidae) was confirmed, the latter species being a new record for New Zealand. Preliminary diagnostic DNA sequences were determined for both species. A sticky band technique was developed to monitor mite emergence from overwintering big <b>buds,</b> and <b>mite</b> emergence was found to occur between early and late spring. Mite emergence and movement occurred when daily temperatures were greater than 15 degrees C and when mean temperatures were greater than 9 degrees C, with mite emergence increasing with temperature. It proved difficult to relate the phenology of hazelnut to mite emergence, however, the development of new <b>buds</b> during <b>mite</b> emergence was a crucial factor in the infestation of new buds. An accumulated heat sum model (DD), started at Julian date 152 and using a lower threshold temperature of 6 degrees C, predicted the onset of emergence on two cultivars and at two sites as occurring at approximately 172 DD. A regression model based on leaf number, bud height, bud width, DD and Julian date provided a more satisfactory prediction of percent accumulated mite emergence. It is recommended both peak mite emergence and the appearance of hazelnut buds should be used to optimise the time to apply control measures. Therefore, a control should be applied before buds measure 0. 5 x 0. 5 mm (width x height), are enclosed within the axil, and have a rounded tip, or, when 50 % accumulated mite emergence has occurred, which ever occurs first. A preliminary field experiment tested the application of sulphur (40 g/ 10 litres of 800 g/kg No Fungus Super Sulphur) at 2, 50 and 80 % accumulated mite emergence. The greatest reduction in mite numbers was achieved with an application at approximately 50 % emergence.

Though it is traditionally carried out after fruit set, an earlier reduction of the crop potential or crop load promotes a more efficient use of the available carbohydrate resources. As thinning is currently most often conducted through time-consuming manual labor, it comprises a large part of a growers production costs. Various thinning machines developed in recent years have clearly demonstrated that mechanization of the thinning process is both feasible and cost-effective. However, these machines still lack sufficient selectivity {{to take into account the}} specific fruit bearing capacity of individual trees. Furthermore, the current devices often cause damage to shoots, leaves and fruitlets which decreases tree vigor and makes the trees more susceptible to diseases such as fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) and cankers. The main objective of this dissertation was the development of a novel mechatronic device suited for early-season thinning of pear (cultivar Conference), offering a high degree of selectivity and causing minimal tree damage. To these ends, two sub-objectives were set: (1) the development of a sensor to detect and quantify the early-season crop potential; and (2) the investigation of a new non-contact way of thinning using pulses of compressed air. Pre-bloom recognition of green floral <b>pear</b> <b>buds</b> in a green orchard environment is hard to realize with standard cameras. Therefore, a dedicated multispectral sensor has been designed for this purpose. This was done by measuring the spectral properties of the floral <b>pear</b> <b>buds</b> in the laboratory with a hyperspectral camera in the visible and near infrared region of the spectrum. A stepwise variable selection algorithm was then applied to the recorded data to select the combination of six wavebands which are best-suited for discriminating between floral buds and their environment. Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), a spectral discriminant model was built with these wavebands. Using this model an overall 95. 14 % correct pixel classification under laboratory conditions was achieved. Based on the selected wavebands, a multispectral camera system was designed and subsequently tested in a commercial pear orchard during two flowering seasons. Measurements were conducted at nighttime under controlled illumination to limit the visibility of background objects. As the conditions in an orchard differ from those in the laboratory, a new spectral discrimination model was built that recognizes pixels originating from floral buds, again using CCA. A custom image analysis algorithm was then developed and used to translate the pixel classification into object recognition. This algorithm recognized 87 % of the unoccluded floral buds, making the multispectral sensor system well-suited to increase the efficiency of new and existing thinning devices. In order to design the pneumatic thinning technique, the fracture strength required to remove a floral bud has been measured on a laboratory test bench. The required strength was found to vary as a function of bud development and reaches a minimum around the stage Green cluster. Based on this information, a simple pneumatic setup with a single nozzle has been built and tested during a two-year orchard trial to determine the effects of air pressure, nozzle type, distance and phenology on the attainable removal efficiency. Thinning grades as high as 93. 13 % and 74. 52 % were achieved during a dry and a wet season, respectively. Furthermore, pneumatic thinning was observed to cause limited damage since floral buds were removed at their natural attachment point on the supporting branch. Based on these results, pneumatic removal of floral <b>pear</b> <b>buds</b> is considered feasible. In a next step, a more elaborate prototype setup has been designed which contains multiple nozzles than can be moved in front of the canopy while blowing. This setup more closely approximates a fully operational machine by targeting a region of a tree rather than a single bud. This setup was tested in the orchard during one growing season and a maximum success rate of 36. 59 % was obtained. This is clearly lower than the maximal thinning rate observed during the single nozzle trials. Suggestions were made for further improvements of the setup which could increase the performance. Finally, the integration of the detection sensor and the pneumatic thinning technique has been elaborated. Such a mechatronic system can realize precision thinning by choosing the required settings of the pneumatic thinning device based on the measured floral bud distribution. A second bud detection and counting procedure after the thinning operation can be used to assess the effectiveness of the procedure and to adjust the machine settings if required. Initial tests of this concept have been conducted in the orchard and positive results were obtained. A conservative cost price estimation of the mechatronic device has been presented. This analysis indicated that pneumatic thinning can be an economically feasible alternative to the traditional hand thinning. nrpages: 182 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of 99 Belgian Pseudomonas syringae strains {{representative of}} the genetic diversity encountered in Belgian fruit orchards was evaluated by using 17 pathogenicity tests conducted on pear, cherry, plum, lilac, sugar beet and wheat. The P. syringae pv. morsprunorum strains were pathogenic to stone fruit species but the race 1 strains possessing the cfl gene involved in coronatine production were pathogenic in more tests than those lacking the gene. Also, sweet cherry twigs were a better material to detect pathogenic strains of race 1 and sour cherry twigs of race 2, which accorded with race 2 presence in sour cherry orchards in Belgium. Three groups were defined in the pv. syringae based on pathogenicity. One group pathogenic in 71. 1 % of the tests and to lilac included toxic lipodesipeptide-producing (TLP+) strains. The second group pathogenic in 26. 8 % of the tests and non-pathogenic to lilac included TLP+ strains.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Spring {{frost damage}} to pears in the Pacific Northwest {{frequently}} results in substantial crop losses. This research was undertaken {{to investigate the}} effects of frost on <b>pear</b> <b>buds,</b> flowers, and fruit through controlled freezing tests and field studies {{in order to better}} understand the frost phenomenon and refine frost protection decisions. Controlled freezing studies on 'Bartlett' pear (Pyrus communis L.) showed that the percent of florets injured by frost increased with decreasing temperature, advancing developmental stage, and increasing duration at minimum temperatures of - 2, - 3, and - 4 ° C. Increases in injury occurred with exposures of 30 or 60 minutes at all stages except the small fruit stage, in which injury continued to increase for 2 hours at - 2 ° C. No significant effects of freezing rate were found at - 2, - 3, or - 4 ° C. However, there was a significant effect of freezing rate at - 5 ° C. No hardiness differences were found between comparable floral developmental stages from weak and vigorous trees. Bloom delay through evaporative cooling resulted in a loss of hardiness beyond that found earlier in the season on non-misted trees for similar stages of development. However, under field conditions a certain amount of frost protection was gained through bloom delay. Simulated frost injury to small fruit ovaries at intervals after full bloom significantly-increased fruit malformation, reduced fruit weight, and increased fruit drop of 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Comice' pear trees. Time of injury did not affect fruit weight and malformation in most cases, but early injury did significantly increase fruit drop. Significant positive correlations were found between fruit weight and seed content, while negative correlations were found between fruit malformation and seed content for all cultivars. Crop density was correlated significantly with sum of percent floral injury from frost, orchard design, and height in the tree for 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Anjou' pear. Regression models for crop density, regressed on sum of the percent injury, orchard design, and height in the tree differed between cultivars indicating that one model cannot be used to estimate crop density at harvest for all cultivars. Crop density was greater at low levels of frost injury in free standing than in hedgerow trees, and at greater elevations in the trees. Data suggest that 30 percent frost injury in hedgerow and 60 percent frost injury in free standing pear orchards are reasonable injury levels to accept without incurring crop losses...|$|R

The research started when {{it was noted that}} certain species of <b>pear</b> tree produced <b>buds</b> that were unpalatable to a particular bird. Investigating this has produced a compound, called cinnamamide, which can protect a range of crops, from rice to citrus fruit, against a number of pests, including birds, rats and slugs. The compound that makes the food unattractive to the pests, has proved to be effective on all birds tested. These include species from Argentina, Costa Rica, New Zealand, USA and the UK, and David Cowan who heads the team responsible for the development of cinnamamide hopes that future trials will show its effectiveness in other countries too. Dr Chris Feare, working for the MAFF's Central Science Laboratory, is convinced ''cinnamamide has enormous potential as a bird repellent' and hopes to carry out trials through Africa on its effect on birds like the Quelea, a pest of wheat, sorghum, millet and rice. Although the compound is already available, it is expensive to buy; but if a chemical company decides to go into production, large-scale production should result in reduced costs. With cinnamamide being based on a natural product (cinnamic acid and related compounds) there is the possibility of being able to grow the product on site, or even develop new varieties of crops that produce their own cinnamamide as they grow.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on the simplified[1] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Aceria sheldoni (Ewing) (Acari: Eriophyidae), with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. A. sheldoni the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite,</b> is a minute (0. 12 - 0. 18 mm), elongate mite that is reported from citrus and related plant species. The immature and adult stages feed mostly beneath bud scales or in developing buds and flowers, damaging embryonic bud tissues. Plant parts (twigs, flowers and fruits) that develop from damaged buds are often distorted. This species is widely distributed around the world almost everywhere where citrus is cultivated. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles and terminology of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [2] [Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) ] and the terminology of ISPM No. 5 [Glossary of Phytosanitary Terms (2007) ] by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007). The conclusion of the French assessment is that A. sheldoni should be maintained as a quarantine pest for the French overseas departments pending more accurate data on its harmfulness in tropical conditions. However, insufficient information is provided in the simplified risk assessment to support this conclusion. Many statements are not substantiated by references nor supported by verifiable data, particularly with regard to: 1) possible entry pathways, 2) existing pest management measures and 3) potential economic impact of the organism in the PRA area. After a detailed analysis of the material provided in the French document and study of additional literature, the Panel agrees that A. sheldoni can enter and establish in the PRA area, but consider the potential for economic consequences to be low. It is seldom reported to occur on citrus hosts other than lemon. Despite its wide distribution, including areas with similar climates to the PRA area, several studies show a low potential of this mite to cause economic damage on lemons. Moreover, citrus is acknowledged in the French assessment as not {{a major factor in the}} economy. Lemon is grown for home consumption and not for export, and thus the consequences of A. sheldoni on the local market are considered to be very limited. Therefore, the Panel considers that A. sheldoni is not appropriate for consideration of risk management options for French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Reunion, and thus is not potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|R

Patterns A and C were identical to those shown by other P. s. pv. syringae strains previ-ously isolated from pear in other areas. Pattern B was associated solely with leaf spot symptoms observed on cv Coscia. The syrB gene was present in 38. 8 % of the isolates, whereas ice-nucleation activity was observed in 77. 7 %. Isolates possessing the syrB gene were the most aggressive in pathogenicity tests. Different populations of P. s. pv. syringae appear {{to be involved in}} inducing blast symptoms on pear in central Italy. Key words: bacterial blast, syrB gene, ice-nucleation activity, repetitive sequence PCR. Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae van Hall has been repeatedly found associated with blast of pear (Pyrus communis L.) causing economic losses {{in many areas of the}} world. The main symptoms are bud and blossom blast, necrosis of immature fruits, leaf and fruit spots, and cankers on branches and trunk. Studies have clari-fied the relationships between the susceptibility of <b>pear</b> flower <b>buds</b> to frost, presence of ice-nucleation active bacteria (Proebsting and Gross, 1988), and the condi-tions of temperature, moisture and stage of bloom de-velopment favourable for inducing blossom blas...|$|R
40|$|Type-B {{response}} regulators (B-RRs) are transcription {{factors that}} {{function in the}} final step of two-component signaling systems. In model plants, B-RRs {{have been shown to}} play important roles in cytokinin signal transduction. However, the functions of B-RRs in pear have not been well studied. In this report, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 11 putative genes encoding B-PpRR proteins based on the published genome sequence of Pyrus bretschneideri. A phylogenetic tree of the B-PpRR family was constructed, and the motif distribution, chromosome localization, and gene structure of B-PpRR family genes were determined. Gene transcript profiles, which were determined from transcriptome data, indicated that B-PpRR genes potentially function during <b>pear</b> fruit development, <b>bud</b> dormancy, and light/hormone-induced anthocyanin accumulation. Treatment of the fruitlets of 'Cuiguan' pear (Pyrus pyrifolia), which never accumulates anthocyanin, with the cytokinin N-(2 -chloro- 4 -pyridyl) - N'-phenylurea (CPPU) clearly induced anthocyanin accumulation. Anthocyanins accumulated in the skin of fruitlets by 16 days after CPPU treatment, along with the significant activation of most anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Analyses of B-PpRR transcript levels suggested that B-PpRR genes mediated this accumulation of anthocyanins. These findings enrich our understanding of the function of B-PpRR genes in the physiological processes of pear...|$|R

Os experimentos foram conduzidos em duas regiões edafoclimática diferentes no Sul do Brasil: em Pelotas-RS, no Centro de Pesquisa Embrapa Clima Temperado, e em São Joaquim-SC, na Estação Experimental da Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuária e Extensão Rural de Santa Catarina, durante o outono e inverno de 2000 e 2001. Foram executados três ensaios, envolvendo as cultivares Nijisseiki (Século XX), Kousui e Kieffer. As análises quantitativas de cálcio e boro foram {{realizadas}} pelo método adaptado por Freire (1998). As análises químicas possibilitaram verificar que os níveis de cálcio e boro permaneceram praticamente inalterados durante o inverno, nas gemas florais das cultivares Kieffer e Nijisseiki, em Pelotas-RS. A cultivar Nijisseiki possui maior teor de boro nas gemas florais do que a cultivar Kieffer, de melhor adaptação. Do início do outono até o início do inverno, há um incremento nos teores de boro em ambos os locais e cultivares. Na cultivar Nijisseiki, os maiores teores de boro foram detectados na porção basal e mediana da gema floral, enquanto os de cálcio ocorreram na porção basal. The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate calcium (Ca) and boron (B) levels, in <b>pear</b> flower <b>buds,</b> on different locations, cultivars, period of the year and portion of bud. The experiments were carried out in two locations with different climatic conditions in Southern Brazil (Embrapa Clima Temperado Research Centre, in Pelotas-RS, and Experimental Station of Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuária e Extensão Rural de Santa Catarina, in São Joaquim-SC), during the winter of 2000 and 2001. Three experiments were conducted, involving three cultivars, Nijisseiki (XXth Century), Kousui and Kieffer. The calcium and boron level were determined by the method adapted by Freire (1998). The levels of calcium and boron stayed practically unaltered during the winter in the flower buds of cvs. Kieffer and Nijisseiki, in Pelotas-RS. The cv. Nijisseiki had higher levels of boron than that of cv. Kieffer, more adapted to the region. Since the beginning autumn until early winter there was an increase in levels of boron, in both places and cultivars.

Para isso, conduziram-se dois experimentos durante o ano de 2000. Foram coletadas gemas florais de três cultivares (cvs.), em três regiões no Sul do Brasil. Analisaram-se o volume, peso, comprimento e diâmetro de gema, peso seco de escamas, comprimento e peso seco da inflorescência, número de primórdios florais por gema e índice de necrose. Verificaram-se a ocorrência de duplicação de inflorescências e a formação de grande número de primórdios florais por gema nos locais onde os índices de abortamento foram maiores. As cvs. asiáticas apresentaram maior número de primórdios comparado à cv. Kieffer (híbrido). Na região de São Joaquim-SC, a pereira apresenta melhor adaptação, caracterizada por melhor formação da estrutura floral. As cvs. asiáticas, especialmente em Pelotas, apresentaram alterações em nível de primórdios florais, tais como: deformações, necrose de pistilo, abscisão, escurecimento de anteras e feixes vasculares. O comprimento da inflorescência permitiu diferenciar as cultivares, quanto à época de retomada do desenvolvimento floral final, sendo a cv. Kieffer mais precoce que as cvs. Nijisseiki e Housui.

40|$|O abortamento floral em pereira ?? o {{principal}} problema que limita o desenvolvimento da pereira no Brasil, caracterizado por um complexo de fatores fisiol??gicos, fitossanit??rios, gen??tico e ambiental. O porta-enxerto, objeto central deste trabalho, pode ser um fator que tem contribu??do para aumentar tal problema, pois a cultura da pereira se baseou, ao longo das ??ltimas tr??s d??cadas, no uso dos porta-enxertos Pyrus calleryana e P. betulaefolia. A partir de 2000 os produtores do RS e SC passaram a utilizar os marmeleiros, principalmente o Adams e EMC, obtendo resultados satisfat??rios. Em geral esses porta-enxertos s??o mais sens??veis ao estresse h??drico, por apresentarem sistema radicular pouco desenvolvido. Entretanto se desconhece a influ??ncia dos mesmos na fisiologia da dorm??ncia, na mobiliza????o de carboidratos durante o inverno e na biologia floral. Para atingir tais objetivos foram conduzidos cinco experimentos entre 2005 e 2007, sendo parte deles conduzidos em pomar comercial, na empresa Frutirol, em Vacaria-RS, e em condi????es controladas, na Embrapa Clima Temperados, em Pelotas-RS.

Floral bud abortion {{has been}} the main limiting factor {{to the expansion of}} the pear crop in Brazil. That floral bud abortion has been considered as a complex problem that may be affected by physiological, sanitary, genetic and climatic factors. The rootstock that is the main subject of this study could also be an influencing factor in pear floral abortion, since until the year 2000, only the vigorous rootstocks Pyrus calleryana and Pyrus betulaefolia were used in Brazil. After that year, the pear growers of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states started using dwarfing quince rootstocks such as Adams and EMC and the results has been satisfactory. In general these quince rootstocks are more sensitive to water stress during drought periods, since they develop a relatively small root system. However, the influence of these rootstocks on the physiology of dormancy, carbohydrate metabolism and floral biology are not known. With the objective of studying such unknown aspects, five experiments were carried out from 2005 to 2007 growth seasons. Part of these experiments was conduced under field conditions in a commercial orchard in Vacaria, RS, whereas other experiment activities were developed at Embrapa Clima Temperado research center in Pelotas, RS. All were composed of: a general literature review on the <b>pear</b> <b>bud</b> abortion subject, and plus five scientific articles, each one corresponding to one of the five above referred experiments. The first article contain the biological method to determine the dormancy level, on the pear cultivars Abbe Fetel and Packham s Triumph grafted on the quince rootstock EMC or Adams. The second article brings the results on carbohydrate levels in tissues of pear trees. The third article brings the results on floral biology of the above referred two cultivars on the two above referred quince rootstocks. The fourth article reports the results on the chilling requirement of potted trees of the pear rootstocks quinces EMC, EMA and Adams and of the pear rootstocks Pyrus calleryana and Pyrus betulaefolia, all them grown under controlled conditions. The fifth article reports the effects of chilling on potted trees of the pear cultivars Kieffer and Packham s Triumph grafted on the rootstocks quinces Adams, EMC or EMA, or on Pyrus betulaefolia, under controlled conditions. It were concluded that: the sugar transport and the floral biology were affected by rootstocks but not the dormancy development; the plants of the pear rootstocks quinces EMA, EMC and Adams have higher chilling requirements than the Pyrus calleryana and Pyrus betulaefolia rootstocks; the rootstock used changes the vegetative budbreak percentage of canopy cultivar; and that the higher chilling hours accumulated increased budbreak percentage and reduced floral bud abortion only until the chilling requirement is attained but floral bud abortion is increased after that condition...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: An {{open air}} hydroponic {{production}} system (OHS) {{is based on}} classic hydroponic principles, with the difference that it lacks climatological control because the plants are not produced in greenhouses and are cultivated in the outside environment. In these systems the plant is provided with all the essential nutrients through the irrigation system, which is scheduled according to accurate measurements of the available soil water, in three to seven pulses a day. The rationale is that, by delivering nutrients each day, the mixes can be representative of what the plant actually requires for that specific phenological stage. The {{aim of this study}} was to monitor the usefulness and impact of OHS on table grape production within the framework of a case study. For this purpose, it was necessary that all factors involved in the development and growth of the plant should be studied and integrated in a multidisciplinary approach. Currently very limited information exists on basic guidelines for the effective implementation of these systems for table grape production, particularly with regard to local conditions. As a start, and to establish some guidelines and measurable parameters for the implementation of these systems, vegetative growth parameters were analysed within the framework of yield and fruit quality. The experiments were performed in a commercial vineyard in the Paarl region and the cultivars used were Dan ben Hannah (DBH) and Waltham Cross (WC). Relevant soil and climatic conditions, irrigation scheduling, fertiliser application, as well as cultivation practices, were taken into account. The soil maps provided information on the soil types identified in the blocks prior to the establishment of the two cultivars. The conventionally treated vines were irrigated and fertilised according to historical block data, and the OHS-treated vines according to programmes established by two different consultants. The experimental layout included a comparison of conventional cultivation methods and vines that had been switched over from conventional methods to OHS in the middle of 2000. All measurements within the different treatments were done at specific measuring points laid out statistically. Ten phenological stages were chosen to monitor the various aspects throughout the season for both cultivars treated conventionally and hydroponically. All relevant climatic parameters were collected for this specific production unit. The growth, fertility and quality indicators of these cultivars under the mentioned cultivation practices are discussed and established through quantitative analysis One of the aims, namely to show that established table grape vines could adapt from micro-irrigation to drip irrigation within two seasons in terms of root adaptation, was proven in this study. Initially the soil types were identified as Cartref, Clovellyand Glenrosa for both cultivars. The WC block contained an Avalon and the DBH a Westleigh soil type as well. The soil pits in all four treatments revealed the soil type to be a Tukulu form with differences in the clay content. Active roots developed underneath the drip lines for the OHS-treated cultivars, while the roots were still evenly distributed over the entire soil profile for the conventionally treated vines. Also, both cultivars adapted to OHS in terms of yield and production within two seasons, especially WC, which produced a higher yield in the 2001 / 2002 season than in the previous four seasons. DBH showed a strong vegetative reaction to OHS in terms of excessive vegetative growth, which had an indirect effect on fruit quality and bud fertility. A higher rate of <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> infection in the OHS-treated vines also had a negative influence on bud fertility. The excessive vegetative growth was due to a rainy 2001 / 2002 growth season, in combination with the irrigation and fertiliser programmes. The irrigation and fertiliser programmes were changed from the 2000 / 2001 to the 2001 / 2002 season because of the change in consultants. As a result of this change, the OHS-treated vines were given very high nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and micronutrient applications in the 2001 / 2002 season. The penetration of light in the canopy of the OHS-treated DBH was lower than in the conventionally treated DBH as a result of the above-mentioned factors, but the situation in Waltham Cross was the opposite. In the winter season of 2001, both OHS-treated cultivars were not fully adapted to the new system, as their pruning mass was lower than in the conventionally treated cultivars. No significant differences were determined for the winter cane starch content of both cultivars under conventional and OHS treatments. Effective fertiliser uptake proved to be suboptimal, especially in the case of calcium. Fruit analyses showed a lower calcium content in the OHS-treated fruit, which led to a poor skin cell structure and higher Botrytis infection during cold storage. The OHStreated cultivars showed more compact bunches, with an overall smaller rachis structure, which was another reason for the higher Botrytis infection during cold storage. However, the more compact rachis structure could not be explained on the basis of the elemental analyses. The OHS-treated DBH showed a more intense red berry colour, while the OHS-treated WC had a higher Fosscan Brix value. Both OHS-treated cultivars therefore ripened earlier than the conventional treatments. One of the advantages of the use of OHS in table grape production shown in this study was the ability to manipulate the phenology of the grapevine to provide fully ripened grapes a few days earlier than the conventionally treated grapes. This kind of advantage could be used to manipulate the production of table grapes for a better market window. Despite its limitations, this study concluded that the use of OHS for table grape production might be a useful tool for future production management, but that accurate management regarding irrigation and nutrient applications is a prerequisite. This will have to be developed systematically through experimentation to fully unlock the potential of the OHS management system for table grape production. This study provides a starting point for future research to elucidate these aspects and has clearly shown that even established vineyards can be switched to OHS in a relatively short period of time. It is envisaged that the advantages of this system, as long as the correct management protocols are in place, could have a positive effect on the production of high quality fruit for the international market. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: 'n Oop hidroponiese produksiestelsel (OHS) is gebaseer op klassieke hidroponiese beginsels, met die verskil dat OHS nie klimatologies beheer kan word nie. Die plante word nie in glashuise of tonnelsisteme verbou nie, maar wei onder buitelug toestande. Binne hierdie sisteme word die plante van alle noodsaaklike voedingstowwe deur die besproeiingstelsel voorsien. Hierdie voedingstowwe word in drie tot sewe pulse per dag volgens akkurate beskikbare grondwaterbepalings geskeduleer. Die rasionaal is dat, deur die daaglikse lewering van voedingstowwe, die mengsels verteenwoordigend is van die plant se behoefte vir 'n spesifieke fenologiese stadium. Die doel van die studie was om die bruikbaarheid en impak van OHS op tafeldruifproduksie binne die raamwerk van 'n gevallestudie te monitor. Alle faktore wat by die groei en ontwikkeling van die plant betrokke is, moet in 'n multidissiplinêre benadering bestudeer en geïntegreer word. Daar is tans slegs beperkte inligting oor die basiese riglyne en effektiewe implementering van dié sisteme vir tafeldruifproduksie wat spesifiek is vir plaaslike toestande. As 'n beginpunt, en om sekere riglyne en meetbare parameters vir die implementering van die sisteme te vestig, is vegetatiewe parameters binne die raamwerk van opbrengs en vrugkwaliteit geanaliseer. Alle eksperimente is in kommersiële wingerdblokke in die Paarl-omgewing uitgevoer. Die kultivars wat vir die studie gebruik is, is Dan ben Hannah (DBH) en Waltham Cross (WC). Alle relevante grond- en klimaatstoestande, sowel as besproeiingskedulering, bemestingprogramme en verbouingspraktyke is vir die projek in ag geneem. Ou grondkaarte het inligting ten opsigte van die verskillende grondtipes wat voor die vestiging van die verskillende kultivars geïdentifiseer is, verskaf. Die wingerde, onder konvensionele behandeling, is volgens historiese blokdata besproei en bemes, terwyl die wingerde onder OHS volgens geskeduleerde programme wat vanaf konsultante verkry is, besproei en bemes is. Die eksperimentele uitleg het 'n vergelyking van konvensionele verbouingsmetodes en wingerde wat in die middel van 2000 van konvensionele na OHS-verbouing oorgeskakel is, ingesluit. Alle metings en analises binne die verskillende behandelings het by spesifieke statistiesbepaalde punte plaasgevind. Tien fenologiese stadia is gekies om die verskillende aspekte vir beide kultivars onder konvensionele en OHSbehandeling gedurende die seisoen te monitor. Alle relevante klimaatsdata is vir die spesifieke produksie-eenheid aangevra. Alle groei-, vrugbaarheids- en kwaliteitsparameters van die kultivars onder die bogenoemde behandelingsmetodes is bespreek en gevolglik deur kwantitatiewe analises bepaal. Een van die doelwitte, naamlik om uit te vind of reeds gevestigde ouer wingerde in terme van wortelaanpassing binne twee seisoene kan aanpas van mikrobesproeiing na drup OHS, is deur die studie bevestig. Aanvanklik was die grondtipes geidentifiseer as die vorme, Cartref, Clovelly en Glenrosa vir beide kultivars, met 'n Avalon vorm adisioneel by WC, en 'n Westleigh vorm by die DBH. Grondprofiele het egter getoon dat die grondtipes vir al vier behandelings 'n Tukulu vorm is met verskillende klei inhoude. Aktiewe wortels het vir die OHS-behandelde wingerde onder die druppers ontwikkel, terwyl die wortels in die konvensionele behandeling steeds eweredig oor die hele grondprofiel versprei was. Beide kultivars het ook in terme van opbrengs en produksie binne twee seisoene ná die oorskakeling van die konvensionele behandeling na OHS aangepas. WC het in die 2001 / 2002 seisoen 'n hoër opbrengs gelewer as in die vorige vier seisoene. Afgesien van die goeie aanpasbaarheid, het DBH 'n sterk vegetatiewe groeireaksie ten opsigte van die OHS-behandeling getoon, wat 'n indirekte effek op vrugkwaliteit en oogvrugbaarheid geopenbaar het. 'n Hoër mate van knopmiet infeksie in die OHSbehandelde stokke kon ook 'n negatiewe bydrae tot oogvrugbaarheid gemaak het. Die sterk vegetatiewe groei kon aan die hoër reënval gedurende die 200112002 groeiseisoen, tesame met die besproeiings- en bemestingsprogramme, toegeskryf word. Die besproeiings- en bemestingsprogramme is verander van die 2000 / 2001 seisoen na die 2001 / 2002 seisoen weens die aanstelling van 'n ander konsultant. As gevolg van hierdie verandering het die OHS-behandelde stokke baie hoë toedienings van stikstof, fosfaat, kalium en mikroelemente in die 2001 / 2002 seisoen ontvang. Sonligpenetrasie in die wingerdlower van die OHS-behandelde DBH was laer as in die konvensionele behandeling as gevolg van die bogenoemde faktore. Die situasie vir WC was egter die teenoorgestelde. Tydens die winterseisoen van 2001 was beide oorgeskakelde kultivars nie ten volle by die nuwe OHS-behandeling aangepas nie, soos gesien kan word in die laer lootmassas in vergelyking met die konvensionele kultivars. Geen beduidende verskil is vir die hoeveelheid stysel in die winterlote van beide kultivars onder konvensionele en OHS-behandeling verkry nie. Effektiewe voedingstofopname was suboptimaal, veral betreffende kalsium. Vruganalises het 'n laer kalsiuminhoud in die OHS-behandelde druiwe getoon, wat aanleiding gegee het tot 'n swakker seistruktuur in die druiwedoppe en 'n hoor mate van Bottytis-infeksie gedurende koelopberging. Die OHS-behandelde kultivars het meer kompakte trosse getoon met kleiner trosraamwerke, wat ook aanleiding kon gegee het tot 'n hoër Botrytis-infeksie. Die kleiner trosraamwerke kon nie deur voedingstofanalises verklaar word nie. Die OHS-behandelde DBH het 'n hoër kleurintensiteit getoon, en die OHS-behandelde WC het 'n hoër suikerinhoud getoon ten opsigte van die konvensionele behandeling. Beide OHS-behandelde kultivars was dus vroeër ryp as die konvensionele behandelings. Een van die voordele van OHS wat uit die studie voortspruit, is die vermoë om wingerdfenologie te manipuleer om ryper druiwe vroeër in die seisoen te verkry. Hierdie tipe voordeel kan aangewend word om druiwe vir "n beter markvenster te produseer. Hierdie studie, tesame met al sy beperkinge, kom tot die gevolgtrekking dat die gebruik van OHS vir tafeldruifproduksie 'n nuttige instrument vir toekomstige produksiebestuur is, maar dat die optimale bestuur van besproeiing en bemesting as kritiese faktore beskou moet word. Hierdie faktore sal sistematies deur intensiewe navorsing ontwikkel moet word om die volle potensiaal van OHS te ontsluit, spesifiek vir tafeldruifproduksie. Hierdie studie kan as 'n beginpunt gebruik word vir toekomstige navorsing vir meer toegeligte verklarings van die bogenoemde aspekte, veral met die voordeel dat reeds gevestigde wingerde maklik en vinnig by OHS kan aanpas. Die voordele van OHS kan 'n groot positiewe invloed op die produksie van hoër kwaliteit tafeldruiwe vir die internasionale mark hê, mits die regte bestuursriglyne in plek is en toegepas word...|$|R
