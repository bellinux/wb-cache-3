40|$|The prompt {{gamma rays}} emission, {{following}} neutron absorptions are characteristics of material under test and its intensity {{is proportional to}} amount or thickness of the material. The method is non-contact, and can, therefore, be very useful for scale or corrosion measurement of high temperature or insulated pipes. This method {{can be used to}} identify type of scale if it is not known. Neutron from 241 Am-Be source with an activity of 11. 1 x 10 10 Bq (3 Ci) emitting 6. 6 x 10 6 n/s were allowed to be incident on carbon steel pipes whose diameters were 10 and 16 cm. These pipes contain asphalt or paraffin scales, likely to be found in oil industry. The gamma spectroscopy system consisted of 20 % relative efficiency HPGe gamma detector with 8192 channels multi-channel analyzer and other appropriate nuclear electronics. The 7. 63 MeV prompt gamma rays were clearer among several gamma rays emitted from iron. The single and double escape peaks counts were measured as a function of iron pipe wall thickness for 1 h. The counts were linear with thickness up to the maximum measured thickness of 1. 1 cm and expected to remain linear for higher thicknesses because of the gamma rays high energy. For <b>paraffin</b> <b>scale,</b> the H prompt gamma ray main peak of 2. 22 MeV was measured as a function of scale thickness for 1 h in 16 cm diameter pipe. Counts were linear with thickness until the pipe was almost filled with scale. Data showed that counts of the iron peak are affected by the amount of organic scale and that for accurate measurements both thicknesses has to be determined simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Hydrocarbon deposits, {{often found}} in oil or polymer industries, are very {{difficult}} to detect by the usual inspection techniques of gamma radiography or x-ray radiography methods. The density and atomic number of pipe walls are much higher than that of the scale, therefore, most of the attenuation of gamma rays or x-rays, takes place in the iron, and only a negligible fraction in the scale. This makes the contrast in the radiography film very poor. Moreover accessibility is needed {{on both sides of the}} pipe or reservoir. The ultrasonic method cannot function on hot or unprepared surfaces. In this method neutrons from 241 Am-Be or 252 Cf sources are allowed to interact with carbon steel pipes containing either asphalt or <b>paraffin</b> <b>scale.</b> Fast neutrons penetrate the pipe wall without significant interaction; they are scattered elastically with H and C atoms in the scale and hereby slow-down. Some of the slowed down neutrons diffuse backward and are measured by a BF 3 slow neutron detector. Counts taken with thickness in the BF 3 counter for asphalt scale were linear for both the neutron sources. When using paraffin, counts were linear with 241 Am-Be neutrons but approached saturation with 252 Cf neutrons. This is attributed to the fact that 241 Am-Be neutrons has harder spectrum compared to 252 Cf neutrons, and can penetrate into deeper layers. With weaker spectrum slowed down back diffused neutrons are absorbed or scattered in the scale before reaching the detector. Because sensitivity depends on reduction of background counts, several attempts were made to reduce these counts by using cadmium, boron or boric acid shield around the detector. It was found that 2. 5 cm of boron powder around the detector reduced background counts significantly. It was possible to measures scale thickness down to a fraction of one mm...|$|E
50|$|The {{process was}} commercially {{important}} from the mid 1930s on and {{was carried out}} until the first years after the Second World War on a large industrial <b>scale.</b> <b>Paraffin</b> oxidation enabled for first time the large-scale production of synthetic butter from coal by chemical means which {{was at that time}} seen as a sensation. Because of the high availability of inexpensive natural fats and the competition by petroleum-based fatty alcohols, the process lost its importance in the early 1950s.|$|R
40|$|Wellbore soaking {{has been}} {{successfully}} applied to remove damage in oil and gas wells. The damage (<b>paraffin,</b> asphaltene, <b>scale</b> and other damage) is effectively removed by soaking the wellbore with mud acid, aromatic solvents or other chemicals {{depending on the type}} of damage. Majority of the damage that has been observed in geothermal injection wells comes from the deposition of silica causing the decline in their injection capacities. The damage may form in and away from the wellbore and in the surface injection lines. This paper discusses the application of wellbore soaking prior to the main acid treatment in two of the injection wells in the Botong sector of the Bacon-Manito Geothermal Production Field, Philippines. Results of the acid treatment showed significant improvement in injection capacities compared to previous acid treatment of injection wells without soaking the wellbore...|$|R
40|$|A {{regenerating}} biochemical {{mixture and}} organic surfactant {{has been applied}} to wells in the East Texas Field with the goal of restoring permeability, reversing formation damage, mobilizing hydrocarbons, and ultimately increasing production. Initial work in task 1 was designed to open the perforations and remove blockages of scale, asphaltene, and other corrosion debris. This was accomplished on three wells that produce from the Woodbine, and was necessary to prepare the wells for more substantial future treatments. Secondly, in task 2, two wells were treated with much larger quantities of the biochemical mixture, e. g. 25 gallons, followed by approximately 140 barrels of a 2 % KCl solution that carried the active biochemical solution into the near wellbore area and into the producing reservoir. After a 7 to 10 day acclamation and reaction period, the wells were put back into production. The biochemical solution successfully broke down the <b>scale,</b> <b>paraffin</b> and other binders blocking permeability and released significant debris which was immediately produced into the flowlines and separators. Oil production was clearly improved and the removed debris was a maintenance issue until the surface equipment could be modified. Next steps include larger treatments and tracer tests to better understand the fluid flow dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In {{many studies}} the endocrinological {{response}} {{of individuals to}} different kind s of stresses has been tested. There seems to be widespread agreement that stress, depression, disability and dysfunctional illness behaviors are critical aspects of patients suffering from TMD (temporomandibular disorders) symptoms like pain. We wanted to explore treatment-induced changes in salivary cortisol, IgA and flow rate values in TMD patients suffering from myofascial pain. Methods: TMD paitents (n= 39) were randomized into two groups and treated with two different occlusal appliances. Percieved stress regarding family work, economy, relationships, general health and stress in general was wvaluated at baseline according to a verbal <b>scale.</b> <b>Paraffin</b> stimulated saliva samples were collected before treatment and during follow-up at 6 and 10 weeks. Flow rate was measured immediately after the saliva collection while salivary sortisol, and IgA were determined from - 70 ° C-stored samples. Results: No clear association between reported stress and cortisol or IgA values could be observed at baseline. At 10 weeks´ follow-up 92 % of the patients felt better-much better-symptom free and no difference {{was found between the}} two appliance groups. Cortisol, IgA and flow-rate values showed no systematic between-appliance groups differences. All salivary parameters showed interindividual differences but stayed intraindividually on a similar level throughout the study and no statistically significant changes could be observed when comparing before and after treatment levels. Conclusion: To conclude, there were no treatment induced changes in saliva parameters despite successful appliance therapy in myofascial pain patients...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of a regenerating biochemical mixture and an organic surfactant {{has been applied to}} wells in the East Texas Field with the goal of restoring permeability, reversing formation damage, mobilizing hydrocarbons, and ultimately increasing production. Initial work in task 1 was designed to open the perforations and remove blockages of scale, asphaltene, and other corrosion debris. This was accomplished on three wells that produce from the Woodbine, and was necessary to prepare the wells for more substantial future treatments. Secondly, in task 2, two wells were treated with much larger quantities of the biochemical mixture, e. g. 25 gallons, with a 2 % KCl carrier solution that carried the active biochemical solution into the near wellbore area adjacent to producing reservoir. After a 7 to 10 day acclamation and reaction period, the wells were put back into production. The biochemical solution successfully broke down the <b>scale,</b> <b>paraffin</b> and other binders blocking permeability and released significant debris, which was immediately produced into the flow lines and separators. Oil production was clearly improved and the removed debris was a maintenance issue until the surface equipment could be modified. In task 3 the permeability restrictions in a cylindrical area of 10 to 20 feet from the wellbore within the reservoir were treated with the biochemical solution. Fluid was forced into the producing horizon using the hydraulic head of the well filled with 2 % KCl solution, allowed to acclimate, and then withdrawn by pumping. The chloride content of the produce water was measured and production of oil and water monitored. The most significant effect in improving permeability and removing scale and high molecular weight hydrocarbons was accomplished in the wellbore perforations and near wellbore treatments of tasks 1 and 2. The effect the deeper insertion of solution in task 3 had minimal impact on production...|$|R
40|$|The Preferred Upstream Management Practices (PUMP) project, {{a two-year}} study {{sponsored}} by the United States Department of Energy (USDOE), had three primary objectives: (1) the identification of problems, problematic issues, potential solutions and preferred practices related to oil production; (2) {{the creation of an}} Appalachian Regional Council to oversee and continue this investigation beyond the end of the project; and (3) the dissemination of investigative results to the widest possible audience, primarily by means of an interactive website. Investigation and identification of oil production problems and preferred management practices began with a Problem Identification Workshop in January of 2002. Three general issues were selected by participants for discussion: Data Management; Reservoir Engineering; and Drilling Practices. At the same meeting, the concept of the creation of an oversight organization to evaluate and disseminated preferred management practices (PMP's) {{after the end of the}} project was put forth and volunteers were solicited. In-depth interviews were arranged with oil producers to gain more insight into problems and potential solutions. Project members encountered considerable reticence on the part of interviewees when it came to revealing company-specific production problems or company-specific solutions. This was the case even though interviewees were assured that all responses would be held in confidence. Nevertheless, the following production issues were identified and ranked in order of decreasing importance: Water production including brine disposal; Management of production and business data; Oil field power costs; Paraffin accumulation; Production practices including cementing. An number of secondary issues were also noted: Problems associated with Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and Waterflooding; Reservoir characterization; Employee availability, training, and safety; and Sale and Purchase problems. One item was mentioned both in interviews and in the Workshop, as, perhaps, the key issue related to oil production in the Appalachian region - the price of a barrel of oil. Project members sought solutions to production problems from a number of sources. In general, the Petroleum Technology Transfer Council (PTTC) website, both regional and national, proved to be a fertile source of information. Technical issues included water production, paraffin accumulation, production practices, EOR and waterflooding were addressed in a number of SPE papers. Articles on reservoir characterization were found in both the AAPG Bulletin and in SPE papers. Project members extracted topical and keyword information from pertinent articles and websites and combined them in a database that was placed on the PUMP website. Because of difficulties finding potential members with the qualifications, interests, and flexibility of schedule to allow a long-term commitment, it was decided to implement the PMP Regional Council as a subcommittee of the Producer Advisory Group (PAG) sponsored by Appalachian Region PTTC. The advantages of this decision are that the PAG is in already in existence as a volunteer group interested in problem identification and implementation of solutions and that PAG members are unpaid, so no outside funds will be required to sustain the group. The PUMP website became active in October of 2002. The site is designed to evolve; as new information becomes available, it can be readily added to the site or the site can be modified to accommodate it. The site is interactive allowing users to search within the PUMP site, within the Appalachian Region PTTC site, or within the whole internet through the input of user-supplied key words for information on oil production problems and solutions. Since its inception in the Fall of 2002, the PUMP site has experienced a growing number of users of increasingly diverse nature and from an increasing geographic area. This indicates that the site is reaching its target audience in the Appalachian region and beyond. Following up on a commitment to technology transfer, a total of eight focused-technology workshops were {{sponsored by the}} Appalachian Region PTTC center at the request of the PUMP project. Five Welltender Operations and Safety seminars were held in Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. A two-day Applied Reservoir Characterization seminar and a one-day course on <b>Paraffin,</b> Asphaltene, and <b>Scale</b> problems were held in Pennsylvania. A one-day workshop on Produced Water was held in OH. In addition to workshops and the PUMP website, the project also generated several topical reports available to the public through the website and through USDOE...|$|R
