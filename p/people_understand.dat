25|$|Alan Lomax foresaw that {{computers}} {{would be an}} ideal way to make Cantometrics analysis available not just to scholars but to {{people of all ages}} and educational backgrounds, particularly school children. With that end in view, during the 1990s he developed The Global Jukebox, an interactive multi-media computer program designed for classrooms, museums, and libraries to visually and aurally map the world's song and dance cultures, incidentally helping <b>people</b> <b>understand</b> their own roots and those of others, while teaching geography, anthropology, and tolerance through song and dance. Since Alan Lomax's death in 2002, The Association for Cultural Equity, which Lomax founded, has been working to update the program, and make it widely available. In fulfillment of this project, as of March 2012 all the recordings of his Archive will be streamed online.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Tebbit gave an {{interview}} to John Mortimer for The Spectator where he said of Thatcher: It's a question of her leadership when our aims aren't clearly defined. When <b>people</b> <b>understand</b> what she's doing there's {{a good deal of}} admiration for her energy and resolution and persistence, even from those people who don't agree with her. Now there's a perception that we don't know where we're going so those same qualities don't seem so attractive. Thatcher disagreed and her biographer claims she was suspicious of Tebbit's motives. Furthermore, Thatcher commissioned the firm Young and Rubicam to carry out their own polling, which concluded that Thatcher's leadership was not the problem. Throughout the rest of 1986 and into the 1987 election, Thatcher continued to use Young and Rubicam, which eventually caused tensions with Tebbit during the election campaign.|$|E
25|$|Broad {{protection}} {{actions are}} geared towards children who {{could potentially be}} trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities. This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work. Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and conditional cash transfer programs. Another major broad protection program that has been readily endorsed by UN.GIFT, the I.L.O, and UNICEF involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education. Another way to raise awareness for child trafficking is by communities {{from all over the}} world dedicating a week to this situation. Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims.

The ICE (Human Trafficking) has a help line for victims as well as conducts awareness in the U.S.A communities through the ICE In Plain Sight Campaign.|$|E

500|$|In Active Liberty, Breyer {{argues that}} the Framers of the Constitution sought to {{establish}} a democratic government involving the maximum liberty for its citizens.

Berlin termed this [...] "negative liberty" [...] and warned against its diminution; Breyer calls this [...] "modern liberty". The second Berlinian concept– [...] "positive liberty"– is the [...] "freedom {{to participate in the}} government". In Breyer's terminology, this is the [...] "active liberty" [...] which the judge should champion. Having established what [...] "active liberty" [...] is, and positing the primary importance (to the Framers) of this concept over the competing idea of [...] "negative liberty", Breyer argues a predominantly utilitarian case for judges making rulings that give effect to the democratic intentions of the Constitution.|$|E
