5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E
5|$|Olivia (Anna Torv) has {{recovered}} from her ordeal of being {{trapped in the}} parallel universe and has rejoined the Fringe team, while others on the team, particularly Peter (Joshua Jackson), struggle {{with the idea that}} the parallel universe's Olivia, Fauxlivia, had successfully <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Olivia. Throughout the episode, Olivia is shown to be struggling emotionally with knowing that Fauxlivia has lived in her apartment and has slept with Peter.|$|E
5|$|When {{the meat}} was shriveling, flaking, and falling off, one {{anonymous}} donor gave the gallery $260 for replacement meat. (This number was of some debate, with $350 worth of meat listed in one vegetarian magazine.) Because {{of the negative}} publicity the work had received, gallery staff <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> caterers when finding a butcher in the Ottawa area to provide replacement meat.|$|E
50|$|Teresa, meanwhile, decides that, to taunt Alfredo, {{she will}} <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in love with}} him, only to dash his hopes later on. Alfredo, who overhears this, {{declares}} that he will <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> reject Teresa. When she learns this, Teresa says that she will feign insanity. By this point, {{all of the major}} characters <b>are</b> <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> something they <b>are</b> not. Alfredo <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Duke married to Ultrice and indifferent <b>to</b> Teresa. Ultrice <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Duchess, married <b>to</b> Alfredo. Teresa <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> insane with love for Alfredo. Bartolo and Nita <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> clock-work Hamlet and Ophelia.

60|$|LORD DARLINGTON. [Still seated L.C.] Oh, {{nowadays}} so many conceited {{people go}} about Society <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good, that I {{think it shows}} rather a sweet and modest disposition <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bad. Besides, there <b>is</b> this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said. If you <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good, the world takes you very seriously. If you <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bad, it doesn't.

5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon with the majority of the weapons, to move into the city for {{the main part of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|During {{his long}} and tumultuous career, Paul was {{appointed}} an Orthodox bishop, sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices, <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, switched from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and back again, supported both the See of Rome and the Avignon anti-popes in the Western Schism, {{and managed to}} be named Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. In the end, his deceptions unmasked, he returned to Constantinople, where he repented and confessed his sins before a synod in 1394.|$|E
5|$|While Wallis was {{researching the}} book, the Guardian's Office, Scientology's {{intelligence}} agency, investigated him. They assigned an individual as an undercover agent who <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a student at}} Stirling University, where he was teaching. The agent inquired if Wallis was involved with illegal drugs. Wallis later discovered forged letters purportedly sent by him and designed to implicate him in controversial acts. Wallis assumed this was a reaction by the Guardian's Office to The Road to Total Freedom.|$|E
60|$|So Mrs. Johnson, <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a princess, {{comes out}} of a wobbly thing that we agree <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>is</b> a castle; and old man Johnson, <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a pirate, is pushed up and down on another wobbly thing that we agree <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>is</b> the ocean. Mrs. Johnson <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in love with him, which we know she is not. And Johnson <b>pretends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a very terrible person; and Mrs. Johnson pretends, till eleven o'clock, to believe it. And we pay prices, varying from a {{shilling}} to half-a-sovereign, to sit for two hours and listen to them.|$|R

5|$|At {{the reunification}} summit, the {{president}} personally requested Hyun-jun {{to be at}} his side. Concurrently, NSS agents realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall crisis was actually the hostages. The true IRIS agents escaped and infiltrated the summit to kill all delegates. IRIS agents killed and replaced various security agents for a massacre. Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. She <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an IRIS agent and used the confusion to stop them. This created mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the tunnel}} had been completed, the American POWs were {{transferred}} to Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland. Juskalian estimated that if the tunnel had been dug for another 100feet, it would reach its destination {{at the bank of}} the Fulda River. Two American POWs <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp and to continue working on the tunnel and ultimately escape. The two Americans, who eventually rejoined the rest of the American POWs in Oflag 64, relayed the news that the tunnel had been discovered by the German guards who had learned of its existence after planting a spy among the POWs.|$|E
5|$|By {{established}} practice, Byzantine emperors did {{not personally}} lead troops into battle. Heraclius ignored this convention and joined with his general Priscus' siege of the Persians at Caesarea. Priscus <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ill, however, {{and did not}} meet the emperor. This was a veiled insult to Heraclius, who hid his dislike of Priscus and returned to Constantinople in 612. Meanwhile, Shahin's troops escaped Priscus' blockade and burned Caesarea, much to Heraclius' displeasure. Priscus was soon removed from command, along with others who served under Phocas. Philippicus, an old general of Maurice's, was appointed as commander-in-chief, but he proved himself incompetent against the Persians, avoiding engagements in battle. Heraclius then appointed himself commander along with his brother Theodore to finally solidify command of the army.|$|E

Then, he appeared in a spoofing stage skit [...] "Rudy/Rudia" [...] together with Julie Andrews, starring at the time on Broadway in the cross-dressing classic Victor Victoria (about a woman <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a man <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a woman).

5|$|Espejo {{particularly}} {{criticized the}} Jesuits for, among other things, teaching ethics {{not as a}} science but {{as a guide to}} good manners and for their adoption of Probabilism as a moral guide. He complained about the lax system for educating priests in Quito and said it instilled slothful habits in students. As a result, the priests had no real idea of their duties towards society and God and had little inclination to study. In El Nuevo Luciano de Quito, he lamented the large number of quacks who <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doctors. In La ciencia blancardina he continued his attack on these quacks while attacking clerics who worked as physicians without adequate medical education.|$|E

He also stated that he planned on quitting smoking , which he did eventually by the epilogue of A Thief's End.|$|E
5|$|A countywide {{chapter of}} the Labour Party was {{established}} in Hedmark in mid-November 1904. After the countywide party convention in Stange in 1906, the convention summary had to be printed in the Kristiania-based newspaper Social-Demokraten, as it lacked its own local newspaper. The county board thus decided to buy 1,500 copies of the Social-Demokraten to distribute to its members. There was a growing notion that the party needed its own newspaper. In the same year, the labour movement in Solør (south of Hedmark) bought the paper Solungen, which had existed since 1904. The takeover came into effect on 1 January 1907, and publishing began the following year. Solungen <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the labour movement organ {{for the whole of}} Hedmark, and outside of Solør it was published as Hedemarkens Amts Socialdemokrat (Solungen). However, the rest of Hedmark county was not satisfied with this solution.|$|E

5|$|A seventh-century work, the Sandong Zhunang ("Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns"), embellished the {{relationship}} between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the Tao and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an exemplary interaction between Daoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted. A would-be adherent is expected to prove his determination and talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing {{that he had made}} progress on his own towards realizing the Tao.|$|E
5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes to take credit for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> earlier in the season).|$|E
5|$|In the live-action {{television}} drama, Mello {{is portrayed}} by Mio Yūki. A major change {{is made to}} this character; Mello is {{the other half of}} Near. He lives inside of Near's body. A puppet of Mello is seen in Near's hand. After knowing that L is killed, Mello possesses Near and teams up with Himura. Mello takes Himura's help to kidnap Sayu Yagami in order to obtain the Death Note. Light Yagami makes Himura to blow up Mello's hideout with the help of Death Note. Mello survives the bombing and, over the phone, vows to expose Light as Kira. Light plans another ambush with the task force and Japanese police in order to defeat Mello. Later, Light meets with Misa and Mikami and orders them to kill the task force and Mello respectively. During the ambush, Light confronts Mello in a warehouse, who reverts to his Near personality. Near reveals that he <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken over by Mello as part of a plan to expose Mikami as the current Kira.|$|E

5|$|Phocas's rule lacked {{legitimacy}} and quickly {{came to be}} resented by the populace and the elites of the Byzantine Empire. What prestige he had further eroded when the Persian shah Khosrau II (r. 590–628) declared war, and when the Byzantine forces began to suffer their first defeats. According to a later tradition, Priscus {{sent a letter to}} the Exarch of Africa, Heraclius the Elder, urging him to revolt. This is probably a later invention, but if true, it would indicate the level of dissent even within Constantinople. Whatever the truth of the matter, in 608 Africa rose in revolt, and the Exarch's son, Heraclius the Younger, was dispatched against Constantinople at the head of a fleet. Unopposed by Phocas's forces, he landed at the suburb of Hebdomon on October 3 and marched to the capital, where pro-Heraclian riots had broken out. At this juncture, Priscus <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ill, and withdrew to his mansion at the Boraïdou quarter, where he assembled the excubitores and his own retainers (bucellarii), thus depriving Phocas of his main source of armed support. He is also recorded by John of Nikiu to have safeguarded the women of Heraclius's family from retribution by Phocas.|$|E
5|$|The Hanoverian {{succession}} to {{the throne}} of Great Britain led to reigns with less ceremony than in any since the incorporation of the heralds. The only notable incident for the college in this period, {{during the reign of}} George I, happened in 1727 when an impostor called Robert Harman <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a herald. The knave was prosecuted by the College in the county of Suffolk, and was sentenced to be pilloried in several market towns on public market days and afterwards to be imprisoned and pay a fine. This hefty sentence was executed, proving that the rights of the College were still respected. In 1737, during the reign of George II the College petitioned for another charter, to reaffirm their rights and remuneration; this effort proved unsuccessful. Apart from these events the influence of the College was greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisational}} {{ability of}} the government agencies charged with overseeing {{the integration of the}} refugees into society was frequently criticised by American officials. In many cases, the individual officials simply made their own decisions and the goal of resettling the northerners without disruption to the existing local economy or social structure was not achieved. In other cases, the northern Catholics formed their own committees and settled and built on areas as they saw fit. By the end of September, the shortage of funds and equipment had eased, but their distribution was not organised or coordinated effectively. At the same time, some Viet Minh cadres who stayed in the south after the partition <b>pretended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> refugees and stirred up trouble inside the camps. Aside from disruption by communists, other non-communist movements such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng were strong in areas of central Vietnam, were opponents of Diem and some of them were military personnel. This sometimes caused hindrance in civilian-military cooperation in the resettlement program, as some of Diem's public servants were suspicious of the military's reliability as a working partner.|$|E
