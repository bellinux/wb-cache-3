40|$|We have {{discovered}} that the brown dwarf WISEJ 014656. 66 + 423410. 0 is a close binary (0. 0875 ± 0. 0021 arcsec, 0. 93 ^+ 0. 12 _- 0. 16 AU) from Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging. Our photometry for this system reveals that both components are less luminous than those in any known substellar binary. Combining a new integrated-light spectrum (T 9 p) and resolved YJH-band photometry from Keck allows us to perform spectral decomposition and assign component types of T 9 and Y 0. Many of the unusual features in the spectrum might be explained by high surface gravity: Y-band <b>peak</b> <b>broadened</b> to the blue; J-band <b>peak</b> <b>broadened</b> to the red; H-band peak shifted slightly to the red; and red Y-J colors. Interestingly, the very low component luminosities imply that the T 9 primary is unexpectedly cold (T_ eff = 345 ± 45 K assuming an age of 10 Gyr), making it ≈ 100 K cooler than any other late-T dwarf and comparable to Y dwarfs. One intriguing explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the J- and H-band spectral features that trigger the transition from T to Y spectral types are highly gravity-dependent. This can be tested directly {{in the very near}} future by orbit monitoring. We constrain the orbital period to be ≲ 10 yr by combining evolutionary model-based mass estimates for the components (≈ 12 - 21 M_ Jup, 1 σ at 10 Gyr) with a statistical constraint on the semimajor axis (≲ 1. 3 AU). Such a period is shorter than any other known T/Y transition binary, meaning that WISEJ 0146 + 4234 AB will likely yield a dynamical mass within the next few years.
