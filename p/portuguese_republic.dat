During political unrest in April 1913, {{part of the}} crew of Vasco da Gama {{had to be removed}} from the ship, as they had been involved in a planned ultra-Radical coup d'état against the First <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Republic.</b> On 14 May 1915, the crew again participated in unrest; they mutinied and killed the ship's captain and bombarded Lisbon, killing around one hundred people. Vasco da Gama remained the flagship of the Portuguese Navy at least as late as 1914, as the Portuguese naval budget was insufficient to fund a suitable replacement vessel. Thoroughly obsolete, she remained in the Portuguese fleet until 1935, when she was sold for scrapping.|$|E
