5000|$|On March 17, 1966, The Munsters episode [...] "A Visit from Johann" [...] {{depicted}} a <b>person-to-person</b> <b>call</b> to a Happy Valley Lodge in the 416 area code. [...] A hamlet of Happy Valley exists in King Township, in 416 {{at the time}} but now (as part of York Region) in 905.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>person-to-person</b> <b>call</b> is an operator-assisted call {{in which}} the calling party {{requests}} {{to speak to a}} specific party and not simply to anyone who answers. The caller is not charged for the call unless the requested party can be reached. This method was popular when telephone calls were relatively expensive. The alternative, {{in which the}} calling party agrees to talk to whoever answers the telephone, is known as station-to-station. Since the introduction of direct dial telephone service and the subsequent drop in the price of long distance telephone calls, person-to-person service has virtually disappeared.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, once most phone {{subscribers}} had direct long-distance dialing, {{a single}} type of operator began to serve both {{the local and}} long distance functions. A customer might call to request a collect call, a call billed to a third number, or a <b>person-to-person</b> <b>call.</b> All toll calls from coin phones required operator assistance. The operator was also available to help complete a local or long-distance number which did not complete. For example, if a customer encountered a reorder tone (a fast busy signal), it could indicate [...] "all circuits busy," [...] or {{a problem in the}} destination exchange. The operator might be able to use a different routing to complete the call. If the operator could not get through by dialing the number, she could call the inward operator in the destination city, and ask her to try the number, or to test a line {{to see if it was}} busy or out of order.|$|E
30|$|Case 3 : {{information}} sharing through displays and distant <b>person-to-person</b> <b>calls</b> In this case, {{the information is}} shared through displays and distant <b>person-to-person</b> <b>calls.</b> Only the social agents (persons) are capable of bi-directional interaction with each other. The regular agents can only be influenced by publicly available information via displays as before.|$|R
50|$|This added {{competition}} in the conferencing market has brought average rates down from over 20 cents per minute to under 10 cents per minute. In addition, it is more efficient and less expensive to speak to many people on one call (a conference call) than on multiple <b>person-to-person</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Person-to-person</b> <b>calls</b> to {{non-existent}} people (or <b>calling</b> yourself <b>person-to-person</b> {{and your}} home refusing the call, {{as a means}} of telegraphing safe passage). A variant was to refuse a collect call at the higher operator-assisted rate, then call the person back station-to-station at a lower price from another telephone.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Person-to-person</b> VoIP <b>calls</b> (possibly using a lookup like ENUM, or {{integration}} with services like Skype) ...|$|R
30|$|Case 4 : {{information}} sharing through public displays, person-to-person vocal communication, <b>person-to-person</b> <b>calls</b> and social capital rewarding In this case, {{the information is}} shared through displays and proximic person-to-person interaction with model of social capital. In the presence of {{both public and private}} information units, the random person-to-display and context-aware person-to-person PoA information would augment the agent’s information quality in terms of attention and memory. The interactions with agents are handled by social capital and collective attention model.|$|R
50|$|Skype Premium {{originally}} bundled {{together a}} number of Skype's features including {{the selection of a}} calling subscription, the ability to make group video calls and the ability to screen share with up to 10 other people (<b>person-to-person</b> video <b>calls</b> are free), improved customer support and the removal of ads from the Skype client. However, the Premium product was removed in the summer of 2014 when group video calls and screen sharing were made free.|$|R
5000|$|In {{this excerpt}} from the radio series Dragnet, Sgt. Joe Friday (Jack Webb) places a <b>person-to-person</b> long-distance <b>call</b> to a number reached via a manual {{switchboard}} in Fountain Green, Utah [...] - [...] a town of several hundred people served by an independent telephone company. In the call, Friday calls a long-distance operator in Los Angeles and gives the name and number of the called party. The operator then calls a rate & route operator, who responds that the call should be routed through Salt Lake City and Mount Pleasant, Utah and the rate-step for the call is 140 (the long distance operator would mark her ticket with that rate-step, and could use it to quote the rate from her rate table, {{in terms of the}} first three minutes and each additional minute, if the caller requested the toll).|$|R
2500|$|After {{his junior}} internship, MacInnis hoped {{to work with}} {{inventor}} and entrepreneur Edwin Link {{in the field of}} deep diving, but {{had no idea how to}} reach him. In fall 1963 MacInnis placed a <b>person-to-person</b> telephone <b>call</b> to Link, who agreed to meet with him for fifteen minutes the next day at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. At the interview, Link offered MacInnis a position as the full-time doctor for his Man-In-Sea Project. MacInnis received a Link Foundation Fellowship to study diving medicine under Dr. Christian J. Lambertsen at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1964, MacInnis became medical director of Man-In-Sea. [...] During his studies at the University of Pennsylvania, MacInnis was a member of a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation filming expedition to Cocos Island, where a group of treasure hunters were seeking the fabled hoard of Benito Bonito and the Treasure of Lima.|$|R
50|$|The {{opening of}} MDC Los Angeles allowed prisoners whose trials are pending to be housed just {{two blocks from}} the U.S. District Courthouse, ending the {{time-consuming}} process of transporting them back and forth down the Harbor Freeway each day court is in session. The U.S. Marshal's Service saves at least $200,000 a year by not having to transport the usual 250 to 300 prisoners a week from FCI Terminal Island and the federal public defender's office saves $18,000 a year in telephone bills alone because it no longer has to rely on clients <b>calling</b> <b>person-to-person</b> collect from FCI Terminal Island.|$|R
50|$|Class 4 toll access {{switches}} provide {{long distance}} (toll) telephone service including intrastate calling and inter-state calling. Intrastate calls {{are generally more}} expensive than inter-state calls due to favorable tariffs with price plans approved by the Public Utilities Commission or Public Service Commission for each state. Inter-state calls are generally less expensive than intrastate calls since tariffs are filed with the Federal Communications Commission because of the inter-state commerce aspect of the service. Class 4 switches provide access to long distance service in rural areas. In addition, Class 4 switches traditionally provided operator assisted <b>calls</b> such as <b>person-to-person,</b> collect, and <b>calls</b> billed to third parties. However, many operator services are now automated with minimum human intervention.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, online <b>person-to-person</b> lending, also <b>called</b> {{peer-to-peer}} or P 2 P lending, {{emerged as an}} alternative form of consumer borrowing and investing. It grew throughout the recession, even as consumer credit markets faltered, {{and it continues to}} grow today. P 2 P lending platforms match individuals looking to borrow with individuals looking to lend in anonymous online marketplaces. They offer attractive interest rates, debt consolidation, access to liquidity, and inexpensive diversification. Despite its growth, however, the P 2 P lending market faces significant challenges. In 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (2 ̆ 2 SEC 2 ̆ 2) declared that notes issued by P 2 P lending platforms to be unregistered securities. This forced the platforms-as web startups-to register for initial public offerings. SEC regulation now creates substantial compliance costs, barriers to entry, and risks to consumers in the P 2 P lending market. P 2 P lending should therefore be exempted from SEC regulation and placed under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2 ̆ 2 CFPB 2 ̆ 7) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{frame of}} {{reference}} for understanding the rhetorical significance of cultural acts lies in the identification and explication {{of the diversity of}} theories which encompass sociological and anthropological definitions of culture. The paradigms presented in this thesis range from unilinear evolution, biological and environmental determinism, materialism, historical ethnology and reductionism, to psychological and cognitive phenomenology, linguistic analysis, and interpretive semiotics. Cultural theories represent thinking from sociology, economics, ethnology, anthropology, psychology, philosophy, critical theory, and linguistics; representing such writers as Spencer, Morgan, Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Boas, Levi-Strauss, Chomsky, Habermass, and Foucault. No single communication and cultural framework is universally agreed upon by members of the social science community. Ever since the pre-Socratics began to theorize about <b>person-to-person</b> communication and <b>called</b> it rhetoric, one framework does remain axiomatic [...] that humans use their capacities for speech to accomplish personal and social ends. This thesis argues that rhetoric and culture share a common dynamic and paradigm, an engagement of common purpose; that they function in concert with one another as rhetoric transforms symbolic usages into acts of communal fusion. Chapter II provides a review and analysis of cultural theories. Chapter III provides a definition of rhetoric in both modern and ancient usages and examines the ways in which people initiate and experience symbols in the rhetorical/cultural matrix. Chapter IV explores the rhetorical/cultural processes which define how people engage one another with symbols; Chapter V establishes the relationships of identification and division necessary to sustain shared meanings and interpretations rhetorically/culturally. Chapter VI provides a summary and the author's conclusions. This thesis concludes that rhetorical acts and cultural acts constitute a similar paradigmatic construct and calls for a synthesis of theories for purposes of rhetorical and cultural analysis...|$|R
