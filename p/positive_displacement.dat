25|$|A {{liquid ring}} pump is a {{rotating}} <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump that is powered by an induction motor and is typically used as a vacuum pump or as a gas compressor. The {{liquid ring pump}} was invented in 1905 by Lewis H. Nash. Production soon began thereafter at the Nash Engineering Company. Nash filed U.S. patent #1,091,529 on February 24, 1910 and was issued to him on March 31, 1914.|$|E
25|$|The digging of the {{foundation}} of the Covington tower commenced in September 1856 and went smoothly. A foundation was set consisting of 13 layers of oak beams, each layer set perpendicular to the one beneath it, bolted with iron hardware, and finally all cemented into place. On the Cincinnati side, work was delayed from the start. The construction crews could not pump water out of the excavating pit fast enough. They were attempting to dig to bedrock {{in the middle of a}} flowing river. After months of a virtual stand-still, Roebling decided against buying costly machinery or bigger engines for his pumps and, quite last minute, designed his own square <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps from three-inch (76mm) pine planks. He built them locally in about forty-eight hours and ran them off of one of Amos Shinkles' tugboats, the Champion No.1. The homemade pumps displaced forty gallons of mud and clay in each cycle.|$|E
25|$|Any type of pump {{that can}} deliver the {{required}} pressure difference and flow volume can be used. Most often used is the dynamic-compression centrifugal type compressor, which {{is familiar to}} most as being used in vacuum cleaners and turbochargers, but multistaged axial-flow compressor types, {{similar to those used}} in most jet engines, could work as well, although there would be little need for the added cost and complexities involved, as they typically don't require such a high flow rate as a jet engine, nor are they limited by the aerodynamic drag considerations which makes a narrow-diameter axial compressor more effective in jet engines than a centrifugal compressor of equal air flow. <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as twin screw compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid).

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{negative}} and positive lateral shifts of the light beams in a dielectric slab configuration is investigated {{from the viewpoint of}} the interference between multiple light beams, due to the multiple reflections and transmissions inside the slab. It is shown that the whole reflected and transmitted beams with negative shifts can be obtained from the successively reflected and transmitted constituents, respectively, with <b>positive</b> <b>displacements</b> predicted from geometrical optics. When the slab&# 39;s thickness is much smaller in comparison with the width of the beam waist, the reshaping reflected and transmitted beams retain the profile of the incident beam. The physical mechanism presented here could also be applicable in investigating other counterintuitive phenomena, such as the superluminal traversal time in quantum tunneling and dispersive media...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of fluid pumps based on Wankel-type geometry, taking {{the shape of}} a double-lobed limaçon, is characterized. To the authors’ knowledge, {{this is the first time}} such an attempt has been made. To this end, numerous simulations for three different pump sizes were carried out and the results were understood in terms of the usual scaling coefficients. The results show that such pumps operate as low efficiency (< 30 %) valveless <b>positive</b> <b>displacements</b> pumps, with pump flow-rate noticeably falling at the onset of internal leakage. Also, for such pumps, the mechanical efficiency varies linearly with the head coefficient, and, within the onset of internal leakage, the capacity coefficient holds steady even across pump efficiency. Simulation of the flow field reveals a structure rich in three-dimensional vortices even in the laminar regime, including Taylor-like counterrotating vortex pairs, pointing towards the utility of these pumps in microfluidic applications. Given the planar geometry of such pumps, their applications as microreactors and micromixers are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 As drop-on-demand (DOD) {{applications}} {{continue to}} gain ground in desktop inkjet-printing, 3 D printing, fluid mixing, {{and other areas}} the demand for higher frequency operations are beginning to push against the current physical boundaries in DOD technology. The current research is exploring the possibility of controlling drop volume and velocity at high frequency ranges where meniscus vibrations can occur between drop formations and affect drop formation characteristics. A periodic voltage is applied to a piezoelectric disk in order to generate pressure fluctuations in a single nozzle droplet generator, causing the fluid meniscus at the nozzle to vibrate. A single stronger pulse is then superimposed over the periodic waveform at different phases in order to drive drop ejection. The characteristics of the resulting drop, specifically the volume and velocity, are experimentally measured using a high speed camera with precise timing control. The results of these experiments are then compared to a lumped element model (LEM) developed for the droplet generator geometry used. Within the LEM model framework, special attention {{was given to the}} definition of a novel method by which one can measure drop volume within an electroacoustic circuit and also allow meniscus dynamics to affect present and future drop formations. Experimental results indicate a strong dependence of both drop volume and drop velocity on the phase of the vibrating meniscus at the start of drop formation. <b>Positive</b> meniscus <b>displacements</b> and momentums resulted in large drop volumes and velocities while negative displacements could reduce drop volume or altogether eliminate drop formation. Specifically, <b>positive</b> <b>displacements</b> and momentum of a vibrating meniscus could lead to drop volumes approximately 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the capabilities of a new out-of-plane displacement piezoelectric actuator called thin-layer composite-unimorph ferroelectric driver and sensor (THUNDER) to alter the upper surface geometry of a subscale airfoil to enhance performance under aerodynamic loading. Sixty test conditions, consisting of combinations of five angles of attack, four dc applied voltages, and three tunnel velocities, were studied in a tabletop wind tunnel. Results indicated that larger magnitudes of applied voltage produced larger wafer displacements. Wind-off displacements were also consistently larger than wind-on. Higher velocities produced larger displacements than lower velocities because of increased upper surface suction. Increased suction also resulted in larger displacements at higher angles of attack. Creep and hysteresis of the wafer, which were identified at each test condition, contributed to larger negative displacements for all negative applied voltages and larger <b>positive</b> <b>displacements</b> for the smaller positive applied voltage (+ 102 V). An elastic membrane used to hold the wafer to the upper surface hindered displacements at the larger positive applied voltage (+ 170 V). Both creep and hysteresis appeared bounded based on the analysis of several displacement cycles. These results show that THUNDER can be used to alter the camber of a small airfoil under aerodynamic loads...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} {{of the human brain}} to detect deviance in the acoustic environment pre-attentively is reflected in a brain event-related potential (ERP), mismatch negativity (MMN). MMN is observed in response to the presentation of rare oddball sounds that deviate from an otherwise regular pattern of frequent background standard sounds. While the primate and cat auditory cortex (AC) exhibit MMN-like activity, it is unclear whether the rodent AC produces a deviant response that reflects deviance detection in a background of regularities evident in recent auditory stimulus history or differential adaptation of neuronal responses due to rarity of the deviant sound. We examined whether MMN-like activity occurs in epidural AC potentials in awake and anaesthetised rats to high and low frequency and long and short duration deviant sounds. ERPs to deviants were compared with ERPs to common standards and also with ERPs to deviants when interspersed with many different standards to control for background regularity effects. High frequency and long duration deviant ERPs in the awake rat showed evidence of deviance detection, consisting of negative displacements of the deviant ERP relative to ERPs to both common standards and deviants with many standards. The high frequency deviant MMN-like response was also sensitive to the extent of regularity in recent acoustic stimulation. Anaesthesia in contrast resulted in <b>positive</b> <b>displacements</b> of deviant ERPs. Our results suggest that epidural MMN-like potentials to high frequency sounds in awake rats encode deviance in an analogous manner to the human MMN, laying the foundation for animal models of disorders characterised by disrupted MMN generation, such as schizophrenia...|$|R

40|$|At 16 : 09 : 36 UTC on March 28, 2005 {{a strong}} {{earthquake}} struck at southwest of Banda Aceh in northern Sumatra. The epicenter was located at (1. 64 oN, 96. 98 oE), {{which is about}} 200 km in the southeast direction of {{the epicenter of the}} December 26, 2004 mega earthquake (3. 30 °N, 95. 78 °E). Both earthquakes occurred near the junction of the Indian, Australian and Burma plates. It is known that the Indian plate has been subducting below the Burma microplate (at roughly 60 mm/year) along a fault line stretching from Indonesia in the south to the Andaman Islands in the north. The December 26, 2004 earthquake and aftershocks ruptured approximately 1, 200 km of this fault line, along the northern Sunda Trench. It has been estimated that the March 28, 2005 earthquake only ruptured about 400 km fault line filling in the gap between 1861 earthquake and 2004 mega earthquake. The initial estimate of the earthquake magnitude was Mw = 8. 6, based on the Harvard University’s Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) solution. The seismic moment released on the fault plane (strike = 329 o and dip = 7 o) was estimated as 1. 1 x 1029 dyne-cm, which is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the December 26, 2004 earthquake. In Figure 1, the vertical and horizontal seafloor displacements resulting from the earthquake have been reported by Ji, C. (2005). The maximum <b>positive</b> seafloor <b>displacement</b> is slightly greater than 3 m and the maximum negative seafloor displacement is roughly 1 m.

40|$|Fast {{displacement}} photocurrents {{have been}} reported in bacteriorhodopsin model membranes by several groups of investigators since 1977. A fast component (B 1) is associated with <b>positive</b> charge <b>displacement</b> in the direction opposite to that of a physiological proton translocation. A slower component (B 2) of opposite polarity is associated with <b>positive</b> charge <b>displacement</b> {{in the same direction as}} the proton translocation. Using two slightly different methods for model membrane formation, we observed photosignals with or without a significant B 2 component under appropriate conditions. By means of the tunable voltage clamp method of measurement (Hong, F. T., and D. Mauzerall, 1974, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 71 : 1564 - 1568) we demonstrated that the time course of the B 1 signal is completely predictable by an equivalent circuit containing a chemical capacitance. From the equivalent circuit analysis, we obtained a first-order relaxation time constant of 12. 3 +/- 0. 7 microseconds at room temperature. We also found a slight temperature dependence of the B 1 relaxation with an activation energy of 2. 54 +/- 0. 24 kcal/mol. We found no pH dependence of the B 1 component in the range of 0 to 11, whereas the B 2 component is diminishing in a graded manner when the pH is varied from 0 to 10. These results are diametrically different from what reported previously (Drachev, L. A., A. D. Kaulen, L. V. Khitrina, and V. P. Skulachev, 1981, Eur. J. Biochem., 117 : 461 - 470). Our results support the interpretation that the B 1 component is generated by an intramolecular charge displacement accompanying the light-induced reactions of bacteriorhodopsin and that the B 2 component is generated by a process of proton uptake from the intracellular aqueous phase and subsequent release into the same aqueous phase. The impact of the present results on the conventional practice of identifying photointermediates of bacteriorhodopsin by spectroscopic means is discussed...|$|R
