5|$|It {{would take}} FDR another five years, {{with the help}} of the League of Women Voters to replace Stevens. Making the {{argument}} that Stevens was appointed by the Conference of the Pan-American States and not as a U.S. delegate, FDR agreed to give <b>permanent</b> <b>status</b> to the CIM, if each state was allowed to appoint their own delegates. Securing approval, he then immediately replaced Stevens with Mary Nelson Winslow. Stevens did not go quietly and the clash continued throughout 1939 with Eleanor Roosevelt backing Winslow and suffragists backing Stevens. Eleanor's objection to Stevens was multi-faced, in that she did not think that the Equal Rights Amendment would protect women and on a personal level, she believed Stevens behaved in an unladylike manner.|$|E

However, upon acquiring NBN, PBL did not fold it into the main Nine Network, but continued to operate it as a regional station. The purchase also secured <b>permanent</b> <b>status</b> of supplying Nine's content to the station's entire coverage area, sparing any future affiliation switches (particularly the 2016 Australian television shakeup involving Southern Cross Austereo and WIN Corporation).|$|E

Following a short flying refresher he was posted to Ottawa and placed in charge of the personnel branch where he was responsible for documenting Canadians with First World War experience in the RAF then recruiting them into the provisional air force and setting up an air training centre at Camp Borden. By 1924, the Canadian Air Force had grown sufficiently to acquire <b>permanent</b> <b>status</b> as a component of the new Department of Defence.

The Quartet has reiterated that the only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement that ends the occupation that began in 1967; resolves all <b>permanent</b> <b>status</b> issues as previously defined by the parties; and fulfils the aspirations of both parties for independent homelands through two states for two peoples, Israel and an independent, contiguous and viable state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.|$|E
25|$|In July 1987, a {{distance}} measurement {{in the distance}} measuring equipment failed, terminating all scheduled and night flights until it was replaced in September. The second half of 1987 also saw {{the expansion of the}} terminal with , consisting of seven modular workman's sheds. It included seating for 40 people, a cafeteria, facilities for pilots and offices for the airport's manager, and customs and police facilities. The latter allowed the airport status as an international airport, which allowed charter flights to Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom, which were often done on a weekly basis by foreign companies involved in the heavy industry. However, the airport did not have status as a permanent border control and the airport therefore had to cover these costs themselves. The Ministry of Justice stated that the airport was too close to Flesland, Haugesund and Sola to have <b>permanent</b> <b>status,</b> but allowed the chief-of-police to give dispensations for individual flights from 1988. In 1987, the airport company lost NOK2 million.|$|E

25|$|The task of demobilization fell to Colonel Towle, {{the second}} {{director}} of the wartime WR. In December 1945 the WR was down to about 12,300 members, with expectations of reducing this number by 2,000 each month thereafter. The demobilization plan called for mandatory resignation or discharge of all WR members by 1September 1946. Separation centers were set up at San Diego, San Francisco, ElToro, Paris Island, and Lejeune. In early 1946 there was speculation that legislation to give women <b>permanent</b> <b>status</b> in the military was pending, prompting the Marine Corps to relax its demobilization policy. Then on 15June 1946 the wartime office of the WR was closed when Colonel Catherine Towle returned {{to work at the}} University of California. The outgoing director proposed that Julia E. Hamblet replace her. Three months later, Hamblet was appointed as the third and final {{director of the}} wartime WR. When August 1946 came around, some 300 women had been asked by the Marine Corps to stay on, even as the last WR barracks was being closed. For the next two years, these women served the Marine Corps in an undetermined status. But on 30July 1948, the Women's Armed Services Act (Public Law 625) was signed into law, allowing these and other women to serve in the regular Marine Corps.|$|E
25|$|On 25 July 1993, Israel {{carried out}} a week-long {{military}} operation in Lebanon to attack Hezbollah positions. On 13 September 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords (a Declaration of Principles) on the South Lawn of the White House. The principles established objectives relating to a transfer of authority from Israel to an interim Palestinian Authority, {{as a prelude to}} a final treaty establishing a Palestinian state, in exchange for mutual recognition. The DOP established May 1999 as the date by which a <b>permanent</b> <b>status</b> agreement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip would take effect. In February 1994, Baruch Goldstein, a follower of the Kach party, killed 29 Palestinians and wounded 125 at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, which became known as the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. Kach had been barred from participation in the 1992 elections (on the grounds that the movement was racist). It was subsequently made illegal. Israel and the PLO signed the Gaza–Jericho Agreement in May 1994, and the Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities in August, which began the process of transferring authority from Israel to the Palestinians. On 25 July 1994, Jordan and Israel signed the Washington Declaration, which formally ended the state of war that had existed between them since 1948 and on 26 October the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace, witnessed by U.S. President Bill Clinton.|$|E

500|$|The Bureau of the Mint in the 1830s was {{undergoing}} {{a period of}} significant change, as new technologies were adopted.

[...] Congress adjusted the precious-metal content of US coins in 1834 and 1837, and was able to achieve a balance whereby US coins remained in circulation alongside those of foreign nations (mostly Spanish colonial pieces). [...] In 1836, the first steam machinery was introduced at the Mint; previously coins had been struck by muscle power. Congress had in 1835 authorized branch mints at Dahlonega in Georgia, Charlotte in North Carolina, and at New Orleans in Louisiana. [...] The Charlotte and Dahlonega mints only struck gold, catering to miners in the South who sought to deposit that metal, but the New Orleans facility would also strike silver coins, including the Seated Liberty dollar.|$|E
500|$|All {{disability}} types {{were eligible}} to participate at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC oversaw classification based on functional disability. General and functional classification {{took place in}} the Paralympic Village, with functional swimming classification taking place on the same dates at the Piscines Bernat Picronell. The process became a contentious issue at the Paralympics because of on-the-spot reclassifications that resulted in changes to the competition schedule. On-the-spot classification or re-classification was viewed as a negative aspect of the 1996 Summer Paralympics, and the Paralympic movement overall. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 54 assessments were conducted, resulting in 13 class changes. There was one Paralympic New Status (PNS) protest and two Paralympic <b>Permanent</b> <b>Status</b> (PPS) protests by a national Paralympic committee, with one classification upheld and two denied. Six classification appeals were lodged for swimming at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving four athletes, resulting in two class changes. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. [...] This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. [...] In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, swimming classification was scheduled to take place at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, with visually impaired swimmers getting classified from September 4 to 6 and all other swimmers being classified from September 3 to 5. [...] For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through [...] classification or reclassification in Rio, their in-competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.|$|E
