25|$|During a Monday Night Football {{telecast}} on September 15, 2008, Kornheiser made {{a comment}} about a clip of the ESPN Deportes crew's call of a Felix Jones touchdown, saying, “I took high-school Spanish, and that either means ‘nobody is going to touch him’ or ‘could you <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> dry cleaning in the morning.’” Later in the broadcast, Kornheiser apologized on-air for the remark.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Madonna's {{previous}} two lead singles, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] (2012), [...] "Living for Love" [...] puts {{the emphasis on}} the lyrics and vocals, with the lines on the bridge going like [...] "Took me to heaven, let me fall down/Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on" [...] and a [...] "throbbing drop" [...] in the middle. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets [...] "Like a Prayer", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed {{towards the end of the}} song. For Jon Lisi from PopMatters, [...] "Living for Love" [...] fitted with contemporary pop music releases and the DIY ethic they displayed, starting from Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off", to Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "Roar". The survivor anthem-like nature of the track was evocative of Madonna's survival in her music career. With NRJ the singer herself explained the meaning behind the lyrics: [...] "It's a song having your heart broken but it's about saying you know what I'm going to my life goes on, I will carry on, I won't stop believing in love, I'll <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> crown, put it back on my head and I will walk through life proudly believing that love, true love does exist." ...|$|E
