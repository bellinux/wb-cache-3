40|$|PROJECT FINANCING OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINES A STUDY ON NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT FINANCING UNDER FINANCIAL LAW AND LAW OF SECURITY INTERESTS. 1 Object {{and methods}} of the study Currently, Russia is the only {{supplier}} of natural gas to Finland. This study investigates how can the natural gas markets in Finland be opened by constructing a natural gas pipeline from Norway through Sweden to Finland {{in a manner that}} would be beneficial under financing laws and the law of security interests. Answers have been sought applying traditional analytical doctrine, utilizing as far as possible the questions enabled by the doctrine. In places where the answers have not been found applying traditional analytical doctrine, Juha Karhu s contemporary approach to the law of security interests has been applied. This study discusses various issues under financial law and law related to security interests related to property located in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether a project company, as the borrower under a <b>project</b> <b>loan,</b> or the shareholders of a project company, could provide sufficient collateral for loan for a natural gas pipeline project. The legal literature used and discussed in this study includes a large variety of Nordic monographs and general property law books. In addition, Nordic case law concerning certain legal questions about which no literature is available has been studied in detail. 2 Structure of the study The study is divided into sections based on the type of collateral for the <b>project</b> <b>loan.</b> In addition, the study includes a short financing section in which the elements of a natural gas pipeline feasibility study are described, studied and applied to a hypothetical natural gas pipeline project. The discussion of the collateral for the <b>project</b> <b>loan</b> is divided into sections: (i) the property law-related issues concerning the construction of the pipeline and the possibility of pledging real estate owned, leased or expropriated by the project company as collateral for the project loan; (ii) the nature of the intercreditor agreements entered into among the members of the banking syndicate under Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian law; (iii) how the so-called earnings principle would affect the structure of the construction agreement for the natural gas pipeline and the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries; (iv) how the pledgee could use the control factor related to a share pledge when the shareholders of the project company pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the <b>project</b> <b>loan.</b> 2. 1 Real property required to construct the natural gas pipeline Due to its length, the natural gas pipeline would be built on real property owned by other parties than the project company. The project company would receive the right to use this property through an expropriation procedure. One of the most valuable assets of the project company has is the turbines that are located at the compressor stations. In order to ensure that the natural gas flowing through the pipeline remains pressurized, it must periodically be compressed along the pipeline at the compressor stations. This section examines the land codes of Finland, Sweden and Norway and discusses the possibilities for the project company to delineate which machine or facility is, or is not, part of a real estate through registration. This registration has proven useful in determining the scope of the real estate mortgage vis-√†-vis the scope of a business mortgage established to the project company s assets. The registration should be used to designate that the turbines, for example, are part of the project company s real estate, and therefore, pledged under the real estate mortgage. If this registration is not carried out, there is a risk that the turbines will be considered to be pledged as a part of the business mortgage established to the project company s assets. In Finland, a business mortgage lender may only recover 50 percent of the enforcement proceeds and the remainder is divided among all creditors. 2. 2 Intercreditor agreements t is customary for the members of the banking syndicate that finance a <b>project</b> <b>loan</b> to enter into an intercreditor agreement. This agreement regulates, among other things, the relationship between the senior and junior creditors regarding the terms of loan repayment and the payment order regarding the payment received from the enforcement of the project collateral. In Finland, the Act on Creditors Payment Order (1578 / 1992, as amended) regulates the payment order in a debtor s bankruptcy or foreclosure. Similar acts are in force in Sweden and Norway. However, it is possible for the parties to agree on an alternative payment order and these agreements are binding inter partes. In Finland, in order for the obligations of an intercreditor agreement to bind third parties, the agreement must be construed as a pledge or transfer of receivables with the intention of securing payment to the senior creditor. It may also be construed as a new financing form to which the Finnish Promissory Notes Act (487 / 1987, as amended) would be applied by analogy. 2. 3 The effects of the so-called earnings principle on the collateral securing the repayment of the <b>project</b> <b>loan</b> and on the construction agreement Due to the scale and complexity of natural gas pipeline projects, the construction of a natural gas pipelines usually takes years to complete. The so-called earnings principle affects the structure of the construction agreement. The question discussed in this section is whether it is advisable for the project company to allow the constructor to build the pipeline on its own account or whether the project company would benefit from an agreement under which the pipeline would be constructed in parts and the ownership of individual segments of the pipeline would be transferred to the project company upon their completion. If the constructor files for bankruptcy, this above-mentioned framework could serve as a basis for concluding which parts of the unfinished pipeline would be part of the project company s or the constructor s bankruptcy estate and which part will be covered by a business mortgage established to the project company s or the construction company s assets. In addition, the earnings principle affects the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries. If the pledged receivable is not divisible, and the pledgor was unable to earn the receivable before the pledgor s bankruptcy, the pledgor s bankruptcy estate has the right to terminate the underlying pledge agreement, rendering the pledge null and void. If the bankruptcy estate continues the pledgor s business, it is entitled to the pledged assets because no part of the pledge was earned by the pledgor prior to its bankruptcy. If (a) the pledged agreement is divisible, (b) the estate continues the pledgor s business and (c) the estate is unable to terminate the portions of the pledge already earned, the earnings principle divides the pledge into two parts: the pledgee will receive the part of the pledge earned prior to the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy estate is entitled to the part earned after bankruptcy. This study raises arguments against the contemporary view accepted in legal literature in relation to the pledging of future receivables. The contemporary view is to consider that the earnings principle is taken into account when the pledge is established. The view presented in this study is that the earnings principle does not come into effect prior to the execution phase of the pledge agreement. 2. 4 Pledging of the project company s shares The shareholders of a project company usually pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the <b>project</b> <b>loan.</b> The study analyses in detail the problems related to the control function and the collateral function of a share pledge. The control function related to a share pledge affects the possession of the shares from the establishment of the share pledge to the enforcement of the pledge. The thorough examination of the parties risk positions serves as an interesting starting point. The section discusses how the composition of a project company s board of directors may affect the decisions the project company makes and the claw back of the company s pledge/mortgage agreements to the project company s bankruptcy estate. There are jurisdictions in which a project company s sponsors are unable to pledge the project company s shares to the banking syndicate as collateral for the <b>project</b> <b>loan.</b> In such jurisdictions, a floating charge as found in English law may prove a useful tool due to the fact that it covers all of a company s assets (including real property). In such cases, the floating charge would de facto have the same characteristics as a share pledge in terms of controlling the project. Tutkimuksesta yleens√§ Tutkimuksessa on pyritty hakemaan vastausta siiten, miten Suomeen voitaisiin luoda maakaasumarkkinat rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeudellisesti kannattavalla tavalla rakentamalla putki Norjasta Ruotsin l√§pi Suomeen. Tarkastelun kohteena ovat erityisesti projektiyhti√∂n maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien rakentamista varten ottaman projektilainan vakuudet ja pankkikonsortion vakuusoikeudellinen asema. T√§m√§ p√§√§kysymys huomioiden tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan, miten rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeuden yleisi√§ oppeja ja sen mahdollistamia oikeudellisia instrumentteja voitaisiin hy√∂dynt√§√§ siten, ett√§ projektin rahoittava pankkikonsortio saisi lainalleen kattavat vakuudet. Maakaasuputken vaatimat kiinteis√∂t Tutkimuksen viitekehys muodostuu kiinteist√∂jen osalta tarkasteltavien maiden kiinteist√∂j√§rjestelmien erojen ja yht√§l√§isyyksien sek√§ kiinteist√∂n ulottuvuuden selvitt√§misest√§. Kiinteist√∂n ulottuvuudella on merkityst√§ sen suhteen, mit√§ omaisuutta kuuluu kiinteist√∂- tai laitoskiinnityksen piiriin ja mik√§ osuus on vakuutena yhti√∂n varoihin vahvistetun yrityskiinnityksen nojalla. Maakaasuputken rahoittajien asema Maakaasuputken rakentaminen toteutetaan projektilainalla/(-lainoilla), jonka my√∂nt√§√§ yleens√§ pankkikonsortio. Senioriluotonantaja, jonka saatavalle junioriluotonantajan saatava on alistettu, on kohdeyhti√∂n varoja jaettaessa maksunsaantij√§rjestyksess√§ muita rahoittajia edell√§, joten huonommassa asemassa olevien juniorilainojen p√§√§oma ja korot voidaan maksaa p√§√§s√§√§nt√∂isesti silloin, kun senioriluoton p√§√§oma ja korot on maksettu. Mezzanine-instrumentit ovat sopimuksellisesti tai rakenteellisesti alisteisia suhteessa seniorilainoihin. Mezzanine-velkojat luetaan junioriluotonantajiin. Ne tulevat velkojien kesken√§√§n sopimassa maksunsaantij√§rjestyksess√§ senioriluotonantajien j√§lkeen, mutta ennen muita junioriluotonantajia. Tutkimuksessa tullaan perustellusti siihen tulokseen, ett√§ tarkoituksenmukaisinta olisi mielt√§√§ velkojien v√§linen alistamissopimus saatavan panttaukseksi tai siirroksi (vaikka sit√§ kansainv√§lisess√§ luotonannossa ei n√§in j√§sennet√§k√§√§n), taikka vaihtoehtoisesti omaksi vakuusmuodokseen, johon voitaisiin analogisesti soveltaa velkakirjalain m√§√§r√§yksi√§. Urakkasopimuksen rakenteen vaikutus ansaintaperiaatteen soveltuvuuteen sek√§ ansaintaperiaatteen soveltuvuus maakaasuputken tuottaman kassavirran panttaukseen Ansaintaperiaatteella tarkoitetaan panttioikeudellisessa mieless√§, ettei saamista koskeva panttaus sido pantinantajan ulosmittausvelkojia ja konkurssivelkojia, ennen kuin pantatun saamisen perusteena olevan pantinantajan suoritusvelvollisuus on t√§ytetty. Ansaintaperiaatteen vaikutusta projektirahoituksessa tarkastellaan t√§ss√§ tutkimuksessa silm√§ll√§ pit√§en urakoitsijan mahdollisia taloudellisia vaikeuksia ja n√§iden vaikutusta projektilainan vakuuksiin. Sill√§, toimiiko urakoitsija rakennuttajana omaan lukuunsa niin, ett√§ maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien omistusoikeus luovutetaan projektiyhti√∂lle vasta niiden valmistuttua vai rakennetaanko putki suoraan projektiyhti√∂n lukuun niin, ett√§ omistusoikeus maakaasuputkeen ja kompressoriasemiin siirtyy sit√§ mukaa kuin ne valmistuvat, on ratkaiseva merkitys. Ansaintaperiaatetta on perinteisesti tutkittu ja oikeusk√§yt√§nn√∂ss√§ sovellettu kassavirran panttaamisen yhteydess√§. Maakaasun siirtomaksuista kertyv√§ kassavirta on projektiyhti√∂n t√§rkein omaisuuser√§. Maakaasua siirt√§v√§n projektiyhti√∂n kassavirran panttaamiseen ansaintaperiaate soveltuu hyvin alalla noudatetun k√§yt√§nn√∂n vuoksi. T√§ss√§ tutkimuksessa ansaintaperiaatteen sovellettavuutta tutkitaan kuitenkin my√∂s rakennutettavien esineiden omistusoikeuden siirtymisen kohdalla. Projektiyhti√∂n pankkitilien panttaus Pankkitilien panttausta koskeva s√§√§ntely on t√§ss√§ tutkimuksessa soveltuvilta osiltaan Pohjoismaissa hyvin samankaltaista. Sill√§ sijaitsevatko projektiyhti√∂n pankkitilit pankkikonsortiopankeissa vai jossain n√§iden ulkopuolisissa pankeissa on kuitenkin merkityst√§ Ruotsissa. Ruotsin konkurssilaissa ei nimitt√§in ole erityist√§ kieltoa pankille kuitata saatavansa pankkitilill√§ olevia saatavia vastaan, vaikka kuittaus konkurssin ulkopuolella olisikin sopimuksen nojalla kielletty. Ruotsissa tilipankissa olevien varojen on katsottu olevan pankin omaisuutta ja sen k√§ytett√§viss√§ kuittaukseen panttauksesta huolimatta. Velkoja voi kuitata velallisen konkurssissa sek√§ siin√§ tapauksessa, ett√§ h√§nen oma velkansa on er√§√§ntym√§t√∂n tai ehdollinen ett√§ siin√§ tapauksessa, ett√§ velallisen velka on er√§√§ntym√§t√∂n tai ehdollinen. Suomessa pankkien eriarvoisuudesta johtuvat ongelmat on huomioitu konkurssilaissa. Ongelma esiintyy ainoastaan tilanteessa, jossa projektilainanvakuudet t√§ytyy jakaa pankkikonsortion j√§senten kesken. K√§yt√§nn√∂ss√§ kuitenkin projektilainan vakuuksia hallinnoi aina vakuusagentti kaikkien pankkikonsortion j√§senten lukuun ja pankkikonsortion j√§senten kuittausoikeus on sopimusoikeudellisesti estetty velkojien v√§lisen alistamissopimuksen (intercreditor agreement) kuittauskielloilla. Tutkimuksessa p√§√§dyt√§√§n perustellusti siihen tulokseen, ett√§ vakuusagentin k√§ytt√∂ ja velkojien v√§lisen alistamissopimuksen m√§√§r√§ykset ovat v√§ltt√§m√§tt√∂mi√§ erityisesti Ruotsissa, jotta v√§ltet√§√§n tilipankin kuittausoikeuden aiheuttama ongelma. Osakekantapantti ja kontrollifunktio Osakekantapantti on projektirahoituksessa takauslain mukainen vierasvelkapanttaus. Pankkikonsortio kontrolloi projektiyhti√∂n hallintoa t√§lle annetun valtakirjan ja hallituksen tarkkailijaj√§senten avulla. Osakekantapanttiin liittyv√§ kontrollioikeuden k√§ytt√§minen ei merkitse ainoastaan vaikuttamista osakekantapantin kohteena olevaan yhti√∂√∂n, vaan kontrollioikeudella s√§√§dell√§√§n my√∂s osakekantapantin realisointiajankohtaa. Mahdollinen maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaus Kansainv√§lisi√§ sijoittajia voisi houkutella sijoittamaan suomalaisiin/Pohjoismaalaisiin hankkeisiin mahdollistamalla maakaasuverkkoluvan vakuusk√§yt√∂n. Esimerkki√§ lupien vakuusk√§yt√∂lle l√∂ytyy muun muassa kaivosluvan vakuusk√§yt√∂st√§ sek√§ Norjasta, miss√§ putken operoimiseen ja rakentamiseen my√∂nnetty√§ lupaa voidaan k√§ytt√§√§ vakuutena operointia ja rakentamista varten otetulle lainalle. Maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaamisen mahdollistaminen ei aiheuttaisi suurta hallinnollista taakkaa maakaasumarkkinaviranomaisena toimivalle Energiamarkkinavirastolle sen vuoksi, ettei Suomeen tule useita maakaasuputkihankkeita. Kyse olisi todenn√§k√∂isesti muutamasta luvasta. Maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaamisella olisi ehk√§ enemm√§nkin merkityst√§ maakaasuputkihankkeen vakuuskokonaisuuden kannalta. Olisi varmasti oikeuspoliittisesti tarkoituksenmukaista, mik√§li maakaasuverkkoluvan vakuusk√§ytt√∂ sallittaisiin, samassa yhteydess√§ muuttaa lakia/maanmittauslaitosten kirjaamisohjeita mahdollistaen pakkolunastetun k√§ytt√∂oikeuden luokitteleminen rasitteeksi. N√§iden kahden vakuusoikeuteen liittyv√§n muutoksen avulla pantin kohteena olisi projektiyhti√∂n harjoittama maakaasuverkkotoiminta sek√§ toiminnan edellytt√§m√§ kiinteist√∂omaisuus kokonaisuutena. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{in depth}} {{one of the}} potential causes of the low performance of foreign aid; in particular, the role incentive structures within international donor agencies could play in leading to ‚Äúa push‚Äù to disburse money. This pressure to disburse money is termed as the ‚ÄúMoney-Moving Syndrome‚Äù. In this dissertation, the ‚ÄúMoney Moving Syndrome‚Äù exists when the quantity of foreign aid committed or disbursed becomes, in itself, an important objective side by side or above the effectiveness of aid. The theoretical analysis relies on the principal-agent theory to explore how donor agencies‚Äô institutional incentive systems may affect the characteristics of an optimal and efficient incentive contract and thus give rise to the ‚ÄúMoney-Moving Syndrome‚Äù. We adapted the basic framework developed in Baker (1992) to fit the organizational settings of international development agencies. The model concludes that {{the extent to which}} a performance measure based the amount of aid allocated within a specific period of time would lead to the ‚ÄúMoney-Moving Syndrome‚Äù and affect aid effectiveness depends on the level of institutional imperatives for survival and growth, the degree of aid agency‚Äôs accountability for effectiveness, the level of corruption in recipient countries and the degree of difficulty to evaluate development activities. Due to data unavailability regarding other bilateral and multilateral aid agencies, the empirical framework tests several predictions of the theoretical model by examining whether money moving incentives affect World Bank‚Äôs decisions regarding <b>project</b> <b>loan</b> size in developing countries. Overall, the empirical results suggest that there seems to be some degree of ‚ÄúMoney-Moving Syndrome‚Äù in effect within the World Bank...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the diverse {{challenges}} that the masses faced in the procurement of housing from the public and private sector housing market, many people had turned to seek assistance through the organized informal sector, especially the co-operative society. This study explored Co-operative Societies intervention in housing provision with the ultimate aim of establishing empirically the different methods of meeting housing needs of their members in Lagos State. Ikeja Area office, having the highest number of institution based Co-operative Societies in Lagos Metropolis was purposely selected for the study. Thus structured questionnaires were administered to two groups of respondents, the principal officers of the selected 54 institution based co-operative societies together with their 315 members. Secondary data were also collected through the review of relevant publications and records of some of these societies. Primary data analysis was carried out with tables, percentages and relative importance index while independent sample t-test was used to find if there is any statistical significance between the opinion of the principal officers and members on the success rates of the methods of housing provision engaged by the co-operative societies. The study found that amongst others that both categories of respondents have similar opinion on the method of housing provision commonly engaged with housing development loan (corporate scheme) ranking first, followed by land acquisition, documentation, layout and allocation, private housing <b>project</b> <b>loan,</b> then land acquisition, documentation, development and allocation with complete house purchase (universal) trailing behind. The study also revealed that most co-operative societies generate their funds and hardly receive financial assistance from external sources. The study concluded by suggesting a model that would incorporate external assistance from government, non-government and parent institutions and as well synchronize the various methods to make deliver a wholesome housing acquisition process for members of institution based co-operative societies...|$|E
