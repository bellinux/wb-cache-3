They accept the invitation. Cerie takes them shopping for her wedding dress, and when asked to try one on, Liz decides to buy one.|$|E
25|$|Early modems were {{generally}} very simple devices using acoustic couplers to handle telephone operation. The user would first <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> dial a number, then press the handset into rubber cups {{on the top}} of the modem. Disconnecting at the end of a call required the user to pick up the handset and return it to the phone. Examples of direct-connecting modems did exist, and these often allowed the host computer to send it commands to answer or hang up calls, but these were very expensive devices used by large banks and similar companies.|$|E
25|$|Hayes' {{solution}} to the problem was to use a small microcontroller to implement a system that examined the data flowing into the modem from the host computer, watching for certain command strings. This allowed commands to be sent to and from the modem using the same data pins as {{all the rest of the}} data, meaning it would work on any system that could support even the most basic modems. The Smartmodem could <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> dial numbers, and hang up again, all without any operator intervention. The Smartmodem was not necessary for BBS use but made overall operation dramatically simpler. It also improved usability for the caller, as most terminal software allowed different phone numbers to be stored and dialed on command, allowing the user to easily connect to a series of systems.|$|E

500|$|Each {{release of}} [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{included}} {{one or more}} B-sides. [...] "Polyethylene (Parts 1 & 2)", included on the CD1, 7-inch vinyl, and Japanese releases of the single, were a multi-section piece formatted much like [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] itself. The {{first part of the}} song consists of Yorke's vocals over acoustic guitar; the second part contains distorted guitar and organ and uses complex time signature changes. [...] "Pearly*", featured on the CD1 and Japanese releases of the single, was described by Yorke as a [...] "dirty song for people who use sex for dirty things". [...] "A Reminder", which appears on the CD2 release, features fuzzed guitar, thumping drums, and electric piano. According to Yorke, this song was inspired by [...] "this idea of someone writing a song, sending it to someone, and saying: 'If I ever lose it, you just <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and play this song back to remind me.'" [...] "Melatonin", also on the CD2 release, is a synthesiser-based song with lyrics similar to that of a lullaby, but with an undercurrent of menace in lines like [...] "Death to all who stand in your way". The OK Computer track [...] "Let Down" [...] is also included on the Japanese single.|$|E
500|$|Steiger played Pontius Pilate in Franco Zeffirelli's TV miniseries Jesus of Nazareth (1977). Stacy Keach, who portrayed Barabbas, {{expressed}} his joy at {{the opportunity to}} work with Steiger, describing him as [...] "generous and opinionated". In 1978, Steiger played a senator in Norman Jewison's F.I.S.T., opposite Sylvester Stallone, who played a Cleveland warehouse worker involved in the labor union leadership of the fictional organisation named Federation of Inter-State Truckers. Love and Bullets, later that year, in which Steiger appeared as a mafia boss, was poorly received; Roger Ebert dismissed it as a [...] "hopelessly confused hodgepodge of chases, killings, enigmatic meetings and separations, and insufferably overacted scenes by Steiger alternating with alarmingly underacted scenes by [...] Bronson". The following year, Steiger was cast as a general opposite Richard Burton and Robert Mitchum in Andrew V. McLaglen's war film Breakthrough, set on the Western Front. In The Amityville Horror (1979), Steiger appeared as a disturbed priest, who is invited to perform an exorcism on a haunted house. Again Steiger was accused of overacting; Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Mr. Steiger bellows and weeps and overdoes absolutely everything. He won't even <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> before it's rung 12 or 15 times." [...] Pauline Kael thought that Steiger's [...] "spiritual agony was enough to shatter the camera lens".|$|E

500|$|System Shock {{was first}} {{conceived}} {{during the final}} stages of [...] development, between December 1992 and January 1993. Designer and programmer Doug Church spent this period at the Texas headquarters of publisher Origin Systems, and discussions about Looking Glass Technologies' next project occurred between him and producer Warren Spector, with input from designer Austin Grossman and company head Paul Neurath in Massachusetts. According to Church, the team believed that they had made [...] "too many dungeon games"; and Neurath later explained that they were experiencing burnout after the rushed development of Ultima Underworld II. As a result, they decided to create another [...] "immersive simulation game", but without a fantasy setting. They briefly considered placing the game in modern day, but Church said that the idea was rejected because [...] "it [...] just beg so many questions: why can't I <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> why can't I get on the train, and so on". Church returned to Looking Glass in Massachusetts, where he, Neurath and Grossman brainstormed possible science fiction settings for the game. According to Spector, the game was initially titled [...] "Alien Commander" [...] and was a spin-off of the Wing Commander series; however, this idea was soon replaced entirely. Spector said that they enjoyed not being attached to an existing franchise, because it meant that they [...] "could basically do whatever [...] liked".|$|E
500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a tropical house, EDM, and electropop song with elements of bashment, featuring a drum and horn instrumentation. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, the song is composed in the key of A minor, and has a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Lipa's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. In the lyrics, the singer sets a list of rules that prevent her from getting back together with an ex-boyfriend. The rules are: [...] "One: Don't <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone / Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again / Three: Don't be his friend, you know you're going to wake up in his bed in the morning." [...] Lipa confessed in an interview with NPR that [...] "hey're not necessarily rules I've been able to stick by. But [...] rules that I feel like it's important to be able to tell yourself, to tell your friends... There's a reason people break up, and it's probably the same reason why you shouldn't get back together." [...] Warren explained through an annotation on website Genius that the track was a self-reminder for people recovering from a break-up to not succumb to a momentary temptation since it is not [...] "a good idea in the long term".|$|E

2500|$|Austin Nichols portrays Julian Baker, Peyton's ex-boyfriend from Los Angeles. [...] "The {{funny thing}} about Austin {{is that there was}} {{initially}} much resistance from the folks who have to OK our casting choices. Which is not rare, by the way," [...] commented Schwahn. [...] "When that happens, I <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and try to rationalize with everyone, or pout or bitch or whine and eventually I get my way (and probably get called an ass****) and this leads to Austin Nichols killing it as Julian, just as I suspected he would in the first place." [...] Schwahn added, [...] "This {{is not to say that}} there aren't good people and good allies working on my show at both the studio and network, just that the fans would be surprised at how things work behind the scenes." [...] A regular from season 7, Julian initially comes to Tree Hill to win Peyton back. He offers to produce a film based on Lucas's first book. At first, Peyton does not reveal to Lucas that Julian is her ex-boyfriend, but she is forced to do so when the plans of the movie take shape. Brooke rebuffs his advances until Peyton gives her blessing when she sees that Brooke has a serious interest in Julian. After Brooke opens up to Julian, they begin a relationship.|$|E

At the end of World War II he was personally hired by President Harry S. Truman to transport a specially-printed trillion dollar bill to Europe as the United States' contribution to the reconstruction of Europe. As the United States' richest citizen, Mr. Burns was thought to be the most trustworthy. Mr. Burns absconded with the bill and kept it in his possession for many years until it was lost to Fidel Castro in [...] "The Trouble with Trillions". In [...] "Homer the Smithers", it is revealed that Mr. Burns' mother is still alive at the age of 122 years, although Mr. Burns dislikes speaking to her, because she had an affair with President William Howard Taft and she refers to him as an [...] "improvident lackwit". Furthermore, because she is so old, the only things she can do (according to Smithers) are <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> dial and yell.|$|E
