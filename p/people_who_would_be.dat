5|$|SEN. CLINTON: Well, what Governor Spitzer {{has agreed}} {{to do is to}} have three {{different}} licenses; one that provides identification for actually going onto airplanes and other kinds of security issues, another which is an ordinary driver's license, and then a special card that identifies the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on the road.|$|E
25|$|Sanctions {{required}} under H.R. 4587 would probably {{increase the number}} of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> denied a visa by the United States Secretary of State. Most visa fees are retained by the department and spent without further appropriation, but some fees are deposited in the Treasury as revenues. CBO estimates that implementing those sanction provisions would affect very few people and, thus, have an insignificant budgetary effect.|$|E
25|$|In July 1940, the few {{military}} personnel trapped on the Islands {{were identified and}} sent to POW camps. A year later, all trained army officers in the Islands, many being retired English <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> deported from the Islands to Germany in 1942, or were Islanders who had served in World War I, many of these holding positions of authority in the Island Governments were identified. What was left were elderly veterans and civilian men and women, with no weapons or communications with England to give guidance.|$|E

25|$|Egypt {{approved}} Viagra {{for sale}} in 2002, but soon afterwards allowed local companies to produce generic versions of the drug, citing the interests of poor <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> able to afford Pfizer's price.|$|R

25|$|Albert Marsh of Mobile, Alabama {{established}} the commercial hamster {{industry in the}} United States in the 1940s. Marsh first got a hamster when he was gambling and won it in a wager. Somehow he got more hamsters after this one, perhaps from the breeding stock managed by Guy Henry Faget in Carville, Louisiana. At the time, Marsh was a highway engineer but unemployed. After getting his hamsters, he learned to breed them and founded Marsh Enterprises and the Gulf Hamstery, which promoted Syrian hamsters as pets, for laboratory use, and in business schemes. Marsh took advertisements in magazines, comics, and livestock trade journals which praised hamsters as pets and presented the idea that breeding hamsters was a good business investment. In his business, he shipped hamsters to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> breeders, then he coordinated the shipment of various breeders' hamsters to other breeders or to laboratories.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 2012, the NTC {{released}} a 15-page draft {{law that would}} regulate {{the election of a}} national assembly charged with writing a new constitution and forming a second caretaker government. The proposed law laid out more than 20 classes of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> prohibited from standing as candidates in the elections, including Libyans who had ties to Muammar Gaddafi, former officials accused of torturing Libyans or embezzling public funds, active members of the Revolutionary Guard, opposition members who made peace with Gaddafi and academics who wrote about Gaddafi's The Green Book. The draft bill also stipulated that 10% of the 200 seats in the constituent assembly would be reserved for women. The finalization of the election law would be followed by the appointment of an election commission to divide the country into constituencies and oversee the poll, to be held in June.|$|E
25|$|The Anglo-Irish Treaty {{provided}} that should Northern Ireland choose {{not be included}} in the Free State, a Boundary Commission would be set up to revise the borders between the two jurisdictions. The Irish perspective was that this was intended to allow largely nationalist areas of Northern Ireland to join the Free State, and shortly after the establishment of the Free State this commission came into being. However the commission concentrated on economic and topographic factors, rather than the political aspirations of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> living near the new border. In 1925 the Boundary Commission report, contrary to expectations, proposed ceding some small areas of the Free State to Northern Ireland. For a variety of reasons the governments agreed to accept the original Northern Ireland/Southern Ireland delineation in return for Britain dropping the Irish obligation to share in paying Britain's Imperial debts. The Dáil approved the boundary by a large margin of 71 to 20.|$|E

50|$|Rhonin died {{years later}} when he sacrificed himself trying to contain a mana bomb created by the Horde which {{destroyed}} Theramore Isle. His actions saved {{the lives of many}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> caught in the bomb's expansive radius, including his wife Vereesa and Jaina Proudmoore.|$|R
25|$|Patrick Henry {{questioned}} {{the authority of}} the Philadelphia Convention to presume to speak for “We, the people” instead of “We, the states”. In his view, delegates should have only recommended amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Consolidated government would put an end to Virginia’s liberties and state government. Nine states making a new nation without the rest would abrogate treaties and place Virginia in great peril. Edmund Randolph had changed from his opposition in the Philadelphia Convention to now supporting adoption for the sake of preserving the Union. He noted that the Confederation was “totally inadequate” and leading to American downfall. The new Constitution would repair the inadequacies of the Articles. If something were not done, the Union would be lost. The new government should be based on the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> governed by it, not the intermediary states. The Constitution should be ratified, along with any “practical” amendments, after the new nation was begun.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining a {{comfortable}} temperature inside {{such a large}} glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely {{on the fact that}} they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions - they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Due to the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function - the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors {{at the end of each}} day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.|$|E
500|$|With Lord Dartmouth Aldrich {{began to}} draw {{together}} the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{involved in his}} investigation. [...] They chose the matron of a local lying-in hospital as principal lady-in-waiting, the critic and controversialist Bishop John Douglas, and Dr George Macaulay. [...] A Captain Wilkinson was also included on the committee; he had attended one séance armed with a pistol and stick; the former to shoot {{the source of the}} knocking, and the latter to make his escape (the ghost had remained silent on that occasion). [...] James Penn and John Moore were also on the committee, but its most prominent member was Dr Samuel Johnson, who documented the séance, held on 1February 1762: ...|$|E

2500|$|This part of Psycharis' {{doctrine}} {{split the}} Greek intellectual world.

2500|$|On {{the same}} day, the Welfare Secretary Alan Johnson {{announced}} plans to replace Incapacity Benefit with two new benefits: [...] "Disability and Sickness Allowance", for people deemed too ill to work; and [...] "Rehabilitation Support Allowance", paid {{at the same rate}} as Jobseekers Allowance to less disabled <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> 'supported' by the DWP back into work. In reality, no benefits with these names ever materialised, and the policy behind [...] "Rehabilitation Support Allowance" [...] was still being debated more than a decade later.|$|E
2500|$|Research for the New World Tapestry's twenty-four panels {{began in}} 1980. [...] Tom Mor {{was joined by}} Tom Maddock, a retired friend from Ivybridge. [...] Over the months they {{travelled}} hundreds of miles together, researching the two hundred sixty four <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> named on the tapestry. [...] Heraldic expert Paul Presswell of Buckfastleigh identified all the coats of arms of the people, colleges and companies involved. [...] The result has been the creation alongside the tapestry of a library of files on each person {{and a collection of}} reference books of great use to researchers, scholars and teachers.|$|E

50|$|Critics, {{such as the}} Drug Free America Foundation, have criticised heroin {{assisted}} treatment {{along with}} other harm reduction strategies for allegedly creating the perception that certain behaviors can be partaken safely, such as illicit drug use, claiming that this may {{lead to an increase}} in that behavior by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>be</b> deterred.|$|R
2500|$|The {{movement}} originated {{along the}} U.S. border with Mexico in Arizona {{but was also}} strong in Chicago, Philadelphia, and California. In 1981, Rev. John Fife and Jim Corbett, among others, began bringing Central American refugees into the United States. It was their intent to offer sanctuary, or faith-based protection, from the political violence that was taking place in El Salvador and Guatemala. The Department of Justice indicted several activists in south Texas for assisting refugees. [...] Later 16 activists in Arizona were indicted, including Fife and Corbett in 1985; 11 were brought to trial and 8 were convicted of alien smuggling and other charges. [...] The defendants claimed their actions were justifiable to save lives of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> killed and had {{no other way to}} escape.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of cognitive reserve implies {{that people with}} greater reserve who already are suffering neuropathological changes in the brain will not {{be picked up by}} standard clinical cognitive testing. Conversely anyone who has used these instruments clinically knows that they can yield false positives in people with very low reserve. From this point of view the concept of [...] "adequate level of challenge" [...] easily emerges. Conceivably one could measure cognitive reserve and then offer specifically tailored tests that would pose enough level of challenge to accurately detect early cognitive impairment both in individuals with high and low reserve. This has implications for treatment and care. Currently some <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> eligible for it are not offered treatment while it may be offered in other cases needlessly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{size of the}} megalithic rings varied, perhaps {{according}} {{to the number of}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> using it during ceremonies.

Nonetheless, such gargantuan monuments were rare, and Burl calculated that most of the megalithic rings (92%) had an average diameter of , with an average area of 150 m² (1615ft²).|$|E
50|$|Humanitarian visas {{are also}} known as {{humanitarian}} parole in the USA which are documents granted for short-term urgent humanitarian relief, typically for up to one year. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>be</b> unable to enter the U.S. may be granted humanitarian parole in exceptional personal circumstances, but these do not permit them to obtain permanent residency.|$|R
50|$|Laurent Kabila {{ruled by}} decree and banned party {{politics}} until general elections planned for 1999.

2500|$|Judicial {{appointments}} {{are frequently}} {{thought to be}} politically motivated. In an interview in the Autumn 2012 edition of The Parchment, Mr Justice Peter Kelly head of the Commercial Court {{and head of the}} Association of Judges of Ireland said the appointments to the Supreme Court were [...] "purely political". He went on to say the creation of the [...] Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) in 1996 [...] "was done to create the semblance of independence as to how judges were appointed" [...] but [...] "the JAAB by common consent, doesn't really work". He continued [...] "We all know of cases of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> excellent judicial appointments and are passed over in favour of people who are not so well qualified." [...] He called for an independent body to appoint judges. In 2015 Mr Justice Kelly was appointed by the government as President of the High Court.|$|E
2500|$|After Epstein's death, Silvers was {{the sole}} editor until his own death in 2017.

Some of them work here, some used to work here, and some are just people we know. I think they would put out a terrific paper, {{but it would be}} different." [...] In 2008, the Review celebrated its 45th anniversary with a panel discussion at the New York Public Library, moderated by Silvers, discussing [...] "What Happens Now" [...] in the United States after the 2008 election of Barack Obama as president. Panelists included Review contributors such as Didion, Wills, novelist and literary critic Darryl Pinckney, political commentator Michael Tomasky, and Columbia University professor and contributor Andrew Delbanco. The 45th anniversary edition of the Review (November 20, 2008) began with a posthumous piece by Edmund Wilson, who wrote for the paper's first issue in 1963.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, naval {{innovations}} {{led to a}} German domination of trade in the Baltic Sea and parts of Eastern Europe through the Hanseatic League. Along the trade routes, Hanseatic trade stations became centers of the German culture. German town law (Stadtrecht) was promoted {{by the presence of}} large, relatively wealthy German populations, their influence and political power. Thus <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered [...] "Germans", with a common culture, language, and worldview {{different from that of the}} surrounding rural peoples, colonized trading towns as far north of present-day Germany as Bergen (in Norway), Stockholm (in Sweden), and Vyborg (now in Russia). The Hanseatic League was not exclusively German in any ethnic sense: many towns who joined the league were outside the Holy Roman Empire and a number of them may only loosely be characterized as German. The Empire itself was not entirely German either. It had a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual structure, some of the smaller ethnicities and languages used at different times were Dutch, Italian, French, Czech and Polish.|$|E
