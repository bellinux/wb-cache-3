40|$|Continuous {{measurement}} of oxygen {{level and pulse}} rate {{is very important for}} aged people, pregnant women and in many other critical situations. This is commonly monitored by a <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter.</b> This paper presents a low-cost and a miniaturized <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> to continuously measure patient‟s blood-oxygen saturation level (SpO 2) and pulse rate. Change in intensity of light transmitted through tissue due to arterial blood pulse can be measured as a voltage signal called the photoplethysmographm (PPG). Oxygenated blood has different light absorption characteristics than deoxygenated blood under red and infra red wavelengths. So the hardware implementation is included placing of two LEDs (red and infra red) on the patient‟s finger and a photo detector on opposite side of the LEDs to get the corresponding PPG signals which are used to estimate the SpO 2 by comparing the absorption characteristics of the two different colored light (red and infra red). As the PPG signal is mostly corrupted by patient‟s hand movement, it is given to LabView window by DAQ card for further signal processing. In this paper a low pass filter is used for removing motion artifacts and a moving average algorithm is applied to remove high frequency noise content. The SpO 2 is calculated by computing the AC and DC components of both the red and infra red LEDs corresponding PPG signals. The pulse rate is determined by time domain peak detection algorithm in LabView signal processing module...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Medical {{electrical}} equipments {{at health}} care facilities presented malfunction and wrong medical information due to poor electric power quality and to inadequate electrical Installations. Some equipment such as X-ray, computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are considered as polluting ones due to their high amount of harmonics and voltage transients produced on the electrical power supply when in operation, while other equipments, connected to the same power supply, are considered sensitive or victim ones, presenting failure or producing wrong. Approach: The effects on some sensitive medical electrical equipment were verified in a controlled environment at energy quality technological center of the technical school of the University of Sao Paulo. A heart monitor, pulmonary ventilator and <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> equipment types were submitted to a controlled voltage supply with high harmonic content and voltage sags. The test methodology used simulated conditions based on Brazilian NBR standards, ANSI/IEEE Std. 519, IEC 60601 and IEC 61000 - 4 - 11 standards. Results: The results of the polluting equipment current consumption measurements {{as well as the}} three sensitive equipments tested were presented and discussed. The pulmonary ventilator presented problems that range from stoppage to expiratory valve blockage and alarm system failures. The <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> presented display malfunctions and it was extremely sensitive to voltage sags. The heart monitor maintained steady operation in all test cases. Conclusion/Recommendations: In spite of several existing recommendations and standards for testing medical electrical equipments, {{there is a lack of}} standard related to test cases considering the effects of high harmonic and voltage sags. The quality of electrical installation in {{health care facilities}} needs to be improved to reduce risks to the patients and to provide better health treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 1 : Comparative {{testing of}} <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeters</b> for {{screening}} of {{congenital heart disease}} in newborns Background. Pulse oximetry testing can be a useful tool in order to detect congenital heart defect. There are several types of monitors on the market. We wanted to find the differences in these monitors regarding technology, qualities, price and oxygen saturation values. SpO 2 below 95 % {{was used as the}} border value for a positive test. Material and methods. 18 children were included in the study. Three different apparatus were tested and compared against each other. The study included Masimo SET Radical tm, Nellcor OxiMax N- 550 og MiniCorr Oximeter BCI 3402. The sensor was placed on the childs lower extremitet. We observed how fast the oximeters stabilised and measured the pulse and oxygen saturation values six times in the space of three minutes. Results. The oximeters stabilised after 13 too 21 seconds. MiniCorr was the fastest. Masimo showed significant higher SpO 2 -value than the other two and the lowest number of false positive. Masimo showed a greater variation in the values measured than the other two. Interpretation. Pulse oximeter measurement is simple and fast. In order {{to reduce the number of}} false positive testes the child must stay calm and while the saturation is low, the registration has to continue for at least two to four minutes after the oximeter count the correct pulse. Abstract 2 : Can pulse oximeter screening in the newborn period decrease the age at diagnosis for children with transposition of the great arteries or total anomalous venous connection? Background. An early diagnosis of some congenital heart defects is of vital importance for the further prognosis. Our study has looked at the time of diagnose for two cyanotic heart defects, transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and total anomalous pulmonary venous connections (TAPVC). The purpose of the study was to see if an early screening with pulse oximeter could reveal the mentioned diagnosis at an earlier stage. Material and method. Retrospectively we studied the journals of all children who had been diagnosed with TGA and TAPVC between 1993 and 2004 at Ullevål University Hospital. Our main focuses were the age, ethnicity signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Results. A total number of 68 children were included in the study. 58 % of the children did not have the diagnosis within their first two days, when they normally would have been sent home from the hospital. Children of non ethnic Norwegian parents were given a diagnosis later than others, median values were 7 and 2 days respectively. TAPVC was diagnosed later than TGA, median values were 9 and 1 ½ days respectively. Interpretation. Screening with pulse oximeter on newborns could potentially reveal cyanotic heart defects in children earlier and thus give them a better prognosis...|$|R

The NHA is composed of several instruments, in-cluding an electronic blood pressure instrument (with <b>pulse</b> curve detection), <b>oxymeter</b> (SpO 2), hemoglobinometer and a core-body thermometer. Their data inputs are the dynamic characteristics of the patient’s condition. The static charac-teristics including, date of birth, sex, height, weight and test date are entered manually or via computer. These in-puts are analyzed by a high performance multi-function data acquisition computer. In a recently published retro-spective study of 203 ICU patients thermodilution cardiac output data were compared with NHA computed CO val-ues. Statistical evaluation, concerning bias, precision and accuracy showed clinically acceptable ranges according to a literature survey. The hemodynamic pattern of two essen-tial hypertensive patients were computed by the NHA and diagnostic and therapeutic directions were demonstrated. The NHA computer-aided clinical decision system provides reliable guidance for hemodynamic evaluation and leads to a scientifically based differential diagnosis of hypertensive patients as a promising screening method. Since the NHA system can function separately from direct patient measure-ment, it can be ideally applied to telemedicine applications...|$|R

40|$|SummarySexual {{activity}} {{is an important}} component of quality of life in patients suffering from chronic illnesses. To our knowledge, the effects of sexual activity on gas exchange in patients with respiratory failure have not been yet studied. To such an extent, we evaluated the oxygen saturation (SaO 2), by a <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter,</b> during three different sexual performances in a 63 -yr-old patient affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). The sexual performances were divided in four periods: basal, sex, 10 min after sex and relax. In each performance during sex, we observed a significant increase of either heart rate (HR) or SaO 2, with the highest value of the latter achieved within the 10 min of the post-sex period. SaO 2 returned to basal value (pre-sex) {{by the end of the}} relax period. We conclude that the observed improvement of SaO 2 during sexual activity might be due to a better ventilation/perfusion ratio (V/Q) obtained for either an increase of ventilation (hyperventilation) and perfusion (tachycardia), without significant muscle expenditure...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to evaluate changes in finger pulse wave amplitude (PWA), as measured by photoplethysmography, and heart rate (HR), related to obstructive respiratory events and associated arousals during sleep. We analyzed 1, 431 respiratory events in NREM sleep from 12 patients according to (1) the type of event (apnea, hypopnea, upper airway resistance episode) and (2) the duration of the associated EEG arousal (> 10, 3 - 10, < 3 s). Obstructive respiratory events provoked a relative bradycardia and vasodilation followed by HR increase and vasoconstriction. Relative PWA changes were significantly greater than HR changes. These responses differed significantly according to EEG-arousal grades (timexarousal interaction, p< 0. 0001), with longer arousals producing greater responses, but not to the type of respiratory event (timexevent interaction, p = ns). Obstructive respiratory events provoke HR and PWA changes, the magnitude seemingly related to the intensity of central nervous activation, with PWA changes greater than HR.

This study with the goal of comparing of reflexive and stroke massages on physiologic indices in patients with MI was performed. Methods: This clinical trial was performed in 2012 on 105 patients who were randomly assigned into three groups: reflexive massage, stroke massage and control groups (each with 35 patients). In the intervention groups each patient took massages for 15 minutes in morning and afternoon in one day. Vital signs and arterial O 2 saturation were measured before and after the massage by blood pressure cuff, thermometer, and <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter.</b> Paired T test and X 2 test were used to analyze data. Results: The stroke massage produced significant difference between arterial O 2 saturation levels (p = 0. 002) and temperature rates (p = 0. 017) in morning and afternoon in a day. Reflexive massage as well, causing significant difference between the mean of heart rate and temperature rates in morning and afternoon in a day (P= 0. 001). No significant differences in physiologic indices were seen in control group. Conclusion: Results showed that both massages were effective on vital signs, but stroke massage besides effect on vital signs of the patients, had a positive effect on their arterial O 2 saturations, so doing this massages on these patients is recommended. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Heart {{disease and}} stroke {{are among the}} world’s leading causes of death and disability. The higher stress level, {{inactive}} lifestyle, unawareness about risk factors such as overweight, high cholesterol level, hypertension, diabetes etc. results in increasing risk of cardiovascular diseases. Heart patients have to follow different tests for diagnosis {{as well as for}} treatment. The presented techniques such as ECG are expensive, invasive and can be applied only under clinical observation. Development of noninvasive, accurate physiological parameter monitor which can be used at personal as well as clinical level is among the main fields in biomedical engineering. The popularity of smart phones is increasing at a very tremendous rate. A mobile phone can serve as an accurate monitor for several physiological variables, based on its ability to record and analyze the varying color signals of a fingertip placed in contact with its optical sensor. In this paper, we have used smartphone camera for collecting the PPG videos.

40|$|Objective To {{study the}} sign and {{symptoms}} of hypoxemia in children with pneumonia and to identify its clinical predictors in children between two months to five years of age. Methods Children between {{two to five years}} of age suffering from cough or difficult breathing were assessed. Arterial oxygen saturation was measured with a <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> and child was labeled hypoxic if < 90 %. The children were categorized into four types according to WHO criteria-Cough and cold, pneumonia, severe pneumonia and very severe pneumonia. Results Out of 200 patients that were included in the study population, 101 (51 %) were found hypoxemic and was found in all grades of pneumonia. Frequency of hypoxemia increased with the severity of pneumonia being 100 % for very severe pneumonia, 84 % for severe pneumonia and 9 % for pneumonia. None of the patients in the cough and cold category was found hypoxic. On univariate analysis, different predictors for hypoxemia found were inability to feed and drink, lethargy, tacypnoea, central cyanosis, chest indrawing and grunting. Discussion Prevalence of hypoxemia decreased with increasing age of the child. Significantly more number of infants (2 – 12 months) were hypoxemic as compared to elder children. Conclusion Pneumonia in infants is risk factor for hypoxemia. Children less than one year with cough and difficult breathing were at more risk for hypoxemia.

Material-Method: SubjectsFifty-three patients with stable COPD (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) 46 ± 9 % predicted, mean age 71 ± 12 year) and 15 healthy individuals (mean FEV 1 101 ± 13 % predicted and mean age 63 ± 8) were included. InterventionsFunctional performance was evaluated by STST and 6 MWT. During the tests, severity of dyspnea (by Modified Borg Scale), heart rate, pulsed oxygen saturation (SpO 2, by Modified Borg Scale) (by <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter),</b> blood pressure were measured. The pulmonary function (by spirometry), quadriceps femoris muscle strength (by manual muscle test) and quality of life (by Nottingham Health Profile Survey) were evaluated. ResultsThe STST and 6 MWT results were lower in COPD group than the healthy group (P< 0. 05). During the 6 MWT the rise in the heart rate, systolic blood pressure and the decrease in SpO 2 were statistically significant according to STST in COPD groups (P< 0. 05). The STST and 6 MWT were strongly correlated with each other in both groups (P< 0. 05). Similarly, they were correlated with age, quality of life, peripheral muscle strength and dyspnea severity in COPD groups (P< 0. 05). ConclusionSimilar to 6 MWT, STST is also able to determine the functional state correctly. Additionally, it produces less hemodynamical stress compared to the 6 MWT.

Group 2 : Patientswere treated with nebulisation with 300 mg of tobramycin twice daily in addition to bronchodialators,oxygen and oral antibiotics. For symptomatic relief drugs like paracetamol, proton pump inhibitors andantiemetics were prescribed. The progression of treatment was monitored by regular follow up ofpatient’s total leucocyte count, Erthrocyte sedimentation rate, X ray chest, pulmonary function test onalternate days, oxygen saturation by <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> and arterial blood gas analysis. Clinical parameterslike resipratory rate, blood pressure, fever and patient’s well being were also monitored. Result: Using Z test this study showed that group 2 patients had better outcome (p value 92 %, rapid normalization of cellcounts and clinical parameters improved in 4 days in group 2 in comparison to 6 days in group 1 patients. Study Limitation: Minor comorbidities of few patients were not taken into consideration in this study.

40|$|AbstractTo {{compare the}} effects of salmeterol, an {{adrenergic}} drug, and ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic drug, on breathlessness and gas exchange during exercise in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), we performed a progressive treadmill exercise test on 15 patients on 3 days (24 h apart), after inhalation placebo, ipratropium bromide (120 μg) or salmeterol (50 μg) in a randomized fashion. Dyspnoea during exercise was evaluated from the regression slope between Borg scale (BS) scores and distance walked each minute on the treadmill. The regression was expressed as the distance walked at BS score 5, the threshold load of dyspnoea (TLD) and breakpoint load of dyspnoea. During and after the exercise, oxygen saturation was monitored by <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> and we measured the lower SaO 2 during exercise and the recovery time of SaO 2 after exercise. In comparison to placebo inhalation we found the same small but significant improvement in airflow limitation after salmeterol or ipratropium inhalation, also the distance walked on treadmill increased after bronchodilators. After bronchodilators the magnitude of oxyhaemoglobin desaturation with exercise {{was similar to that}} observed after placebo but the duration of the recovery from sustained SaO 2 desaturation after exercise was shorter to the same extent as after ipratropium or salmeterol. Dyspnoeic sensation, when assessed by the TLD and by the distance walked at BS score 5, was decreased after salmeterol and after ipratropium bromide to a similar extent. We conclude that the salmeterol, when given in conventional doses, produces significant improvement in the airway obstruction in the recovery of postexercise HbO 2 desaturation and in dyspnoeic sensation in patients with COPD, effects which were similar to those observed after inhalation of the anticholinergic agent ipratropium bromide...|$|E

40|$|Leukotrienes, {{one of the}} {{mediators}} of inflammation in asthma, have {{a strong}} bronchoconstrictive effect. L-carnitine {{has been reported to}} influence respiratory functions. It has also been reported that L-carnitine inhibits leukotriene synthesis. To evaluate the effects of L-carnitine on oxygen saturation, urine leukotriene E 4 levels and lung histopathology in a murine model of asthma, high IgE responder BALB/c mice (n = 24) were systemically sensitized to ovalbumin and chronically challenged with low particle mass concentrations of aerosolized ovalbumin, and then they were divided into 3 groups (study groups A, B, and C) each including eight mice. After methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction, the mice in groups A and B were given intraperitoneal L-carnitine (250 and 125 mg/kg, respectively), while the mice in group C were given placebo. Oxygen saturation of the mice was measured by <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> before and after methacholine and after L-carnitine/ placebo application. In addition, urine leukotriene E 4 levels were measured before asthma development, and 24 -h after L-carnitine injection in asthmatic mice. Inflammation in the lung tissues of the sacrificed animals was scored histopathologically to determine the effect of L-carnitine on tissue level. A control group of non-sensitized mice (n = 8) treated with placebo only was used for comparison of urine leukotriene E 4 levels and of histopathological parameters. Oxygen saturation of the mice in the study groups tended to decrease after methacholine and to improve after L-carnitine injection, although these changes were not significant at all time points. Urine leukotriene E 4 levels of all 3 study groups increased significantly after asthma development. The rate of increment was smallest in the group given the highest L-carnitine dose (group A). Inflammation at the tissue level was also mildest in group A, and severest in the group that was not given carnitine (group C). All of the study groups and the control group differed significantly with respect to inflammation scores. In conclusion, L-carnitine improved oxygen saturation, and decreased urine leukotriene E 4 levels and inflammation in lung tissues in the present murine model of asthma. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Effect of tadalafil on {{cardiopulmonary}} haemodynamics {{in patients}} of chronic pulmonary diseases residing {{at an altitude}} has not been studied adequately. The present study reports the effect of tadalafil on cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in patients of chronic pulmonary diseases with PH residing at an altitude ranging between 1000 meters to 2500 meters above mean sea level. Methods: Seventy six patients of chronic pulmonary diseases with PH diagnosed by echocardiography were randomized to receive tadalafil 40 mg once a day or to the control group. The effect of tadalafil on cardiopulmonary haemodynamics was assessed after 3 months of tadalafil exposure. The echo Doppler derived indices of cardiopulmonary haemodymics recorded were; TR gradient, pulmonary flow acceleration time, pulmonary vascular resistance, myocardial performance index, RV eccentricity index, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and cardiac output. The arterial oxygen saturation was measured by <b>Pulse</b> <b>oxymeter.</b> Results and Interpretation: Tadalafil significantly improved the indices of RV performance; pulmonary flow velocity time integral (14. 54 +/- 3. 17 cm versus 12. 25 +/- 2. 25 cm, p < 0. 0002), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (18. 53 +/- 4. 0 mm versus 17. 11 +/- 3. 94 mm, p< 0. 002), RVFS 30. 6 % vs. 24. 8 % p< 0. 003. There was no {{significant change in the}} TR gradient although PFAT increased significantly with tadalafil; (89. 8 +/- 11. 7 vs. 76. 2 +/- 8. 2 msec. p< 0. 001). There was a trend of lower PVR with tadalafil buts not statistically significant 3. 6 +/- 0. 9 vs. 3. 1 +/- 1. 0. Tadalafil also improved the arterial oxygen saturation, SPO 2 (90. 91 +/- 1. 76 % versus 88. 40 +/- 1. 79 %, p< 0. 0001) significantly. Conclusions: Tadalafil improved RV function significantly but its effect on PVR was modest. [Natl J Med Res 2016; 6 (1. 000) : 28 - 34...|$|E
40|$|The case is {{presented}} of epiglottal and pre-epiglottal oedema secondary to {{infection of the}} pharyngolaryngeal area. The purpose of this report {{was to assess the}} utility of ultrasonography to image epiglottal and pre-epiglottal oedema. Bedside emergency department ultrasonography could be a valuable tool to detect pathological enlargement of the epiglottis. Ultrasonography may be used in unstable patients for diagnosing epiglottitis because it is cheap, rapid, non-invasive and does not aggravate the patient’s symptoms. Acute epiglottitis is a life-threatening disease because of its potential for sudden upper airway obstruction. It is a well-known entity in children but it is uncommon in adults and therefore is often misdiagnosed. We present the case of epiglottal and pre-epiglottal oedema secondary to infection of the pharyngolaryngeal area. The purpose of this case report was to assess the utility of ultrasonography to image epiglottal and pre-epiglottal oedema. CASE REPORT A 56 -year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with a history of fever, sore throat and gradually increasing hoarseness, which had started 2 days previously. He had been followed up since March 2007 with nasopharyngeal cancer. The patient’s last chemotherapy (cisplatine, doxitaxel and 5 -fluorourasil) was 2 weeks earlier, and he had not been treated with radiotherapy since January 2008. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 98 / 64 mm Hg, pulse rate 112 beats/minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths/minute, oral body temperature 38. 68 C and oxygen saturation 96 % with <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> at room air. Physical examinationwas normal except for a high body temperature, swelling on the anterior neck, pharyngeal erythema and epiglottal oedema on indirect laryngoscopy. This finding led us to think that the patient had epiglottitis. The patient was stable without any respiratory distress and he was suitable for ultrasound examination. Ultrasonography was performed at the bedside, which revealed a hypoechoic structure with an increase in thickness (5. 1 mm) of the echogenic pre-epiglottal space using a 10 MHz linear probe (Medison Digital Sonoace 5500; Medison America, In...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Intravenous {{prostaglandin}} E 1 (PGE 1) infusion is {{a treatment}} {{which has been}} proven {{to be effective in}} ductus dependent congenital heart disease. However, PGE 1 is very expensive, needed continuous infusion and its supply is difficult by every center. When its long term use is necessary, these problems become more important. The aim {{of this study was to}} show whether oral PGE 1 could keep the ductus open or not till the supply of intravenous PGE 1. Method: Ten patients, who were admitted to newborn intensive care unit with the diagnosis of ductus dependent congenital heart disease and received oral PGE 1 till the supply of intravenous PGE 1, were evaluated. The PO 2 with the arterial blood gas analysis and SO 2 levels with <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> at skin were recorded before and after the administration of oral and intravenous PGE 1. Results: The mean oral PGE 1 initiation age was 5. 5 hours (0. 5 &# 150; 25), and mean administration period was 28 hours (18 &# 150; 46). It was observed that the PO 2 and SO 2 levels of patients measured 2 hours after the initiation of oral PGE 1 were significantly increased compared to the levels before initiation of PGE 1. The improvement in PO 2 and SO 2 levels continued till the initiation of intravenous PGE 1. It was also observed that the PO 2 and SO 2 levels of patients measured 2 hours after the initiation of intravenous PGE 1 were slightly increased compared to levels before initiation of intravenous PGE 1. Conclusion: Although intravenous PGE 1 is more effective than oral PGE 1 in short term usage, oral PGE 1 is also sufficiently effective in keeping the dustus open. For this reason until the intravenous PGE 1 is supplied oral PGE 1 may be used as an alternative treatment choice. We think that in long term use oral PGE 1, which is cheaper and easy to use, could be used instead of intravenous PGE 1 without need of admission to hospital and opening intravenous line. However for this further studies are needed to confirm this assumption. [Cukurova Med J 2012; 37 (3. 000) : 150 - 156...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: the {{propofol}} is an hypnotic agent which {{during the}} anesthetic induction {{can lead to}} hypotension. Objective: evaluate the ephedrine´s efficacy in preventing the arterial hypotension caused by the association between propofol and remifentanil as anesthetic inductors. Patients and Methods: thirty patients with age between 18 and 50 years, ASA state PI e PII, were randomly divided in three groups according to the solution in use. Group I (n = 10) propofol 1 %; group II (n = 10) propofol 1 % associated with ephedrine (0, 5 mg. ml- 1); Group III (n = 10) propofol 1 % associated with ephedrine (1 mg. ml- 1). The patients have been monitorized with non invasive blood pressure, continuous ECG in DII and <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter.</b> It has been administrated midazolam at the dose of 0, 05 mg. kg- 1 intravenous 5 minutes before induction. After pre-oxygenation with FiO 2 at 100 %, it has been administrated remifentanil intravenous (0, 5 mg. kg- 1. min- 1) by 90 seconds. Then, the patients received the propofol solution 1 % (with/without ephedrine), in continuous infusion at rate of 180 ml. h- 1 until {{the loss of the}} palpebral reflex followed by cisatracurium (0, 15 mg. kg- 1). Blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation have been recorded in the moments: before induction, 1, 3, 5 and 10 minutes after propofol´s administration. Results: there were no statistically significant differences among groups in anthropometric data. The heart rate outline analyzed didn't show statistic significance between the groups. There has been reduction in the values founded at some moments between the groups I and II, however without clinical significance. In the arterial blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) data, there were reductions in the values at some moments compared to the initial time and between the groups, but they can't be classified as arterial hypotension. But, in group I, the ephedrine´s rescue dose administrated was larger comparing to the others groups (p < 0, 05). Conclusion: there haven't been, in none of the groups, important clinical reduction of blood pressure and heart rate. However, in group I, more patients needed ephedrine´s rescue dose to correct hypotension (p < 0, 05) ...|$|E

We aimed evaluate the consistency of practice and the adherence to the International Guidelines in early deliv-ery room management of ELBW infants in Italy. Materials and methods A questionnaire {{was sent to the}} directors of all Italian level III centers between April and August 2012. Results There was a 92 % (n= 98 / 107) response rate. Participating centers reported an overall number of 198. 322 births during 2011, and of these, 1933 were ELBW infants. Northern and Central centers had a higher median of births and of ELBW infants than Southern centers. A provider skilled in neonatal resuscitation is present in high-risk deliveries in 46 % of III level centers: this rate was higher in Northern (77. 5 %) than in Central (33. 3 %) and Southern (21. 6 %) centers. The team leader for neonatal resuscitation is generally a Pediatrician/ Neonatologist (67. 2 %). The median delivery room tem-perature was 24 °C (IQR: 22 – 25). Only 18 centers (20. 2 %) achieved a delivery room temperature over 25 °C. A poly-ethylene bag/wrap was used by 54 centers (55. 1 %). Most centers had a <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> (91 / 98, 92. 9 %) available in delivery room and used saturation targets (82 / 98, 83. 7 %).

40|$|Introduction Telemedicine enables {{patients}} to get needed diagnostics and therapy by specialists without personal contact and supports early diagnosis {{in case of}} disease. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is high and results in severe sequelae such as cardiovascular diseases and type-II diabetes. For definite diagnosis polysomnography (PSG) is needed. However, sleep laboratory capacities are limited and PSG is cost-intensive. Sensitive and highly specific preliminary investigations supported by telemedicine may identify patients needing therapy earlier. Cessation of breathing is characteristic for OSA. The resulting lack of oxygen uptake leads to a consecutive oxygen desaturation. The duration of oxygen desaturation and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) correlate with a high predictive rate {{in comparison to the}} polysomnographically determined apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) and thus determine the severity. The nightly long term-pulse oximetry is simple and cost-effective. Method Concerning significance of E-Health techniques for apnea diagnostics, my research is divided into 3 steps. Paper one is an open feasibility study. The aim was to construct a telemedical network for data transfer and evaluate measurements from different practices in cooperation with a specialised sleep laboratory. Paper two includes the technological comparison between different pulse oxymeters to define the clinical requirements. Paper three reflects the results of a prospectively single-blind study in a specialised sleep laboratory with respect to sensitivity and specificity of the telemedical system in comparison to the gold standard polysomnography. Results 1. Differentiated OSA-risk early diagnosis in outpatient setting with telemedical network structures is possible. 2. When selecting a <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter,</b> it is decisive to define exact matching limiting values. 3. Telemedical supported pulse oxymetry {{has proven to be a}} valid method. It is not affected by comorbidities and is a procedure with high sensitivity and specifity. Nightly pathological SaO 2 -changes have to be clarified. Qualified assessment by somnologists prevents false-positive and false-negative results, which is well known in devices with automatic assisted evaluation. Commonly used self-assessment questionnaires are not suitable for a pre-selection. Conclusion Taking the complaints, high health-risks, possible improvement of the patient’s quality of life (QoL) and the economical health aspects – tiredness/sleepiness as relevant cost factors for health, accident and pension insurance – into account, it is possible to achieve an effective use of limited resources with telemedical technology and interdisciplinary cooperation with sleep specialists. Likewise, patients of known risk groups can be supplied with necessary specific diagnostics at an early stage by means of easy available e-health techniques...|$|E
40|$|Stress is {{considered}} a major concern of the modem world as it negatively impacts social stability by hindering performance, efficiency and overall health of people. It {{is the leading cause}} of serious life threatening diseases such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, cancer and many psychological disorders. Therefore solutions are constantly researched as it has become a severe issue in the fast paced world especially western nations where they have encountered drastic consequences. The only solution that can counteract stress is relaxation. The western approach to stress management is mainly through psychotherapy and external stimuli such as brain synchronous music, while the eastern approach tends to go into deeper relaxation through meditation. It's not possible to detect stressed/relaxed psychological states directly, it is essential to study the physiological cues through which it manifest in order to detect it. According to literature different research studies have used cues Heart Rate Variation (HRV), skin temperature, Galvanic skin response, Respiration patterns, Electroencephalography (EEG) as physiological cues, however very few research studies have been carried out focusing on physiological effects of eastern relaxation techniques. Heart rate and Electroencephalography (EEG) were selected as physiological variables during this research and most importantly both western and eastern approaches to relaxation have been analysed together with counterpart stress. Stressed state triggered using arithmetic stressors and stressful videos while relaxed state generated by meditation and relaxation music. Nonin 4100 <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> and Emotiv EEG headset were respectively used for capturing raw heart rate and EEG signals. Fourier techniques have been widely used while wavelet techniques have been occasionally used for Heart rate and EEG data processing as per the literature, decided to proceed with wavelet packet decomposition as it allowed both frequency and time localization of the signal with much reasonable accuracy. Matlab together with EEGLAB was used as the data processing tool during entire research. Heart Rate signals' Power characteristics of Low Frequency (0. 04 - O. 1 S Hz) and High Frequency (O. lS - O. S Hz) bands, which correspond to sympathetic and parasympathetic activities were analyzed. Further power characteristics of Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma rhythms of EEG singals were analyzed for each test case, each channel. The results of the experiments were in par with the results suggested by current literature for common stress and relaxation test cases, importantly additional test case meditation triggered high power in Alpha EEG rhythm and high frequency band of Heart rate signals. It was possible to identify that db 2 (sym 2), dbS, sym 7, coiflets 4 and coifletsS wavelets can be used for heart rate based analysis, in addition to db 4 & dbS which were used in literature. Noticed that the EEG channels corresponding to occipital regions are the best channel locations that have to be analyzed to identify psychological state, while it's possible to use db 6, db 7, dbS coif 2, coif 3, coif 4, coifS, symS, sym 6, sym 7 and symS wavelets in addition to db 4 and dbS which were generally used in literature for EEG related analysis. Accuracy of the test setup can be further improved by incorporating more physiological cues and by identifying best techniques for filtering, rejecting artifacts of EEG signals. Further, state identification process needs to be automated while integrating a data mining tool to convert setup to a real-time psychological state detection and management tool. Abstrac...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of an infant’s condition at birth or during resuscitation remains mostly clinical {{and can be}} a challenge for practitioners [1 - 3]. In 2005, the addition of the transcutaneous oxygen saturation monitoring was suggested in the European guidelines [4] only to become part of AAP and ERC recommendations in 2010 [5, 6] By contrast, in the NICU, data from multimodal monitoring systems are generally integrated to the clinical evaluation to optimize newborn infants’ intensive care. Thus, respiratory mechanic information’s given by the ventilator provides useful informations on pressure, volume, leaks and respiratory function of the intubated infant [7]. While ventilation is the main intervention to support difficult transition to extra-uterine life, monitoring infants and medical procedures is only slowly integrating clinical practice in the delivery room [8]. Use of an experimental respiratory function monitor (RFM) at birth was suggested initially in 1984 in a study evaluating mask and bag ventilation in 9 term infants [9]. It reappeared 30 years later in a manikin study that discussed future use for research and as a training tool [10]. The RFM is connected to a computer for recording. A hot wire anemometer interposed between the mask and the pressure providing device (self-inflating bag SIB or T-piece) supply flow data, and therefore informations on tidal volume (VT), inspiratory and expiratory times, and leaks. The pressure line can be fitted at the T-piece gas inlet, the T-piece itself, or at a port on the SIB. Oxygen concentration can be quantified at the gas inlet, and integrated to the recording. Additionally, the software can accommodate heart rate and oxygen saturation data from a <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter.</b> A small webcam can also document both the infant’s visual aspect and actions undertaken. Clinical and simulation studies did highlight some technical difficulties of birth resuscitation and suggested ways to overcome them. Holding the face mask appropriately is surprisingly a difficult task. Large leaks are common, and are associated with lower VT’s [11]. Use of RFM in simulation studies allowed to investigate placement and hold of face masks [12]. Trainees also improved their technique when provided with RFM feedback [13]. RFM has been used to evaluate different pressure providing devices [14, 15]. The negative influence of chest compressions on the efficacy of manikin ventilation was documented with RFM [16]. In clinical practice, RFM was shown to decrease mask leak and helped to avoid excessive VT [17]. Currently, a randomized controlled trial evaluates if guiding neonatal resuscitation with RFM will improve infants’ outcomes. Studies with RFM in the delivery room did improve our understanding of respiratory adaptation at birth. Patterns of initial respirations have been further characterized, with long or delayed expirations observed mostly in preterm infants [18]. Very preterm infants’ respiration starts with increasing VT’s followed by smaller breaths and increased CO 2 exhalation[19]. With face mask ventilation, VT’s have a large variability, with lower volumes occurring when active inspiration is absent [11]. Additionally, obstructive phenomena (when positive pressure is not associated with insufflatory flow) seem common in the first minutes of life [20]. Our neonatal stabilization room now benefits from a RFM. This tool already has multiple applications. For new residents and for outreach training, the RFM helps to improve mask ventilation teaching on a leak-free manikin. Combined video and RFM recordings can be reviewed for educational and auditing purposes. We used it in a manikin study, to assess if different types of small manometers could improve bag and mask ventilation. Finally, RFM helps to evaluate the outcome of a resuscitation intervention in a randomized controlled trial. We are investigating the effect of either prophylactic suction before ventilation (as recommended by the AAP [6]) or no systematic suction (as in the ERC guidelines [5]) on the incidence of airway obstructions and neonatal adaptation.

40|$|Objetivos: Relatar resultados obtidos em testes da caminhada de seis minutos (TC 6) de pacientes com DPOC integrantes de programa de reabilitação pulmonar (PRP), com objetivo de contribuir para interpretação e adequada utilização deste teste. Paralelamente, estudar alguns fatores que interferem no treinamento físico durante a reabilitação pulmonar. Materiais e métodos: Foram avaliados, retrospectivamente, dados de 18 homens e cinco mulheres integrantes do PRP. Os pacientes foram submetidos a treinamento dos membros inferiores por três meses em três sessões por semana. Alguns parâmetros pré e pós-treinamento foram analisados: distância percorrida no TC 6 e sua relação com os valores calculados pelas equações de Enright e Sherril para valores de referência, volume expiratório forçado no 1 º segundo (VEF 1), carga de treinamento, freqüência cardíaca (FC) freqüência respiratória (f), saturação do oxigênio por oximetria (SpO 2), índice de massa corpórea (IMC). Resultados: Os valores obtidos durante o TC 6 pré-treinamento nos pacientes não diferiram dos de referência resultantes das equações de Enright e Sherril (p = 0, 777). Houve diferença significativa nesses valores, após treinamento (p = 0, 001). O aumento médio, na distância percorrida no TC 6, após treinamento, foi de 76 m; contudo, três pacientes não atingiram o aumento mínimo significativo de 54 m. A distância percorrida, pós-treinamento correlacionou-se positivamente com o VEF 1 pré-treinamento (p = 0, 012), mas não com o incremento de carga durante o treinamento (p = 0, 693). Não se observou diferença significativa na f, SpO 2 no TC 6 antes e após treinamento. A FC aumentou significantemente no final do TC 6 após treinamento. Nove pacientes (39 %) apresentaram o IMC abaixo do limite inferior; destes, 6 (66 %) atingiram 54 m ou mais de incremento na distância caminhada após treinamento. Conclusão: Sugere-se utilizar-se metodologia padronizada e adequada para realização do TC 6, {{inclusive}} quando o objetivo for obter valores de referência. As equações de Enright e Sherril para indivíduos normais parecem tender a valores subestimados, não diferindo estatisticamente dos valores obtidos pré-treinamento nesses pacientes com DPOC. Isso se deve, provavelmente, a diferenças na técnica de encorajamento utilizada pelos autores. Confirma-se o ganho de performance física, após reabilitação, independente do estado funcional inicial, justificando sua indicação mesmo para pacientes com limitação respiratória acentuada. A resposta heterogênea ao incremento de carga sugere a necessidade de analisar fatores preditivos da melhor resposta ao treinamento, para personalizá-lo e obter a melhor performance possível dos pacientes. Objectives: To {{report the}} results obtained in six-minute walk tests (6 MWT) performed {{in a group of}} patients under a pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) as a contribution to a better interpretation and the proper use of this test. Some factors that interfere with physical training during pulmonary rehabilitation were also studied. Methods: Retrospective data on 18 males and 5 females under a PRP were evaluated. During 3 months, the patients had 3 weekly training sessions to exercise the muscles of the lower extremities. The following parameters were analyzed before and after training: the distance walked during the 6 MWT and its relationship with the reference values calculated by the equations of Enright and Sherril; forced expiratory volume in one second, training load, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation by <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymeter</b> (SpO 2) and body mass index (BMI). Results: The values obtained during pre-training 6 MWT did not differ from the reference values calculated by Enright and Sherril equations (P = 0. 777). After training, these values differed significantly (P = 0. 001). The mean 6 MWT distance increase was 76 m. However, 3 patients did not reach the minimally significant increase of 54 m. Post-training 6 MWT correlated positively with pre-training FEV 1 (P = 0. 012), but not with load increase during training (P = 0. 693). No significant difference in RR and SpO 2 was observed before and after training. HR increased significantly at the end of post-training 6 MWT (P = 0. 035). In 9 patients BMI was lower than the inferior limit. Six of them (66 %) presented post-training distance increased in 54 m or more. Conclusions: The use of standardized methods for 6 MWT performance is recommended, even when reference values are targeted. The equations of Enright and Sherril for healthy subjects tended to yield underestimated values, with no statistical differences in training values in COPD patients. Differences in the encouragement technique employed could explain these conflicting results. Physical gain after rehabilitation was confirmed regardless of the patient's initial functional status, justifying the indication of rehabilitation even to those with severe respiratory limitations. The heterogeneous responses to load increase suggest the analysis of the predictive factors of the best response to training is necessary to customize load increase and thus obtain the best performance possible...|$|E
