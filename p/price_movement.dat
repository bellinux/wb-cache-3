2500|$|In weak-form efficiency, future prices {{cannot be}} {{predicted}} by analyzing prices from the past. Excess returns cannot be earned {{in the long}} run by using investment strategies based on historical share prices or other historical data. Technical analysis techniques {{will not be able to}} consistently produce excess returns, though some forms of fundamental analysis may still provide excess returns. Share prices exhibit no serial dependencies, meaning that there are no [...] "patterns" [...] to asset prices. This implies that future price movements are determined entirely by information not contained in the price series. Hence, prices must follow a random walk. This 'soft' EMH does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants not be able to systematically profit from market 'inefficiencies'. However, while EMH predicts that all <b>price</b> <b>movement</b> (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e., non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock markets to trend over time periods of weeks or longer and that, moreover, there is a positive correlation between degree of trending and length of time period ...|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the efficiency of}} the Philippine stock market using stock <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> during the period July 1987 to May 2004. Characterizing stock <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> as an AR(1) process with Laplace residuals, the statistical evidence supports the hypothesis that the Philippine stock market is weak-form efficient. An examination of major events that could plausibly affect share prices and large <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> from an event study perspective indicates fairly rapid absorption by the market of information, except in cases of extreme stress caused by political and economic shocks. Furthermore, factors other than information about fundamentals appear able to cause major share <b>price</b> <b>movements.</b> Given these, the support for the semistrong-form efficiency of the stock market is mixed. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{identifies}} some macroeconomic {{and policy}} implications arising from food inflation in South Africa. There are three main results {{emanating from the}} analysis in this paper. Firstly, food <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> have played {{a large role in}} generating inflationary episodes in South Africa. Secondly, while external influences do matter, South African food <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> are mainly due to domestic influences. This implies that national policy has an important role to play in taming domestic food price inflation. Thirdly, given the strong second-round impacts, food <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> warrant special attention in monetary policymaking. Core measures of inflation that exclude food <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> may not accurately reflect the underlying inflationary pressures in the economy and could compromise the attainment of the goal of price stability. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{effectiveness}} of price limits on Chinese A shares and investigate the characteristics of those stocks that hit their price limits more frequently. We find {{that the effect of}} price limits is asymmetric for the A shares in upward and downward <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> and different for bullish and bearish sample periods. During a bullish period price limits effectively reduce stock volatility for downward <b>price</b> <b>movements,</b> but not for upward price movements; while during a bearish period price limits effectively reduce stock volatility for upward <b>price</b> <b>movements,</b> but not for downward <b>price</b> <b>movements.</b> Second, <b>price</b> limits delay efficient price discovery for upward <b>price</b> <b>movements,</b> but not for downward <b>price</b> <b>movements.</b> However, we do not find evidence to suggest that price limits harmfully interfere with the stock trading processes in the Chinese A share markets. Finally, we find that actively traded stocks hit their price limits more often and tend to hit the lower limit more frequently when overall market conditions are bearish. Stocks with high book-to-market values of equity hit their upper price limits more frequently, while stocks with a high ratio of tradable shares tend to hit their price limits less frequently.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{research has found}} evidence of a relationship between oil <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> and stock <b>prices.</b> Most published research investigates the relationship between oil <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> and stock <b>prices</b> using either economy-wide measures of stock prices or industry sector measures of stock prices. An important question that has largely gone unanswered relates {{to the relationship between}} oil prices and stock prices when the size of firms is allowed to vary. Relative to large firms, do oil <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> have larger or smaller impacts on the stock prices of small- or medium-sized firms? The answer to this question could have important policy implications that affect economic growth and prosperity. In this paper, a panel of firms is followed over a 17 -year period to investigate the relationship between oil <b>price</b> <b>movements,</b> firm size, and stock prices. Evidence is found that shows the relationship between oil <b>price</b> <b>movements</b> and stock <b>prices</b> does vary with firm size and the relationship is strongest for medium-sized firms.
