Materials and methods: Fifty prospective measurements {{were made on}} 12 patients undergoing pulmonary artery catheter and mechanical ventilation. All measurements were divided into < 8 mmHg or ≥ 8 mmHg subgroups according to respiratory variability, and they were then subdivided into either an airway <b>pressure</b> <b>display</b> measurement group (AM group) or an expiration holding (EH) group for comparison. Results: In all measurements, the two groups showed similar levels of accuracy; however, for the time spent for measurement, the EH group was much faster than the airway <b>pressure</b> <b>display</b> measurement group (P< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{idea that}} {{emotions}} regulate social interaction is increasingly popular. But exactly how do emotions do this? To address this question, I draw on {{research on the}} interpersonal effects of emotions on behavior in personal relationships, parent-child interactions, conflict, negotiation, and leadership, and propose a new framework that can account for existing findings and guide future research: the emotions as social information (EASI) model. I demonstrate that emotional expressions affect observers' behavior by triggering inferential processes and/or affective reactions in them. The predictive strength of these two processes—which may inspire different behaviors—depends on the observer's information processing and on social-relational factors. Examples of moderators that determine the relative predictive strength of inferences and affective reactions include power, need for cognitive closure, time <b>pressure,</b> <b>display</b> rules, and the appropriateness and target of the emotional expression, which are all discussed...|$|E
40|$|Arctic {{atmospheric}} variability {{during the}} industrial era (1875 – 2000) is assessed using spatially averaged surface air temperature (SAT) and sea level pressure (SLP) records. Air temperature and <b>pressure</b> <b>display</b> strong mul-tidecadal variability on timescales of 50 – 80 yr [termed low-frequency oscillation (LFO) ]. Associated with this variability, the Arctic SAT record shows two maxima: in the 1930 s– 40 s {{and in recent}} decades, with two colder periods in between. In contrast to the global and hemispheric temperature, the maritime Arctic temperature was higher in the late 1930 s through the early 1940 s than in the 1990 s. Incomplete sampling of large-amplitude multidecadal fluctuations results in oscillatory Arctic SAT trends. For example, the Arctic SAT trend since 1875 is 0. 09 6 0. 038 C decade 21, with stronger spring- and wintertime warming; {{during the twentieth century}} (when positive and negative phases of the LFO nearly offset each other) the Arctic temperature increase is 0. 05 6 0. 048 C decade 21, similar to the Northern Hemispheric trend (0. 068 C decade 21). Thus, the large-amplitude mul-tidecadal climate variability impacting the maritime Arctic may confound the detection of the true underlying climate trend over the past century. LFO-modulated trends for short records are not indicative of the long-term behavior of the Arctic climate system. The accelerated warming and a shift of the atmospheric pressure pattern from anticyclonic to cyclonic in recent decades can be attributed to a positive LFO phase. It is speculated tha...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the data}} {{obtained}} by LES for an initially laminar and overexpanded jet at Mach number 3. 3 and Reynolds number 105 are reexamined in order to investigate the non-linear effects on the propagation of the acoustic waves, and the normalized flow/acoustics cross-correlations. To study the non-linear propagation effects at the direction φ = 60 ◦ and up to 240 radii from the nozzle exit, the LES near field is propagated in far-field by solving either the isentropic linearized Euler equations or the full Euler equations. The comparisons of the acoustic data obtained from the two methods clearly show that the non-linear effects are strong up to about 240 radii from the nozzle exit. Using the far-field acoustic results from the non-linear propagation, the normalized cross-correlations between the turbulent flow quantities and the acoustic pressure signals at the direction φ = 60 ◦ are then evaluated to give some information on sound generation. A sound source which may be similar to that one observed in subsonic jets is first found on the jet axis {{in the vicinity of the}} end of the potential core. Other sound sources attributed to the supersonic convection of turbulent vortices are noticed. Finally, the normalized cross-correlations between the fluctuating density along the jet axis and the acoustic <b>pressure</b> <b>display</b> correlation bands between the 3 rd and the 5 th shock cells.

The implementation of a coarse-grained technique allows a thorough description of all the kinetic and micromechanical properties of the particle flow in the outlet proximities. Though the free-fall arch does not exist as traditionally understood—a region above which particles have negligible velocity and below which particles fall solely under gravity action—we discover that the kinetic <b>pressure</b> <b>displays</b> a well-defined transition in a position that scales with the outlet size.
