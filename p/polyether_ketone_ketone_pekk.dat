SherwoodThis {{dissertation}} {{will examine}} the fabrication of different phosphorus containing films and their use as corrosion preventative films and adhesion materials between polymers and metal and metal alloys. Orthophosphate films are used in several metals and metal alloys to prevent corrosion and promote adhesion between paints or polymers and metal substrates.

The objectives of this study are to see if it is possible to fabricate different phosphorus containing films, use them to adhere polymers to metal and metal alloys, and test the phosphorus containing films’ and polymer films’ corrosion protection properties. The thermoplastic resin, <b>Poly(ether</b> <b>ketone</b> <b>ketone),</b> or <b>PEKK</b> was found to adhere well to different phosphorus containing films and protect the underlying layers from oxidation in 4 -D water.

The second, separate polymer films were created by dip coating the metal or metal alloy in a polymer solution. The film thickness in both cases was controlled to be less than 100 Å to ensure that the underlying metal or metal alloy could be detected. The surface chemical analysis was collected using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, or XPS. Core level and valence band XPS were used to distinguish the differences in the chemistry at the surfaces.

The formed PEKK-silica composite wet gel was dried by freeze-drying from tert-butanol to obtain PEKK-silica composite aerogel, which consisted of polymer fibers tangled together. By adjusting the concentration of PEKK with trimethoxysilane pendant groups in solution, PEKK-silica composite aerogels with different densities (ranging from 0. 17 to 0. 40 g/cm(3)) were obtained.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to explore structure-property relationships to develop the understanding needed for introduction of superior PEM materials. Polymer electrolyte membranes based on sulfonated <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone</b> <b>ketone)</b> (SPEKK) were fabricated using N-methyl pyrrolidone as casting solvent. The membranes were characterized in terms of properties that were relevant to fuel cell applications, such as proton conductivity, methanol permeability, and swelling properties, among others. It was found in this study that the proton conductivity of neat SPEKK membranes could reach the conductivity of commercial membranes such as Nafion®. However, when the conductivity of SPEKK was comparable to Nafion®, the swelling of SPEKK in water was quite excessive. The swelling problem was remedied by modifying the microstructure of SPEKK using different techniques. One of them involved blending of lightly sulfonated PEKK with highly acidic particles (sulfonated crosslinked polystyrene-SXLPS). Low sulfonation level of SPEKK was used to reduce the swelling of the membrane in water {{and the role of the}} highly acidic particles was to enhance the proton conductivity of the membrane. Because of the residual crystallinity in SPEKK with low sulfonation levels (IEC 3 ̆c 1 meq/g), the composite membranes exhibited excellent dimensional stability in water at elevated temperatures (30 - 90 °C). Also, the resistance to swelling of these composite membranes in methanol-water mixtures was far better than Nafion®, and so was the methanol permeability. Another technique explored was blending with non-conductive polymers (poly(ether imide) and poly(ether sulfone)) to act as mechanical reinforcement. It was found that miscibility behavior of the blends had a significant impact on the transport and swelling properties of these blends, which could be explained by the blend microstructure. The miscibility behavior was found to be strongly dependent on the sulfonation level of SPEKK. The conductivities of the blends were enhanced by as much as two orders of magnitude when the morphology was modified by electric field. The last approach was ionic crosslinking of the sulfonate groups in SPEKK using divalent cations, specifically barium ions. The crosslinking treatment has greatly improved the thermal stability of the membranes in both dry and wet conditions. ...|$|R

H 2 SO 4 and oleum {{with a total}} SO 3 {{content of}} not less than 82 wt. %. Also claimed are certain (I), esp. {{in the form of}} cation exchange membranes. USE - The process is used for producing (I) in the form of cation exchange membranes (claimed). ADVANTAGE - Even (II) with almost no O-Ph-O gps. can be sulphonated under these conditions. The prods. have a deg. of sulphonation comparable with that of commercially available <b>polyether</b> <b>ketones</b> and better, i. e. lower, swelling ratio. Cation exchange membranes with keto/ether gp. ratio > 1 : 1 have a higher concn. of functional gps., higher cation exchange capacity, lower electrical capacity and lower swelling ratio than usual...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{procedure}} is described {{for the formation}} of a hyperbranched <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> with carboxylic acid terminal groups. This preparation was based on the one-step synthesis of an AB 2 -type monomer 5 -phenoxyisophthalic acid using phosphorus pentoxide/methanesulfonic acid as the condensing agent and solvent. The electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction {{led to the formation of}} the aryl <b>ketone</b> linkage. With the help of model compounds, 1 H NMR studies revealed that the degree of branching of the <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> was about 55 %. The terminated carboxylic acid groups were readily functionalized, yielding hyperbranched polymers with a variety of different functional chain ends. The nature of the chain ends was shown to dramatically affect physical properties of the hyperbranched macromolecules. The ammonium derivative was soluble in water and behaved as a unimolecular micelle...|$|R
40|$|<b>Poly(ether</b> <b>ketone</b> quinoline) {{has been}} {{synthesized}} as a composite membrane matrix {{and has a}} molecular weight of ~ 40, 000. Composite membranes for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been prepared from sulfonated <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone</b> quinoline) (SPEEK) -poly(ether ether <b>ketone)</b> (SPEKQ) blend and Nafion with non- and surface coated silicotungstic acid (SiWA). The Nafion/surface coated SiWA composite membranes have excellent potential {{to be used in}} DMFCs with a high methanol feed concentration. The surface coated SiWA particles may protect the SiWA particles from “washing out ” with water from the feed and suppress methanol crossover. The composite membrane of SPEEK-SPEKQ/SiWA yields a highly porous uniform composite membrane. At a constant feed flow rate, the peak power and current density range increase with respect to the methanol concentration for a Nafion/surface coated SiWA membrane electrode assembly. Peak power of 50 mW was achieved for the SPEEK-SPEKQ/SiWA composite membrane...|$|R
