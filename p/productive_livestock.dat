The latter is what is taking place in our study areas as well as in large areas in the south of Senegal and Mali, eastern Guinea and the north of Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo.

Since the birth of the first transgenic pig, genetic engineering in livestock has been advancing slowly due to inherent technical limitations. A major breakthrough has been the advent of somatic cell nuclear transfer, which, for the first time, provided the technical ability to produce site-specific genome-modified domestic animals. However, the low efficiency of gene targeting events in somatic cells prohibits its wide use in agricultural and biomedical applications.

The experimental factors investigated were location, vegetation and herbage removal. Margin strips were mown twice a year with a late first cut around 15 June and a regrowth cut around 15 September to meet nature conservation objectives. Average DM yield over the first three years was not significantly affected by herbage removal but increased significantly over time, irrespective of vegetation or herbage removal. Initially, sown margin strips significantly outyielded unsown margin strips, but differences in DM yield converged over time. The mid-June cut yielded significantly more than the regrowth cut but its herbage quality was significantly lower. Herbage from the unsown margin strip had a significantly better forage quality than herbage from sown margin strips. Forage quality decreased over time, irrespective of location or vegetation. Changes over time in DM yield and quality were attributed to changes in species composition.

40|$|An {{agricultural}} revolution {{based on}} cowpeas awaits {{farmers in the}} semi-arid belt that stretches across West Africa where {{there is an opportunity}} to develop the area into a more <b>productive</b> <b>livestock</b> fattening region to meet help the demands of the growing population further south. Traditionally farmers grow millet intercropped with cowpeas as their subsistence crops, and keep livestock to provide cash. Population pressure on the land is breaking that system down, and rangeland to feed the livestock is decreasing and is befog degraded. This deteriorating situation demands change and researchers at the Sahelian Centre in Niger, set up 13 years ago by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), are meeting this challenge by developing strategies that are quite different from those proposed in the past. The biggest constraint to increasing crop yields is poor soil fertility, not lack of rain. Farmers can no longer fallow land, and all crop residues are needed for roofing houses and feeding livestock. The only input the soil receives is some animal manure. Fertilizers are not widely used as farmers do not spend money on crops which are grown just for their subsistence needs. Past experience has shown that farmers will spend money on crops that can be sold for cash. So the researchers are suggesting that farmers should turn cowpeas into a cash crop. They will be grown separately from millet, planted earlier than at present, and fertilized with locally available rock phosphate. Grown in this way they will produce five to ten times the present yield, and the millet, which will follow the cowpeas in a rotational system, will double their yield. The cowpeas will be grown essentially for hay, and the local, creeping, varieties are ideal as they are simply rolled up into bundles at hervesting, and either stacked or sold in the market. At the moment cowpea hay may sell for more than millet grain. The extra amount of cowpea hay gives the farmer the chance to produce and fatten livestock of greater quality and value than those raised at the moment. This is the basis of a larger marketing system, trading meat for grain, with the wetter regions further south, which have the comparative advantage for growing cereals. The new strategy is dependent on the exploitation of locally available rock phosphate. This system should allow farmers to pay for the fertilizer, though some help might be needed during the transition phase. Another constraint might be the availability of labour, and this is still under study. All other aspects of the new strategy, through, have largely been proved, and researchers feel it should be attractive to farmers without added risk to food security. ICRISAT Shaelian Centre B.

30|$|Changing {{management}} systems and lifestyles may also portend new hope for wildlife and pastoralists to co-exist. Some previously mobile pastoralists who {{were encouraged to}} become sedentary and take ownership of small parcels of land by governments (Mwangi and Ostrom 2009) are now aggregating their holdings and returning to patterns of seasonal migration more {{similar to those of}} the past (Mwangi 2007). Particularly in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, pastoral mobility affords a more resilient and potentially more <b>productive</b> <b>livestock</b> system and is less likely to cause land degradation than a more sedentary, year-round grazing regime (Western et al. 2009 a, b; Hesse and Cavanna 2010). In southern Kenya, wildlife populations fared far better where pastoral mobility was maintained compared to adjacent areas that were subdivided and settled (BurnSilver et al. 2008; Western et al. 2009 a, b), and sedentarization had mixed effects on livestock production, being particularly detrimental on low-productivity sites (Boone et al. 2005; BurnSilver et al. 2008). Although the KLEE experiment was not designed to ask questions about livestock mobility, it does provide one example of wildlife coexisting with cattle in an area where cattle are grazed episodically rather than continuously. Mobility may also help to create or maintain greater landscape heterogeneity and reduce dry-season competition between wild herbivores and livestock. The possibility that traditional management practices such as seasonal migration and deliberate burns may in time be reinstated raises many possibilities for a sustainable relationship among people, livestock, and wildlife.|$|E

30|$|On the one hand, and {{confirming}} previous studies, enclosures seem {{to provide}} opportunities for a more <b>productive</b> and profitable <b>livestock</b> production where diversified income streams are possible, {{and at the same}} time contribute to increased vegetation cover and soil organic carbon (e.g. Mureithi et al. 2015). Furthermore, enclosures seem to form part of rapid and, in most parts, positive change in gender relations. On the other hand, the practice of enclosures is also related to emerging conflicts and inequalities in relation to land. However, in order to more firmly and systematically assess the sustainability outcomes of enclosures and the ongoing transition towards sedentary, market-based agro-pastoralist livelihoods, further studies are needed. The analysis does however illustrate the importance of recognizing and accounting for local, alternative pathways and strategies within the general transition. We argue that it is the room for and nature of such local pathways and strategies that will determine the sustainability outcomes of the ongoing transition and land use transformation in dryland areas across East Africa.|$|R

In addition, honeybees contribute to the pollination of wild flowers, thereby helping the maintenance of natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Recently, the number of managed honeybee colonies has declined in both North America and Europe. Beside environmental causes, e. g. the loss of forage {{as a consequence of}} agricultural intensification, another cause is the increasing relevance of pests and diseases affecting honeybee colonies. In the honeybee, hygienic behaviour (HB) is a heritable phenotype that confers to the colony resistance to foulbrood diseases, chalkbrood, and the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. Nurse bees manifesting HB are able to detect, uncap, and remove infested and/or parasitized pupae from the colony. The genetic and biochemical factors that drive the manifestation of this behaviour are under investigation. Therefore, the selection of such trait still relies on field assays.

Concerning the FKB test, a comparison between the standard FKB test and a variant of this method (E.

Nutrient concentration can vary considerably in feeds, especially forages.

Use feed tests to target specific feeds to different livestock. Feed high quality forage to the most <b>productive</b> <b>livestock</b> or when nutrient needs are highest. Feed lower quality forage to animals with lower nutrient needs. Feed tests can help establish the dollar value of a forage, in the cash market or in personal use inventories. Use these tests to establish the value of your forage and to help determine what forages to feed, buy, or sell. Forage tests are useful to evaluate production practices like fertilization, time of harvest, method of harvest, etc., that may influence forage quality. Management skills can improve by learning how changes in production practices affect the quality of your forages. Livestock are most productive when fed a ration balanced according to their nutrient needs. Unfortunately, many rations are balanced using average values for each feedstuff.

The first three clusters were also evident for both the additional data and for the larger combined dataset. The lowland grass/arable sites were a 'mixed use' cluster that was not apparent in the analysis of the additional or combined datasets indicating a mismatch between particular ecosystem services and specific landscapes/habitats. Procrustes analysis of the biogeographical data and the combined dataset suggested that the primary differences between datasets were due to variables associated with local management decisions which prevented harvesting of provisioning services or denied public access to the site.

We project that by 2030 autonomous transitions toward more efficient systems would decrease emissions by 736 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (MtCO 2 e/y), mainly through avoided emissions from the conversion of 162 Mha of natural land. A moderate mitigation policy targeting emissions from both the agricultural and land-use change sectors with a carbon price of US$ 10 per tCO 2 e could lead to an abatement of 3, 223 MtCO 2 e/y. Livestock system transitions would contribute 21 % of the total abatement, intra- and interregional relocation of livestock production another 40 %, and all other mechanisms would add 39 %. A comparable abatement of 3, 068 MtCO 2 e/y could be achieved also with a policy targeting only emissions from land-use change. Stringent climate policies might lead to reductions in food availability of up to 200 kcal per capita per day globally. We find that mitigation policies targeting emissions from land-use change are 5 to 10 times more efficient [...] measured in "total abatement calorie cost" [...] than policies targeting emissions from livestock only. Thus, fostering transitions toward more <b>productive</b> <b>livestock</b> production systems in combination with climate policies targeting the land-use change {{appears to be the}} most efficient lever to deliver desirable climate and food availability outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Food-insecure {{households}} {{in many countries}} depend on international aid to alleviate acute shocks and chronic shortages. Some food security programmes (including Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program–PSNP – which provides a case study for this article) have integrated aid in exchange for labour on public works to reduce long-term dependence by investing in the productive capacity and resilience of communities. Using this approach, Ethiopia has embarked upon an ambitious national programme of land restoration and sustainable land management. Although the intent was to reduce poverty, here we show that an unintended co-benefit is the climate-change mitigation from reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increased landscape carbon stocks. The article first shows that the total reduction in net GHG emissions from PSNP’s land management at the national scale is estimated at 3. 4 million Mg CO 2 e y− 1 – approximately 1. 5 % of the emissions reductions in Ethiopia’s Nationally Determined Contribution for the Paris Agreement. The article then explores some of the opportunities and constraints to scaling up of this impact. Key policy insights Food security programmes (FSPs) can contribute to climate change mitigation by creating a vehicle for investment in land and ecosystem restoration. Maximizing mitigation, while enhancing but not compromising food security, requires that climate projections, and mitigation and adaptation responses should be mainstreamed into planning and implementation of FSPs at all levels. Cross-cutting oversight is required to integrate land restoration, climate policy, food security and disaster risk management into a coherent policy framework. Institutional barriers to optimal implementation should be addressed, such as incentive mechanisms that reward effort rather than results, and lack of centralized monitoring and evaluation of impacts on the physical environment. Project implementation can often be improved by adopting best management practices, such as using <b>productive</b> living <b>livestock</b> barriers where possible, and increasing the integration of agroforestry and non-timber forest products into landscape regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Insufficient {{access to}} assets {{is the main}} {{determinant}} of poverty. We analyze the role of access to assets in explaining household labor allocation strategies, sources of income, levels of income achieved, and poverty headcount ratios among classes of Mexican rural households. To assess the gains from asset redistribution, we both measure the direct income effects from redistribution and simulate the general equilibrium effects of redistribution in a computable non-separable household model. Results show that land redistribution allows to achieve both equity and efficiency gains. However, there are economies of scale in self-employment in microenterprise, human capital assets for labor market participation, and social capital for international migration, implying conflicts between equity gains and social efficiency in redistributing these assets towards those with lower endowments. I. Assets and poverty Insufficient asset entitlements is the main determinant of poverty. For rural households, who typically pursue multiple sources of income, assets that determine the choice of income earning strategies and the levels of income achieved are quite diverse. In agriculture, they include land, irrigation, <b>productive</b> capital, and <b>livestock</b> for direct production and organizational capital for the reduction of transactions costs in accessing markets. For wage earnings on the labor market, the...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the use of fodder shrubs and {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids as a nutritional strategy to mitigate enteric methane production in cattle. Special emphasis was made on the use of Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray (Mexican sun ower), as a species with antimethanogenic potential. Bibliographic information for this review was obtained between July and September 2015 by using key words. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG), the increase of its atmospheric concentration is caused mainly by emissions from agriculture and industry, but it is also estimated that a proportion of methane is emitted by ruminants as a product of enteric and anaerobic fermentation of diet. This causes an environmental and <b>productive</b> problem in <b>livestock</b> production systems worldwide. Although there is controversy about the real contribution of methane by ruminants and its impact on environmental issues, the amount of emissions should try to be reduced. This document emphasizes the search for nutritional strategies such as supplementation with forage shrubs and sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have shown potential to maintain animal production ef ciency and decrease enteric methane synthesis...|$|R
