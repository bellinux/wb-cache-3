5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium <b>platter,</b> mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the <b>platter</b> and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} <b>platter</b> assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E
5|$|Like the LP12, the Xerxes has a two-piece platter–sub-platter {{configuration}} {{on which}} sits a thin felt mat. And while the LP12's platters {{are made of}} mazak, the Xerxes' platters are of aluminium. The outer <b>platter</b> is rigid and peripherally weighted. However, the Roksan's outer <b>platter</b> weighs {{less than half of}} that of the LP12, to reduce load on the main bearing, yet is able to achieve a greater inertia because of its weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|The Xerxes.20 which {{superseded}} the Xerxes.X in 2005 incorporated new {{main bearing}} {{ball and the}} new Rmat-5 sub-plinth. The bearing, attached to the inner <b>platter,</b> has an unusually small-diameter hardened-steel spindle, which sits {{on top of a}} tungsten ball that measures 2mm and is machined to a tolerance in the order of micrometres. The corresponding housing is made of bronze. The two-piece <b>platter,</b> when fit together, are snug and will not resonate.|$|E

5|$|Rega {{went against}} {{conventional}} {{wisdom of the}} time, preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass <b>platter</b> sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass <b>platter.</b> The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is single speed – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the <b>platter</b> to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E
5|$|In a 5-4 decision, the Court {{overturned}} the silver <b>platter</b> doctrine and Elkins' conviction. Associate Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion, while Associate Justices Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II dissented.

5|$|This image's iconic status {{has led to}} parody and satire. New York painter Frank Moore re-created Rockwell's all-white Americans with an {{ethnically diverse}} family, as Freedom to Share (1994), in which the turkey <b>platter</b> brims over with health care supplies. Among the better known reproductions is Mickey and Minnie Mouse {{entertaining}} their cartoon family with a festive turkey. Several political cartoons and even frozen vegetable advertisements have invoked this image.|$|E
5|$|While {{some other}} designs use clamps to couple the disc to the <b>platter,</b> Roksan shares the same {{philosophy}} as Linn in believing that rigid coupling would cause rumble to be transmitted {{from the main}} bearing, thus colouring the sound. To further increase isolation, the Xerxes possesses a spindle that allows the user to centre the record, but {{which is supposed to}} be removed during listening so that the disc rests solely on the felt mat.|$|E

The two are sent flying and crashing through the record building, Perry using the PFT tape to latch himself safely on a flag pole in the resulting free fall, while Doofenshmirtz plummets to the ground, landing on top of a mattress placed on top of a parked truck. Unfortunately, the truck belongs to a folding mattress company and Doofenshmirtz is crushed by the mattress and then crushed by his own robot immediately afterwards.|$|E
50|$|Congress officially opened Nebraska Territory {{with the}} passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Almost {{instantly}} a factional divide between North <b>Platters</b> (those living north of the Platte River) and South <b>Platters</b> (those living south of the Platte) arose over the question of capital location. Much to the chagrin of the South <b>Platters,</b> Acting Governor Thomas B. Cuming selected the small northern village of Omaha City for the seat of government. Cuming was from Iowa, and as his political allies were investors in the Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company, Omaha as capital would be beneficial to his personal political career. Results from the first territorial census, however, revealed 914 North <b>Platters</b> and 1,818 South <b>Platters.</b> The South <b>Platters,</b> with greater legislative representation, would be able to take the capital, but Cuming ignored proportional representation and assigned seven councilmen and fourteen representatives to the north and six councilmen and twelve representatives to the south. The North <b>Platters,</b> with greater political power, confirmed Omaha as the capital.|$|R

5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} on a <b>platter</b> or in a skull-bowl– {{in her left}} hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} incense clock have been found, {{the most common}} forms include the incense stick and incense seal. An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, {{sometimes}} having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a <b>platter</b> or gong below, signifying that {{a certain amount of}} time had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray. Sticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. The incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods of use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper <b>platter.</b> The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Toshiba {{released}} the MK1122FC, the first hard drive {{to use a}} glass substrate, replacing the aluminium alloys used in earlier hard drives. It was originally designed for laptops, for which the greater shock resistance of glass substrates are more suitable. Around 2000, other hard drive manufacturers started transitioning from aluminum to glass <b>platters</b> because glass <b>platters</b> have several advantages over aluminum <b>platters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The drives {{were known}} for {{an unusually high}} rate of head crashes, due to the {{magnetic}} coating soon beginning to loosen and sprinkle off from the <b>platters,</b> creating dust in the hard disk array and leading to crashes over {{large areas of the}} <b>platters.</b> The combination of two technologies, GMR (Giant Magneto-Resistive) heads on 3.5-inch glass <b>platters,</b> are said to be largely to blame for the issues.|$|R
50|$|Remaining in England, John Cheatdom formed The Realistics in 1976. The group {{broke up}} in 1983, and Cheatdom then joined various {{unofficial}} line-ups of the <b>Platters,</b> {{sometimes called the}} Magic <b>Platters,</b> who toured internationally.|$|R
5|$|On 15 March 963, Emperor Romanos II (r. 959–963) {{unexpectedly}} died, {{leaving his}} young sons Basil II and Constantine VIII as emperors. The powerful general Nikephoros Phokas (the brother of Leo) decided {{to seize the}} throne for himself, but was opposed by the parakoimomenos and guardian of the young emperors, Joseph Bringas. Seeking support, Bringas offered Marianos the high command {{in the east and}} potentially even the throne if he would aid him. Marianos first suggested trying to win over Nikephoros Phokas' popular nephew and lieutenant, the strategos of the Anatolics John Tzimiskes. The latter not only refused, however, but took his letter straight to his uncle, who summoned his armies to Caesarea and had them proclaim him emperor in early summer. As Phokas' army advanced across Asia Minor on Constantinople, Marianos then tried to stage a coup in Constantinople with men of the Macedonian regiments and armed prisoners of war. This move was opposed by the populace, however, resulting in clashes in the streets. The populace became especially enraged when Marianos tried to forcibly remove the Phokades' elderly father, Bardas, from the Hagia Sophia where he had sought sanctuary, on 15 August. Marianos was reportedly hit on the head by a <b>platter,</b> thrown by a woman from a nearby house roof. Mortally wounded, he died on the next day. Phokas' supporters rapidly prevailed thereafter. Bringas was forced to flee himself to the Hagia Sophia, and on 16 August Nikephoros Phokas was crowned senior emperor as guardian of Basil and Constantine.|$|E

25|$|In {{the decades}} after its construction, the {{fountain}} became a landmark {{due to its}} prominent location in Malta's main bus terminus. It was used for various events, including the Republic Day national festivities which were televised on the programme Mill-Maltin għall-Maltin. A platform {{was built on the}} fountain's upper <b>platter</b> to house entertainment acts which included concerts as well as motorcycles climbing on the plate over specially-constructed ramps. This greatly weakened the structure, and together with natural deterioration, it resulted in the tank mounted inside the basin failing to limit the water supported inside. This caused an excessive amount of water to remain in the <b>platter,</b> which strained the bronze Triton figures supporting it. One of the Tritons' arms broke on 1 March 1978, and the <b>platter</b> collapsed resulting in significant damage to two of the three Tritons.|$|E
