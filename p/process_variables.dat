50|$|Process plants {{consist of}} hundreds, or even thousands, of control loops all {{networked}} together {{to produce a}} product to be offered for sale. Each of these control loops is designed to keep some important <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> such as pressure, flow, level, temperature, etc. within a required operating range {{to ensure the quality}} of the end product. Each of these loops receives and internally creates disturbances that detrimentally affect the <b>process</b> <b>variable,</b> and interaction from other loops in the network provides disturbances that influence the <b>process</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>process</b> <b>variable,</b> <b>process</b> {{value or}} process {{parameter}} {{is the current}} measured value of a particular part of a process which is being monitored or controlled. An example {{of this would be}} the temperature of a furnace. The current temperature is called the <b>process</b> <b>variable,</b> while the desired temperature is known as the set-point. The set point is usually abbreviated to SP, and the process value is usually abbreviated to PV.|$|R

50|$|To {{reduce the}} effect of these load disturbances, sensors and {{transmitters}} collect information about the <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> and its relationship to some desired set point. A controller will then process this information and decides what must be done to get the <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> back to where it should be after a load disturbance occurs. When all the measuring, comparing, and calculating are done, some type of final control element must implement the strategy selected by the controller. The most common final control element in the process control industries is the control valve. The control valve manipulates a flowing fluid, such as gas, steam, water, or chemical compounds, to compensate for the load disturbance and keep the regulated <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> {{as close as possible to}} the desired set point.|$|R

2500|$|To do this, a {{controller}} {{with the}} requisite corrective behaviour is required. This controller monitors the controlled <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> (PV), and compares {{it with the}} reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the <b>process</b> <b>variable,</b> called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are [...] controllability and observability. On this is based the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is feedback control, which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range {{by means of a}} [...] "final control element", such as a control valve.|$|R

EVOP, on the other hand, is intended to introduce small changes in the <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> during normal production flow.
