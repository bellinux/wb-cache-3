5|$|The first {{extension}} of Smithfield's meat market {{took place between}} 1873 and 1876 {{with the construction of}} the <b>Poultry</b> <b>Market</b> immediately west of the Central Market. A rotunda was built at the centre of the old Market Field (now West Smithfield), comprising gardens, a fountain and a ramped carriageway to the station beneath the market building. Further buildings were subsequently added to the market. The General Market, built between 1879 and 1883, was intended to replace the old Farringdon Market located nearby and established for the sale of fruit and vegetables when the earlier Fleet Market was cleared to enable the laying out of Farringdon Street between 1826–1830.|$|E

At around 5:00p.m., the Dutch opened fire on Chinese-occupied houses with cannon, causing them to catch fire. Some Chinese died in the burning houses, while others were shot upon leaving their homes or committed suicide in desperation. Those who reached the canal near the housing district were killed by Dutch troops waiting in small boats, while other troops searched in between the rows of burning houses, killing any survivors they found. These actions later spread throughout the city. Vermeulen notes {{that many of the}} perpetrators were sailors and other [...] "irregular and bad elements" [...] of society. During this period there was heavy looting and seizures of property.|$|E
500|$|Trade {{and crafts}} are {{extremely}} important to the local tourism-fueled economy. There are 18 souks in Marrakesh, employing over 40,000 people in pottery, copperware, leather and other crafts. The souks contain a massive range of items from plastic sandals to Palestinian-style scarves imported from India or China. Local boutiques are adept at making western-style clothes using Moroccan materials. The Birmingham Post comments: [...] "The souk offers an incredible shopping experience with a myriad of narrow winding streets that lead {{through a series of}} smaller markets clustered by trade. Through the squawking chaos of the <b>poultry</b> <b>market,</b> the gory fascination of the open-air butchers' shops and the uncountable number of small and specialist traders, just wandering around the streets can pass an entire day." [...] Marrakesh has several supermarkets including Marjane Acima, Asswak Salam and Carrefour, and three major shopping centres, [...] Al Mazar Mall, Plaza Marrakech and Marjane Square; a branch of Carrefour opened in Al Mazar Mall in 2010. Industrial production in the city is centred in the neighbourhood of Sidi Ghanem Al Massar, containing large factories, workshops, storage depots and showrooms. Ciments Morocco, a subsidiary of a major Italian cement firm, has a factory in Marrakech. The AeroExpo Marrakech International Exhibition of aeronautical industries and services is held here, as is the Riad Art Expo.|$|E

Seeking to identify the source of the human infections, we sequenced 31 H 5 N 1 viruses isolated from humans in China (2005 to 2010). We found a number of viral genotypes, not all of which have similar known avian virus counterparts. Guided by patient questionnaire data, we also obtained environmental samples from live <b>poultry</b> <b>markets</b> and dwellings frequented by six individuals prior to disease onset (2008 and 2009). H 5 N 1 viruses were isolated from 4 of the 6 live <b>poultry</b> <b>markets</b> sampled.

The {{most perfect}} {{examples}} of the third order in Venice are {{the windows of the}} ruined palace of Marco Querini, the father-in-law of Bajamonte Tiepolo, in consequence of whose conspiracy against the government this palace was ordered to be razed in 1310; but it was only partially ruined, and was afterwards used as the common shambles. The Venetians have now made a <b>poultry</b> <b>market</b> of the lower story (the shambles being removed to a suburb), and a prison of the upper, though {{it is one of the}} most important and interesting monuments in the city, and especially valuable as giving us a secure date for the central form of these very rare transitional windows. For, as it was the palace of the father-in-law of Bajamonte, and the latter was old enough to assume the leadership of a political faction in 1280,[88] the date of the accession to the throne of the Doge Pietro Gradenigo, we are secure of this palace having been built not later than the middle of the thirteenth century. Another example, less refined in workmanship, but, if possible, still more interesting, owing to the variety of its capitals, remains in the little piazza opening to the Rialto, on the St. Mark's side of the Grand Canal. The house faces the bridge, and its second story has been built in the thirteenth century, above a still earlier Byzantine cornice remaining, or perhaps introduced from some other ruined edifice, in the walls of the first floor. The windows of the second story are of pure third order; four of them are represented above, with their flanking pilaster, and capitals varying constantly in the form of the flower or leaf introduced between their volutes.|$|E

40|$|Samples of {{drinking}} water from poultry cages, which can be collected conveniently and noninvasively, provide higher rates of infl uenza (H 9 N 2) virus isolation than do samples of fecal droppings. Studies to confi rm the usefulness of poultry drinking water for detecting infl uenza (H 5 N 1) should be conducted in disease-endemic areas. Pandemic influenza originates from influenza viruses of birds (1). Live <b>poultry</b> <b>markets</b> {{play a crucial role}} in maintenance, amplification, and dissemination of avian influenza viruses (2 – 4) and are a risk factor for zoonotic transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H 5 N 1) viruses to humans (5, 6). Maintaining surveillance of live <b>poultry</b> <b>markets</b> for influenza viruses is therefore important. In routine surveillance of live <b>poultry</b> <b>markets,</b> handling birds for collecting tracheal or cloacal swabs is often unacceptable to the bird sellers. Because avian influenza viruses were believed to be transmitted primarily by the oral–fecal route (7), fecal droppings were therefore regarded as the noninvasive specimen of choice for surveillance purposes (8). However, emerging evidence from experimental studies indicates that H 9 N 2 (9) and H 5 N 1 (10) subtypes are shed in higher titers in the upper respiratory tract. We tested the hypothesis that sampling drinking water is a convenient, noninvasive, and sensitive method for conducting avian influenza surveillance in live <b>poultry</b> <b>markets.</b> Because vaccine-derived Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is also commonly isolated from poultry in Hong Kong, we used NDV isolation rates for comparison. As part of our ongoing surveillance in live <b>poultry</b> <b>markets</b> in Hong Kong, 51 – 67 poultry stalls in 8 <b>poultry</b> <b>markets</b> were sampled monthly from August 2004 through July 2005. Typically, several poultry of the same type share a cage, and all birds in the same cage share a drinking water trough, which is intermittently filled from the municipal water supply. We collected paired samples: drinking water from the water trough supplying a cage and a fresh fecal droppin...|$|R
30|$|The close {{similarity}} of the NDVs from commercial small scale poultry farms {{with those from}} village chickens suggests that viruses can move reasonably freely between these two bird populations. This {{could be attributed to}} the poor biosecurity practices in these farms and live <b>poultry</b> <b>markets</b> in Ethiopia. In live <b>poultry</b> <b>markets</b> birds from different sources (villages and small scale commercial farms) are mixed and sold either to traders or to the consumers.
