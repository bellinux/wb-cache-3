50|$|The {{original}} prototype weighed 84 kilograms, dived autonomously to {{depths of}} 500 meters, and generated 1.7 watt-hours of energy per dive. SOLO-TREC draws upon the ocean's thermal energy as it alternately encounters warm surface water and colder conditions at depth. Key to its operation are the carefully selected waxy substances known as phase-change {{materials that are}} contained in 10 external tubes, which house enough material to allow net power generation. As the float surfaces and encounters warm temperatures, the material melts and expands; when it dives and enters cooler waters, the material solidifies and contracts. The expansion of the wax <b>pressurizes</b> <b>oil</b> stored inside the float. This oil periodically drives a hydraulic motor that generates electricity and recharges the vehicle's batteries. Energy from the rechargeable batteries powers the float's hydraulic system, which changes the float's volume (and hence buoyancy), allowing it to move vertically.|$|R

50|$|A typical Kawai cell 8-6 multi-anvil {{apparatus}} uses air pumps to <b>pressurize</b> <b>oil,</b> which {{drives a}} vertical hydraulic ram to compress a cylindrical cavity {{known as a}} hatbox. This cavity is filled with six steel anvils, three facing and three facing down, that converge {{on a set of}} eight tungsten carbide cubes. The interior corners of these cubes truncated to fit an octahedral assembly. These octahedra range from 8 mm to 25 mm on edge and are typically composed of MgO or another material that deforms ductilely over the range of experimental conditions, to make sure the experiment is under hydrostatic stress. As this assembly is compressed, it extrudes out between the cubes, forming a gasket. A cylinder is drilled out between two opposite faces to accommodate the experiment. Experiments that require heating are surrounded by a cylindrical graphite or LaCrO3 cylinder furnace, which can produce considerable heat by electrical resistance (figure 4). However, the graphite furnace can be troublesome at higher pressures due to its tendency to transform into diamond. The DIA multi-anvil is the main alternative to the Kawai cell: it uses six anvils to compress a cubic sample.|$|R

The hydrodynamic bearing composed a hydrodynamic bearing made of porous material and several hydrostatic chambers with an external oil system. The hydrodynamic bearing is <b>pressurized</b> with <b>oil</b> chamber and supports the spindle shaft both at rest and at rotation state.

50|$|An early form of {{circuit breaker}} was {{described}} by Thomas Edison in an 1879 patent application, although his commercial power distribution system used fuses. Its purpose was to protect lighting circuit wiring from accidental short circuits and overloads. A modern miniature circuit breaker {{similar to the ones}} now in use was patented by Brown, Boveri & Cie in 1924. Hugo Stotz, an engineer who had sold his company to BBC, was credited as the inventor on DRP (Deutsches Reichspatent) 458392. Stotz's invention was the forerunner of the modern thermal-magnetic breaker commonly used in household load centers to this day.Interconnection of multiple generator sources into an electrical grid required development of circuit breakers with increasing voltage ratings and increased ability to safely interrupt the increasing short circuit currents produced by networks.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{research}} is to study the rheological behavior of an oil based mud (OBM) sample from the Mexican side of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) under extreme conditions of High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT). In the coming years many HPHT wells are going to be drilled in this area of the GOM. Currently Mexican Oil and Gas industry is already open to international operators because the Mexican energy reform has been approved, so it is important to study the possible drilling fluids that will be used. These fluids can be within any of these 3 tiers of HPHT classification: HPHT, ultra (uHPHT) or extreme (xHPHT). The sample was submitted to extreme HPHT conditions, by using the state-of-the-art Model 7600 HPHT Viscometer that is capable of measuring drilling fluid properties up to 40, 000 psi and 600 ?F. During the laboratory tests performance, it was noticed that erroneous results were obtained by several mechanical failures. It {{should be noted that the}} spare parts take a long time to arrive-around 3 weeks. One of the failures was that the pivot of the spring assembly got inside the device, so the bob was spinning nonstop. For this reason the readings of the dial went well beyond the allowed range; another mechanical failure was that the spring of the spring assembly was loose, which did not allow us to obtain a correct reading of shear stress at high pressures and low temperatures; also the baffle does not separate the <b>pressurizing</b> <b>oil</b> from the sample, mixing these two fluids and obviously affecting the properties of the sample. This was noticed by running one test with baffle and another without it getting very similar results. The rheological behavior of the sample showed that the viscosity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to pressure, noticing a failure point at 300 ?F, because of sample degradation. Moreover the rheogram?s curves obtained are quite similar to a second degree polynomial function, with R-squared values ranging from 0. 95 to 0. 99; hence an equation can be adjusted in the future by extrapolating different pressure and temperature values...|$|R

50|$|A {{bar feeder}} feeds {{a single piece}} of bar stock into the cutting machine. As each part is machined, the cutting tool creates a final cut to {{separate}} the part from the bar stock, and the feeder continues to feed the bar for the next part, allowing for continual operation of the machine. There are two types of bar feeds used in lathe machining: Hydrodynamic bar feeds, which rest the bar stock in a series of channels whilst clamping down on {{the top and bottom of}} the bar, and hydrostatic bar feeds, which hold the bar stock in a feed tube using <b>pressurized</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most brakes {{commonly}} use {{friction between}} two surfaces pressed together {{to convert the}} kinetic energy of the moving object into heat, though other methods of energy conversion may be employed. For example, regenerative braking converts much of the energy to electrical energy, which may be stored for later use. Other methods convert kinetic energy into potential energy in such stored forms as pressurized air or <b>pressurized</b> <b>oil.</b> Eddy current brakes use magnetic fields to convert kinetic energy into electric current in the brake disc, fin, or rail, which is converted into heat. Still other braking methods even transform kinetic energy into different forms, for example by transferring the energy to a rotating flywheel.|$|E
50|$|For {{high speed}} and high power machines, {{a loss of}} {{lubricant}} can result in rapid bearing heating and damage due to friction. Also in dirty environments the oil can become contaminated with dust or debris that increases friction. In these applications, a fresh supply of lubricant can be continuously supplied to the bearing and all other contact surfaces, and the excess can be collected for filtration, cooling, and possibly reuse. Pressure oiling is commonly used in large and complex internal combustion engines {{in parts of the}} engine where directly splashed oil cannot reach, such as up into overhead valve assemblies. High speed turbochargers also typically require a <b>pressurized</b> <b>oil</b> system to cool the bearings and keep them from burning up due to the heat from the turbine.|$|E
50|$|The {{convenience}} of the camshaft {{is that not}} only does it keep the timing of the opening and closing valves and injecting fuel through its cams, it is also responsible for the mechanical force that is required to actually open and close the valves and power the port and helix fuel pump. The camshaftless intelligent system uses the rotation of the engine to power an axial piston pump that <b>pressurizes</b> a hydraulic <b>oil</b> system. The potential energy from the hydraulic pressure is directed by the electronically controlled servo system to drive InFI (Intelligent Fuel Injection) and InVA (Intelligent Valve Actuation) systems.|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of attachment, a {{hydraulic}} function consists of a valve on the forklift with a lever near the operator that provides two passages of <b>pressurized</b> hydraulic <b>oil</b> to power the attachment features. Sometimes an attachment has more features than your forklift has hydraulic functions and one or more need to be added. There are many ways of adding hydraulic functions (also known as adding a valve). The forklift manufacturer makes valves and hose routing accessories, but the parts and labor to install can be prohibitively expensive. Other ways include adding a solenoid valve {{in conjunction with a}} hose or cable reel that diverts oil flow from an existing function. However, hose and cable reels can block the operator's view and are problematic, easily damaged. The Ditto Valve kit uses a solenoid valve and special HydWire hoses, in which the wire reinforcing braid doubles as an electrical conduit. These hoses replace those already on the forklift, nesting in the original reeving, keeping it safe from damage and out of the operators field of vision.|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{wet sump}} engines have one oil pump. It is {{generally}} located inside {{the lower part}} of the engine, usually below and/or to one side of the crankshaft. On dry sump engines, at least two oil pumps are required: one to pressurize and distribute the oil around the engine components, and at least one other 'scavenge pump' to evacuate the oil which has pooled at the bottom of the engine. This scavenge pump is sometimes (but not always) located in the 'sump' of the engine, and crucially, this scavenge pump's flow-rate capacity must exceed that of the pump which <b>pressurizes</b> and distributes <b>oil</b> throughout the engine.|$|R
