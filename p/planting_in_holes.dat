Different soil tillage systems can improve soil conditions to plant growth, avoid erosion problems and reduce costs. In areas belonging to TANAGRO S. A. e SETA S. A., in two different counties, Piratini and Butiá, RS, and two distinct soil types litholic and red yellow podzolic soil tillage systems with different levels of soil disturbance were tested in growing black wattle: <b>planting</b> <b>in</b> <b>holes</b> with no-tillage and planting after subsoiling with two, three and five shranks and harrowings. Plant height and DBH were taken annually, and after seven years samples of the trunk were obtained at six different positions for specific gravity analyses. Soils were characterized chemically and physically on their surface layers. Soil losses were greater where soil was prepared with a five-shrank-subsoiler, and they were measurable until 18 months after planting. These soil losses are very important for sustainable production of the litholic soil, constituted in around 80...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o vigor e a produtividade do maracujazeiro-amarelo plantado em diferentes tamanhos de cova e plantio direto sob manejo orgânico. O experimento foi conduzido de 2005 a 2007, no Setor de Agricultura Ecológica da Universidade Federal do Acre, em delineamento de blocos casualizados, constituídos de cinco tratamentos, quatro repetições e quatro plantas por parcela. Foram avaliados cinco tipos de preparo do solo: T 1 cova do tamanho do torrão (0, 19 x 0, 063 m) com adubação em cobertura; T 2 cova de 0, 30 x 0, 30 x 0, 30 m com adubação de plantio na cova; T 3 cova de 0, 30 x 0, 30 x 0, 30 m com adubação de plantio em cobertura; T 4 cova de 0, 50 x 0, 50 x 0, 50 m com adubação de plantio na cova; e T 5 cova de 0, 50 x 0, 50 x 0, 50 m com adubação de plantio em cobertura. O tamanho da cova e o plantio direto não influenciaram o vigor da planta e a biomassa de raízes. O número de frutos por planta e a produtividade, na segunda e na somatória das duas safras, foram maiores com plantio direto e com covas cúbicas de 0, 30 m. Após dois anos de cultivo, a densidade do solo foi maior na camada de 0 - 5 cm de profundidade num raio de 20 cm da planta para o plantio em covas de 0, 50 m com adubação na cova e menor para o plantio direto, não havendo diferença entre os demais tratamentos. O plantio direto ou o plantio em covas pequenas com dimensões de 0, 30 x 0, 30 x 0, 30 m proporcionou maior produtividade de maracujá que o plantio em covas maiores, mesmo não influenciando o vigor das plantas e a massa seca de raízes. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the yield and vigor of the yellow passion fruit tree planted in hole and no-tillage under organic system. The experiment was carried under experimental design in randomized blocks with five treatments and four replicates with four plants per plot. Five types of soil tillage: T 1 - hole {{of the size of the}} clod (0. 19 x 0. 063 m) with manuring in covering; T 2 - hole of 0. 30 x 0. 30 x 0. 30 m with manuring addition in the hole; T 3 - similar the T 2, with manuring in covering; T 4 - hole of 0. 50 x 0. 50 x 0. 50 m with manuring addition in the hole; and T 5 - similar the T 4, with manuring in covering were evaluated. The hole size and the no-tillage did not influence the vigor of the plant and root biomass. The number of fruits per plant and the yield in the second crop and in the total of the two crops were larger with holes of 0. 30 m and no-tillage. After 2 years of planting, the soil bulk density was larger in the depth of 0 - 5 cm to 20 cm of the plant for the <b>planting</b> <b>in</b> <b>holes</b> of 0. 50 m with manuring addition and smaller for the no-tillage, there was no difference among the other treatments.

40|$|We used an isotopic {{approach}} {{to evaluate the}} effects of three afforestation methods on the ecophysiology of an Aleppo pine plantation in semiarid Spain. The site preparation methods tested were excavation of planting holes (H), subsoiling (S), and subsoiling with addition of urban solid refuse to soil (S + USR). Five years after plantation establishment, trees in the S + USR treatment were over three times larger {{than those in the}} S treatment, and nearly five-fold larger than those <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> <b>holes.</b> Differences <b>in</b> tree biomass per hectare were even greater due to disparities <b>in</b> initial <b>planting</b> density and pine tree mortality among treatments. Pine trees in the S + USR treatment showed higher foliar P concentration, δ 13 C and δ 15 N than those in the S or H treatments. Foliar δ 15 N data proved that trees in the S + USR treatment utilized USR as a source of nitrogen. Foliar δ 13 C and δ 18 O data suggest that improved nutrient status differentially stimulated photosynthesis over stomatal conductance in the pine trees of the S + USR treatment, thus enhancing water use efficiency and growth. In the spring of 2002, trees in the S + USR treatment exhibited the most negative predawn water potentials of all the treatments, indicating that the rapid early growth induced by USR accelerated the onset of intense intra-specific competition for water. The results of this study have implications for the establishment and management of Aleppo pine plantations on semiarid soils. Planting seedlings at low density and/or early thinning of pine stands are strongly recommended if fast tree growth is to be maintained beyond the first few years after USR addition to soil. Foliar C, O and N isotope measurements can provide much insight into how resource acquisition by trees is affected by afforestation techniques in pine plantations under dry climatic conditions.

Cypress is {{a forest}} tree species that is widely {{distributed}} {{across the entire}} Mediterranean region. Grown in the Adriatic area, in many coastal and island localities of Central and South Dalmatia it regenerates naturally but does not form large forest stands. Instead, it occurs in smaller orbigger groups. It is mostly found near Orebić, Župa Dubrovačka and further south, while some individual trees can also occur in the warmer sub-Mediterranean parts of Obrovac, Knin, Vrlika and Sinj. Compared to many other Mediterranean species, cypress has a very large distribution range and should, therefore, {{have an important role}} in afforesting karst areas, particularly in view of its great economic, ecologic and landscape value. This paper investigates the impact of container type on the development of common cypress grown in nurseries and forest cultures at various methods of preparing the soil for afforestation. The research was undertaken in the nurseries of Split Forest Administration and in the experimental plot Podi in thearea of Šibenik Forest Office. The goal was to determine which of the studied containers, already in use in regular forest production for several years, have the greatest impact on the development of cypress seedlings in the nurseries and in the experimental plot. The seedlings were <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> the soil undermined with a ripper and <b>in</b> dug <b>holes.</b> Three types of containers were used: Bosnaplast 12, Bosnaplast 18 and PVC bag 7 / 24. The containers were filled with standard 2 : 1 peat and soil mixture commonly used in regular nursery production. The seeds were hand-sown in containers on 23 April 2003. After reaching one year, the plants were measured and analyzed in the nurseries and laboratories. The variables studied in the nurseries and laboratories included plant height, root collar diameter, plant weight, root weight, total plant weight and plant weight - root weight ratio. Root system deformations were observed in each container during plant measurements. Measurements were carried out successively every month on three occasions. Each time three plants were chosen (maximal, medium and minimal height) from each container for morphologic determination. Plant heights were measured with a ruler in cm and root collars with a shubler. The weight of the aboveground and underground plant part was measured with precise scales to two decimals. Scener STD 1600 and Vin RHizo Pro software were used to determine overall length of all the root parts by diameter degrees, as well as total volume, volume by diameter degrees, the average root diameter and root area. In the experimental plot of Podi, the block method was used to prepare the soil and <b>plant</b> the seedlings <b>in</b> the soil undermined with a ripper, and so was classical afforestation <b>in</b> the <b>holes</b> of 40 x 40 x 40 cm. A total of 826 <b>plants</b> were <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> three separate blocks of 40 x 50 m and monitored. After planting one-year-old seedlings of common cypress, the heights of all the planted stock were measured annually over the period 2003 to 2008 and the survival percentage was determined. A correlation-regression analysis was applied to determine the quantitative grades of particular variables (container type, planting method) on the growth and development of common cypress seedlings in the nurseries and in the experimental plot. Container volume had a strong and positive effect on the growth and development of one-year-old seedlings of common cypress in the nursery (Table 1). <b>Plants</b> grown <b>in</b> larger-volume containers (PVC 7 / 24) attained bigger heights (r 2 = 0. 981), bigger plant weight (r 2 = 0. 985) and bigger root weight (r 2 = 0. 792), compared to <b>plants</b> grown <b>in</b> smaller containers (B 18), particularly in Bosnaplast 12 containers (Figure 1). Research showed that cypress seedlings developed differently not only in different but also in the same container type. The first analysis of the root system done four months after sowing showed very poor root growth of cypress seedlings, especially of less developed ones, in all container types (Figure 2). Only by the end of October and the beginning of November was root development satisfactory <b>in</b> better developed <b>plants</b> grown <b>in</b> Bosnaplast 12 containers, but not so in Bosnaplast 18 and PVC 7 / 24 containers. The root system developed better and was richer in a PVC bag than in a B 18 container, and especially in a B 12 container (Figure 4). During one vegetation, no spiraling of the root system was observed <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> grown <b>in</b> these containers, or it was very slight (Figures 3 and 5), whereas root development, particularly <b>in</b> poorly developed <b>plants,</b> was not adequate. For this reason, seedlings of common cypress should be kept in PVC 7 / 24 containers and in B 18 containers for more than one vegetation, but not longer than for two vegetations. Table 2 shows data on average heights of common cypress plants and their survival percentages by container type and <b>planting</b> method <b>in</b> {{the first five years of}} research in the experimental plot. According to the Table, at the end of the first vegetation period, taking into account all container types and afforestation methods, the survival of common cypress plants ranged from 28. 0 % to 78. 8 %. The best results were obtained in the soil undermined with a ripper and planted with seedlings from PVC 7 / 24 containers (78. 8 %), followed by plants from B 18 containers (62. 5 %), and plants from B 12 containers (61. 3 %). In the experimental plot the survival percentage of common cypress planted with a classical method <b>in</b> dug <b>holes</b> was by 50 % lower than that of <b>plants</b> <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> the ripped soil in all container types. Regression analysis showed the dependence of plant survival percentage and <b>plant</b> height <b>in</b> the plot on container type and planting method (Figures 7 and 8). Plants of common cypress growing in larger containers and undermined soil attained bigger heights (r 2 = 0. 981) and bigger survival percentage (r 2 = 0, 792) than those <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> <b>holes.</b> Five-year monitoring of <b>plant</b> development <b>in</b> the experimental plot showed that the afforestation method with common cypresses <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> the soil undermined with a ripper to 50 to 70 cm in depth gave better results than the classical method of afforestation <b>in</b> dug <b>holes</b> of 40 x 40 x 40 cm. Common cypress plants from polyethylene bags of 923 cm 3 <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> the soil undermined with a ripper had an average height of 74. 5 cm and maximal height of 181. 0 cm. Those <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> dug <b>holes</b> reached a height of 54. 5 cm and maximum height of 128. 0 cm (Figures 9 and 10). Plants from B 12 containers showed the smallest height increment. The average <b>plant</b> height <b>in</b> the soil undermined with a ripper was 48. 4 cm and the maximal height was 101. 0 cm, while that <b>in</b> dug <b>holes</b> was 38. 4 cm to 76. 0 cm. The above data show that common cypress is a very useful species for afforesting karst areas and establishing mixed cultures in particular, on condition that the soil is properly prepared for afforestation and only good quality planting stock used. This material includes two-year-old seedlings grown in larger volume containers (900 to 1000 cm 3). Planting should be timely and expertly performed and obligatory tending treatments should be applied in the first several years after planting...|$|R

40|$|No plantio de um cafezal em terra de derrubada recente usa-se plantar as sementes no fundo das covas abertas com 15 a 30 cm. Em terras já anteriormente cultivadas, o emprêgo de mudas é indicado, julgando-se oportuno também o plantio profundo nas covas. A fim de verificar qual a melhor profundidade de plantio foram feitos três ensaios, nos quais se observaram as quantidades de falhas ocorridas e as produções dos cafeeiros. Notou-se que em Campinas a ocorrência de falhas foi a mesma nas diferentes profundidades de plantio, enquanto em Mococa foi maior para o plantio ao nível do solo. Quanto à produção, analisada durante os 4 a 6 primeiros anos, notou-se que as colheitas aumentaram à medida que as mudas foram plantadas a menores profundidades. A maior produção ocorreu no plantio ao nível do solo, em dois dos ensaios analisados. No ensaio instalado na Estação Experimental de Mococa observou-se pequena diferença entre o plantio na superfície e a 10 cm abaixo. Embora os resultados apresentados sejam de caráter preliminar, o bom desenvolvimento vegetativo e as melhores produções, além da facilidade de trabalho de plantio, aconselham o emprego da plantação das mudas ao nível do solo ou a 10 cm de profundidade, nas regiões estudadas. The {{establishment}} of coffee plantation in new deforested lands is usually made sowing about 20 seeds very deep <b>in</b> the <b>holes</b> and protecting with wood the lateral and upper {{sides of the}} <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> order to secure to the germinating seeds an environment similar to that found in nurseries. In land already cultivated with other crops the coffee plantation is established using seedlings developed in nursery. At our conditions four individual seedlings are <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> each <b>hole.</b> It is usually believed that these one year old seedlings must also be planted 20 to 30 cm below soil surface {{in the same way}} as the seeds are <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> new land. There are however indications that the seedlings can be planted only a few centimeters below the soil surface or at the soil level, saving a great deal of time in the preparation of the <b>hole.</b> <b>In</b> order to study the effects of depth of planting on the development and yield of the coffee plants, three experimental trials were <b>planted</b> <b>in</b> three coffee regions of the State of S. Paulo, using three to four different depths of planting. Seedling failures were the same for the depths of 0, 10, 20, and 30 cm in the trials from Campinas and higher at soil level in Mococa. The yields for the period of four consecutive years increased as the seedlings were planted at lower depth at the three localities. The highest yield was observed when seedlings were planted at soil level or at 10 cm depth. For clay soils (where the trials were established) it can be stated that seedlings may advantageously be planted at soil level. Other experiments will indicate which will be the best depth of planting for the coffee seedlings in sand soil, since it is a common practice in this type of soil to plant seedlings very deep <b>in</b> the <b>hole...</b>|$|R
