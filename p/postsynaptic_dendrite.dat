5000|$|In neuroscience, {{retrograde}} signaling (or retrograde neurotransmission) refers {{more specifically}} to {{the process by which}} a retrograde messenger, such as anandamide or nitric oxide, is released by a <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrite</b> or cell body, and travels [...] "backwards" [...] across a chemical synapse to bind to the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron.|$|E
50|$|Graded {{potentials}} are {{changes in}} membrane potential that vary in size, {{as opposed to}} being all-or-none. They arise from the summation of the individual actions of ligand-gated ion channel proteins, and decrease over time and space. They do not typically involve voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. These impulses are incremental and may be excitatory or inhibitory. They occur at the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrite</b> as a result of presynaptic neuron firing and release of neurotransmitter, or may occur in skeletal, smooth, or cardiac muscle in response to nerve input. The magnitude of a graded potential is determined by the strength of the stimulus.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the nature and distribution of synaptic contacts on the terminals of rapidly adapting mechanosensory afferents innervating the glabrous skin of the rat foot. Afferents were physiologically characterized by intracellular recording, before injection with neurobiotin and preparation for electron microscopy. Axon terminals were serially sectioned and immunolabeled with antibodies against GABA and glycine using a postembedding immunogold method. Afferent boutons in lamina III were often surrounded by several presynaptic axons and <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites</b> (thus forming type II glomeruli), while boutons in laminae IV–V had only simple, nonglomerular interactions. In both regions triadic synaptic arrangements where presynaptic interneurons contact both afferent boutons and their <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites</b> were present in 50 – 75 % of boutons. Approximately three-quarters of presynaptic axons were immunoreactive for both GABA and glycine and most of the remainder for GABA alone. Most <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites</b> were not immunoreactive. Comparisons are made with information from similar studies of other rat and cat afferents conducting in the Aαβ range. This demonstrates that although the principles of control may be similar for cutaneous afferents of this type there are significant differences between cutaneous and 1 a muscle afferents in the rat. There are also differences in detail between the interactions of afferents of the same modality in rat and cat; in the rat there are greater numbers of presynaptic axons per bouton and a greater proportion of boutons receive axo-axonic contacts and are involved in synaptic triads...|$|R
50|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{investigated}} additional mechanisms of NIHL involving delayed or disabled electrochemical transmission of nerve impulses from the hair cell to {{and along the}} auditory nerve. In cases of extreme acute acoustic trauma, {{a portion of the}} <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrite</b> (where the hair cell transfers electrochemical signal to the auditory nerve) can rupture from overstimulation, temporarily stopping all transmission of auditory input to the auditory nerve. This is known as excitotoxicity. Usually, this sort of rupture heals within about five days, resulting in functional recovery of that synapse. While healing, an over-expression of glutamate receptors can result in temporary tinnitus, or ringing in the ears. Repeated ruptures at the same synapse may eventually fail to heal, leading to permanent hearing loss.|$|E
40|$|Dendritic spines are {{protrusions}} on the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrite</b> {{that contribute}} to a semi-autonomous response that is spatiotemporally separated from other postsynaptic neuron regions like the soma and dendritic shaft. Spines are crucial for synaptic plasticity including long-term potentiation (LTP) and information storage. Their morphology is regulated by numerous organelles, cellular events and molecular interactions. Vesicle trafficking and remodeling of the cytoskeleton, which are closely linked, are widely accepted to be the pivotal mechanisms of spine growth and contribute to strengthening synaptic transmission. In this review I aimed to provide a comprehensive view of the cellular processes and molecular key players involved in spatiotemporal regulation of spine growth, starting from the Ca 2 + influx as a resultant of synaptic activity. Recently, many effectors have been made that supplied new insights in vesicle and protein trafficking that underlies neuronal processes like LTP and synaptic plasticity. The discovery of novel players and mechanisms concerning spine growth also contributed {{to a better understanding}} of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases like autism, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease and schizophrenia which are associated with spine anomalies...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the time}} of Hebb, the {{physical}} substrate for learning and memory in the brain has been most often discussed in relation to activity-dependent synaptic "weight" changes mediated by LTP or LTD. However, two recent theoretical studies suggest that long term information storage in neural tissue could also depend (heavily) on structural plasticity at the interface between axons and dendrites (Poirazi & Mel, 2001; Stepanyants et al. 2002). According to both theories, the capacity for structure-based information storage depends on the interaccessibility of afferent axons and their dendritic targets within the neuropil. For example, how many different axons {{are likely to be}} accessible to any given <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrite</b> with only minor structural modification? How much overlap exists in the set of axons accessible to two different dendritic branches? Using axonal and dendritic arborizations of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron from cat visual cortex as a reference point (courtesy J. Hirsch), we quantified the tradeoffs among several morphological variables that parameterize the axo-dendritic interface in neocortex, including spine length, spine density, dendritic branch length, branches per neuron, etc. We then used an extended version of the formula derived in Poirazi & Mel (2001) to understand how each of these variables separately and together contribute to the tissue's capacity to learn...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCone pedicles, the {{synaptic}} terminals of cone photoreceptors, {{are connected}} in the macaque monkey retina {{to several hundred}} <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites.</b> Using light and electron microscopy, we found underneath each cone pedicle a laminated distribution of dendritic processes of bipolar and horizontal cells. Superimposed were three strata of glutamate receptor (GluR) aggregates, including a novel layer of glutamate receptors clustered at desmosome-like junctions. They are, most likely, postsynaptic densities on horizontal cell dendrites. GABAA and GABAC receptors are aggregated on bipolar cell dendrites in a narrow band underneath the cone pedicle. Glutamate released from cone pedicles and GABA released from horizontal cell dendrites act not only through direct synaptic contacts but also (more so) through diffusion to the appropriate receptors...|$|R
40|$|In recent {{physiological}} experiments {{focusing on}} synaptic plasticity, it is shown that synaptic modifications induced at one synapse {{are accompanied by}} hetero-synaptic changes at neighbor sites (Bi, 2002). These evidences imply that the hetero-synaptic interaction {{plays an important role}} in reconfiguration of synaptic connections to form and maintain functional neural circuits (Takahashi et al., 2012). Although the mechanism of the interaction is still unclear, some physiological studies suggest that the hetero-synaptic interaction could be caused by propagation of intracellular calcium signals (Nishiyama et al., 2000). Concretely, a spike-triggered calcium increase initiates calcium ion propagation along a dendrite through activation of molecular processes at neighboring sites. Here we hypothesized that the mechanism of the hetero-synaptic interaction was based on the intracellular calcium signaling, which is regulated by interactions between NMDA receptors (NMDARs), voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) and Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To assess realizability of the hypothesized interaction mechanism, we simulated intracellular calcium dynamics at a cellular level, using the computational model that integrated the model of intracellular calcium dynamics (Keizer and Levine, 1996) and the multi-compartment neuron model (Poirazi et al., 2003). Using the proposed computational model, we induced calcium influxes at a local site in <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrite</b> by controlling the spike timings of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. As a result, synchronized calcium influxes through NMDARs and VDCCs caused calcium release from ER. According to the phase plane analysis, RyR-mediated calcium release occurred when the calcium concentration in cytoplasm sufficiently increased under the condition of a high calcium concentration in ER. An NMDAR-mediated calcium influx was slow and persistent, consequently responsible for maintaining a high calcium concentration in ER. In contrast, a VDCC-mediated calcium influx was rapid and transient so that it contributed to rapid increase in calcium the concentration in cytoplasm. Taken together, it was found that calcium concentration exhibited a supralinear increase when a presynaptic spike preceded a postsynaptic one. The calcium ions released from ER diffused along cytoplasm and then activated RyRs at neighboring sites. Thus cascades of RyR activation along a dendrite contributed to propagation of calcium pulses. The range of calcium propagation was 10 - 100 micrometers and depended on dendritic locations because the spatial distribution of VDCC expression was not homogeneous along a dendrite. According to the experimental evidences that the outcome of synaptic plasticity depends on postsynaptic calcium concentration, it was suggested that the RyR-regulated calcium propagation could serve as the mechanism of the hetero-synaptic interaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and synaptic arrangement of thyrotropin-releasing hormone-, substance P- and enkephalin-immunoreactive axonal boutons {{have been studied}} in the ventrolateral nucleus (Onuf's nucleus) of the upper sacral spinal cord segments in the cat. For this purpose, the peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemical technique was used. Immunoreactive axonal boutons were traced in complete series of sections in order to reveal synaptic contacts with the bundled dendrites of the ventrolateral nucleus. As judged from the cross-sectional diameter of the postsynaptic dendrites, the distribution of immunoreactive boutons was non-random. Enkephalin-immunoreactive axonal boutons, presumed to be mostly of segmental origin, displayed a rather restricted distribution to mainly (> 80 %) medium-to-large dendrites. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone-immunoreactive boutons, that derive from supraspinal levels, were also found to impinge on medium-to-large dendrites (> 80 %), indicating a proximal location within the dendritic trees. The skewness toward large postsynaptic dendrites was even more marked for thyrotropin-releasing hormone- than for enkephalin-immunoreactive boutons. Substance P-immunoreactive boutons, that are of either supraspinal or spinal origin, showed a more even distribution throughout the dendritic trees, including both thin distal branches and thick proximal dendrites. In view of the well-known fact that virtually all thyrotropin-releasing hormone-immunoreactive boutons in the ventral horn cocontain substance P (and serotonin) {{it was assumed that}} substance P-immunoreactive boutons in synaptic contact with the finest-calibre dendrites as well as most of those with a very proximal juxtasomatic location on the dendritic trees were of segmental origin, while those impinging on medium-to-large dendrites could be of either spinal or supraspinal origin. Fine-calibre dendrites (< 1 μm) represent about 25 % of the dendritic branches in the ventrolateral nucleus, but receive, with the exception of substance P (8 %), very little (< 3 %) peptidergic or GABAergic (Ramírez-León and Ulfhake, 1993) input, although the degree of dendritic membrane covering by bouton profiles in the ventrolateral nucleus does not seem to vary much with the calibre of the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrite</b> (Ramírez-León and Ulfhake, 1993). Both substance P- and enkephalin-immunoreactive axonal boutons established synaptic contact with more than one dendrite. Furthermore, one and the same bouton could be found in contact with two dendrites that were coupled to each other by a dendro-dendritic contact of desmosomal or puncta adherentia type. This synaptic arrangement was, however, not seen among thyrotropin-releasing hormone-immunoreactive boutons, indicating that these axonal boutons act on a single postsynaptic element, while inputs intrinsic to the spinal cord can show a divergence also at the terminal level...|$|E
40|$|Single motoneurons and {{pairs of}} a {{presynaptic}} reticulospinal axon and a postsynaptic motoneuron {{were recorded in}} the isolated lamprey spinal cord, to investigate the role of calcium-dependent K(+) channels (K(Ca)) during the afterhyperpolarization following the action potential (AHP), and glutamatergic synaptic transmission on the dendritic level. The AHP consists of a fast phase due to transient K(+) channels (fAHP) and a slower phase lasting 100 - 200 ms (sAHP), being the main determinant of spike frequency regulation. We now present evidence that the sAHP has two components. The larger part, around 80 %, is abolished by superfusion of Cd(2 +) (blocker of voltage-dependent Ca(2 +) channels), by intracellular injection of 1, 2 -bis-(2 -aminophenoxy) -ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA; fast Ca(2 +) chelator), and by apamin (selective toxin for K(Ca) channels of the SK subtype). While 80 % of the sAHP is thus due to K(Ca) channels, the remaining 20 % is not mediated by Ca(2 +), either entering through voltage-dependent Ca(2 +) channels or released from intracellular Ca(2 +) stores. This Ca(2 +) -independent sAHP component has a similar time course as the K(Ca) portion and is not due to a Cl(-) conductance. It {{may be caused by}} Na(+) -activated K(+) channels. Glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by single reticulospinal axons give rise to a local Ca(2 +) increase in the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrite,</b> mediated in part by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The Ca(2 +) levels remain elevated for several hundred milliseconds and could be expected to activate K(Ca) channels. If so, this activation should cause a local conductance increase in the dendrite that would shunt EPSPs following the first EPSP in a spike train. We have tested this in reticulospinal/motoneuronal pairs, by stimulating the presynaptic axon with spike trains at different frequencies. We compared the first EPSP and the following EPSPs in the control and after blockade with apamin. No difference was observed in EPSP amplitude or shape before and after apamin, either in normal Ringer or in Mg(2 +) -free Ringer removing the voltage-dependent block of NMDA receptors. In conclusion, the local Ca(2 +) entry during reticulospinal EPSPs does not cause an activation of K(Ca) channels sufficient to affect the efficacy of synaptic transmission. Thus the integration of synaptic signals at the dendritic level in motoneurons appears simpler than would otherwise have been the case...|$|E

Electrophysiological techniques in the NAc slice preparation demonstrated that activation of mGlu 2 / 3 with synaptically released glutamate or specific exogenous agonist, such as LY 354740 (200 nM, 10 min), induced long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission (mGlu 2 / 3 -LTD).

By combining in vivo time-lapse imaging of Xenopus tectal neurons with electron microscope reconstructions of imaged neurons, we report the distribution and ultrastructure of synapses on individual vertebrate neurons and relate these synaptic properties to dynamics in dendritic and axonal arbor structure over hours or days of imaging. Dynamic dendrites have a high density of immature synapses, whereas stable dendrites have sparser, mature synapses. Axons initiate contacts from multisynapse boutons on stable branches. Connections are refined by decreasing convergence from multiple inputs to <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites</b> and by decreasing divergence from multisynapse boutons to postsynaptic sites.

In the past 25 years, candidate growth genes have been implicated in learning processes, {{but it has not}} been demonstrated that they in fact enhance them.

If the overexpressed GAP- 43 was mutated by a Ser → Ala substitution to preclude its phosphorylation by protein kinase C, then no learning enhancement was found.

Conversely, neuroligins induce presynaptic differentiation in both glutamate and GABA axons. Whereas neuroligins- 1, - 3, and - 4 localize to glutamate postsynaptic sites, neuroligin- 2 localizes primarily to GABA synapses. Direct aggregation of neuroligins reveals a linkage of neuroligin- 2 to GABA and glutamate postsynaptic proteins, but the other neuroligins only to glutamate postsynaptic proteins. Furthermore, mislocalized expression of neuroligin- 2 disperses postsynaptic proteins and disrupts synaptic transmission.

Dendritic recordings from CA 1 pyramidal neurons reveal that proximal inputs from CA 3 {{as well as}} distal inputs from entorhinal cortex layer III (ECIII) sum sublinearly or linearly at low firing rates due to feedforward inhibition, but sum supralinearly at high firing rates due to synaptic facilitation, producing a high-pass filter. However, during ECIII and CA 3 input comparison, supralinear dendritic integration is dynamically balanced by feedforward and feedback inhibition, resulting in suppression of dendritic complex spiking. We find that a particular subpopulation of CA 1 interneurons expressing neuropeptide Y (NPY) contributes prominently to this dynamic filter by integrating both ECIII and CA 3 input pathways and potently inhibiting CA 1 pyramidal neuron dendrites...|$|R

Here we report that axonal NMDARs play {{an essential role in}} LTP induction at mouse corticostriatal synapses by triggering activity-induced presynaptic secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Genetic depletion of either BDNF or the NMDAR subunit GluN 1 specifically in cortical axons abolished corticostriatal LTP in response to theta burst stimulation (TBS). Furthermore, functional axonal NMDARs were required for TBS-triggered prolonged axonal Ca 2 + elevation and BDNF secretion, supporting the notion that activation of axonal NMDARs induces BDNF secretion via enhancing Ca 2 + signals in the presynaptic nerve terminals. These results demonstrate that presynaptic NMDARs are equally important as postsynaptic NMDARs in LTP induction of corticostriatal synapses due to their role in mediating activity-induced presynaptic BDNF secretion...|$|R

Axon terminals were serially sectioned and immunolabelled with antibodies against γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine by using a postembedding immunogold procedure. Computer-aided reconstruction was used to reveal the relative distribution of different types of synapses on terminal and en passant synaptic boutons. Eighty-nine percent of boutons received axoaxonic synaptic contacts, the mean number of contacts per bouton being 3. 5. Fifty-nine percent of presynaptic axons were immunoreactive for both GABA and glycine and 45 % for GABA alone. Most boutons (95 %) made axodendritic contacts, and the mean number of dendrites contacted was 1. 6. More than half of the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites</b> were greater than 1 μm in diameter.

The different durations and sensitivities to somatic membrane potential of pyramid–pyramid excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) apparently reflect {{the positions of}} the synapses on the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites.</b> Their time-, frequency- and voltage-dependent properties enable supra-linear summation of several low-frequency inputs arising in the same dendritic region, even if only loosely coincident, but they depress during repetitive firing in any one input. Pyramidal input to classical fast spiking and low threshold spiking interneurones are strikingly different. Here low presynaptic firing rates result in many transmission failures. EPSPs are brief and inputs must be near coincident for summation. However, these synapses display pronounced, frequency-dependent, incrementing facilitation at higher presynaptic frequencies. Once initiated by a brief high-frequency burst, this facilitation is maintained at lower frequencies. GABAA receptormediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) arising proximally are of very different durations {{depending on the type of}} interneurone activated and can prevent and subsequently synchronize firing in their many postsynaptic partners with very different delays (eg. 10 – 100 ms).

In the present paper, we examine the role of endogenous Narp in excitatory synapse formation by using novel, dominant-negative Narp mutants (dnNarp) that selectively bind endogenous Narp and prevent its accumulation at synapses. Axons from neurons transfected with wild-type Narp showed an increase {{in their ability to}} cluster AMPA receptors on spinal neurons, whereas axons from neurons transfected with dnNarp showed a marked decrease in their ability to induce GluR 1 clusters on contacted dendrites. Despite their marked effect at excitatory synapses, dnNarp and wild-type Narp had no effect on the postsynaptic clustering of the inhibitory protein gephyrin or the percentage of contacts associated with staining for the presynaptic vesicle proteins GAD or synaptophysin. Use of the dnNarp mutants to suppress endogenous Narp expression by <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites</b> showed a complementary role for dendritic Narp in the clustering of synaptic AMPA receptors, as well as a reduction in the total number of excitatory synapses on transfected neurons. Together these experiments suggest an important role for Narp in the formation of excitatory synapses in cultured spinal neurons.

40|$|Cytolinker {{proteins}} stabilize cells mechanically, regulate cytoskeleton dynamics, {{and provide}} scaffolds for signaling molecules. For plectin, {{the prototype of}} these proteins, an unusual diversity of isoforms has been reported, which show distinct expression patterns, subcellular localizations, and functions. Plectin {{has been shown to}} have important functions in skin and muscle, but little is known about its role in neural cells. To address this issue we generated two knockout mouse lines, one which was selectively lacking plectin 1 c (P 1 c), the major isoform expressed in neural cells, and another in which plectin was conditionally deleted in neuronal precursor cells. Using isoform specific antibodies, we found P 1 c to be expressed late in development, and to associate with <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites</b> of central nervous system neurons, motorneurons of spinal cord, sciatic nerve axons, and Schwann cells. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) was found significantly reduced in sciatic nerve from P 1 c-deficient as well from conditional knockout mice. This defect was traceable to an increased number of motor nerve fibers with small cross-sectional areas; the thicknesses of axons and of myelin sheaths were unaffected. This is the first report demonstrating an important role of plectin in a major nerve function...|$|R
40|$|Hippocampal interneurons {{consist of}} {{functionally}} diverse cell types, {{most of them}} target the dendrites or perisomatic region of pyramidal cells with a few exceptions, like the calretinin-containing cells in the rat: they selectively innervate other interneurons. However, no electron microscopic data are available about the synaptic connections of calretinin-immunoreactive neurons in the human hippocampus. We aimed to provide these data to establish whether interneuron-selective interneurons indeed represent an essential feature of hippocampal circuits across distant species. Two types of calretinin-immunostained terminals {{were found in the}} CA 1 region: one of them presumably derived from the thalamic reuniens nucleus, and established asymmetric synapses on dendrites and spines. The other type originating from local interneurons formed symmetric synapses on both pyramidal and interneuron <b>dendrites.</b> Distribution of <b>postsynaptic</b> targets showed that 26. 8 % of the targets were CR-positive interneuron dendrites, and 25. 2 % proved to be proximal pyramidal dendrites. CR-negative interneuron dendrites were also contacted (12. 4 %). Small caliber <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites</b> were not classified (28 %). Somata were rarely contacted (7. 6 %). The present data suggest that calretinin-positive boutons do show a preference for other interneurons, but a considerable proportion of the targets are pyramidal cells. We propose that interneuron-selective inhibitory cells exist in the human Ammon's horn, and boutons innervating pyramidal cells derive from another cell type that might not exist in rodents...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{demands are}} {{becoming}} {{recognized as an}} important constraint on neural signaling. The olfactory glomerulus provides a well defined system for analyzing this question. Odor stimulation elicits high-energy demands in olfactory glomeruli where olfactory axons converge onto dendrites of olfactory bulb neurons. We performed a quantitative analysis of the energy demands of each type of neuronal element within the glomerulus. This included the volumes of each element, their surface areas, and ion loads associated withmembrane potentials and synaptic activation as constrained by experimental observations. In the resting state, there was a high-energy demand compared with other brain regions {{because of the high}} density of neural elements. The activated state was dominated by the energy demands of action potential propagation in afferent olfactory sensory neurons and their synaptic input to dendritic tufts, whereas subsequent dendritic potentials and dendrodendritic transmission contributed only aminor share of costs. It is proposed therefore that afferent input and axodendritic transmission account for the strong signals registered by 2 -deoxyglucose and functional magnetic resonance imaging, although <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>dendrites</b> comprise at least one-half of the volume of the glomerulus. The results further suggest that presynaptic inhibition of the axon terminals by periglomerular cells {{plays an important role in}} limiting the range of excitation of the postsynaptic cells. These results provide a new quantitative basis for interpreting olfactory bulb activation patterns elicited by odor stimulation.
