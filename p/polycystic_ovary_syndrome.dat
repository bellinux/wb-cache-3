40|$|Fertility {{in women}} with {{congenital}} adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency (21 -OHD) appears to be reduced, especially {{in women with}} the classic salt-wasting type. Several factors have been suggested to contribute to this subfertility such as androgen excess, adrenal progesterone hypersecretion, consequences of genital reconstructive surgery, secondary <b>polycystic</b> <b>ovaries</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and psychosexual factors. In contrast to this subfertility, pregnancies are commonly normal and uneventful.

5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. <b>Polycystic</b> <b>ovary</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} <b>polycystic</b> <b>ovary</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In vitro {{fertilization}} {{is becoming more}} and more popular lately, as such light is to be shed on any possible related complication. One of these complications is the possible hormonal effect on the lipid profile of the patients. Case presentation: We present a case of a 39 -year-old woman with no prior or family history of dyslipidemia, who presented with post in {{vitro fertilization}} severe hypertriglyceridemia and secondary acute pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis. Discussion of the case is followed by a brief review of the literature related to in vitro fertilization–induced hypertriglyceridemia. Conclusion: This is, up to our knowledge, the sixth reported case of in vitro fertilization–induced hypertriglyceridemia with secondary acute pancreatitis. This is a serious and life-threatening complication. As such, it might be wise at least in high-risk patients (such as patients with diabetes mellitus, <b>polycystic</b> <b>ovaries</b> <b>syndrome,</b> obesity, and family and personal history of dyslipidemia) to screen for lipid abnormalities before initiating in vitro fertilization and monitor these levels afterward...|$|R
40|$|<b>Polycystic</b> <b>ovaries</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PCOS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} causes of reproductive failure. Its pathogenesis may be hormonal and immune disorder with hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The present study was conducted to demonstrate the effect of coleus forskohlii roots extract (CFE) in modulating the levels of some hormones and immune parameters of rats with androgen induced PCOS. Fifty immature female albino rats were divided into control group and androgen treated group that injected subcutaneously with 60 mg/kg BW/day androgen (Cidotestone) for 35 days to induce PCOS. Each group was subdivided into two subgroups. The first two subgroups received saline and 25 mg/kg BW of CFE, respectively while the other two subgroups received the same doses of Cidotestone and Cidotestone + CFE, respectively for 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected at the end of the experiment to estimate the levels of corticosterone, beta endorphin, total leucocytic count (TLC), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD+ 4), cluster of differentiation 8 (CD+ 8), interleukin 2 (IL- 2), interleukin 3 (IL- 3), interleukin 4 (IL- 4), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA). The results revealed a significant decrease in the concentrations of β endorphin, IL- 2, TLC, CD+ 4, CD+ 8 and IgG, while corticosterone and IL- 4 showed a significant increase in the androgen induced PCOS group. Rats treated with Cidotestone + CFE displayed normal values of all tested parameters except corticosterone, suggesting role of CFE in mediating both humoral and cellular immunity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of low dose GnRH analogue (Buserelin) on gonadal steroid secretion and hair growth in hirsute women. The drug was administered as a nasal spray (200 micrograms tid) to reduce gonadal steroid secretion. Eight hirsute women were treated for six month with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. All had subclinical <b>polycystic</b> <b>ovary</b> <b>syndromes</b> on the basis of ultrasound or hormonal data, together with ovary dysfunctions and irregular menses. None had adrenal or pituitary dysfunction. The score of hirsutism was evaluated according to Ferriman and Gallway; pituitary function was evaluated measuring the FSH and LH response to GnRH stimulation and gonadal steroid secretion by measuring estradiol, progesterone, total plasma testosterone, androstenedione and androstanediol. Sex hormone binding globulin, insulin, prolactin and DHEA-S were also measured. The suppression of ovarian steroid secretion was confirmed by reductions in total plasma testosterone, and rostenedione and androstanediol that were detectable after one month of treatment. FSH and LH responses to GnRH stimulation were inhibited consistent with pituitary desensitization. No significant side effects were observed and all patients completed the trial. The score of hirsutism was 24 +/- 5 before, 19. 6 +/- 6 by the 3 rd month and 16. 8 +/- 5. 1 by the 6 th month of treatment (p < 0. 001); the effect was still evident 1 and 6 months after the withdrawal of the therapy (14. 8 +/- and 15. 8 +/- 5 respectively; p < 0. 001).

A central (hypothalamic-pituitary) abnormality, including high plasma beta-endorphin (BE) concentrations without simultaneous elevation of ACTH, was reported for subjects with PCO syndrome. Since we have found the presence of high plasma BE concentrations in hereditary angioedema (HANE) during attacks as well as during symptom-free periods, we studied, by means of pelvic ultrasound scanning employed to determine the prevalence of PCO and of MFO, 13 women of reproductive age affected with HANE who were not on oral contraceptives. We have found PCO in 5 / 13 (38. 4 %) and MFO in 7 / 13 (53. 8 %) HANE patients. Nine patients had oligomenorrhoea (five with PCO, three with MFO, one with normal ovaries), five (three with PCO, two with MFO) were hirsute and only one (with MFO) had weight loss. No patient was obese. Mean plasma LH, testosterone, prolactin, cortisol and ACTH concentrations were normal, while FSH was significantly reduced and LH/FSH ratio increased.

40|$|<b>Polycystic</b> <b>ovaries</b> {{were defined}} with {{ultrasound}} imaging {{in a series}} of 173 women who presented to a gynaecological endocrine clinic with anovulation or hirsutism. <b>Polycystic</b> <b>ovaries</b> were found in 26 % of women with amenorrhoea, 87 % with oligomenorrhoea, and 92 % with idiopathic hirsutism [...] that is, hirsutism but with regular menstrual cycles.

40|$|Background: to {{investigate}} insulin levels in lean and overweight women {{with and without}} <b>polycystic</b> <b>ovaries.</b> An observational, cross-sectional study at The Northem General Hospital, Sheffield, UK. Methods: sixty-eight women born at Jessop Hospital, Sheffield, between 1952 and 1953 were divided into four groups according {{to the status of}} their <b>polycystic</b> <b>ovaries</b> and body mass index: either > or ~ 25. Therefore, this was an unselected sample, unlike previous studies that have recruited from endocrine clinics or similar.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to study the genetic susceptibility in pubertal females having hyperandrogenic manifestations without an evident cause. This study included 31 pubertal females, presented by hirsutism, acne and androgenic alopecia in various combinations. Exclusion criteria were ovarian and suprarenal tumors, classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia, ambiguous genitalia or receiving drugs that may give androgenic manifestations. Parents and sibs of the multicase families were included. In addition 40 normal females of matched age were taken as control group. Pelvic ultrasonography was done and blood samples were withdrawn (9 a. m.) in the fifth day of menstrual cycle for estimation of serum cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 17 -hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, estrone- 2 (E 2), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). For all the parents and female sibs, affected and unaffected, of the multicase families, HLA class I (A and B) and CLASS II (DR and DQ) were determined in addition to the 40 control female. Patients were enrolled into 3 groups; Group 1 (G 1) included 11 cases with normal hormonal profile. Out of them 7 have female sib(s) affected (7 multicase families) with hormonal levels in the normal range. Group 2 (G 2) included cases with increased hormones and LH/FSH ratio 2. Non of them has affected female sib. The genetic analysis included HLA-haplotype concordance, lod score for linkage and identity by descent. The results revealed that in G 2 the levels of cortisol and E 2 were significantly low (P 2 = 3. 24). IBD analysis in G 1 fits dominant model (P = 0. 36) and in G 2 fits the recessive model (P = 0. 64). In conclusion the hyperandrogenic manifestations in G 1 are due to dominant inherited hypersensitivity to hormones. G 2 and G 3 may result from dyshormonogenesis due to recessive gene(s) leading to non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia or <b>polycystic</b> <b>ovary</b> (PCO) <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R
