50|$|From a {{political}} or sociological outlook, {{there are three}} main paradigms for understanding the origins and basis of nationalism.

The second paradigm is ethnosymbolism, which is a complex <b>perspective</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> explain nationalism by contextualizing it throughout history as a dynamic, evolutionary phenomenon and by further examining the strength of nationalism {{as a result of}} the nation's subjective ties to national symbols imbued with historical meaning. The third and most dominant paradigm is modernism, which sees nationalism as a recent phenomenon that needs the structural conditions of modern society in order to exist.|$|E

Three vignettes based on critical incidents generated from observation, interview, and diary data illustrate various aspects of the situatedness of learning.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2007. Bullying within schools {{continues}} despite current anti-bullying strategies aimed against it. Bullying {{research has}} largely been of an empirical nature, employing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. This project adds a missing philosophical <b>perspective,</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> more deeply {{understand the nature of}} bullying and the realities which motivate and guide its activities. Within the empirical literature bullying is seen in part to be motivated by a lack of understanding, skill deficiency, misdirected status acquisition attempts, bully delinquency or ecological realities (i. e., through school culture, teacher modeling or peer pressure). Using hermeneutic philosophy, psychoanalytic and feminist philosophies, as well as post-structural philosophy, I analyze three experiences of understanding (as elucidated by Hans-Georg Gadamer), the desires at work within relations of domination (as discussed by Jessica Benjamin) and the realities of subjectivity narrations within systems of discourse and practice (as described by Michel Foucault). In the end I argue that bullying may be fundamentally seen as a process of attempted self-construction through domination, a process that actually eclipses self-knowledge and that is guided by the dividing practices inherent in school motivational discourse and practice. I suggest several implications for current and future anti-bullying strategies and research trajectories, including curricular strategies and school culture reform. In essence, this project discusses the possibility of proactive strategies aimed at stopping bullying before it starts...|$|E
40|$|Public health {{nutrition}} (PHN) as {{a discipline}} aims to improve nutrition-related outcomes for population groups and increasing morbidity-free life years. Optimising nutritional health and wellbeing among mothers and their infants is a priority for PHN as evidence demonstrates both {{short and long term}} influence on health. Settings based intervention approaches offer a holistic approach to addressing multiple determinants of health and wellbeing. The community pharmacy (CP) is an accessible, conveniently located and widely utilised health care settings and therefore may be a potential setting for PHN intervention. The aim of the research undertaken in this thesis was to explore community pharmacy as a potential setting for public health nutrition intervention particularly among pregnant women and new mothers. Given the exploratory nature of this research a qualitative approach was undertaken based on an action research approach which positions research as informed inquiry focused on social change. The research was underpinned by assumptions regarding the complexity of practice, the role of context in developing understanding to inform action and the need for multiplicity of perspectives to enhance and deepen the investigation. Four key sources of knowledge were investigated – research literature, interventionists, mothers and public health nutritionists.

50|$|In {{its early}} stages, {{the law and}} {{literature}} movement focused strictly on the law in literature theory; however, {{beginning in the late}} 1970s the law as literature perspective began to gain popularity.

40|$|Notes on a Scandal (Eyre, 2006) {{contains}} one of {{the most}} visible portrayals of a non-heterosexual older woman in recent mainstream film, Barbara Covett (Judi Dench). The fact that Barbara, as a twenty-first century creation, is reminiscent of cultural texts that precede the gay-rights-liberation movements of the 1960 s raises questions about the pervasiveness and continuation of ageist and heterosexist images (such as the threatening spinster, the predatory stalker or the monstrous lesbian). Barbara establishes the continuity between the types of representation characteristic of a pre-gay-liberation era and a 2006 film, based on a contemporary literary text. This collision of former models of lesbian representation with contemporary audiences – that can be assumed to be familiar with a more diverse type of texts, including transgressive images of new queer cinema – creates a range of interpretative possibilities. This paper considers the means by which Barbara is textually constructed as ‘other’ and as a threat to Sheba’s (Cate Blanchett) heteronormative identity and explores the transgressive potential of Barbara’s non-normative body and desires. The concept of abjection (Kristeva, 1982; Shildrick, 2002) is at the centre of this exploration of Barbara’s transgressive potential as old and queer, the abject ‘other’ who has the ability to unsettle the normative self (the youthful heteronormative). Approaching the abject more constructively, this paper questions whether Notes on a Scandal can be explored from a queer theory <b>perspective,</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> re-appropriate the older lesbian figure as an empowering monstrous ‘other’...|$|E

Much of this burgeoning literature has reported from specific places, at specific times, thereby creating a wealth of case-study material for scholars to examine (collections of case studies include Mc Cay and Acheson, 1987; Berkes, 1989; Bromley, 1992; Agrawal, 2001, has recently reviewed some of this material). There has also been some work that has adopted a more analytical <b>perspective,</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> develop general principles that help to explain and understand common pool resource outcomes (most notably, of course, the work of Ostrom and her associates over this period). This paper does not seek to review knowledge of the politics, economics or ecology of common pool resource management, but develops a framework that relates current knowledge to the processes of everyday decision making that concern the policy community. The paper follows the tradition of those who have contributed to building analytical frameworks {{for the study of the}} commons (Oakerson 1986, 1992; Ostrom, 1990; Thomson et al 1992; Edwards and Stein, 1998).

40|$|The Andean Tribunal of Justice (ATJ) is {{the third}} most active {{international}} court and {{the oldest and most}} successful of eleven transplanted copies of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Drawing on over a decade of interviews, archival research, and case coding, Transplanting International Courts examines the ATJ’s creation, doctrinal development, and contributions to the law and politics of the Andean Community. Alter and Helfer evaluate the ATJ in a wider <b>perspective,</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> understand how transplanted supranational institutions operate in practice and the strategies that international judges deploy to navigate turbulent political environments, especially in developing country contexts. Transplanting International Courts begins by analyzing how the European judicial model shaped the ATJ’s original design and foundational legal doctrines. But the ATJ has since charted its own path, most strikingly in the area of intellectual property (IP). The ATJ has built deep and mutually supportive relationships with domestic IP administrative agencies that have allowed it to confront governments pressured by the U. S. and by multinational drug companies to abandon limits on IP that promote public health and protect consumers. Outside of this IP island, the ATJ is less legally and politically influential. The tepid support of national judges and the lack of jurist advocacy movements prevent the tribunal from graining greater legal and political traction. This pattern has continued even as Andean Community has faltered. Riven by ideological divisions among the member states, in some respects the regional integration project has moved backward over the last decade. Even in this fraught political climate, the IP island is flourishing and the Andean legal system continues to confront state noncompliance. As they explore multiple aspects of the Andean legal system, Alter and Helfer’s interdisciplinary analysis elucidates the many factors that contribute to and limit the effectiveness of all international courts...|$|E
