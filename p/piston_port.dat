5000|$|The Rotax Engine design used a {{slightly}} unusual style of intake. A compact rotary disc system was employed and this plate was altered between T'n'T (track and trail) and MX models {{to provide the}} desired power curve. This compact rotary disc is accredited with the horsepower gain over conventional <b>piston</b> <b>port</b> engines used on Japanese motorcycles. The MX3, produced in 1977, was the pinnacle of Can Am. Its [...] was 6 hp more than the closest competitor.|$|E
50|$|The Kawasaki 440/A engine, {{produced}} by Kawasaki, is a 436 cc <b>piston</b> <b>port</b> engine utilizing 38 mm Mikuni VM series carburetors and a tuned dual exhaust.

Unfortunately an accident in the semi final of Clubman Light did not allow him to complete the season.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{advanced}} for its time, with features normally seen on race bikes: two-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil injected, dual rotary valve. While other manufactures had utilised {{the advantages of}} rotary disc valve induction on small single-cylinder machines, only Kawasaki and Bridgestone produced twin-cylinder machines. Rotary disc valve induction ensures that the all the fuel charge is used and not partly lost (as in a <b>piston</b> <b>ported</b> engine). As a result, it produces more power, more torque at low revs and better response throughout the rev range. The engine's initial air supply began in an air filter canister below the seat and was drawn through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head, then down into the internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors.|$|R
5000|$|The Toro Agreement - In 1999, Briggs & Stratton made {{a license}} {{agreement}} with The Toro Company of Bloomington, Minnesota USA. {{to produce the}} Toro R*Tek <b>piston</b> <b>ported</b> version of their E series 2-stroke engine (AKA Lawn-Boy DuraForce) for use in Toro Snow Throwers. The engine was a 141cc 2 cycle that produced from 4 hp to 6.5 hp at 3700 to 4000 rpm on a 50:1 gas & oil mix. A higher power 7-HP model was made (Engine Model# 84330) for use in heavier duty machines such as the single stage Snow Commander (2001-2008) & 2 stage Power Max 726TE/6000 (2004-2008), the extra horsepower was obtained using Transfer <b>Ports</b> in the <b>piston</b> & cylinder wall and ran at the same operating speed as the 6.5 hp engines (4000rpms). Production stopped in 2011.|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: The {{performance}} of a new engine configuration is assessed. The engine type is unique – details of similar engines have not {{been found in the}} open literature. The primary goal of this new engine design is to improve engine efficiency. It consists of two opposed pistons in a single cylinder controlled by two synchronously timed crankshafts at opposite ends of the cylinder. It makes use of crank offset to create the required piston motion aimed at engine efficiency improvements through thermodynamic performance gains. In particular, the engine employs full expansion. It also features a greater rate of volume change after combustion than a conventional 4 -stroke engine for the same crank speed. The engine is a <b>piston</b> <b>ported,</b> spark ignition petrol engine. Thermodynamic and friction modelling using Matlab predicted net efficiencies in the order of 38...|$|R
50|$|The Maicoletta used a Bosch six volt 'pendulum' {{electric}} starter system. When activated, instead of rotating the crankshaft, the starter used the generator coils {{on the shaft}} to rock {{it back and forth}} under the control of cams on the crankshaft. These cams closed contacts in the starter to trigger a reversing switch in the control box that changed the crankshaft direction {{at the end of each}} swing. This gives the impression of the crankshaft continually bouncing back and forwards against compression, when operated. A separate set of ignition points fired the spark plug in the forward direction only, and when this fires the mixture in the cylinder the engine starts to rotate normally, the starter is released and the normal ignition system takes over. This system was possible due to the <b>piston</b> <b>port</b> induction system of the two-stroke engine.|$|E
50|$|When the {{transfer}} is complete, the piston {{is on the}} compression stroke but the exhaust port is still open, an unavoidable problem with the two stroke <b>piston</b> <b>port</b> design. To help prevent the piston pushing fresh mixture out the open exhaust port the strong acoustic wave (produced by the combustion) from the expansion chamber is timed to arrive during {{the beginning of the}} compression stroke. The port blocking wave is created by reducing the diameter of the chamber. This is called the convergent section (or baffle cone). The outgoing acoustic wave hits the narrowing convergent section and reflects back a strong series of acoustic pulses to the cylinder. They arrive in time to block the exhaust port, still open during the beginning of the compression stroke and push back into the cylinder any fresh mixture drawn out into the header of the expansion chamber. The convergent section is made to converge at 16 to 25 degrees, depending on requirements.|$|E
5000|$|The {{market for}} {{motorcycles}} in 1968 had been changing from time, utilitarian transport to more aggressive sporting motorcycles that disregarded fuel economy and noise, {{in favor of}} quicker quarter mile times, which were prominently advertised by manufacturers. While Kawasaki had an inline-four four-stroke in development, it was not going be ready in time to upstage the 1969 Honda CB750, so instead they moved up the release of their conventional <b>piston</b> <b>port</b> two-stroke triple to [...] "make a real splash". They turned to the N100 Plan, a project begun in June, 1967, whose intent was to design the most powerful production motorcycle engine in the world. They first considered increasing the bore of an existing engine but instead created an all-new engine, experimenting with both inline and L cylinder arrangements, with both two and three cylinders. They settled on an inline-three arrangement after testing showed that an inline layout did not adversely affect cooling of the middle cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} {{had a higher}} profile cam design in the head, a cam cover with ribs throughout its length, and fuel injectors in the intake manifold runners. Mechanically, the late-model motors received MAP load sensing and redesigned <b>pistons,</b> intake <b>ports,</b> and intake manifold. The {{second generation}} engine was produced from 1992-1998 (1993-1997 in the US).|$|R
40|$|The Space Power Research Engine (SPRE), a free-piston Stirling engine with {{a linear}} alternator, {{is being tested}} at NASA Lewis Research Center {{as part of the}} Civilian Space Technology Initiative (CSTI) as a {{candidate}} for high capacity space power. Results are presented from recent SPRE tests designed to investigate the effects of variation in the displacer seal clearance and <b>piston</b> centering <b>port</b> area on engine performance and dynamics. The effects of these variations on PV power and efficiency are presented. Comparisons of the displacer seal clearance test results with HFAST code predictions show good agreement for PV power but poor agreement for PV efficiency. Correlations are presented relating the piston mid-stroke position to the dynamic Delta P across the piston and the centering port area. Test results indicate that a modest improvement in PV power and efficiency may be realized with a reduction in <b>piston</b> centering <b>port</b> area...|$|R
50|$|Suzuki AX 100 is a two-stroke, 100 cc {{motorcycle}} from Suzuki. It {{was made}} both in Japan, India and China. The Suzuki Samurai was a similar motorcycle made by Suzuki India for the Indian market.Various Chinese companies like Baccio, Jiancheng, Guerrero, Ayuco or Akt copied {{the design and}} produced mechanical copies under various names such as Dayun. Launched in the middle 1990s purely for the Far Eastern commuter market, {{in fact it is}} still made in China some 15 years on. It is the height of simplicity; a four-speed air-cooled two stroke with <b>piston</b> <b>porting</b> and a simple carburetor. A full chain guard and simple drum brakes keep maintenance tasks simple for unskilled labour, and parts inexpensive to buy, especially as they are manufactured by many different companies in China, many of poor or at best indifferent quality.Between 1990 and 2000 Suzuki motors corporation manufactured the Suzuki AX 115 cc.|$|R
5000|$|The Maicoletta {{motor scooter}} of the 1950s {{was one of}} the largest motor scooters {{produced}} by any manufacturer until the modern era. The engine was a single cylinder 247cc <b>piston</b> <b>port</b> 2-stroke (an export version featuring a 277cc engine was also produced for use with a sidecar), with four foot-operated gears, enclosed chain drive, centrifugal fan cooling and electric start. This was fitted to a tubular frame built on motorcycle principles with long travel telescopic forks and 14-inch wheels. The Maicoletta had a top speed of greater than 70 mph, comparable with most 250cc motorcycles of the time. In the 1950s most scooters such as Vespa, Lambretta, were 125cc to 200cc with 8-10 inch wheels and a top speed of 55 to 60 mph, so the expensive but fast and comfortable Maicoletta developed a following amongst scooter club enthusiasts. By modern standards the brakes (drum front and rear) leave something to be desired, but compared to those of other scooters from the period, the brakes are not inferior.|$|E
50|$|Some of the sleds made by Ski-Doo are the Formula III, Mach 1, and Mach Z with Rotax engines. While it is a {{commonly}} held misconception that all Ski-Doo snowmobiles were powered by rotary valved engines, {{this is not}} true. Only two cylinder Rotax engines were equipped with rotary valves. As a rule, the later rotary valved sleds were liquid cooled as well. Fan cooled sleds were usually <b>piston</b> <b>port</b> (2-stroke) induction. Sleds such as the formula III, later model mach-1's and the mach Z were powered by three cylinder, 2-stroke, Rotax engines. In 1994 the company produced the first snowmobile equipped specifically for mountain riding, the Ski-Doo Summit. Ski-Doo snowmobiles have consistently been extremely competitive for performance and in the marketplace up to the current day, taking a number of national titles in racing events from Sno-X to hill-climbing. In 1999 Ski-Doo introduced the ZX aluminum chassis which was lighter weight with better suspension and thus very successful in sno-cross competition. In 2003 Ski-Doo introduced rider-forward REV chassis, which changed the sport and was followed by other manufacturers. In 2008 Ski-Doo introduced the XP chassis, which moved the rider further forward with major weight reduction. The XP was the lightest machine available, with power-to-weight ratios in the Summit models {{for the first time}} under 3 lb per HP.|$|E
5000|$|The 700S {{continued}} to be developed at the Darley Abbey works in Derbyshire, along with the SPR Production Racing version. [...] Production was slow, with just two motorcycles a week coming off the production line. Customers could select from five colour schemes - British Racing Green, metallic blue or green, black with gold coachlines or plain red. There was also a Scott special edition in purple and cream - and a special scheme similar to Silk Cut cigarettes, which were popular at the time.As a precision engineering company, Silk {{were able to make}} the <b>piston</b> <b>port</b> twin cylinder engine in-house at their Derbyshire workshops. The pressed up, four roller bearing crank had the primary drive taken from the crankshaft centre, to an inverted Velocette Venom four-speed gearbox. The two stroke engine ran on a 50:1 petroil mix, with a separate oil tank reserved for main bearing lubrication fed by Silk's own design of oil pump. When the rider opened the throttle the oil flowed faster, ensuring best possible lubrication. The engine's claimed 48 bhp was developed at 6,000rpm, giving good touring performance, and peak torque was at 3,000rpm, comparable to the Suzuki GT750. Twin siamesed exhaust pipes fed an Ossa silencer. The wheels on early models were 18 inch Borrani alloy rims, replaced with six spoke Campagnolo cast wheels on later Silks. The final drive chain was enclosed for longer life.|$|E
