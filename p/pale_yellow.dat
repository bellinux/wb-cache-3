5|$|The gleba {{is largely}} {{made up of}} two types of threads. The pseudocapillitium has hyphae up to 5µm diameter, mostly thin walled, smooth, septate, sparsely branched, hyaline to <b>pale</b> <b>yellow,</b> with clamps. The elaters have diameters of 3.5–7µm and are 32–70µm long; they are <b>pale</b> <b>yellow,</b> smooth-walled, tapered and {{cylindrical}} with spiral thickenings. Glebal elaters are aseptate and not branched.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{exposures}} of the pyriteiferous shale {{may develop}} the secondary mineralization of orange limonite(FeO(OH)·nH2O), and the <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> efflorescence or bloom of sulfur, associated with acid rock drainage.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{fluorine}} is a gas of diatomic molecules, <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> when pure (sometimes {{described as}} yellow-green).

The bill of the female is <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> with the tip and cutting edge of mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, a <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> supercilium, and a pale horn bill. Females and juveniles have hints of chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other rufous sparrows, which are common {{in much of the}} chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius subconiatus, {{known from}} Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is {{somewhat}} similar to M.sasicola. It can be differentiated as its stem does {{not enter the}} substrate, and the gills differ. In M.subconiatus, the gills are orange, and sport cheilocystidia which are <b>pale</b> <b>yellow.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{body is a}} pale {{brown or}} silvery brown colour, {{transitioning}} to white below, with green, mauve and rosy reflections when the fish is first removed from the water. An indistinct silver-yellow mid-lateral band extends across some specimens. The spinous dorsal fin is olive green with faint darker blotches, the second dorsal fin also a pale olive with rows of dark brown to blackish spots. The anal and ventral fins are <b>pale</b> <b>yellow,</b> the pectorals are <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> to pale brown with a well defined dark blue-black blotch at the base.

5|$|Fluorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists {{as a highly}} toxic <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> diatomic gas at standard conditions. As the most electronegative element, it is extremely reactive: almost all other elements, including some noble gases, form compounds with fluorine.|$|E
5|$|Large chromatophores densely {{cover the}} upper {{surfaces}} of the head, mantle and arms. They are distributed more sparsely on the ventral side. The fins do not possess chromatophores on the underside. Living specimens range in colour from translucent creamy white through <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> to brownish pink and brownish violet.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests can {{used to help}} confirm identification of the mushroom. The cap cuticle turns grayish with {{the application of a}} drop of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4), and dark brown to amber with a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). The flesh turns pale brown with KOH, and <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> with ammonia (NH4OH).|$|E

5|$|The Indian subcontinent is {{the range}} of {{subspecies}} N. p. ginginianus, {{the smallest of the}} three subspecies, which is identifiable by a <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> bill. The subspecies name is derived from Gingee in southern India where the French explorer Pierre Sonnerat described it as Le Vautour de Gingi and it was given a Latin name by John Latham in his Index Ornithologicus (1790).|$|E
5|$|The gill {{tissue is}} made of {{thin-walled}} hyphae containing a septum, which are hyaline to <b>pale</b> <b>yellow,</b> and measure 3–15µm wide. The cap tissue comprises interwoven, inflated hyphae with widths between 2 and 25µm. Neither the gill tissue nor the cap tissue show any color reaction when stained with Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of Lepiota babruzalka.|$|E
5|$|The silky-flycatchers are a {{small family}} of {{passerine}} birds which occur mainly in Central America, although the range of one species extends to central California.

5|$|The {{standard}} {{corporate identity}} across the Metrolink system uses a <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> and metallic silver colour scheme, with a logotype {{that consists of}} a diamond motif formed from a pattern of repeating circles and the Metrolink name. The logo, signage and publicity use the Pantograph sans regular typeface. Tram livery features yellow at the vehicle ends with grey sides and black doors, and a pattern of circles.|$|E
5|$|The {{thick-walled}} spores {{are roughly}} spherical, rusty-brown, finely and densely warted, and have diameters of 5–6.5µm. Elaters are 50–80 by 4–6µm, and have ring-like or spiral thickenings. The endoperidium consists of densely interwoven hyphae that are 3–9µm {{in diameter and}} walls less than 1µm thick; they are septate, branched, <b>pale</b> <b>yellow,</b> with clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Variety queletiformis can be {{distinguished}} from the main form by the reddish discolouration of the stem base that occurs both on the exterior surface and in the flesh. Variety rubriceps has a deep crimson red cap, while var. lupiniformis has a <b>pale</b> <b>yellow</b> or dirty ochre cap, sometimes with pink tones throughout.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 18-25 mm. Adults have {{light yellow}} forewings with three large violet-brown costal spots and usually two small ones. The hindwings are <b>paler</b> <b>yellow</b> with {{one to three}} slightly darker lines. They are on wing from June to August.|$|R
5|$|Juvenile red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} resemble females until puberty, {{which occurs}} around {{four years of}} age, but have <b>paler</b> <b>yellow</b> barred underparts. As the birds reach maturity, males gradually replace their yellow tail feathers with red ones; the complete process takes around four years.|$|R
