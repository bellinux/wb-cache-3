40|$|AbstractClassifying 33 undisturbed, {{perennial}} springs of the Pfälzerwald mountains by macrobenthic communities, {{three different}} groups of springs have been found. Springs in this area {{can be divided into}} lotic ones, mostly rheocrenes, with coarse substrates and, as a distinct group, lenitic ones, mostly helocrenes and limnocrenes, having fine substrates. Furthermore, acidity separates the lotic springs into two additional groups, an acid one with <b>pH-values</b> mostly lower than 5. 5 and a second, moderate or not acid one showing <b>pH-values</b> mostly higher than 6. All springs, especially the acidic ones, are predominantly populated by crenobiontic and crenophilous species, though unacidified lotic springs show high proportions of rhithrobiontic organisms. Hence, it is concluded, that spring dwelling species, as an adaptation to special crenal living conditions, are more tolerant to low <b>pH-values</b> than rhithrobiontic ones are. In the Pfälzerwald mountains, the character of substrate - which is an expression of current velocity — is the main factor determining spring communities.

Nanomechanical properties were investigated by nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests before and after incubation of the specimens at 37 °C for 30 days in artificial saliva with <b>pH-values</b> of 3, 7 and 10, respectively. Nanoindentation and nanoscratching tests were performed using the Hysitron TI 950 TriboIndenter to evaluate the reduced elastic moduli, nanohardness, viscoelasticity, friction coefficient and residual scratch profiles. After treatment, the nanomechanical properties of unfilled PEEK did not change. The reduced elastic moduli and nanohardness of the carbon fiber-reinforced PEEK increased significantly. The reduced elastic moduli and nanohardness of CHARISMA decreased. The plasticity of all materials except that of the unfilled PEEK increased. This indicates that different <b>pH-values</b> of the artificial saliva solutions had no obvious influences on the nanomechanical properties of the PEEK matrix. Therefore, the aging resistance of the unfilled PEEK was higher than those of other materials. It can be deduced that the PEEK matrix without filler was more stable than with filler in the nanoscale...|$|R

50|$|RGR opsins, {{also known}} as Retinal G protein coupled receptors are {{expressed}} in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller cells. They preferentially bind all-trans-retinal in the dark instead of 11-cis-retinal. RGR opsins speed up light-independently the production of 11-cis-retinol (a precursor of 11-cis-retinal) from all-trans-retinyl-esters. However, the all-trans-retinyl-esters are made available light-dependently by RGR-opsins. Whether RGR-opsins regulate this via a G-protein or another signaling mechanism is unknown.

50|$|A {{carbonate}} platform is a sedimentary body which possesses topographic relief, and {{is composed of}} autochthonous calcareous deposits (Wilson, 1975). Platform growth is mediated by sessile organisms whose skeletons build up the reef or by organisms (usually microbes) which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism. Therefore, {{carbonate platform}}s can not grow up everywhere: they are not present in places where limiting factors {{to the life of}} reef-building organisms exist. Such limiting factors are, among others: light, water temperature, transparency and <b>pH-Value.</b> For example, carbonate sedimentation along the Atlantic South American coasts takes place everywhere but {{at the mouth of the}} Amazon River, because of the intense turbidity of the water there (Carannante et al., 1988). Spectacular examples of present-day carbonate platforms are the Bahama Banks under which the platform is roughly 8 km thick, the Yucatan Peninsula which is up to 2 km thick, the Florida platform, the platform on which the Great Barrier Reef is growing, and the Maldive atolls.http://www.tamug.edu/cavebiology/Bahamas/BahamaIntro.html All these carbonate platforms and their associated reefs are confined to tropical latitudes. Today’s reefs are built mainly by scleractinian corals, but in the distant past other organisms, like archaeocyatha (during the Cambrian) or extinct cnidaria (tabulata and rugosa) were important reef builders.|$|E
40|$|In natural {{habitats}} Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex have different ranges of extension {{with respect to}} pH-conditions in ponds. In acid brooks Gammarus pulex will survive longer than Gammarus fossarum. Investigations in the laboratory showed that, correspondingly, D. magna is more sensitive to low pH than D. pulex, and G. fossarum more sensitive than G. pulex. Mortality increased in close relation to increasing acidity and is mainly caused by the increasing concentration of free hydrogen ions. Anions are less important, which was shown in experiments with five different acids, including acid drip water from a fir forest. Low <b>pH-values</b> {{may lead to the}} mobilization of heavy metalions, which can increase the toxicity of a medium.

The pH dependence of this structure was investigated; cro protein is stable over pH 4. 5 – 10. 5.

40|$|Abstract: In laboratory-scale {{experiments}} with ashes from different full-scale sludge incineration plants the elution behaviour of phosphorus and metals at different <b>pH-values</b> were examined. The elution of ashes with water alone {{did not cause}} any significant release of phosphorus, while depending on the ash origin and formation, a phosphorus release of maximum 30 % was measured when using sodium hydroxide solution. With sulphuric acid, {{it was possible to}} release phosphorus and (heavy) metals quantitatively at <b>pH-values</b> less than 1. 5. In addition to the elution experiments, precipitation and nanofiltration were investigated as methods for the separation of phosphorus and metals from the liquid phase. Sequential precipitation of phosphorus (SEPHOS Process) seems to be promising. The generated product, an “aluminium phosphate”, is a valuable raw material for the phosphorus industry. After alkaline treatment of the “aluminium phosphate”, it is possible to precipitate phosphorus as calcium phosphate (advanced SEPHOS Process). Following acidic elution of the ash, nanofiltration {{can also be used to}} separate phosphorus...|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of electro-osmosis or electroosmotic flow creates {{a flow of}} an electrolyte through a very small tube in the nano-meter range. To achieve this flow there is a cathode and an anode {{at the ends of}} the tube over which a voltage is applied. Due to this voltage the ions in the electrolyte stored in a reservoir directly connected to the tube can be accelerated and ejected. This way electrical energy is transformed into kinetic energy. The amount of thrust created by one nano thruster is in the micro newton range, however due to its size it makes sense to arrange a big amount in an array to achieve sufficient thrust. The thrust, exit velocity of the ions and the mass flow rate of the electrolyte are influenced by the applied voltage which makes it easy to regulate those parameters. The applied voltage and the <b>pH-value</b> of the electrolyte (amount of ions it contains) also vary the balance between thrust, efficiency and maximal exhaust velocity (determines the maximal achievable flight velocity). It is also theoretically possible to achieve a very high efficiency of nearly 100% as well as a high specific impulse and high thrust-to-power ratio. This system has not yet been build and experimentally tested because of difficulties with the production of the nano-tubes needed for it.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Adsorption {{characteristics}} of two Ariake clays (Clay- 1 and Clay- 2) to chromium were investigated by batch contact tests and advection-diffusion column tests. A strong non-linear adsorption isotherm was observed from batch contact test results.

This non-linear adsorption characteristic has been confirmed by analyzing the advection-diffusion column test results.

The <b>pH-value</b> of the solution has a strong effect on the adsorption capacity.
