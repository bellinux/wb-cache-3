50|$|The Rebecca T. Ruark is {{a typical}} sloop-rigged skipjack, built for the shallow draft, low {{freeboard}} and high stability needed to work the Chesapeake Bay oyster beds. She has a rounded chine with a sharp, convex clipper bow on a sloop hull. The Ruark is fore-and-aft planked. Her wood plug rudder is carried well forward beneath the transom, astern of the centerboard. As part of her 2000 U.S. Coast Guard certification to carry passengers for hire she received a watertight bulkhead ahead of the mast. An aluminum hatch provides access into the new space, which is used for sail and line storage. The deck is 2 in fir forward of the main hatch and pressure-treated pine aft. Deck beams are oak, with two 11.5 in king planks running from the bow to the main hatch. A central hatch measures 55 in long by 64.75 in wide. Behind the hatch is a small trunk cabin with a three-sided doghouse aft, with double doors leading from the doghouse to the hold. A fuel tank for the <b>push</b> <b>boat</b> is on the starboard side of the cabin. Pipe rails have been added for passenger carriage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{aim at the}} {{integrated}} rudder propeller power transmission system which is specific to the towing and tugging ship’s rudder propeller system, presented an analyzing method with ducted propeller design. Analyzed the thrust, torque, efficiency and total pressure distribution law of blade in the condition of open water work of the propeller by means of finite element method. The numerical results and the flow details are concluded and compared with published experimental data,. Results displayed in good agreement with theoretical analysis results. Initially formed a whole process of design the rudder propeller from the initial ship type parameters to prediction of propeller under open water test condition, and had a certain reference value. Instruction Ducted propeller is {{a special kind of}} propeller, China has carried out a large number of models for its experimental and theoretical research [1]. It is suitable for larger load vessels, such as tugs, <b>push</b> <b>boat</b> and so on. The advantages of ducted propeller are including that it is less affected by the changes of external sea state and can protect the propeller and improve the direction stability significantly, etc. Hence, the vessels which need freely movement, ducted propeller is often developed into a comprehensive rudder-propeller system [2, 3] in engineering ships.

5000|$|A pusher, <b>pusher</b> craft, <b>pusher</b> <b>boat,</b> <b>pusher</b> tug, or towboat, is a <b>boat</b> {{designed}} for <b>pushing</b> barges or car floats. In the United States, the industries that use these vessels {{refer to them}} as towboats. These vessels are characterized by a square bow, a shallow draft, and typically have knees, which are large plates mounted to the bow for pushing barges of various heights. These boats usually operate on rivers and inland waterways. Multiple barges lashed together, or a boat and any barges lashed to it, are referred to as a [...] "tow" [...] and can have dozens of barges. Many of these vessels, especially the long distances, or long haul boats, include living quarters for the crew.|$|R

Just to the east and downstream of this, the navigable river is crossed by a swing bridge carrying the road from the centre of Woolhampton village to the nearby village of Brimpton. Craft are warned to enter or leave the lock and pass under the open bridge in a single movement, since the current from the incoming river tends to <b>push</b> <b>boats</b> off course and there is nowhere to moor between the lock and bridge. Adjacent to this bridge is the Row Barge public house.|$|R
