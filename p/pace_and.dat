5|$|A right-arm fast bowler of express pace, Lindwall {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as the greatest pace bowler of his era and one of the finest of all time. Together with Keith Miller, Lindwall formed a new-ball pairing {{regarded as one of the}} greatest to have played cricket. Lindwall was known for his classical style, with a smooth and rhythmic run-up and textbook side-on bowling action, from which he generated his trademark outswinger which moved away late at high pace. Lindwall mixed his outswinger with a searing yorker, subtle changes of <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> an intimidating bouncer that skidded at the heads of opposing batsmen. Later in his career, Lindwall developed an inswinger, which together with his variety, <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> control made him the most feared paceman of his time. Lindwall was a fine all round cricketer; he was a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries at Test level and often improved Australia's position with his lower order batting. Lindwall's best known performance was his role in leading the Australian bowling during the 1948 tour of England under Don Bradman; the 1948 Australian team went through the tour undefeated and gained the sobriquet The Invincibles which saw it regarded as one of the finest teams in cricketing history. Lindwall's place in Australian cricket history saw him inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, Lindwall was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} a laboratory study of work preferences (ideal job demand and discretion levels) as moderators {{of the effects}} of <b>paced</b> <b>and</b> unpaced work on cognitive and affective responses. Posttest measures of cognitive performance and self-reported stress and arousal were used as outcome measures with covariance control for the corresponding pretest values. The experimental design allowed within-subjects contrasts of fast versus slow <b>pacing</b> <b>and</b> of machine-paced versus self-paced conditions. Self-paced performance compared favorably with machine-paced performance; however, individual differences in ideal demand influenced the relative speed of work under the two conditions. Work preferences also moderated relationships between <b>pacing</b> <b>and</b> outcome measures; ideal discretion moderated machine-pacing versus self-pacing effects in relation to cognitive performance and stress, and ideal demand moderated fast versus slow pacing effects in relation to arousal. These findings are discussed in relation to existing literature on <b>pacing</b> <b>and</b> on person-environment fit...|$|R
40|$|Right {{ventricular}} (RV) septal pacing {{has been}} advocated {{as an alternative}} to apical pacing to avoid long-term detrimental effects. There is conflicting evidence on the benefits of RV septal pacing. Fifty-five subjects (22 normal healthy controls, 17 with RV septal <b>pacing,</b> <b>and</b> 17 with apical pacing) were recruited. Midventricular short-axis left ventricular (LV) circumferential and radial strains were determined. Circumferential and radial strain dyssynchrony and longitudinal systolic dyssynchrony were determined. Echocardiographic determination of pacing sites were compared with electrocardiogram and chest x-ray. Septal pacing is a heterogenous group of different <b>pacing</b> sites, <b>and</b> there was only modest agreement among echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. Median pacing durations were 436 days for septal <b>pacing</b> <b>and</b> 2, 398 days for apical pacing. Mean QRS duration for apical pacing was longest, followed by septal <b>pacing</b> <b>and</b> control (...|$|R
5|$|After {{two years}} of poor {{attendance}} at ACC championship games in Tampa, Florida, organizers hoped moving the game to Charlotte, closer to the geographic center of the conference, would result in improved ticket sales. That hypothesis was borne out as early public sales approached 28,000 tickets before the participating teams were officially announced. After the announcement, each school sold its allotment of 10,000 tickets, and the more than 50,000 publicly available tickets were purchased at a rapid pace.

5|$|Alternatively, Suzanne Bergeron, for example, raises {{examples}} {{of studies that}} illustrate the multifaceted effects of globalization on women, including Kumudhini Rosa's study of Sri Lankan, Malaysian, and Philippine, workers in free trade zones {{as an example of}} local resistance to globalization. Women there use their wages to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of individualism, and alter the <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> direction of globalization itself.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his four}} matches since the MCC fixture had yielded only six wickets at 34.16, Johnson was {{selected}} in the team for the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool, the other spinner in the MCC and Worcestershire matches, had played in only one match since the MCC game, {{in which he was}} wicketless. McCool’s omission was the only change from those two matches. Bill Johnston, who bowled left arm <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> orthodox spin was included in the team at the last minute in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket, following the arrival of rain. Johnston had taken match figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively, both on rain-affected wickets.|$|E

5|$|Games {{are played}} on a {{rectangular}} court with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to {{certain areas of the}} court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold on to it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> appeal to a wider audience.|$|E
