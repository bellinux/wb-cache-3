40|$|Olive {{production}} {{is one of}} the main agricultural activities in Portugal. In the region of Trás-os-Montes this crop has been considerably affected by Prays oleae. In order to evaluate the diversity of fungi on P. oleae population of Trás-os-Montes olive orchards, larvae and pupae of the three annual generations (<b>phyllophagous,</b> antophagous and carpophagous) were collected and evaluated for fungal growth on their surface. From the 3828 larvae and pupae, a high percentage of individuals exhibited growth of a fungal agent (40. 6 %), particularly those from the <b>phyllophagous</b> generation. From all the moth generations, a total of 43 species from 24 genera were identified, but the diversity and abundance of fungal species differed between the three generations. Higher diversity was found in the carpophagous generation, followed by the antophagous and <b>phyllophagous</b> generations. The presence of fungi displaying entomopathogenic features was highest in the <b>phyllophagous</b> larvae and pupae, being B. bassiana the most abundant taxa. The first report of B. bassiana presence on P. oleae could open new strategies for the biocontrol of this major pest in olive groves, since the use of an already adapted species increases the guarantee of success of a biocontrol approach. The identification of antagonistic fungi able to control agents that cause major olive diseases, such as Verticillium dahliae, will benefit future biological control approaches for limiting this increasingly spreading pathogen.

40|$|Study on the {{parasitoid}} {{complex of}} Prays oleae (Bernard) and parasitism levels in an organic olive orchard in western Sicily (Italy). Prays oleae {{is a serious}} pest of the olive tree in the Mediterranean basin. This phytophagous infests fruits (carpophagous generation) and leaves (<b>phyllophagous</b> generation). In cases of high population densities crop losses, caused mainly by fruit drop, may be heavy. The aim of this work was to investigate on 1) parasitoid species living on P. oleae, 2) their incidence parasitoid complex, 3) parasitism levels and 4) the influence on the fruit fall. Observations were conducted in an organic olive grove near Contessa Entellina (PA) (Sicily, Italy) (37. 43. 44 N; 13. 10. 14 E, 640 m s. l. m.).

40|$|Comunicação em painelThe {{olives and}} olive oil {{production}} are important agricultural activities in Portugal. In the region of Trás-os-Montes, olive orchards are strongly affected by Prays oleae Bern., {{which is responsible for}} high losses in the olive production, as much as 40 % of the expected yield. This lepidopteran presents three generations per year (<b>phyllophagous,</b> antophagous and carpophagous) that damage the olive tree in different organs (leaves, flowers and fruits, respectively). In an attempt to identify fungi that might cause the death of olive moths, larvae and pupae of those three annual generations were collected and surveyed for natural fungal infection. After their isolation, the fungal agents were molecularly identified by sequencing the amplified internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA. In the present work, the diversity of fungal species associated to P. oleae, in several olive orchards located in Trás-os-Montes region, is discussed. The diversity and abundance of fungal species differed between all three generations. Higher diversity was found in the carpophagous generation, followed by the antophagous and <b>phyllophagous</b> generations. The use of already adapted fungal species to control one of the major pests of olive groves will increase the success of a future biocontrol strategy. In this context, the identification of fungi associated to P. oleae from olive orchards provided a pool of potential biocontrol agents. In this work, Beauveria bassiana proved to be the most promising fungus to be used as biocontrol agent against olive moth, being strongly associated to the <b>phyllophagous</b> generation. Other fungal species presenting entomopathogenic, antagonistic and phytopathogenic characteristics were also found. This work has been supported by FCT (PTDC/AGR-AAM/ 102600 / 2008) ...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that crop plants ’ induced {{resistance}} to phyllophages, {{which is due to}} accumulation of second-ary metabolites, decreases the viability of phyllophages and changes the sensitivity to entomopathogens [1]. One of the most important classes of compounds that are involved in defensive responses of deciduous plants is phenols, in particular, flavonoids and polymeric tan-nic compounds (tannins). Results of experiments show that correlation between the content of tannins and the viability of phyllophage depends primarily on the spe-cific characteristics of the insect. Today, data on the effect of tannic acid on the sensitivity of insects to viral infections are almost absent, although it {{is known that}} viruses can markedly influence the populational dynamics of many species of <b>phyllophagous</b> insects, including the gypsy mot...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{most ancient}} life style of beetles is xylomycetophagy; xylophagy and rhizo-phagy {{appeared}} in the Jurassic and flourished {{in the middle of}} Lower Cretaceous but be-fore angiosperms diversification; the same is true about carnivorous beetles living under loose bark. In the Triassic and Jurassic the most common xylophagous beetles were Cupe-didae, from Mid-Cretaceous to Eocene – Buprestidae, and later on Cerambycidae. Sper-matophagy existed from the Triassic and became common from the Upper Jurassic in tropical and subtropical regions (possible connection with bennettites). Palynophagous forms were common in the Upper Jurassic too. <b>Phyllophagous</b> beetles are unknown prior to angiosperm expansion in the Middle Cretaceous. Terrestrial carnivorous beetles ex-isted from Triassic and did not differ essentially from the Recent ones. History of water beetles is distinctive. They lived under the water for a long time but did not swim. Most of Upper Mesozoic beetles lived in upper layers of the water (bentic forms are rare). Many ecological types of Mesozoic water beetles became extinct and have no Recent analogues. Ecological diversity of beetles became close to the Recent ones only after the end of Pa-leogene...|$|E
40|$|The {{system of}} {{pheromone}} communication in insects-phyllophagous was considered {{in terms of}} its effectiveness as a communication system. A selected lepidopterous insect (Lepidoptera) was chosen for analysis of pheromone communication system. We analyzed data on 250 species of insects from three families – Lasiocampidae, Geometridae, Lymantriidae. Specificity of the chemical composition of the complex pheromones and pheromone component count was assessed for all of these females. Characteristics of complexes of insect pheromones and possible female strategies of behavior were modeled using the methods of information theory, utility theory and game theory. We estimated complementarity for various types of chemical compounds in pheromone composition. The uniqueness of the pheromone signal of separate species of Lepidoptera is achieved by using a multi-component pheromone. There are no hard links between existence or absence of individual components in multi-component pheromones. The model was proposed for explanation of regularities of pheromone composition. Nonmonotonic of relative frequency of insect species curve with different number of components can be explained in terms of a trade-off between increasing the efficiency of males seeking females of the same species with an increasing number of individual components and the complexity of the synthesis of pheromones multi-component pheromones. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the validity of the model description. Possible mechanisms of pheromone signal amplification studied were associated with the aggregation {{of a large number of}} individuals in a limited area. If females in the process of attracting individuals of the opposite sex are aggregated, then the source of pheromones is not a private individual, but a group of females, and the intensity of the flow of the group of molecules is defined as the intensity of pheromone release pheromones individual animals and the number of females in the cluster. The analogy game-theoretic problem «Prisoner's dilemma» use for evaluating of the effectiveness of the group strategy to attract for the simplest case, which dealt with two players – the females capable of generating pheromone. The proposed approach allows evaluation of the reliability of the pheromone communication system in insects – <b>phyllophagous...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of foraging ants on the insect fauna within {{the canopy of}} the tree species Terminalia sericea, Burkea africana and Ochna pulchra was studied {{in an area of}} typical South African savanna, over a two year period. The number of individual insects and their species composition was compared on unbanded, ant-infested plants and on banded plants where ants had been excluded. Differences in the level of herbivory recorded on banded and unbanded trees were related to the guild composition of insects within the canopy, and the results are discussed in terms of plant protection as a consequence of ant - insect interactions. Twenty-six ant species were recorded on the study trees at Nylsvley, with individuals belonging to the genus Crematogaster being numerically abundant and dominant within the canopy of each species of tree. These dominant ant species influenced the insect fauna by their strong dependence on honeydew, encouraging a build up in numbers of Homoptera on the branches and leaves of foraged trees, and supporting homopterous populations within the confines of their nest compartments. The exclusion of ants from trees led to fewer "mobile" homopterans (Aphididae, Membracidae, Psyllidae and Cicadellidae) and "sessile" homopterans (mainly Coccidae but also Pseudococcidae). Pyrethrum spraying showed that the guild composition of non-homopterous insects was similar on banded and unbanded trees. Differences in the level of herbivory on banded and unbanded trees suggested that, although slight, foraged trees were protected from some damage by the presence of ant species within the canopy. A trend did exist towards a greater number of insect individuals and species on unbanded trees, and it is postulated that during the period 1982 1984 when drought conditions prevailed over Nylsvley, ants do not reduce insect numbers through predation or disturbance but simply deter <b>phyllophagous</b> feeding. A separate experiment showed that Crematogaster constructor would feed on the eggs and early instar larvae of the saturnid moth, Cirina forda, but low numbers of lepidopterous larvae on the trees may have forced ants to seek honeydew. The negative impact of large homopterous populations on foraged trees was only seen in an isolated field observation where Polyrachis schistacea was found to associate with the lac insect Tachardina sp.. In conclusion {{it can be said that}} where homopterans are not the dominant phyllophages, plants do benefit from foraging populations of ants in that damage to the leaves is reduced...|$|E
