50|$|The {{concept is}} {{analogous}} to financial portfolio management, but there are significant differences. Financial <b>portfolio</b> <b>assets</b> typically have consistent measurement information (enabling accurate and objective comparisons), and this is {{at the base of}} the concept’s usefulness in application to IT. However, achieving such universality of measurement is going to take considerable effort in the IT industry (see, for example, Val IT). IT investments are not liquid, like stocks and bonds (although investment portfolios may also include illiquid assets), and are measured using both financial and non-financial yardsticks (for example, a balanced scorecard approach); a purely financial view is not sufficient. Finally, assets in an IT portfolio have a functional relationship to the organization, such as an inventory management system for logistics or a human resources system for tracking employees' time. This {{is analogous to}} a vertically integrated company which may own an oil field, a refinery, and retail gas stations.|$|E
40|$|By {{utilizing}} a unique dataset and employing {{a variant of}} gravity models, we find strong evidence {{for the presence of}} complementarities among bank loans, short- and long-term debts, and portfolio equity holdings. The complementarities can be partially explained by common factors of standard gravity models such as economy size, state of economic development, and information cost proxies (such as distance), as well as bilateral trade in goods. However, we find an additional direct channel of complementarities among financial asset holdings that cannot be explained by these gravity factors. The complementarities are also robust to the consideration of unobserved fixed effects of both source and destination countries. We find evidence that the sequential reinforcing impact of bank lending on <b>portfolio</b> <b>asset</b> holdings is greater than the impact of <b>portfolio</b> <b>asset</b> holdings on bank lending. We also find that bank loans lead to subsequent <b>portfolio</b> <b>asset</b> holdings by partially alleviating information frictions. However, the role of portfolio investment seems to be independent from the information channel. The mutual reinforcement effect among cross-border asset holdings is stronger in destination countries with better quality of institutions. Overall our findings suggest that, while there may exist pecking order of cross-border investment due to differing sensitivity of capital flows to various costs and frictions, once a country receives a form of cross-border investment, this tends to induce other forms of investment and thus a deeper and more balanced financial integration.

40|$|The {{performance}} of an optimal-weighted portfolio strategy is evaluated when transaction costs are penalized {{compared to an}} equal-weighted portfolio strategy. The optimal allocation weights are found by maximizing a modified Sharpe ratio measure each trading day, where modified refers to the expected return of an asset in this context. The leverage of the investment is determined by a conditional expectation estimate {{of the number of}} <b>portfolio</b> <b>assets</b> of the next-coming day. A moving window is used to historically measure the transition probabilities of moving from one state to another within this stochastic count process and this is used as an input to the estimator. It is found that the most accurate estimate is the actual trading day’s number of <b>portfolio</b> <b>assets</b> and this is obtained when the size of the moving window is one. Increasing the penalty parameter on transaction costs of selling and buying assets between trading days lowers the aggregated transaction cost and increases the {{performance of}} the optimal-weighted portfolio considerably. The best portfolio performance is obtained when at least 50 % of the capital is invested equally among the assets when maximizing the modified Sharpe ratio. The optimal-weighted and equal-weighted portfolios are constructed on a daily basis, where the allowed VaR 0 : 05 is € 300 000 for each portfolio. This sets the limit on the amount of capital allowed to be invested each trading day, and is determined by empirical VaR 0 : 05 simulations of these two portfolios...|$|E

40|$|Many {{optimization}} problems involve parameters {{which are}} not known in advance, but can only be forecast or estimated. Such problems fit perfectly into the framework of Robust Optimization that, given optimization problems with uncertain parameters, looks for solutions that will achieve good objective function values for the realization of these parameters in given uncertainty sets. Aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate and compare alternative forms of robustness in the context of <b>portfolio</b> <b>asset</b> allocation. Starting with a relaxed form of robustness, which allows one to specify not only the values of the uncertainty parameters, but also their degree of feasibility, in the first part of the paper we propose a family of relaxed robust models, called norm-portfolio models, which use general norms to relax the classical notion of robustness. Then, in the second part we test some norm-portfolio models, as well as various robust strategies from the literature, with real market data on different data sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at comparing robust strategies of different kinds in the framework of <b>portfolio</b> <b>asset</b> allocation...|$|R

For Gaussian assets the measure is a logarithmic function of the variance and combining independent Gaussian assets of equal variance adds an amount to the diversification. The advantages of this measure include that it naturally extends to any type of distribution and that it takes all moments into account. Furthermore, it can be used in cases of undefined weights (zero-cost assets) or moments. We present examples which apply this measure to derivative overlays. ...|$|R
