5000|$|The {{cartridge}} {{used in the}} Borchardt C-93 Pistol was {{the basis}} for the <b>primary</b> <b>cartridge</b> used in the Mauser C96 pistol (7.63×25mm Mauser); they have the same dimensions, but the 7.63 mm Mauser generally had a more powerful powder charge (contemporary loading data indicated it took approximately 20% more powder than the Borchardt) and is considered to be too strong to be used in a Borchardt C-93. Nonetheless, cartridge boxes from some manufacturers were marked [...] "For Borchardt and Mauser Automatic Pistols." ...|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the standard 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 Winchester) cartridge in the 1950s, standard military cartridges were the [...]30-06 Springfield or 7.62×63mm (United States), [...]303 British (7.7×56mmR) (United Kingdom) and 7.92×57mm (8mm Mauser Germany). The [...]30-06 Springfield continued in service with U.S. Marine Corps snipers during the Vietnam War in the 1970s, well after general adoption of the 7.62×51mm. At the present time, in both the Western world and within NATO, 7.62×51mm is currently the <b>primary</b> <b>cartridge</b> of choice for military and police sniper rifles.|$|E
50|$|A rack can {{release a}} store via gravity or by ejection. Ejection {{utilizes}} an impulse cartridge, a pyrotechnic device which provides jettison capability by igniting and supplying an ejection force to safely propel a store {{away from the}} rack and aircraft. Some racks contain an auxiliary cartridge {{in the event that}} the <b>primary</b> <b>cartridges</b> fail to fire. The rack will also have accessories such as a Zero Retention Force Arming Unit, a solenoid to pull arming wires from fuzes, ports for data, video or electrical fuzing. The MIL-STD-1760 Aircraft/Store Electrical Interconnection System defines a standardized electrical interface between a military aircraft and its carriage stores.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]30-06 Springfield {{cartridge}} (pronounced “thirty-aught-six”, [...] "thirty-oh-six") or 7.62×63mm in metric notation, {{was introduced}} to the United States Army in 1906 (hence “06”) and standardized, used until the 1960s and early 1970s. It replaced the [...]30-03, 6 mm Lee Navy and [...]30 US Army (also called [...]30-40 Krag). The [...]30-06 remained the US Army's <b>primary</b> rifle <b>cartridge</b> for nearly 50 years before it was finally replaced by the 7.62×51mm NATO (commercial [...]308 Winchester) and 5.56×45mm NATO (commercial [...]223 Remington), both of which remain in current U.S. and NATO service. It remains a very popular sporting round, with ammunition produced by all major manufacturers.|$|R
5000|$|In {{most moving}} magnet designs, the stylus itself is {{detachable}} {{from the rest}} of the cartridge so it can easily be replaced. There are three <b>primary</b> types of <b>cartridge</b> mounts. The most common type is attached using two small screws to a headshell which then plugs into the tonearm, while another is a standardized [...] "P-mount" [...] or [...] "T4P" [...] cartridge (invented by Technics in 1980 and adopted by other manufacturers) that plugs directly into the tonearm. Many P-mount cartridges come with adapters to allow them to be mounted to a headshell. The third type is used mainly in cartridges designed for DJ use and it has a standard round headshell connector. Some mass market turntables use a proprietary integrated cartridge which cannot be upgraded.|$|R
5000|$|Olin formed Western Cartridge Company in 1898 to {{manufacture}} sporting rifle powder and shotgun shells for settlers of the Great Plains. The shotgun shells used primers manufactured by larger eastern ammunition firms. When the firms with primer manufacturing facilities raised primer prices in 1900 to reduce competition from independent shotgun shell assembly plants, Western Cartridge Company formed the Union Cap and Chemical Company (UCC) as {{a joint venture}} with Austin Cartridge Company of Ohio. UCC manufactured primers, blasting caps, and [...]22 and [...]32 caliber rimfire cartridges at East Alton. Similar manufacturing procedures for these products included fabrication of sheet metal cups and filling portions of those cups with <b>primary</b> explosive. Rimfire <b>cartridges</b> bore a UCC headstamp and product packaging included a Maltese cross trademark. Purchase of Alliance Cartridge Company in 1907 allowed UCC merger into Western Cartridge Company. The company trademark morphed into Super-X as the Maltese cross became associated with World War I Germany.|$|R
40|$|Inkjet ink {{analysis}} {{is the best}} way to discriminate between printed documents, or even though more difficult, to connect an inkjet printed document with a brand or model of printers. Raman spectroscopy and laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for dyes and pigments analysis, which are ink components. The aim of this work is to evaluate the aforementioned techniques for inkjet inks analysis in terms of discriminating power, information quality, and nondestructive capability. So, we investigated 10 different inkjet ink <b>cartridges</b> (<b>primary</b> colors and black), 7 from the HP manufacturer and one each from Epson, Canon and Lexmark. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of three methods: Raman spectroscopy, LDMS and MALDI-MS. Raman spectroscopy, as it is preferable to try the nondestructive approach first, is successfully adapted to the analysis of color printed documents in most cases. For analysis of color inkjet inks by LDMS, we show that a MALDI matrix (9 - aminoacridine, 9 AA) is needed to desorb and to ionize dyes from most inkjet inks (except Epson inks). Therefore, a method was developed to apply the 9 AA MALDI matrix directly onto the piece of paper while avoiding analyte spreading. The obtained mass spectra are very discriminating and lead to information about ink additives and paper compositions. Discrimination of black inkjet printed documents is more difficult because of the common use of carbon black as the principal pigment. We show for the first time the possibility to discriminate between two black-printed documents coming from different, as well as from the same, manufacturers. Mass spectra recorded from black inks in positive ion mode LDMS detect polyethylene glycol polymers which have characteristic mass distributions and end groups. Moreover, software has been developed for rapid and objective comparison of the low mass range of these positive mode LDMS spectra which have characteristic unknown peaks. Peer reviewe...|$|R
