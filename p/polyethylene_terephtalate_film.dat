The analysis of the present situation reveals a gap for low sheet resistance electrodes. Two new approaches to the problem will be presented. The first one is a novel technology for the deposition of zinc oxide on <b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephtalate</b> <b>film.</b> The intention for this process is {{the establishment of a}} low cost coating in a roll-to-roll machine. Silicon was used as the dopant material with a concentration varying in different samples between 1 and 4 %. The optimum parameters provided a transparent layer with a sheet resistance of 16 Ωsqu. Metal grids are a second promising approach for achieving low sheet resistance electrodes. The combination of these grids with transparent conducting oxides (TCO) will be presented. The TCO were deposited under vacuum in a roll-to-roll coating machine. The grids were applied by aerosol jet printing and subsequent tempering of the film...|$|E
40|$|Transparent {{electrodes}} are {{an important}} component for various thin film devices. The paper will present a review of present solutions covering single layer conducting oxides as well as composite technologies. Special emphasis will {{be put on the}} mechanical stability of the electrode on plastic film. Conventional indium tin oxide (ITO) layers break at a stretching of 1 - 2 %. The mechanical sensitivity of the samples increases with increasing thickness. This requires new solutions for low sheet resistance electrodes on flexible substrates. A novel cost effective technology for the deposition of zinc oxide on <b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephtalate</b> <b>film</b> is presented. The deposition was performed in a roll-to-roll coating machine at low substrate temperature. Silicon was used as the dopant material with a concentration varying in different samples between 1 and 4 %. The optimum parameters provided a transparent layer with a sheet resistance of 16 ? sq. The carrier density and the mobility were determined by Hall measurements. They amounted to 8. 8 cm² V- 1 s- 1 and 2. 5 x 1020 cm- 3, respectively. These values are a promising starting point for the deposition on heat sensitive substrates...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) concentration on the peel strengthof an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) {{has been studied}} as a functionof the adhesive thickness. Different amounts of PVP (2 - 30 % w/w) were mixed thoroughly with an acrylic PSA. Films with different thicknesses (10, 40, and 70 μm) were prepared by casting the formulation on a <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephtalate)</b> <b>film.</b> Peel tests were carried out by adhesive-coated tapes of 25 mm width on the stainless steel substrate at least for three samples. The samples were investigated by Fourier trans-mittance infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technique and surface tension and viscoelas-tic properties measurements. The peel strength values are directly dependent on the thickness of adhesive. Also, results showed that due to the polar part of blend in 2 %w/w PVP, the peel strength has the maximum value. At higher concentrations of PVP, due to its surface migration, reduction in peel strength was more pronounced. The parallel investigations on the viscoelastic properties of blends showed that the storage modulus shifts to higher values at higher concentrations of PVP. Therefore, the bonding step becomes difficult and the peel strength decreases significantly...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the use of PET (<b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephtalate)</b> <b>films</b> as a modern development of Cholodny’s glass slides, to enable microscopy and molecular-based analysis of soil communities where spatial detail at the scale of microbial habitats is essential to understand microbial associations and interactions in this complex environment. Methods. Classical microbiological methods; attachment assay; surface tension measurements; molecular techniques: DNA extraction, PCR; confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM); micro-focus X-ray computed tomography (µCT). Results. We first show, using the model soil and rhizosphere bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25 and P. putida KT 2440, that bacteria are able to attach and detach from PET films, and that pre-conditioning with a filtered soil suspension improved the levels of attachment. Bacteria attached to the films were viable and could develop substantial biofilms. PET films buried in soil were rapidly colonised by microorganisms which could be investigated by CLSM and recovered onto agar plates. Secondly, we demonstrate that µCT can be used to non-destructively visualise soil aggregate contact points and pore spaces across the surface of PET films buried in soil. Conclusions. PET films are a successful development of Cholodny’s glass slides and can be used to sample soil communities in which bacterial adherence, growth, biofilm and community development can be investigated. The use of these films with µCT imaging in soil will enable a better understanding of soil micro-habitats and the spatially-explicit nature of microbial interactions in this complex environment...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSingle nanoconstriction per {{magnetic}} wire is obtained by bi-conical track etching and electrodeposition. Magnetoresistance measurements at various angles result in irreversible jumps. Resulting jumps of magnetization {{have been attributed}} to the pinning and depinning of a constrained magnetic domain wall. a b s t r a c t In a cylindrical magnetic nanowire, a magnetic domain wall (DW) can move along the wire when an applied magnetic field or a spin-polarized current is applied.

40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} (ES) {{is a novel}} {{approach to}} osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Even though ES has been acknowledged as a treatment method for bone fractures already for two decades, it has gained more interest {{in the field of}} bone tissue engineering only for a few years. Therefore, also research of electroconductive scaffold materials is increasing in order to find an optimal osteogenic material to combine with the effect of ES. Polypyrrole (PPy) is a conductive biomaterial which is biocompatible with various cell lines and therefore a considerable option for mediating the electric current (EC) for MSCs. The combined effect of ES and PPy on MCSs could provide an alternative method for drugs and cytokines used in bone tissue engineering. PPy was synthesized electrochemically on top of a gold-coated <b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephtalate</b> (PET) <b>film.</b> Adipose-derived MSCs, adipose stem cells (ASCs), were exposed to ES for 4 hours a day during 14 days at amplitude of ± 0. 2 V. There were 3 different stimulation groups to compare: a group with no stimulation (control) and groups with the frequency of 1 Hz and 100 Hz. In addition, two different PPy dopants were compared: hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulphate (CS). Groups were also divided into osteogenic differentiation medium (OM) and basal medium (BM). In order to determine the viability, proliferation and differentiation of the cells, Live/Dead staining, DNA detection and alkaline phosphatase assays were used, respectively, at days 7 and 14 {{from the beginning of the}} stimulation. PPy showed good biocompatibility with CS doped PPy (CS-PPy) in the viability examination in both media and in all of the stimulation groups, whereas ASCs on HA doped PPy (HA-PPy) formed clusters. Stimulation groups did not show any differences; however, a trend could be seen in the proliferation of CS-PPy in osteogenic medium (OM). CS-PPy showed significantly higher effect on proliferation, whereas HA-PPy supported on differentiation. CS-PPy coatings seem to offer a suitable conductive surface for ASCs in osteogenic applications. /Kir 1...|$|R

40|$|Potassium sorbate {{inhibited}} {{the growth}} of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) through a mechanism of uncompetitive inhibition. Heating decreased the antimicrobial effect of potassium sorbate {{in a manner consistent}} with the Arrhenius relationship in terms of temperature, while heating time inactivated it by first order kinetics. Therefore, thermal processing of foods containing potassium sorbate may reduce antimicrobial activity and cause microbial spoilage of the food products. ^ The diffusivity and diffusion profile of potassium sorbate in plastic films and cheese were determined both experimentally and using mathematical models and computer simulations. Low density polyethylene (LDPE) had the lowest diffusivity among common commercial plastic films. The results of diffusion tests suggested that the LDPE film is good as a reservoir layer for releasing the preservative. The other common films, such as high density polyethylene, polypropylene and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephtalate,</b> are good <b>films</b> for use as control layers for slow release or barrier layers. An overall diffusion model for the preservative release in a plastic film/cheese packaging system was suggested and simulated by computer programming for predicting the shelf-life of cheese. ^ The tensile strength of a LDPE film was not changed by the addition of potassium sorbate into the film. These results can be explained by a model of the polymer structure which assumes that the huge amorphous regions of the polymer incorporated the small potassium sorbate molecules. However, the transparency of the film, an optical property, was reduced due to the incorporation of potassium sorbate. A migration test of the preservative-releasing LDPE sheet showed good fit with model simulations, and was used in determining the diffusivity of potassium sorbate from the LDPE sheet to water. ^ The LDPE film containing potassium sorbate released its preservative and inhibited the yeast growth on agar plates. Therefore, it is possible that the antimicrobial polymer could prevent microbial spoilage of food products and prolong the shelf life of the products when it is used as a packaging material during food packaging. ...|$|R

The biodegradable polyesters used were poly(butylene succinate), poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate), poly(ε-caprolactone), poly(butylene succinate / terephthalate), and poly(L-lactic acid). Petrochemical plastics, low-density <b>polyethylene</b> and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephtalate,</b> {{were used for}} comparison. The target HOCs were biphenyl, bisphenol-A, dibenzofuran, diethylstilbestrol, nonyl-phenol, and chlorophenols. The treatment of the HOC solutions {{with each of the}} biodegradable polyesters resulted in the nearly complete removal of the chemicals by sorption from the aqueous phase, except for the case of poly(L-lactic acid). Low-density polyethylene adsorbed biphenyl and dibenzofuran selectively, and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephtalate</b> did not adsorb any of the HOCs. The adsorptive interaction between the plastics and the HOCs might be related to both the glass transition temperature of the former {{and the nature of the}} latter as defined by the Fujita's inorganicity/organicity ratio.

Besides diffusion, the molecule’s solubility contributes largely to the overall permeation process. This study presents a method to calculate solubility coefficients of gases such as O 2, H 2 O (vapor), N 2, and CO 2 in polymeric matrices from simulation methods (Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo) using first principle predictions.
