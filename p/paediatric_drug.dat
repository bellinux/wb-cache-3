40|$|Background: Drug {{development}} for rare diseases is challenging, especially when these orphan drugs (OD) {{are intended for}} children. In 2007 the EU <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Drug</b> Regulation was enacted to improve the development of high quality and ethically researched medicines for children through the establishment of Paediatric Investigation Plans (PIPs). The effect of the EU <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Drug</b> Regulation on the marketing authorisation (MA) of drugs for children with rare diseases was studied. Methods: Data on all designated orphan drugs, their indication, MA, PIPs and indication group (adult or child) {{were obtained from the}} European Medicines Agency (EMA). The outcome and duration of the process from orphan drug designation (ODD) to MA, was compared, per indication, by age group. The effect of the <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Drug</b> Regulation, implemented in 2007, on the application process was assessed with survival analysis. Results: Eighty-one orphan drugs obtained MA since 2000 and half are authorised for (a subgroup of) children; another 34 are currently undergoing further investigations in children through agreed PIPs. The <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Drug</b> Regulation did not significantly increase the number of ODDs with potential paediatric indications (58 % before vs 64 % after 2007 of ODDs, p = 0. 1) and did not lead to more MAs for ODs with paediatric indications (60 % vs 43 %, p = 0. 22). ODs authorised after 2007 had a longer time to MA than those authorised before 2007 (Hazard ratio (95 % CI) 2. 80 (1. 84 - 4. 28), p < 0. 001); potential paediatric use did not influence the time to MA (Hazard ratio (95 % CI) 1. 14 (0. 77 - 1. 70), p = 0. 52). Conclusions: The EU <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Drug</b> Regulation had a minor impact on development and availability of ODs for children, was associated with a longer time to MA, but ensured the further paediatric development of drugs still off-label to children. The impact of the <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Drug</b> Regulation on research quantity and quality in children through PIPs is not yet clea...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is now greater {{involvement}} {{of children in}} drug trials to ensure that paediatric medicines are supported by sound scientific evidence. The safety of the participating children is of paramount importance. Previous research shows that these children can suffer moderate and severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials, yet {{very few of the}} trials designated a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) to oversee the trial. Methods: Safety data from a systematic review of <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2007 were analysed. All reported adverse events (AEs) were classified and assessed to determine whether an ADR had been experienced. ADRs were then categorised according to severity. Each trial report was examined as to whether an independent DSMB was in place. Results: Of the 582 <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> RCTs analysed, 210 (36...|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies to show {{that many of the}} medicines used in children are used off-label or are unlicensed for use in children. When children are prescribed unlicensed and off-label medications, some people may see them as unknowing participants in informal and uncontrolled experiments. However, the licensing status of a drug {{can be seen as a}} by-product of the real issues: the safety, efficacy and quality of these medicines in the current licensing system. It is important to conduct research in order to provide high quality data regarding safety and efficacy to support evidence-based paediatric prescribing. Clinical trials will always be an invaluable means of acquiring vital information about a drug; but when it comes to children, we may find that these trials are not always practical for technical, ethical and financial reasons; therefore, it is important to explore other methodologies in paediatric medicines research. Pharmacoepidemiological and prospective cohort studies could provide vital safety and efficacy data on paediatric medicines; however, resources need to be invested in the methodological research. <b>Paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> formulation research is under-resourced and under-valued, and, unfortunately, fatal and serious adverse reactions due to inappropriate formulations have been reported in many instances. Paediatric medication is a complex problem; we need to use all available tools for research on safety, efficacy and formulation. The reason for lack of progress in <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> research is most likely due to lack of resources and research capacity. The industry and government should work together and invest more money in <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> research. Finally, regulatory authorities, healthcare professionals and academics need to rethink the research strategy in order to provide better medicines for children. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This {{preliminary}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the microbiological quality of <b>paediatric</b> oral liquid <b>drug</b> formulations during consumption. Paracetamol, Salbutamol, Cephalexin, Amoxicillin and Lactulose are few oral liquid medicines prescribed in Sri Lanka. These oral liquid medicines are at a greater risk of microbial contamination during consumption. This can lead to co-infection in paediatric patients. Therefore, it is important to evaluate microbial quality of oral liquid medicines during consumption. In methodology, organoleptic examination, pH determination and assessment of microbiological quality of two bottles from each five commercially available samples were done. Selective media were employed for quantification and isolation of the microbial contaminants. Quantification of viable microbial colonies was expressed as colony forming units per mililitre (cfu/ml). These procedures were conducted in duplicates at each consumption day and cfu/ml was expressed as a mean. All liquid drug formulations had < 1000 cfu/ml bacteria during the consumption period except Lactulose, which had 12733 cfu/ml bacteria during the last consumption day. In conclusion, this study has revealed that the good microbial quality of <b>paediatric</b> oral liquid <b>drug</b> formulations should be maintained during consumption period.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the prescription rate of respiratory drugs (ATC code R 03) in an Italian community setting and {{to estimate the}} extent of off-label use by both age and indication. METHODS: A cohort study aimed at evaluating prescriptions of drugs with ATC code R 03 was conducted for the period 2002 - 2006. Data source was the PEDIANET Database. RESULTS: Ninety percent of R 03 prescriptions are covered by 11 active substances or combinations, corresponding to 67 medicinal products. Inhaled corticosteroids are the most prescribed anti-asthmatic agents, followed by short-acting beta 2 mimetics. The mean off-label rate is 19 and 56 %, by age and indication respectively. The majority of off-label uses is among {{children under the age}} of 2. Five active substances are used at dosages not supported by adequate dose-finding studies. CONCLUSION: In Italy, many respiratory drugs are approved for the treatment of paediatric respiratory diseases, but a remarkable percentage of their prescriptions is off-label. This pharmaco-utilization study demonstrates that there is a need to perform clinical studies aimed at increasing the current knowledge on marketed <b>paediatric</b> <b>drugs,</b> and to revise and re-label the existing regulatory documents to reduce their off-label uses...|$|R
40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} (M&S) -based {{approaches have}} been proposed to support <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> development in order to design and analyze clinical studies efficiently. Development of anti-cancer drugs in the paediatric population is particularly challenging due to ethical and practical constraints. We aimed to review the application of M&S {{in the development of}} anti-cancer drugs in the paediatric population, and to identify where M&S-based approaches could provide additional support in <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> development of anti-cancer drugs. A structured literature search on PubMed was performed. The majority of identified M&S-based studies aimed to use population PK modelling approaches to identify determinants of inter-individual variability, in order to optimize dosing regimens and to develop therapeutic drug monitoring strategies. Prospective applications of M&S approaches for PK-bridging studies have scarcely been reported for paediatric oncology. Based on recent developments of M&S in drug development there are several opportunities where M&S could support more informative bridging between children and adults, and increase efficiency of the design and analysis of paediatric clinical trials, which should ultimately lead to further optimization of drug treatment strategies in this populatio...|$|E
40|$|An {{urgent need}} remains for new {{paediatric}} oncology drugs to cure children who die from cancer {{and to reduce}} drug-related sequelae in survivors. In 2007, the European Paediatric Regulation came into law requiring industry to create <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> (all types of medicinal products) development programmes alongside those for adults. Unfortunately, <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> development is still largely centred on adult conditions and not a mechanism of action (MoA) -based model, even though this would be more logical for childhood tumours as these have much fewer non-synonymous coding mutations than adult malignancies. Recent large-scale sequencing by International Genome Consortium and Paediatric Cancer Genome Project has further shown that the genetic and epigenetic repertoire of driver mutations in specific childhood malignancies differs from more common adult-type malignancies. To bring about much needed change, a Paediatric Platform, ACCELERATE, was proposed in 2013 by the Cancer Drug Development Forum, Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer, the European Network for Cancer Research in Children and Adolescents and the European Society for Paediatric Oncology. The Platform, comprising multiple stakeholders in paediatric oncology, has three working groups, one with responsibility for promoting and developing high-quality MoA-informed <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> development programmes, including specific measures for adolescents. Key is {{the establishment of a}} freely accessible aggregated database of paediatric biological tumour drug targets to be aligned with an aggregated pipeline of drugs. This will enable prioritisation and conduct of early phase clinical paediatric trials to evaluate these drugs against promising therapeutic targets and to generate clinical paediatric efficacy and safety data in an accelerated time frame. Through this work, the Platform seeks to ensure that potentially effective drugs, where the MoA is known and thought to be relevant to paediatric malignancies, are evaluated in early phase clinical trials, and that this approach to generate pre-clinical and clinical data is systematically pursued by academia, sponsors, industry, and regulatory bodies to bring new paediatric oncology drugs to front-line therapy more rapidl...|$|E

The aim of this review is to highlight the advantages and limitations of modelling and simulation (M&S) in supporting decision making during <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> development. Methods A literature search on Pubmedâ€™s database Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) has been performed to retrieve relevant publications on the use of model-based approaches in <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> development and therapeutics.

It has been widely used {{in the last two decades}} to support pre-clinical and early clinical drug development. In fact, M&S have been applied to drug development as decision tools, as study optimization tools and as data analysis tools. In particular, this approach can be used to support dose adjustment in specific subgroups of a population. M&S may therefore allow the individualisation of drug therapy in children, improving the riskâ€“benefit ratio in this population...|$|E

40|$|Objective of {{the study}} To {{determine}} the extent and nature of unlicensed/off-label prescribing patterns in hospitalised children in Palestine. Setting Four paediatric wards in two public health system hospitals in Palestine [Caritas childrenâ€™s hospital (Medical and neonatal intensive care units) and Rafidia general hospital (Medical and surgical units) ]. Method A prospective survey of drugs administered to infants and children < 18 years old was carried out over a five-week period in the four paediatric wards. Main outcome measure Drug-licensing status of all prescriptions was determined according to the Palestinian Registered Product List and the Physicianâ€™s Desk Reference. Results Overall, 917 drug prescriptions were administered to 387 children. Of all drug prescriptions, 528 (57. 5 %) were licensed for use in children; 65 (7. 1 %) were unlicensed; and 324 (35. 3 %) were used off-label. Of all children, 49. 6 % received off-label prescriptions, 10. 1 % received unlicensed medications and 8. 2 % received both. Seventy-two percent of off-label drugs and 66 % of unlicensed drugs were prescribed for children < 2 years.

40|$|AbstractSeven {{years after}} {{the launch of the}} European Paediatric Medicine Regulation, limited {{progress}} in <b>paediatric</b> oncology <b>drug</b> development remains a major concern amongst stakeholders â€“ academics, industry, regulatory authorities, parents, patients and caregivers. Restricted increases in early phase paediatric oncology trials, legal requirements and regulatory pressure to propose early Paediatric Investigation Plans (PIPs), missed opportunities to explore new drugs potentially relevant for paediatric malignancies, lack of innovative trial designs and no new incentives to develop <b>drugs</b> against specific <b>paediatric</b> targets are some unmet needs. Better access to new anti-cancer <b>drugs</b> for <b>paediatric</b> clinical studies and improved collaboration between stakeholders are essential. The Cancer Drug Development Forum (CDDF), previously Biotherapy Development Association (BDA), with Innovative Therapy for Children with Cancer Consortium (ITCC), European Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOPE) and European Network for Cancer Research in Children and Adolescents (ENCCA) has created a unique Paediatric Oncology Platform, involving multiple stakeholders and the European Union (EU) Commission, with an urgent remit to improve <b>paediatric</b> oncology <b>drug</b> development. The <b>Paediatric</b> Oncology Platform proposes to recommend immediate changes in the implementation of the Regulation and set the framework for its 2017 revision; initiatives to incentivise drug development against specific paediatric oncology targets, and repositioning of drugs not developed in adults. Underpinning these changes is a strategy for mechanism of action and biology driven selection and prioritisation of potential paediatric indications rather than the current process based on adult cancer indications. Pre-competitive research and drug prioritisation, early portfolio evaluation, cross-industry cooperation and multi-compound/sponsor trials are being explored, from which guidance for innovative trial designs will be provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of licensed paediatric drugs is lagging behind those for adults, {{and there is}} a lack of safe formulations in suitable doses that children are able and willing to take. As a consequence, children are commonly treated with off-label or unlicensed drugs. As off-label and unlicensed drug use are associated with a greater risk for harm than on-label drug use, a range of global initiatives have been developed to realize "better" medicines for children. This review describes the challenges and achievements of the European Union to realize this goal, with a focus on <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> development and formulation design. In 2007, a European Paediatric Regulation was installed enforcing companies to consider children in the early development of drugs with a new drug substance, for a new indication or with a new route of administration. The Regulation, e. g. requires companies to develop a paediatric investigation plan discussing the proposed clinical trials in children of different ages and the formulations for future marketing. Since 2013, the pharmaceutical design of any newly marketed <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> should comply with the "Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Development of Medicines for Paediatric Use. " Companies should, e. g. justify the route of administration, dosage form, formulation characteristics, safety of excipients, dosing frequency, container closure system, administration device, patient acceptability and user information. In this review, the guideline's key aspects are discussed with a focus on novel formulations such as mini-tablets and orodispersible films, excipients with a potential risk for harm such as azo dyes and adequate user instructions...|$|E
40|$|Objective When {{developing}} new medicines for children, {{the potential to}} extrapolate from adult data to reduce the experimental burden in children is well recognised. However, significant assumptions about the similarity of adults and children are needed for extrapolations to be biologically plausible. We reviewed the literature to identify statistical methods {{that could be used}} to optimise extrapolations in <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> development programmes. Methods Web of Science was used to identify papers proposing methods relevant for using data from a â€˜source populationâ€™ to support inferences for a â€˜target populationâ€™. Four key areas of methods development were targeted: paediatric clinical trials, trials extrapolating efficacy across ethnic groups or geographic regions, the use of historical data in contemporary clinical trials and using short-term endpoints to support inferences about long-term outcomes. Results Searches identified 626 papers of which 52 met our inclusion criteria. From these we identified 102 methods comprising 58 Bayesian and 44 frequentist approaches. Most Bayesian methods (n = 54) sought to use existing data in the source population to create an informative prior distribution for a future clinical trial. Of these, 46 allowed the source data to be down-weighted to account for potential differences between populations. Bayesian and frequentist versions of methods were found for assessing whether key parameters of source and target populations are commensurate (n = 34). Fourteen frequentist methods synthesised data from different populations using a joint model or a weighted test statistic. Conclusions Several methods were identified as potentially applicable to <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> development. Methods which can accommodate a heterogeneous target population and which allow data from a source population to be down-weighted are preferred. Methods assessing the commensurability of parameters may be used to determine whether it is appropriate to pool data across age groups to estimate treatment effects...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChildren deserve {{medicines}} {{that are}} adapted to their needs. The {{need to include}} children in drug development has been recognised increasingly {{over the past few}} decades.

40|$|AIM: Lamivudine is used {{as first}} line therapy in HIV-infected children. Yet, like many other <b>paediatric</b> <b>drugs,</b> its dose {{rationale}} {{has been based on}} limited clinical data, without thorough understanding of the effects of growth on drug disposition. Here we use lamivudine to show how a comprehensive population pharmacokinetic model can account for the influence of demographic covariates on exposure (i. e. AUC and Cmax). METHODS: Data from three paediatric trials were used to describe the pharmacokinetics across the overall population. Modelling was based on a non-linear mixed effects approach. A stepwise procedure was used for covariate model building. RESULTS: A one compartment model with first order elimination best described the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine in children. The effect of weight on clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) was characterized by an exponential function, with exponents of 0. 705 and 0. 635, respectively. For a child with median body weight (17. 6 kg), CL and V were 16. 5 (95 % CI 15. 2, 17. 7) l h(-) (1) and 46. 0 (95 % CI 42. 4, 49. 5) l, respectively. There were no differences between formulations (tablet and solution). The predicted AUC(0, 12 h) after twice daily doses of 4 mg kg(-) (1) ranged from 4. 44 mg l(-) (1) h for children 30 kg. CONCLUSIONS: The use of meta-analysis is critical to identify the correct covariate-parameter relationships, which must be assessed before a model is applied for predictive purposes (e. g. defining dosing recommendations for children). In contrast to prior modelling efforts, we show that the covariate distribution in the target population must be considered...|$|R
40|$|Concern with {{potential}} toxicity {{due to the}} widespread use of unlicensed and off label drugs in children has led to regulatory changes aimed to strengthen the evidence base for <b>paediatric</b> <b>drugs.</b> This thesis examines paediatric randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the highest level of evidence, and assesses them in relation to global child health. 	 A systematic review was performed using validated methods to search three major databases for paediatric RCTs published in 2007. More than 600 RCTs were identified involving more than 100, 000 children. The RCTs appear to study the appropriate clinical areas however few studies involved neonates. The RCTs also seem to be of good methodological quality with a mean Jadad score of 3. 22. The reporting of RCTs that involve both adults and children needs to be improved to add to the evidence base of paediatric medicines. More attention is also needed on the reporting of safety information from the RCTs to provide useful toxicity data. Although severe and moderate ADRs were seen in 25 % of the RCTs, few RCTs (12 %) established safety monitoring committees (SMCs). SMCs are vital to ensure patients in paediatric RCTs are protected from toxicity. The burden of childhood disease is heaviest in low and middle income countries (LMIC). A minority of the RCTs were performed in LMIC, although they are increasingly globalised. RCTs conducted in LMIC appear to have lower methodological quality, and reported less well on ethical approval and adverse events. In conclusion high quality, ethical paediatric RCTs should add to the evidence base for paediatric medicines. However they should correspond with the health needs of children on a global basis...|$|R

Some patches have paediatric labelling supported by clinical trials whereas others are used unlicensed. Innovative drug delivery methods, such as microneedles and sonophoresis are being tested for their safety and efficacy; needleless injectors are primarily used to administer growth hormone; and two iontophoretic devices were approved for paediatrics.

40|$|Systemic {{antibiotics}} are {{the group}} of drugs most commonly used in children. Off-label antibiotic use in children is still common {{in the community and}} in hospitals, mostly because of young age, dosage, or frequency of drug application. There is an important incentive gap that hinders <b>paediatric</b> <b>drug</b> development resulting from a series of factors, such as small market size, a predominance of off-patent use, no incentives for generic drug manufacturers, and a greater complexity of drug development. The latter is due to varying capacities of drug absorption and metabolism during growth and maturation and the need for oral formulations in neonates and infants. High ethical barriers, combined with concerns of parents about drug safety, further complicate the conduct of clinical studies in children. While many off-patent antibiotics today are labelled for use in children, newer substances such as fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, linezolid, or daptomycin are not.

Methods Number and type of individual case safety reports in the 30 groups of drugs (5 th level ATC-code) most sold (number of defined daily doses) in outpatient treatment to children (Results The number of individual case safety reports per million defined daily doses in children varied in the groups of drug between 0 and 24. The largest number was found in the drug group R 03 DC, the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast; the majority of the children being Conclusion The number of individual case safety reports per million defined daily doses varies in different groups of drugs. A possible signal for montelukast and psychiatric adverse drug reactions was found, which should be further explored. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to review existing information regarding food effects on <b>drug</b> absorption within <b>paediatric</b> populations. Mechanisms that underpin foodâ€“drug interactions were examined to consider potential differences between adult and paediatric populations, to provide insights into how this may alter the pharmacokinetic profile in a child. Relevant literature was searched to retrieve information on foodâ€“drug interaction studies undertaken on: (i) <b>paediatric</b> oral <b>drug</b> formulations; and (ii) within paediatric populations. The applicability of existing methodology to predict food effects in adult populations was evaluated with respect to paediatric populations where clinical data was available. Several differences in physiology, anatomy and the composition of food consumed within a paediatric population are likely to lead to foodâ€“drug interactions that cannot be predicted based on adult studies. Existing methods to predict food effects cannot be directly extrapolated to allow predictions within paediatric populations. Development of systematic methods and guidelines is needed to address the general lack of information on examining foodâ€“drug interactions within paediatric populations...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this review is {{to address the issue}} of {{endpoints}} in paediatric oncology. Oncologists use this term to refer to an outcome they are trying to measure with a clinical trial, which may become accordingly the object of scientific articles. The outcome measured may concern both efficacy and safety, although from different perspectives. METHODS: Based on both literature and experience developed in clinical trials, the different types of endpoints have been critically analysed in their power to provide the highest information of therapeutic interest (efficacy and safety) with the least risk and discomfort for the individual. Primary, secondary and surrogate endpoints have been distinguished. The most relevant differences have been discussed in comparison with adult oncology settings of endpoints. RESULTS: The rarity of cancer in childhood and adolescence and the objective difficulty of enrolling statistically conceivable numbers of individuals have determined the utmost positive development of large scale, multinational clinical trials. The most interesting consequence is that the impact of multiplicity interferences, which is usually present in virtually all clinical trials developed for adults with cancer, is not a common event in paediatric oncology. Nevertheless, many of the questions concerning the different impact on outcome and survival of clinical trials developed in adult oncology remain unanswered due to the objective limitations still existing in terms of cure compared with paediatric oncology. The powerful consistency of cure rate, as the most relevant endpoint of clinical trials developed in paediatric oncology, addresses additional considerations to support the relevant differences existing between adult and paediatric oncology: both the development of clinical trials with different aims (confirmatory versus primary response) and the limited impact of multiplicity limitations may determine different implications regarding the meaning of endpoints in paediatric and adult oncology. CONCLUSION: The aim of cancer treatment is to improve survival (SUR) and quality of life (QoL), but some restraints on the conduct of clinical trials may make these goals unattainable. Clinical trial endpoints represent a measure method aimed to grant answers to questions addressed by the clinical trial itself. The effect of the new regulation is expected to stimulate high-quality research and provide robust information on <b>paediatric</b> <b>drugs</b> to increase the availability of such drugs to children...|$|R
40|$|For the {{majority}} of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), treatment consists in part of a triple intrathecal (Triple IT) therapy, i. e. a combination of cytarabine (CB), methotrexate (MTX) and methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) [1]. This combination product is prepared ex-tempore. However, no in-use shelf-life under defined storage conditions has yet been established. During stability studies, {{a large number of}} samples are generated, thus creating the need for a fast, accurate and selective analytical method. In this study, a fused-core HPLC method was developed. This hybrid technology, consisting of a 0. 5 Âµm thick porous shell fused to a 1. 7 Âµm inert core, enables faster chromatographic separation with sufficiently high resolution. During method development, both stressed and unstressed solutions containing both single Triple IT components and the mixture thereof, were analyzed using different linear gradient times, ranging from 5 to 30 min. The mobile phase composition was fixed (A: 0. 1 % glacial acid in H 2 O; B: 0. 1 % glacial acid in ACN), starting with A:B (90 : 10, V/V) and ending with A:B (10 : 90, V/V). Method selectivity was evaluated based on the observed peaks in stressed CB, MTX and MPSS solutions, i. e. incubation at 40 Â°C and 80 Â°C. A balance between fast separation and sufficient resolution between the Triple IT components and related degradants, was found by setting the gradient time at 15 min. The Triple IT related degradation peaks were chromatographically separated from the remaining Triple IT components. Moreover, selectivity was supported by a peak purity analysis on the observed peaks. Linearity was demonstrated (RÂ² > 0. 999) for the three Triple IT components. Repeatability was evaluated by triplicate injections of 100 % reference assay: relative standard deviation varied between 0. 155 % (MPSS), 0. 464 % (CB) and 1. 352 % (MTX) [2]. References [1]	A.
