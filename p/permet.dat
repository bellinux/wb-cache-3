Menduh was an {{appointed}} delegate from his hometown Korça to the Albanian National Congress that proclaimed the Independence of Albania. In the intellectual level Menduh was noted for the translation of Friedrich Schiller's drama Wilhelm Tell into Albanian. He was assassinated at a very young age near Pogradec by a local collaborationist band.|$|E
25|$|Until September 1912, the Ottoman {{government}} intentionally kept Albanians divided {{within four}} ethnically heterogeneous vilayets to prevent Albanian national unification. The reforms introduced by Young Turks provoked the Albanian Revolt of 1912 which lasted {{in the period}} from January to August 1912. In January 1912, Hasan Prishtina, Albanian deputy in Ottoman parliament, publicly warned members of the parliament that the policy of Young Turks government is leading to a revolution in Albania. The revolt was successful and until August 1912 rebels managed to gain control over whole Kosovo vilayet (including Novi Pazar, Sjenica, Priština and even Skopje), {{a part of the}} Scutari Vilayet (including Elbasan, <b>Përmet</b> and Leskovik), Konitsa in Janina Vilayet and Debar in Monastir Vilayet. The Ottoman government ended the Albanian revolt on 4 September 1912 by accepting all demands related to establishing the unified autonomous system of administration and justice for Albanians within one vilayet—the Albanian vilayet.|$|E
25|$|On 10 June 1878, about eighty delegates, mostly Muslim {{religious}} leaders, clan chiefs, {{and other}} influential {{people from the}} Ottoman vilayets of Kosovo, Monastir and Janina, met {{in the city of}} Prizren, (Kosova then Ottoman Empire). Around 300 Muslims participated on the assembly, including delegates from Bosnia and mutasarrif (administrator of sanjak) of Prizren as representative of the central authorities, and no delegates from Scutari Vilayet. The delegates set up a standing organization, the League of Prizren, under the direction of a central committee that had the power to impose taxes and raise an army. The league of Prizren consisted of two branches: the Prizren and the southern branch. The Prizren branch was led by Iljas Dibra and it had representatives from the areas of Kirçova (Kicevo), Kalkandelen (Tetovo), Pristine (Pristina), Mitroviça (Kosovska Mitrovica), Viçitirin (Vucitrn), Üsküp (Skopje), Gilan (Gnjilane), Manastir (Bitola), Debar (Debar) and Gostivar. The southern branch, led by Abdyl Frashëri consisted of sixteen representatives from the areas of Kolonjë, Korçë, Arta, Berat, Parga, Gjirokastër, <b>Përmet,</b> Paramythia, Filiates, Margariti, Vlorë, Tepelenë and Delvinë. In these regions the movement was primarily Muslim, {{due to the fact that}} most of the Orthodox population was under Greek influence. On the other hand, in the northern regions both Muslim and Catholic populations supported the objectives of the League of Prizren.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} days, Alexandros Karapanos, Zografos' nephew and a MP for Arta, was installed as foreign minister. Colonel Dimitrios Doulis, a local from Nivice, resigned {{from his post}} in the Greek army and joined the provisional government as minister of military affairs. Within a few days, he managed to mobilize an army consisting of more than 5,000 volunteer troops. The local bishop, Vasileios of Dryinoupolis, took office as minister of Religion and Justice. A number of officers of Epirote origin (not exceeding 30), as well as ordinary soldiers, deserted their positions in the Greek Army and joined the revolutionaries. Soon, armed groups, such as the [...] "Sacred Band" [...] or Spyromilios' men around Himarë (gr. Himárra), were formed in order to repel any incursion into the territory claimed by the autonomous government. The first districts to join the autonomist movement outside of Gjirokastër were Himarë, Sarandë and <b>Përmet.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{repression}} in Korça, Menduh went to <b>Përmet</b> {{and the surrounding}} highlands in autumn, and together with Vangjel Gjika and other nationalist leaders were spreading counterpropaganda {{in the region and}} searching for volunteer fighters. In spring 1911, Menduh created and lead his own revolutionary band, composed of initially 50 men from Korçë and <b>Përmet.</b> In July of that year, after several hours of fighting with the Ottoman garrison of <b>Përmet,</b> they achieved their first success and as a result accumulated valuable military supplies and ammunition. In the end of July, Menduh went to Korça and alongside the bands of Spiro Bellkameni and Qamil Panariti, attempted to release the patriotic leaders that were arrested by the Ottoman government, Mihal Grameno and Themistokli Gërmenji being among them. A group of their fighters went to Orman-Çiflig near the town, to attack the army depot. A violent skirmish followed in the night between 29 and 30 July. Six Albanian fighters were killed while the Ottoman troops lost 2 military officers and 13 soldiers in the battleground. Eventually, the Young Turks set up the military court in Korça for the punishment of the Albanian nationalists.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 August, {{the bands}} of Menduh, Spiro and {{of two of}} the {{aforementioned}} leaders from the region of Gjirokastra, Namik Delvina and Nazif Hadëri, defeated a part of an Ottoman battalion in Pagri, between <b>Përmet</b> and Frashër. Nazif Hadëri was killed during the combat.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile Menduh Zavalani and {{the other}} leaders in the south were ready to attack <b>Përmet.</b> The revolutionary bands lead by him, Spiro Bellkameni, Nexhip Bënja, Mehmet Pavari and Servet Frashëri had seized the town on 13 August. [...] The Ottoman {{garrison}} surrender without fighting. The fighters disarmed the garrison and the next day, the Austro-Hungarian consul of Ioannina {{sent a letter to}} the Foreign Minister of Austro-Hungarian Empire Leopold Berchtold that [...] "the peolpe of <b>Përmet</b> had evicted the Ottoman kaymekam and had declared autonomy". They organized a large meeting where Menduh Zavalani and Spiro Bellkameni gave a speech. An ultimatum with the signatures of all the town's families was sent to the Ottoman government, demanding the autonomy of Albania.|$|E
2500|$|Menduh Zavalani alias Dume Zavalani {{was born}} in Korçë (now southeastern Albania), then Ottoman Empire in 1889. His father, Mehmet Zavalani, was an Albanian Bektashi bey [...] {{and his mother was}} Hedije Luarasi. They had moved to Korça from Zavalan of Dangëllia near <b>Përmet,</b> few years before his birth. Members of his family had already taken an active part in the League of Prizren and the Albanian National Awakening. After {{receiving}} the elementary education in his native town, in 1905 Menduh went to Manastir (Bitola) to continue the secondary education.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Permet</b> National Congress {{held during}} that time called for a [...] "new {{democratic}} Albania for the people." [...] Although the monarchy was not formally abolished, King Zog was barred from returning to the country, which further increased the Communists' control. The Anti-Fascist Committee for National Liberation was founded, chaired by Hoxha. On 22 October 1944, the Committee became the Democratic Government of Albania after a meeting in Berat and Hoxha was chosen as interim Prime Minister. Tribunals were set up to try alleged war criminals who were designated [...] "enemies of the people" [...] and were presided over by Koçi Xoxe.|$|E
2500|$|Menduh {{intensified}} {{his actions}} and extended his {{cooperation with the}} freed Themistokli Gërmenji. In the beginning of summer 1912, the revolutionary movement in the south had reached a high momentum. With a swift attack, the bands of Menduh, Spiro Bellkameni and Izet Zavalani liberated all the environs of Përmet; Dangëllia with its center Frashër, Dishnicë, Shqeri and the surrounding highlands. After the success, they were in control of a large territory and had {{paved the way for}} the liberation of <b>Përmet</b> and the important valley that connected Ioannina with the town of Gjirokastra, Korça and Monastir.|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{a clearly}} defined {{geographical}} term, [...] "Northern Epirus" [...] {{is largely a}} political and diplomatic term applied to those areas partly populated by ethnic Greeks that were incorporated into the newly independent Albanian state in 1913. According to the 20th century definition, Northern Epirus stretches from the Ceraunian Mountains north of Himara southward to the Greek border, and from the Ionian coast to Lake Prespa. The region defined as Northern Epirus thus stretches further east than classical Epirus, and includes parts of the historical region Macedonia. Northern Epirus is rugged, characterized by steep limestone ridges that parallel the Ionian coast, with deep valleys between them.

'"Ceux, ajoute-t-il, qui regardent dans les corps diaphanes, tels que les miroirs, les cuvettes remplies d'eau et les liquides; ceux qui inspectent les coeurs, les foies et les os des animaux, ... tous ces gens-là appartiennent aussi à la catégorie des devins, mais, à cause de l'imperfection de leur nature, ils y occupent un rang inférieur. Pour écarter le voile des sens, le vrai devin n'a pas besoin de grands efforts; quant aux autres, ils tâchent d'arriver au but en essayant de concentrer en un seul sens toutes leurs perceptions. Comme la vue est le sens le plus noble, ils lui donnent la préférence; fixant leur regard sur on objet à superficie unie, ils le considèrent avec {{attention}} jusqu'à ce qu'ils y aperçoivent la chose qu'ils veulent annoncer. Quelques personnes croient que l'image aperçue de cette manière se dessine sur la surface du miroir; mais ils se trompent. Le devin regarde fixement cette surface jusqu'à ce qu'elle disparaisse et qu'un rideau, semblable à un brouillard, s'interpose entre lui et le miroir. Sur ce rideau se dessinent les choses qu'il désira apercevoir, et cela lui <b>permet</b> de donner des indications soit affirmatives, soit négatives, sur ce que l'on désire savoir. Il raconte alors les perceptions telles qu'il les reçoit. Les devins, pendant qu'ils sont dans cet état, n'aperçoivent pas ce qui se voit réellement dans le miroir; c'est un autre mode de perception qui naît chez eux et qui s'opère, non pas au moyen de la vue, mais de l'âme. Il est vrai que, pour eux, les perceptions de l'âme ressemblent à celles des sens au point de les tromper; fait qui, du reste, est bien connu. La même chose arrive à ceux qui examinent les coeurs et les foies d'animaux. Nous avons vu quelques-uns de ces individus entraver l'opération des sens par l'emploi de simples fumigations, puis se servir d'incantations[2] afin de donner à l'âme la disposition requise; ensuite ils racontent ce qu'ils ont aperçu. Ces formes, disent-ils, se montrent dans l'air et représentent des personnages: elles leur apprennent, au moyen d'emblèmes et de signes, les choses qu'ils cherchent à savoir.

6000|$|In {{different}} stages of the progress of knowledge, philosophers have employed, for the colligation of the same order of facts, different conceptions. The early rude observations of the heavenly bodies, in which minute precision was neither attained nor sought, presented nothing inconsistent with {{the representation of the}} path of a planet as an exact circle, having the earth for its centre. As observations increased in accuracy, facts were disclosed which were not reconcilable with this simple supposition: for the colligation of those additional facts, the supposition was varied; and varied again and again as facts became more numerous and precise. The earth was removed from the centre to some other point within the circle; the planet was supposed to revolve in a smaller circle called an epicycle, round an imaginary point which revolved in a circle round the earth: in proportion as observation elicited fresh facts contradictory to these representations, other epicycles and other eccentrics were added, producing additional complication; until at last Kepler swept all these circles away, and substituted the conception of an exact ellipse. Even this is found not to represent with complete correctness the accurate observations of the present day, which disclose many slight deviations from an orbit exactly elliptical. Now Dr. Whewell has remarked that these successive general expressions, though apparently so conflicting, were all correct: they all answered the purpose of colligation; they all enabled the mind to represent to itself with facility, and by a simultaneous glance, the whole body of facts at the time ascertained: each in its turn served as a correct description of the phenomena, so far as the senses had up to that time taken cognizance of them. If a necessity afterward arose for discarding one of these general descriptions of the planet’s orbit, and framing a different imaginary line, by which to express the series of observed positions, it was because a number of new facts had now been added, which it was necessary to combine with the old facts into one general description. But this did not affect the correctness of the former expression, considered as a general statement of the only facts which it was intended to represent. And so true is this, that, as is well remarked by M. Comte, these ancient generalizations, even the rudest and most imperfect of them, that of uniform movement in a circle, are so far from being entirely false, that they are even now habitually employed by astronomers when only a rough approximation to correctness is required. “L’astronomie moderne, en détruisant sans retour les hypothèses primitives, envisagées comme lois réelles du monde, a soigneusement maintenu leur valeur positive et permanente, la propriété de représenter commodément les phénomènes quand il s’agit d’une première ébauche. Nos ressources à cet égard sont même bien plus étendues, précisément à cause que nous ne nous faisons aucune illusion sur la réalité des hypothèses; ce qui nous <b>permet</b> d’employer sans scrupule, en chaque cas, celle que nous jugeons la plus avantageuse.”(104) ...|$|E

Now, Dante [...] does not call her one of the Sirens carelessly, any more [...] than he speaks of Charybdis carelessly, and though he had [...] only got at the meaning of the Homeric fable through [...] Virgil's obscure tradition of it, the clue he has given us [...] is quite enough. Bacon's interpretation, [...] "the Sirens, or [...] pleasures," [...] which has become universal since his time, is [...] opposed alike to Plato's meaning and Homer's.

Dante, [...] however, adopted the Homeric conception of them, which was [...] that they were demons of the Imagination, not carnal (desire [...] of the eyes; not lust of the flesh); therefore said to be [...] daughters of the Muses. Yet not of the muses, heavenly or [...] historical, but of the muse of pleasure; and they are at [...] first winged, because even vain hope excites and helps when [...] first formed; but afterwards, contending for the possession [...] of the imagination with the muses themselves, they are [...] deprived of their wings, and thus we are to distinguish the [...] Siren power from the Power of Circe, who is no daughter of [...] the muses, but of the strong elements, Sun and Sea; her [...] power is that of frank and full vital pleasure, which, if [...] governed and watched, nourishes men; but, unwatched, and [...] having no [...] "moly," [...] bitterness or delay mixed with it, turns [...] men into beasts, but does not slay them, leaves them, on the [...] contrary, power of revival.
