Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control of development in their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is neither a current planning permission or application for a mosque, nor is one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E

5|$|Clashes {{over the}} {{interpretation}} and {{legality of the}} <b>Petition</b> began almost immediately, with the Lords and Commons arguing with the King as early as 20 June 1628, leading to the prorogation of Parliament on the 26th. The <b>Petition</b> of Right was not a formal statute, and despite it being reaffirmed as a bill by the Long Parliament in 1641, {{the legal status of}} the initial <b>Petition</b> has been debated. It has been considered a declaratory act, a private bill, or simply a <b>petition,</b> which permitted an individual harmed by the government to take action against the crown. A <b>petition</b> is the oldest form of Parliamentary proceeding, and the one through which most early statutes were originally passed; the King would be petitioned to take action by Members of Parliament, and would assent to their request; laws passed in this way include Magna Carta and the Statute of Westminster. Whether or not this made it legally binding was debated. Modern historians have either taken two positions on the matter. Either the recognition of the <b>Petition</b> was a judicial matter and at best a private bill, and as such it was not binding on the King or on Parliament, or it had the strength of a public bill; it was a legislative act, and as such legally binding.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on <b>petitions</b> by Ottoman women from Greater Syria during the late Ottoman era. After {{offering}} a general overview of women's <b>petitions</b> in the Ottoman Empire, it explores changes in women's <b>petitions</b> between 1865 and 1919 through several case studies. The article then discusses women's "double-voiced" <b>petitions</b> following the empire's defeat in World War I, particularly those submitted to the King-Crane Commission. The concept of "double-voiced" <b>petitions,</b> or speaking {{in a voice that}} reflects both a dominant and a muted discourse, is extended here from the genre of literary fiction to Ottoman women's <b>petitions.</b> We argue that in Greater Syria double-voiced <b>petitions</b> only began to appear with the empire's collapse, when women both participated in national struggles and strove to protect their rights as women in their own societies...|$|R
