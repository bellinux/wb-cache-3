5|$|Amanita muscaria is {{traditionally}} used for catching flies <b>possibly</b> {{due to its}} content of ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|At some point, Cybi and Caffo parted company, <b>possibly</b> {{because of}} a {{disagreement}} between them, but <b>possibly</b> because his brother Gildas had insulted Maelgwn, who then forced Cybi to dismiss Caffo – both versions appear in the manuscript accounts. Thereafter, Caffo moved towards the south of Anglesey, where {{he was killed by}} shepherds from the area now called Newborough, perhaps avenging the insult on their king.|$|E

5|$|In 1531 Nostredame {{was invited}} by Jules-César Scaliger, a leading Renaissance scholar, {{to come to}} Agen. There he married a woman of {{uncertain}} name (<b>possibly</b> Henriette d'Encausse), who bore him two children. In 1534 {{his wife and children}} died, presumably from the plague. After their deaths, he continued to travel, passing through France and <b>possibly</b> Italy.|$|E

5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{think that}} it may be the earliest extant cantata by Bach, <b>possibly</b> composed in Arnstadt in 1707.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{levels in}} the {{atmosphere}} are trending slightly downward globally, <b>possibly</b> because of fossil-fuel burning.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Coal Run, Rapid Run, Beaver Run, and Muddy Run are {{impaired}} or <b>possibly</b> impaired by agriculture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Possibly</b> Rohese, wife of Henry de la Pomerai.|$|E

5|$|Reginald de Dunstanville, Earl of Cornwall, {{born in the}} 1110s {{or early}} 1120s, <b>possibly</b> to Sibyl Corbet.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{was known}} in antiquity, and <b>possibly</b> was {{produced}} in bloomeries and crucibles.|$|E
5|$|Sudan {{has used}} Su-25s in attacks on rebel targets and <b>possibly</b> civilians in Darfur.|$|E
5|$|The McGulpin House, {{a working-class}} home <b>possibly</b> {{constructed}} prior to 1780, is {{interpreted as a}} frontier working-class home.|$|E
5|$|The final {{production}} revolvers were <b>possibly</b> produced after the Great Kantō earthquake and <b>possibly</b> only 325 of these revolvers were produced. Known examples have serial numbers ranging from 58,903 and 59,227.|$|E
5|$|The {{parent of}} Cairanoolithus is {{probably}} {{some kind of}} non-ornithopod ornithischian, <b>possibly</b> the nodosaurid Struthiosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Therefore, <b>possibly,</b> it is {{necessarily}} true that an omniscient, omnipotent, and perfectly good being exists.|$|E
5|$|While Richard was at Mile End, the Tower {{was taken}} by the rebels. A force of rebels, {{separate}} from those operating under Tyler at Mile End, approached the castle, <b>possibly</b> in the late morning. The gates were open to receive Richard on his return and a crowd of around 400 rebels entered the fortress, encountering no resistance, <b>possibly</b> because the guards were terrified by them.|$|E

5|$|Aristagoras {{was also}} {{successful}} in persuading {{the city of}} Eretria to send assistance to the Ionians {{for reasons that are}} not completely clear. <b>Possibly</b> commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria some time previously, <b>possibly</b> referring to the Lelantine War.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, <b>possibly</b> in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two {{separate}} areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, <b>possibly</b> also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice with a small envelope of gas. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (<b>possibly</b> water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and <b>possibly</b> also found on Europa.|$|E
