The program aims to increase the participation of wind power sources, biomass sources and small hydropower systems in the supply of the Brazilian grid system through Autonomous Independent Producers (PIA). The medium to long-term objective (i.e. 20 years) of the <b>program</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the defined sources supply 15% of the annual market growth until they reach 10% of the nation's annual electric power demand/total consumption.|$|E
25|$|The Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa {{also offers}} a co-op option for some of their {{programs}} including: accounting, commerce, e-business, finance, management, marketing, and few other interconnected programs. With the exception of accounting which starts during the summer before a student’s fourth year, all programs start the summer before a student’s third year of study. Finally as a last category, several co-op graduate programs are offered as well: computer science, economics, globalization and international development, history, information studies, and public and international affairs. The entry requirements for graduate students are {{a little different from}} those for undergraduate co-operative education programs. In the graduate level, one of the requirements of the co-op <b>program</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is crucial that students begin their study in the fall semester because of the co-op program’s placement cycle.|$|E

2500|$|Structured programming, {{canonical}} structures: Per the Church–Turing thesis, any algorithm can be computed by a model {{known to}} be Turing complete, and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while [...] "undisciplined" [...] use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in [...] "spaghetti code", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; {{on the other hand}} [...] "it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language". Tausworthe augments the three Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures: SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE. An additional benefit of a structured <b>program</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it lends itself to proofs of correctness using mathematical induction.|$|E

[...] KindsWorld Magazine noted [...] "you don't have to know a lot of history to enjoy this game, and there's an electronic reference book for help". The journal article Feminist Interventions in Electronic Environments praised the game for providing educational content [...] "in a gender-neutral way" [...] while having [...] "strong, intelligent women characters".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a part of}} 2009 Foxfield Races, the Foxfield Racing Association (FRA) has {{initiated}} a “Go Green” Program which encourages people attending the races to not use glass and to start recycling their cans. [...] As {{a part of the}} “Go Green” program the FRA will now transport all trash from the races to a recycling center and not a landfill. [...] Also another part of the <b>program</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the FRA has provided large containers (supplied by the company Container Rentals) for attendees to put filled trash bags. [...] This program is a reply to the complaints of many civilians and people of the amount of trash that is left behind or found after the Spring Foxfield race, and {{as a response to the}} cooler size change which will lead to a large increase in Styrofoam coolers.|$|E

2500|$|An {{innovative}} {{financing arrangement}} pioneered in Berkeley, California, and Palm Springs, lends {{money to a}} homeowner for a solar system, to be repaid via an additional tax assessment on the property for 20 years. [...] This allows installation {{of the solar system}} at [...] "relatively little up-front cost to the property owner." [...] Now known as PACE, for Property Assessed Clean Energy, it is available in 28 states. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have objected to the repayment of solar loans being senior to mortgage loans, and some states have relegated PACE loans to junior loans. HR 2599 was introduced to prevent interference with the PACE program by other lenders. The principle feature of the <b>program</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the balance of the loan is transferred to the new owners in the event the property is sold, and the loan is paid for entirely through electric bill savings. Unlike a mortgage loan, no funds are transferred when the property is sold - only the repayment obligation is transferred.|$|E
