50|$|Prorenone (developmental {{code name}} SC-23133) is a steroidal antimineralocorticoid of the spirolactone group related to {{spironolactone}} {{that was never}} marketed. It is the lactonic form of prorenoic acid (prorenoate), and <b>prorenoate</b> <b>potassium</b> (SC-23992), the potassium salt of prorenoic acid, also exists. <b>Prorenoate</b> <b>potassium</b> is about 8 times more potent than spironolactone as an antimineralocorticoid in animals, and it may act as a prodrug to prorenone. In addition to the mineralocorticoid receptor, prorenone also binds to the glucocorticoid, androgen, and progesterone receptors. Similarly to spironolactone, prorenone is also a potent inhibitor of aldosterone biosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|The spirolactones {{include the}} marketed drugs {{spironolactone}} (SC-9420; Aldactone), canrenone (SC-9376; Cantaren, Luvion), potassium canrenoate (SC-14266; Venactone, Soldactone), eplerenone (SC-66110, CGP-30083; Inspra), and drospirenone (ZK-30595; Yasmin). Spirolactones {{that were not}} ever marketed include SC-5233, SC-8109, SC-11927 (Catatoxic Steroid 1; CS-1), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), <b>prorenoate</b> <b>potassium</b> (SC-23992), 7α-thiospironolactone (SC-24813), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (SC-26519), mexrenoate potassium (SC-26714), spirorenone (ZK-35973), ZK-91587 (15β,16β-methylenemexrenone), mespirenone (ZK-94679), and ZK-97894 (7α-thiomethylmespirenone). Oxprenoate potassium (RU-28318) is not a spirolactone by definition but is a closely related antimineralocorticoid that was never marketed.|$|E
40|$|A 3 -month {{dose range}} finding study in {{preparation}} for a 2 -yr carcinogenicity study of <b>potassium</b> <b>prorenoate</b> (SC- 23992), a steroid with an antihypertensive profile, i s reported. The drug was administered by gavage once daily at doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day to Charles River CD rats. Treatment was termi-nated at 13 weeks and 10 randomly selected animals from each treatment group were killed and necropsied. The remaining 10 animals in each dose group, including controls, were maintained for an additional 4 weeks, in order to investigate reversibility of changes, and then were killed and necropsied. Dose-related increases in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were observed in treated animals of both sexes during the dosing period and the changes were statistically significant and correlated with an increased thyroid weight in females at 13 weeks. Dose-related morphologic changes in the thyroid, observed by light and electron microscopy, were compatible with the effects of TSH stimulation. l iver weights, which increased, were dose-related. I n females the increase was statistically significant at the high dose at 2, 4, and 13 weeks. I...|$|R
