5|$|She {{wanted the}} {{production}} and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of gender construction). According to Babbit, the germaphobic character of Mary Brown represents AIDS paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and PVC outfits. The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink <b>picket</b> <b>fence</b> were filmed in Palmdale, California.|$|E
5|$|The Charles Payne House is an {{historic}} site at 25 Brown Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The {{house was built}} in 1855–56 by Charles Payne and later expanded {{with the addition of}} two ells and a porch. The -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage is architecturally significant as a 19th-century vernacular cottage in a picturesque setting. Though the round-head <b>picket</b> <b>fence</b> and entry gates were later removed, the property retains a large shaded garden on with ample street frontage. The Charles Payne House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The wrought-iron fence {{along the}} church {{driveway}} {{was installed in}} April 1895, replacing a <b>picket</b> <b>fence.</b> In 1905, the church's wood roof was replaced with a metal one, the present stained-glass windows were installed, its interior and woodwork were painted, and new lamps were installed for better illumination. The stained-glass windows were supplied by Madison Alling of Newark, New Jersey in memory of his father, who summered at nearby Capon Springs Resort. Alling also provided four hanging lamps and calcimine for the interior walls and paint for the interior woodwork. Anton Reymann of Wheeling, West Virginia funded the metal roof and the sanctuary's painting and decoration.|$|E

50|$|<b>Picket</b> <b>fences</b> are {{particularly}} {{popular in the}} United States, where the style has been used since America's earliest colonial era and remains popular today. They are a decorative way to contain pets and children without blocking views, and are used around both front and back yards. Traditionally <b>picket</b> <b>fences</b> were made out of wood and painted white (or whitewashed), but now <b>picket</b> <b>fences</b> are also widely available in polyvinyl chloride (PVC).|$|R
50|$|<b>Picket</b> <b>fences</b> {{can be made}} {{of several}} types of {{material}}s. Historically, wood {{has been the most}} popular material used for <b>picket</b> <b>fences.</b> This wood can be untreated, treated, or naturally insect and rot resistant. Other non-wood options are available; including vinyl, aluminum, and PVC.|$|R
5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head <b>picket</b> <b>fence</b> surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate. By 2013, the <b>picket</b> <b>fence</b> and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E

Later that summer, Project 86 traveled nationwide on the Scream the Prayer Tour with metalcore outfits The Chariot, Haste the Day, and Gwen Stacy. Coming mid-October, Project 86 started the <b>Picket</b> <b>Fence</b> Cartel Tour with , Showbread, The Wedding, and Yearling, and added a second part in spring 2010 with Flatfoot 56 and Wavorly. The band released their first live album, entitled XV Live, in December 2010 to commemorate their 15th anniversary.

500|$|This {{episode was}} {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} crossover episode with the CBS show <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences,</b> which was set in another town in Wisconsin. David E. Kelley, the series creator of <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences,</b> and Chris Carter, the series creator of The X-Files, were talking in a parking lot and thought it might be interesting to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome, Wisconsin for an X-Files episode. Unlike a traditional crossover, the two shows would be shot with different viewpoints and one would be aired as an X-Files episode and the other as an episode of <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences.</b> Ultimately, CBS decided against the crossover and both episodes created ended up becoming stand-alones. Executive producer Robert Goodwin said of the experience [...] "I spent days on the phone with a producer of <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences.</b> We spent days organizing our schedules. Then at the very last minute, of course, we found out that no one had told CBS, and they said 'Forget it. We're having enough trouble on Friday nights without publicizing The X-Files.' It's too bad." [...] The <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> episode intended {{to be part of the}} crossover was called [...] "Away in the Manger" [...] and aired the week following [...] "Red Museum." [...] While every reference to <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> has been purged from the X-Files episode, there still are some small winks left in the <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> episode referring to the happenings at the X-Files, including a mention of Dr. Larson.

A kitchen door opens onto a small side yard, the driveway, and a single-car garage—a frequent setting for get-togethers between the boys, their father, and the boys' friends.|$|E
25|$|The first Catholic {{church in}} the City of Mountain View was built in 1867 with funds {{gathered}} by Rev.Joseph Bixio,S.J. of Santa Clara. The original structure was a little white wooden building, topped by a cross, nestled among tall shade trees and enclosed by a white <b>picket</b> <b>fence</b> {{at the corner of}} El Camino Real and Alviso Road. The land was donated by John Sullivan whose teams hauled the lumber from Watsonville. It was a small church accommodating 150people until 1884 when its capacity was increased to 250. Rev. John J. Cullen was appointed the first pastor in 1901.|$|E

25|$|Upon examination, the {{military}} surgeons determined that no one's neck {{had been broken}} by the fall. The manacles and cloth bindings were removed but not the white execution masks, and the bodies were placed into the pine coffins. The name of each person was written {{on a piece of}} paper by acting Assistant Adjutant R. A. Watts, and inserted in a glass vial, which was placed into the coffin. The coffins were buried against the prison wall in shallow graves, just a few feet from the gallows. A white <b>picket</b> <b>fence</b> marked the burial site. The night that she died, a mob attacked the Surratt boarding house and began stripping it of souvenirs until the police stopped them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the century the city's {{fortunes}} began to change for the better. The Aspen Mountain ski resort was opened, bringing development and people back. Walter Paepcke, the Chicago industrialist who with his wife Elizabeth had financed the development of the ski resort and the Aspen Music Festival and School, sought to restore many of the old buildings that remained {{in order to make the}} city more attractive to visitors. They hired Bauhaus architect Herbert Bayer, who lived in the house while he was in Aspen, designing its current <b>picket</b> <b>fence.</b> Later, it was the home of Atlantic Richfield executive Robert Orville Anderson, who chaired the board of the Aspen Institute.|$|E
