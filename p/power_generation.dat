40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the optimal economic control of electric power systems. An attempt is made to allocate optimally the active and /or active-reactive <b>power</b> <b>generations</b> while minimizing the fuel cost. A problem of this nature is dealt with by representing the electric power system by an appropriate mathematical model to which a suitable optimization procedure is applied. [...] For the purpose of optimal control for economy operation, it is convenient to think of the integrated electric system as being made of three major subsystems, viz, the thermal generation, the hydro generation and the interconnecting extra high voltage transmission network. To each of these a suitable mathematical model is assigned. [...] Our emphasis here is twofold; Firstly we wish to find estimates for the parameters appearing in each of the chosen models while bearing in mind that economy operation strategies require accurate parameter estimates. For this purpose five well known parameter estimation algorithms are applied to the power system problem and results of their application compared in this thesis. The second aspect of this work {{is concerned}} with the problem of optimally allocating the active and/ or active-reactive <b>power</b> <b>generations</b> of the dispatching system, making use of the models with their estimated coefficients. [...] The optimization procedure is intended as an extra measure for judging the merit of each of the estimation techniques as applied to our power system problem, as it is clear that different parameter estimates give rise to different optimal strategies. The allocated optimum <b>power</b> <b>generations</b> are then utilized into the original network and the network performance is analyzed. Finally the optimization procedure is extended to include a range of loading patterns of the system...|$|R
