In other words, the preposition is not registered with any lexical content. Vos claims the internal relation {{between the first and}} second noun in a nominal partitive implicitly denotes a subset-set, possessive or part-whole relation. Similarly, de Hoop embraces the idea that only when a quantifier pairs with a desired type of DP, specific kind of <b>partitive</b> <b>relation</b> can then be determined. The preposition [...] "of" [...] plays a crucial role in enabling the selected DP to surface.|$|E

The Prolex model is based on two main concepts: firstly, a language independent pivot and, secondly, the prolexeme (the projection of the pivot onto particular language), that {{is a set of}} lemmas (names and derivatives). These two concepts model the variations of proper name: firstly, independent of language and, secondly, language dependent by morphology or knowledge. Variation processing is very important for NLP: the same proper name can be written in different instances, maybe in different parts of speech, and it can also be replaced by another one, a lexical anaphora (that reveals semantic link). The pivot represents different referent's points of view, i. e. language independent variations of name. Pivots are linked by three semantic relations (quasi-synonymy, <b>partitive</b> <b>relation</b> and associative relation). The prolexeme is a set of variants (aliases), quasi-synonyms and morphosemantic derivatives. Prolexemes are linked to classifying contexts and reliability code...|$|E
40|$|The « topological part / object » {{relation}} {{is one of}} {{the five}} or six large part / whole relations expressed in language. In French, it is expressed through a number of nouns called « Noms de localisation interne ». These NLI have many syntactic and semantic properties in common with nouns referring to object components, Ncomp, involved in another kind of part-whole relation, but a closer study shows that the NLI / Nobject relation is to be analysed both as a partition and a localisation relation. As a <b>partitive</b> <b>relation,</b> it is quite comparable to a Ncomp / Nobject relation, at the same time, it is to be considered as a spatial relation. An explanation can be found for this mixed status if we accept the hypothesis of an evolutionary path leading from Npc (body-part nouns) to Ncomp, then on to NLI and from there eventually to spatial relational markers (prepositions and adverbs). The transition from one stage to the other is marked by an increasing effect of grammaticalization and abstraction. Borillo Andrée.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an attempt to}} computerize an existing (multilingual) specialized dictionary and make it able to highlight all the relationships between terms, i. e., not only interlingual equivalences and synonyms, but also semantic and lexical relationships, such as hyperonymy, meronymy, derivation and combinatorics. Our aim {{is to give the}} user access to a maximum of information on these relationships in the most economical way. The method discussed here is the extraction of "Lexical Functions" (LFs) [Mel'cuk et al. 1984, 1995; Wanner 1996]. Our attention will be mainly focussed on taxonomic and <b>partitive</b> <b>relations,</b> of particular interest for terminology...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse possessive constructions in the {{language}} of Plautus’ plays and see whether there is any difference in expressing alienable and what may be perceived as inalienable relations. Since nouns denoting kinship and body parts make up the two most frequent semantic groups treated as inalienable in languages in which the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is grammaticalized, a corpus of twelve plays was searched based on a list of possibly inalienable nouns including body part terms and kin terms. Certain <b>partitive</b> <b>relations</b> were subsequently included in the analysis. To see whether these putatively inalienable nouns appear in different possessive constructions than alienable ones, the prologues and the first two acts of each of the twelve plays were searched for instances of alienable nouns occurring in possessive constructions, which were then compared to the first group. The general finding is that, although the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is not grammaticalized in Early Latin, i. e. there is no alienability split which requires different possessive constructions for alienables as opposed to inalienables, it seems to have been more appropriate to use certain constructions, such as the possessive adjective or possessor promotion and deletion, with inalienable nouns than with alienable ones. The result is a higher frequency of these constructions in cases when the possessed noun tends to be perceived as inalienable from the possessor...|$|R
