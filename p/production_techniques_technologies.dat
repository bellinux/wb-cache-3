To determine the empirical relevance of this implication, data for 11 industries in 14 countries over the period 1970 – 1985 are investigated. Moreover, the paper examines the data for seven industries in the nontrade sector. Regression analyses suggest that the industry-level wages across countries are significantly influenced by the relative dispersion of <b>production</b> <b>techniques</b> at the industry level and, to a lesser extent, by international trade.

We develop data on emissions from 41 industrial sectors in 39 countries and estimate the CO 2 emissions intensity of production and trade. We find no evidence that developing countries specialize in emissions-intensive sectors; instead, emissions intensities differ systematically across countries because of differences in <b>production</b> <b>techniques.</b> Thus, the <b>technology</b> of developing countries drives the greater emissions intensity of their exports. Our results suggest that international differences in emissions intensity, while substantial, do not play {{a significant factor in}} determining patterns of trade...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{intrinsic}} {{link between the}} challenge we face to ensure food security through the twentyfirst century and other global issues, most notably climate change, population growth {{and the need to}} sustainably manage the world’s rapidly growing demand for energy and water. Our progress in reducing global poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals will be determined to a great extent by how coherently these long-term challenges are tackled. A key question is whether we can feed a future nine billion people equitably, healthily and sustainably. Science and technology can make a major contribution, by providing practical solutions. Securing this contribution requires that high priority be attached both to research and to facilitating the real world deployment of existing and emergent technologies. Put simply, we need a new, ‘greener revolution’.

40|$|The Dalek Invasion of Earth" (1965) {{marked a}} turning point in the series. Not only did it see the first change to the line-up of regular {{characters}} (Susan Foreman, played by Carole Ann Ford, left at the conclusion of the story) but it was the first to feature material filmed on location. Up until this point, all episodes had been filmed entirely within the confines of a studio. This paper will examine the relationships and effects between narratives, <b>production</b> <b>techniques</b> and <b>technology</b> in this studio-bound era; how the programme makers told stories that in terms of direction, reach, and geography, far outstripped the limiting four walls of the studio space. In addition, the paper will discuss how <b>production</b> <b>techniques</b> developed to allow creativity to flourish in order to escape the trappings of the studio. Techniques such as forced perspective, front and back projection, and lighting will be discussed, along with how they’ve been employed to assist the telling of the story in a number of Doctor Who episodes, including "An Unearthly Child", "The Daleks", "Marco Polo," and "The Keys of Marinus". The central question to be explored is the idea that there is an inverse relationship between television production technology, and the creativity and ambition of geography in the narratives. While one grows, the other dies. Whilst television has become more technically adept, what has been lost? On what levels has moving beyond the studio been to the detriment of the medium?...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Printed {{microstrip}} antennas and arrays {{are known}} to have limitations in terms of bandwidth and efficiency, all imposed by the very presence of the dielectric substrate. Microstrip arrays printed on a very thin film and separated from the ground-plane by foam were successfully designed; however, the fabrication difficulties {{associated with the use of}} foam considerably increases the fabrication cost. In this paper, a new concept is presented. Rather than using a superstrata geometry, the “printed circuit” is etched out of metal and supported in “strategic points ” by (metallic or nonmetallic) posts. The main motivation for this work was to obtain large microstrip arrays, which exhibit a higher efficiency than conventional ones, and can be fabricated using inexpensive large quantity <b>production</b> <b>techniques.</b> However, this <b>technology</b> was also used to develop many new types of microstrip antennas.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) technology has undergone exponential growth and gained {{more and more}} importance in the recent research, mainly due to the freedom of creating sophisticated geometries that are impossible to produce using either one {{or a combination of}} several alternative <b>production</b> <b>techniques.</b> AM <b>technology</b> has mostly been used for prototyping application during the product design and development phase in many different industrial sectors. However, 3 D printed prototypes have limited mechanical properties and the printed parts usually cannot fulfil mechanical requirements for functional applications. As a consequence, this problem has given rise to a new concept of 3 D printing technique based on adding fibers to the polymeric material matrix. By means of this technique, the mechanical properties of the printed parts can be enhanced. The current thesis has researched in carbon fiber reinforcement for nylon specimens printed by the Mark One printer from Markforged. The carbon reinforced specimens were compared with pure nylon specimens by means of the results obtained from tensile and flexural tests. Nylon and carbon reinforced nylon specimens were printed for both tensile and flexural tests. The methodology consisted of obtaining the specimens by 3 D printer, do the mechanical characterization and treat the data obtained. In order to print the specimens and configure the printing options, a software named Eiger was used. The results of the mechanical characterization of carbon reinforced nylon and pure nylon specimens were compared and thoroughly discussed, so as to assess the improvement of the carbon reinforced nylon specimens’ mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{agricultural}} {{history of the}} well-documented manor of Rimpton in south-east Somerset {{provides an opportunity for}} a detailed reconstruction of one medieval demesne farm and for testing generalized models of economic development in one specific local context. Background information is provided concerning the evolution of the manorial economy through to the twelfth century. This analysis suggests that manorialization might have been a significant factor in the adoption of nucleated settlement, common-field agriculture, and certain peasant tenures and customs. Quantitative and qualitative information from the Pipe Rolls of the Bishopric of Winchester, 1208 / 09 to 1411 / 12, is used to describe the operation of the demesne farm under direct management. Topics addressed include the field system, the physical resources (buildings, crops, livestock) and human aspects (administration, labour, marketing) of production. Despite the basic inflexibility of manor's agrarian structure, significant chronological changes in production types, agricultural technology, and administrative systems are detected. Some of these reflect the influence of market pressures upon arable and pastoral husbandry, others the importance of social relationships between lord and peasant for the success of manorial farming. The thesis concludes with a statistical investigation of arable productivity, agricultural investment, and manorial profit. Earlier hypotheses emphasizing overcultivation and lack of manure for yield trends are discarded in favour of management decisions concerning the labour supply and <b>production</b> <b>techniques.</b> Although <b>technology</b> was not static, analysis of investment at Rimpton still shows that bouyant market conditions led to expansion in the scale of manorialised production rather than intensive applications of capital. Trends in productivity, investment, and profit, therefore reflected the impact of wider movements in population and the money supply upon market demand. Despite the success of pastoral production over the fourteenth century, a contracting market for grain undermined farming success and led to the lease of the manor...|$|R
40|$|The {{period of}} the late 20 th and the early 21 st centuries is {{characterized}} for many post-socialist countries by profound social/economic transformations. They are going through a tough transition from the implementation of market reform {{to the formation of}} a market economy oriented towards innovation development. The historical past of these countries attests that, in a sense, they have already been going through a similar process – back in the late 19 th-early 20 th centuries. The history of the industry of Turkestan Krai during that period is a vivid example of the process of the making and development of capitalist relations. This proves once again the relevance and timeliness of the study of the characteristics of the evolution of the region’s industry and determination of its prevalent forms. The author examines the initial forms of the region’s industry. Only the penetration of commodity production on the capitalist basis and the resettlement of peasants, the settling down of Kazakhs on the land, the development of old and emergence of new towns and villages, and the construction of railroads would lay the foundation for social division of labor. This spurred the development of old and emergence of new sectors in the industry of Turkestan Krai. During the period under examination, the prevalent form of industry was petty commodity capitalist production. But the transition from craft production and its workshop form to capitalist petty commodity production in Turkestan Krai was a long and not always straightforward process. The author investigates the issue of the making of the factory/plant form of industry. The emergence of particular factories and plants was a consequence of the wide development of Russian capitalism, a result of adopting Central Russia’s accumulated experience in the way of applying <b>production</b> <b>techniques</b> and <b>technology</b> in Turkestan Krai. Based on the author’s study of facts relating to industrial production in Turkestan Krai, the author comes {{to the conclusion that the}} region’s development is characterized by a top-bottom line, which stands for capitalist, and a bottom-top line, which denotes ante-capitalist relations. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{author is}} one of 14 makers {{selected}} worldwide to contribute to this exhibition which seeks to explore and explain the current employment of digital design and production technologies by independent makers. The jugs selected for exhibition {{were the result of}} a research project which combined traditional ceramic <b>production</b> <b>techniques</b> with digital <b>technologies.</b> Traditional plaster turning processes were combined with rapid prototyping, laser cutting and CNC milling to produce a master model for the jug design. Traditional moulding and slip casting techniques were then used to produce the ceramic pieces. The decoration process involved the use of a ceramic digital printer, which allows the economic production of one-off or small batch decorative decals, and a cutter plotter which facilitated the cutting of the decals to fit the complex 3 D form of the jugs. This integrated approach was taken to make the most efficient use of, often expensive digital technologies, only employing them to produce the elements of the design which would have been unfeasible to produce using more traditional methods. Therefore the project went beyond the employment of digital technologies simply to create design works with new aesthetic characteristics, it also sought to address issues surrounding the economics of production. Elements of this design and production system have been employed within the ceramics industry. However, this range of digital techniques have not been brought together in one project before and the research aimed to illustrate both a series of distinct digital techniques and how they can be integrated into a wider project...|$|R

[...] At the time, China {{was in the}} process of mastering the license production of the US Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo according to the deal first signed between China and USA in 1985. The 705th Institute (also known as Xi'an Precision Machinery Research Institute, 西安精密机械研究所), tasked to evaluate and reverse engineering the A244-S torpedo, was also responsible for Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo program in China, with many of the team members working on both projects. Chinese researchers suggested that since Otto fuel II powered torpedo could cost as much as three times of electrically powered torpedo, the cheaper electrically powered torpedo should be developed as well. The suggestion was accepted, and it was decided that the technologies of both the Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo and A244-S torpedo should be applied to each other to enhance their performances, and 705th Institute was put in charge of A244-S torpedo project in addition to the Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo project. Although incorporating the best features to each other certainly improved the performance for both torpedoes, the greatest benefit by far was that due to many shared components, <b>production</b> <b>techniques,</b> and other <b>technologies,</b> the logistic support was significantly reduced and the overall cost was also significantly lowered.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to map the {{treatment}} process of imagery within a specific workshop tradition. In an oral culture, it would have been wasteful not to take advantage of the iconographic potential of high-quality brooches. Therefore, it must be allowed to propose that Viking Age ornament has a deeper meaning. The tendency to let studies of Animal Art deal with shape rather than content has weakened considerably since the days of Sophus Müller. Nowadays there is a greater openness toward iconographic interpretations of Animal Art. The investigation is iconographic in the sense that it aims to determine how motifs are used and what they might represent. However, the question about the meaning of abstract shapes is not raised. According to an eternally current hypothesis within research history, the Animal Art shows analogies with skaldic poetry. Furthermore, a survey of the production conditions shows that poetry and Animal Art both were commissioned by the leading class. Hence, the investigation is focused on the stately objects of the upper class, and their specific ornament. A suitable group of artefacts are the so-called “baroque” silver brooches from mid Viking Age. By linking them as puzzle pictures, the silver caster has managed to combine several motifs on a limited image surface. Here, six brooches are examined thoroughly: After having shown that they originate from the same workshop, the brooches are organized typologically. This is done based on the <b>production</b> <b>technique,</b> <b>technology,</b> and ornaments. To make this easier to grasp, the descriptions of the history of the finding, utilization and restoration of the artefacts are reviewed in a catalogue. Once established, this typological order forms the backbone of a puzzle picture typology. In the examination process, a number of interesting analogies between poetry and imagery emerge: The composition conditions for puzzle pictures and poetic metaphors (kenningar) show some parallels. Within both arts, the hallmark of a true proficient is the ability to fit several motifs (= kenningar/puzzle pictures) within a narrow frame (= metre/artefact structure) without breaking it. Just like a poet, a silver caster understood the art of borrowing motifs from other fields of the contemporary art and bringing them together into a new composition. Just like the poet’s audience, the beholders of ornamentry must sharpen their senses to solve the riddles. The intellectual challenge lays in puzzling together figures of increasing complexity. Another hint of a connection between imagery and poetry is given by a couple of ekphraseis, composed by various skalds. The production conditions of poetry and silver brooches were similar: Skalds as well as silver casters depended on a patron. The material value of the silver brooches, as well as the names of some of the finding sites, indicate that the commissions may have come from an Óðinn-worshipping upper class, which also supported poetry. Due to these similarities, an attempt is made to interpret the puzzle-picture motifs on the baroque brooches using skaldic metaphors for Óðinn (óðinsheiti). For the time being, any further interpretation is obstructed by the question of semiotics. One the one hand, semioticians seem to offer a variety of hypotheses that could explain the analogies between poetry and silver casting. On the other hand, a wider consensus regarding the teachings and fundamental theories of semiotics has not yet been established. Therefore, I will be cautious in forming overly liberal analogies between different cultural spheres. It remains to be seen, whether the kenning-analogy works as a master key to Viking Age culture. The goal of the paper is to map the image treatment within a specific workshop tradition. Therefore, the results of this case study should only be seen as one among many possible scenarios within the complex reality of the Viking Age. The iconographic interpretations of this paper are also mere suggestions, intended to stimulate further discussion...|$|R

In contrast, state-specific changes in <b>production</b> <b>techniques,</b> which are one indication of state-specific changes in relative factor prices, account for relatively little factor absorption. Second, industry <b>production</b> <b>techniques</b> are very similar across states, especially for neighboring states and states with similar relative labor supplies.
