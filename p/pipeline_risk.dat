40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{aspects of}} <b>pipeline</b> <b>risk</b> {{management}} are researched. The research is exploratory {{in nature and}} {{the focus is on}} discovering a trend between pipeline failure causes and the consequential cost of property damage. The study aims to identify causes of hazardous pipeline failures in the United States of America (USA) and to predict the cost impact of these failures so as to get a better risk picture on this element of operational risk. This study proposes that a systems engineering approach be adopted in applying risk management not only to the project lifecycle but also to the entire product lifecycle. An extensive literature research on systems engineering, risk management, risk analysis and <b>pipeline</b> <b>risk</b> management is conducted. The study then proceeds with the collection and analysis of hazardous pipeline failure data from the United States Department of Transport (US DOT). This data is analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics with the aim of building a multilinear regression model. The research findings which are supported by the data analysis show that the causes of pipeline failure explain a small amount of the variation in the cost of pipeline failure. M. Ing.

The government issued a Corrective Action Order to BP XA that addressed the <b>pipeline’s</b> <b>risks</b> and ordered <b>pipeline</b> repair or replacement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had investigated {{the extent of the}} oil spills and oversaw BPXA’s cleanup. When BP XA did not fully comply with the terms of the corrective action, a complaint was filed in March 2009 alleging violations of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Pipeline Safety Act. [...] In July 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska entered a consent decree between the United States and BPXA resolving the government’s claims. [...] Under the consent decree, BPXA paid a $25 million civil penalty, the largest per-barrel penalty at that time for an oil spill, and agreed to take measures to significantly improve inspection and maintenance of its pipeline infrastructure on the North Slope to reduce the threat of additional oil spills.|$|R
40|$|Restricted until 8 Aug. 2009. Managing <b>pipeline</b> <b>risk</b> {{has been}} a {{challenge}} in the mortgage industry. Any locked loan is like a put option on a callable bond that is given for free to the customer. The mortgage bank has to hedge its risk against interest rate change, but {{the proportion of the}} eventually funded loans is unknown beforehand. In this study, we extend the destinations of a locked loan to four different states: closing, canceling, extending, and renegotiation. We will try to find the probability of exiting to each destination as a function of market price change and other borrowers' attributes. Modeling these probabilities helps the mortgage bank to hedge its <b>pipeline</b> <b>risk</b> more efficiently.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). The problem of Third Party Interference (TPI) on Oil and Gas Pipelines is on the rise across the world. TPI is not only common in developing countries but is now occasionally experienced in developed countries including Germany and the UK. The risks posed by these third-party activities on Oil and Gas pipelines are enormous and could be measured in terms of financial costs, environmental damages as well as health and safety implications. The quest for an end to these malicious activities has triggered a lot of studies into the root causes of pipeline TPI, other causes of pipeline failure, risks associated with pipeline failure and their mitigation measures. However, despite the significance of the effects of TPI, very little has been done to proffer an enduring solution through research. This research therefore aims at developing a framework for integrated oil and gas pipeline monitoring and incident mitigation system through integration of various wireless sensors for effective monitoring of oil and gas pipelines. Having identified the existing gaps in literature as lack of reliable, accurate and standard method for oil and gas <b>pipeline</b> <b>risk</b> assessment model, the study undertook a quantitative approach to develop an effective Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) model for pipelines. The QRA model developed benchmarks <b>pipeline</b> <b>risk</b> assessment and gives the parameters with which standard QRA could be measured.

The associated risk to both the individuals ’ encroaching and inhabiting areas along the right-of-way (ROW) and the society at large cannot be underestimated. Thus safety concerns considering the individual and societal risk of pipeline failures has become important.

In this method, we used the Kent’s <b>pipeline</b> <b>risk</b> assessment method except that to facilitate using the method more practically some changes were exerted into Kent’s method. A pipeline with 16 kilometers length was selected considering surrounding nature of the pipeline. It was divided into two sections. Analogous to Kent’s method, in this method, parameters included: interested party’s injuries, corrosion, design factor, incorrect operation index and consequence scoring. The difference here was that for consequence scoring we used ALOHA 5. 6 software instead of Kent’s pattern. Results showed that health, safety and environmental risks of section 2 (the next 13 kilometers of outgoing pipeline from gas station after the first 3 kilometers) were greater. It seems the main cause of gaining a bigger risk number was related to more activities of interested parties around section 2.

This included discussions of rate-setting and cost recovery issues; limitations in the tools and technology available to industry; and, limitations within the sources of both the data and information upon which decisions by industry and regulators are made. Also discussed were opportunities for improvement in these areas, not just in terms of more consistent and equitable financial treatments and advancements in the hardware utilized, but also in terms of the knowledge or information gaps that must be closed in order to more effectively address these issues and the <b>risks</b> associated with <b>pipelines.</b> Finally, all participant groups presented their views regarding what additional actions and steps can and need to be taken to address the issues raised in the first two panels, and to both reduce <b>pipeline</b> <b>risks</b> and prevent the sorts of incidents that prompted this Forum.
