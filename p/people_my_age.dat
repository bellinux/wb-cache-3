25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with <b>people</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|In an oral history, Lopez-De La Cruz remembered some {{circumstances}} {{of being a}} female labor organizer. “It was very hard being a woman organizer. Many of our <b>people</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and older were raised with the old customs where the husband rules and the wife obeys… Neighbors in Parlier were for the union, {{but they were not}} taking orders from women.” She suggested reforms to make the union more inclusive to women, for example her “suggestion” to add women to the all male ranch committee of Christian Brothers Wine Company, and her push to end a ban on women pruning, making higher paying work available to women’s crews at the Christian Brothers Wine Company. She also remembered how women took the lead in volunteering for store front picket lines and engaging customers in conversations about the struggle. Aside from being an efficient and passionate organizer, Lopez-De La Cruz is remembered for her incredible wit. Many stories have survived of her ability to invoke humor and justice in situations. For example, after being red bated at a picket line at a Fresno Safeway in the mid 1960s and being asked by a white man “how do you say communists in Spanish?”, she responded “Ustedes Ganaran” (You shall win), and the man went on to passionately shout the phrase while UFW members looked on and laughed.|$|E

He completed his National Service as a commissioned officer in the Royal Army Service Corps. He took LSD as a young man, describing it in 2007 as a drug [...] "for <b>people</b> of <b>my</b> <b>age.</b> It's wonderful. The one thing you could not do, however, was drip it into your eyeballs.

500|$|Radcliffe {{made his}} film debut in The Tailor of Panama, an American 2001 film based on John le Carré's 1996 spy novel, and a {{moderate}} commercial success. In 2002, {{he made his}} stage debut as a celebrity guest in a West End theatre production of The Play What I Wrote, directed by Kenneth Branaghwho also appeared {{with him in the}} second Harry Potter film. In 2007, he appeared in the film December Boys, an Australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in 2005 and released to theatres in mid-September 2007. Also in 2007, Radcliffe co-starred with Carey Mulligan in My Boy Jack, a television drama film shown on ITV on Remembrance Day. The film received mostly positive reviews, with several critics praising Radcliffe's performance as an 18-year-old who goes missing in action during a battle. Radcliffe stated, [...] "For many <b>people</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> the First World War is just a topic in a history book. But I've always been fascinated by the subject and think it's as relevant today as it ever was." ...|$|E
500|$|Cobain usually wrote lyrics for songs {{minutes before}} {{recording}} them. Cobain said, [...] "When I {{write a song}} the lyrics are the least important subject. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all". Cobain told Spin in 1993 that he [...] "didn't give a flying fuck" [...] what the lyrics on Bleach were about, figuring [...] "Let's just scream some negative lyrics {{and as long as}} they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay", while the lyrics to Nevermind were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to In Utero were [...] "more focused, they're almost built on themes". Cobain didn't write necessarily in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; the songwriter explained, [...] "I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [...] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most <b>people</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> are".|$|E
2500|$|Keaton's {{first major}} hit since 1996 came in 2003's Something's Gotta Give, {{directed}} by Nancy Meyers and co-starring Jack Nicholson. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 66 and 57 respectively, {{were seen as}} bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy. Twentieth Century Fox, the film's original studio, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were {{too old to be}} bankable. Keaton commented about the situation in Ladies' Home Journal: [...] "Let's face it, <b>people</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and Jack's age are much deeper, much more soulful, because they've seen a lot of life. They {{have a great deal of}} passion and hope—why shouldn't they fall in love? Why shouldn't movies show that?" [...] Keaton played a middle-aged playwright who falls in love with her daughter's much older boyfriend. The film was a major success at the box office, grossing US$125million in North America. Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Nicholson and Keaton bring so much experience, knowledge and humor to their characters that the film works in ways the screenplay might not have even hoped for." [...] The following year, Keaton received her fourth Academy Award nomination for her role in the film.|$|E

The mother of Davis is Jewish and many of her relatives died in the Holocaust. Davis' great aunt though, survived the Holocaust. Regarding the event with 3GNY, Davis said, [...] "I thought it was really cool meeting with them.

2500|$|The {{role was}} {{originated}} on October 29, 1993, by eleven-year-old Jonathan Jackson. Rumors circulated that Jackson’s contract negotiations {{were not going}} well in 1996, and again in 1998, when Jackson responded that he was considering college and had given the series six months notice of his consideration in accordance with his contract. In January 1999, {{it was reported that}} the series had worked out a deal, and Jackson stated he had briefly extended his contract to allow the character's popular romance to continue. His contract allowed him to leave if he received a feature film role, and Jackson left in April, shooting pre-taped scenes that appeared through late May. Jackson explained to Soap Opera Weekly: [...] "I kind of feel that the fact of how much work they've given me this year, at this stage as an actor, they just maxed out quite a bit of what I would do for the show. And I'm at a better age now to go out. There are more projects for <b>people</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> or a little older than there were a few years ago. Hollywood's the kind of town where you kinda have to strike while the iron's hot." [...] Jackson's manager Tony Monziotti released the statement: [...] " [...] has told GH and made it very clear to me that he wants to periodically go back to GH. It's a question of if the storyline warrants it and they want him to come back; Jonathan would be more than happy to." [...] In early 2000, Jackson stated he would enjoy reprising the role but his schedule would not allow it. He suggested a short-term return that could coincide with the departure of co-star Rebecca Herbst (who plays Lucky's love interest Elizabeth Webber) should she not renew her contract, allowing for periodic returns from the couple later on. Although Herbst expressed interest, the show opted to keep the characters on canvas.|$|E
