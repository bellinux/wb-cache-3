40|$|This {{heuristic}} {{journey to}} the Self occurred spontaneously from my life quest. While living with and gazing at symbolic images in my room, I captured their voices unfolding the same message about "going deep down inward {{to search for the}} Self. " I followed the message coming from inner wisdom and realized that my symbolic images and their message were closely related to Cari Jung's perspective of the Self. In this heuristic self-inquiry, I have pursued the self-experience leading me to the essence of the Self, and the symbolic images along with reflexive knowledge were a major guideline to the self-experience of encountering the Self in a metaphoric, safe way. I experienced the symbolic manifestations of the Self by the images of the Shadow, <b>pond,</b> castle, mandala, <b>apple,</b> heart, Christ, and lotus flower. I also experienced fears, which caused resistance or hesitation in my heuristic {{journey to the}} Self. In the process of recognizing and resolving my fears, I could proceed with my heuristic self-inquiry and diminished my resistance. Then, I could expand my limited concepts of the Self, God, and my religion and reached a new understanding of the essence of the Self that the Self is a manifestation of God residing in the heart, deep inside of us. Also I discovered that a heuristic journey on a topic can have several layers of heuristic inquiry, like a spiral shape, in aiming at reaching the core of what is being investigated.

40|$|<b>Pond</b> <b>apple</b> is {{primarily}} water-dispersed, but native and exotic animals are also potential dispersal agents. Previous studies confirmed cassowaries and feral pigs as vectors; {{this study investigated}} the dispersal role of other species, including rodents, wallabies and flying foxes. Infrared motion-detecting cameras recorded three native rodent species consuming seeds: giant white-tailed rats (Uromys caudimaculatis), cane field rats (Rattus sordidus) and pale field rats (Rattus tunneyi). All appeared to destructively consume large quantities of seeds without moving them from host plants. The cameras also recorded agile wallabies (Macropus agilis) consuming seeds. Intact seed was found in 66 % of field dung samples; viability was confirmed by germination from dung. Dung containing seed was found up to 230 m from host plants, sometimes in areas where water dispersal was not possible. The dispersal role of these animals may be significant, given their wide northern Australian distribution. Flying foxes (Pteropus conspicillatus) were not recorded consuming <b>pond</b> <b>apple</b> seeds in this study; anecdotal evidence suggests they consume the flesh and carry fruit short distances from host plants.

40|$|Summary The {{effects of}} root zone {{temperature}} (RZT) and flooding on physiology {{and growth of}} Annona glabra L. (<b>pond</b> <b>apple)</b> and A. muricata L. (soursop) were investigated. Trees planted in containers were exposed to RZTs of 5, 10, 20, 25 or 35 °C in controlled root temperature chambers. Trees at each RZT were either non-flooded (control) or continuously flood-ed. There were four replications over time for each treatment combination. <b>Pond</b> <b>apple</b> was more flood-tolerant than sour-sop. A combination of flooding and RZTs of 5 and 10 °C re-sulted in tree mortality of both species by Week 4. Only trees that appeared to develop morphological adaptations survived continuous flooding. In both species, net CO 2 assimilation (A) decreased to nearly zero within 1 week following exposure to RZTs of 5 or 10 °C and became consistently negative over the remaining experimental period. Flooding reduced leaf chlorohyll index (measured with a SPAD meter), A and plant growth, and increased root electrolyte leakage from soursop. Optimum growth occurred at RZTs of 25 to 35 °C for non-flooded <b>pond</b> <b>apple</b> trees and at 20 to 25 °C for flooded trees.

40|$|Abstract. Annona glabra (<b>pond</b> <b>apple),</b> a {{tropical}} tree growing wild in the Americas and Asia, {{is used in}} traditional medicine against several human ailments, including cancer. To validate the ethnopharmacological claims against cancer, the anticancer effects of alcoholic extracts prepared from <b>pond</b> <b>apple</b> leaves, pulp and seed, were investigated in human leukemia cell lines. The alcoholic extracts were not cytotoxic to normal human lymphocytes. However, extracts were highly cytotoxic to drug sensitive (CEM) and multidrug-resistant leukemia (CEM/VLB) cell lines. The seed extract was more potent than leaf and pulp extracts, and the cytotoxicity values were significantly lower than that for adriamycin.

40|$|<b>Pond</b> <b>apple</b> invades {{riparian}} {{and coastal}} environments with water {{acting as the}} main vector for dispersal. As seeds float and can reach the ocean, a seed tracking model driven by near surface ocean currents was used to develop maps of potential seed dispersal. Seeds were ‘released’ in the model from sites near the mouths of major North Queensland rivers. Most seeds reach land within three months of release, settling predominately on windward-facing locations. During calm and monsoonal conditions, seeds were generally swept in a southerly direction, however movement turns northward during south easterly trade winds. Seeds released in February from the Johnstone River were capable of being moved anywhere from 100 km north to 150 km south depending on prevailing conditions. Although wind driven currents are the primary mechanism influencing seed dispersal, tidal currents, the East Australian Current, and other factors such as coastline orientation, release location and time also {{play an important role}} in determining dispersal patterns. In extreme events such as tropical cyclone Justin in 1997, north east coast rivers could potentially transport seed over 1300 km to the Torres Strait, Papua New Guinea and beyond...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pond</b> <b>apple</b> usually {{occurs in}} swampy areas, but {{mechanical}} control {{may be a}} viable option in some locations during drier periods. Two machines, the Positrack™ and the Tracksaw™, have been trialled for initial kill rate, amount of follow-up control required, safety to field operators, cost-efficiency and selectivity (effect on native vegetation), compared to other control options. The Positrack™ is a tracked bobcat with a slasher-type attachment that cuts individual trees off near ground level and mulches them. It has no on-board herbicide application capability and requires an additional on-ground operator to apply herbicide by hand. The Tracksaw™ is a tracked mini-excavator with a chainsaw bar and spray applicator on the boom that cuts individual trees off near ground level and applies chemical immediately to the cut stump, requiring only a single operator. Initial trials were done in infestations of similar sizes and densities at the Daintree (Positrack™) and in Innisfail (Tracksaw™) in late 2009. Kill rates to date are 83 % for Positrack™ mechanical, 95 % for Positrack™ mechanical plus herbicide, and 78 % for the Tracksaw™ combined treatment.

40|$|Our {{continent}} has a wretched {{history of}} invasive species. Ecosystems have succumbed to exotic {{animals such as}} foxes, rabbits and carp, {{while at the same}} time being beset by strange, virile plants. "Whenever I travel, I'm always amazed by the hold that exotic species have obtained over this land," says Tim Low of the Invasive Species Council. Two centuries ago, when British fleets brought the first bedraggled convicts to Australia, they brought foreign flora as well - including the infamous prickly pear. Shipped across from South America, the cactus slowly became recognised as one of the most invasive weeds ever imported into the country. By the 1920 s, the pear was no longer a garden ornamental or a ferocious homestead hedge; it had stretched its spiky pads, grown into dense, tangled structures, and covered 25 million hectares of Queensland and New South Wales. Last spring, a federally funded weed-awareness campaign was launched to educate people about the plants we purchase, as a third of weeds in Australia are said to originate in our backyards. "When you talk about weed invasion, it is often very pretty plants escaping out of our gardens that cause the problem," says Low. Weeds, we're told, cost the economy around $ 3. 3 billion a year in control efforts and lost production. At the same time, significant resources have been spent determining what constitutes a weed in the first place. In 1999, after recruiting specialists to study and rank Australia's most troublesome plants, commonwealth ministers announced the inaugural list of 'Weeds of National Significance', with species including <b>pond</b> <b>apple,</b> bridal creeper and lantana labelled especially problematic. On the federal government's weed website, each plant's information is accompanied by a floral mug shot...|$|E
40|$|The didemnins are a {{class of}} macrocyclic depsipeptides that were {{isolated}} from a Caribbean tunicate of the family Didemnidae.

The research described herein makes use of fluorescent probes to gain insight into the biological activity of these depsipeptides. Fluorescent didemnin and tamandarin analogs were prepared and were employed in an ecological study to determine the effect of these metabolite analogs on established predator-prey relationships. ^ Pondaplin is a novel cyclic prenylated phenylpropanoid isolated from Annona glabra, which is commonly referred to as <b>pond</b> <b>apple.</b> Research described herein is aimed at developing efficient approaches to structures of this type, which garner interest due to the strain inherent in these molecular architectures. The results of a variety of synthetic strategies are discussed. Additionally, the properties of the pondaplin dimer and trimer are investigated. ^ The yohimbines, members of the Rauwolfia alkaloid family, have attracted a great deal of synthetic interest over the years due to the interesting structures and diverse biological activities of these alkaloids. For some time, it has been known that tryptophan and ninhydrin can be condensed to provide a pentacyclic indole heterocycle bearing a carbon skeleton reminiscent of yohimbane. However, the details of this transformation, including the mechanism, have remained unclear. A simple structural modification has allowed the isolation of a reaction intermediate. This intermediate may be independently converted to the yohimbanone product. We propose a mechanism for this novel rearrangement that is in accord with the known reactivity of ninhydrin. The yohimbanone skeleton has been converted via an oxidative ring opening to a 1 -aroyl-β-carboline- 3 -carboxylate. Compounds of this type {{have been shown to be}} antagonists of benzodiazepines in vivo. ...|$|E
