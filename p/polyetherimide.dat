50|$|The base {{material}} is the flexible polymer film which provides {{the foundation for}} the laminate. Under normal circumstances, the flex circuit {{base material}} provides most primary physical and electrical properties of the flexible circuit. In the case of adhesiveless circuit constructions, the base material provides all of the characteristic properties.While a wide range of thickness is possible, most flexible films are provided in a narrow range of relatively thin dimension from 12 µm to 125 µm (1/2 mil to 5 mils) but thinner and thicker material are possible. Thinner materials are of course more flexible and for most material, stiffness increase is proportional to the cube of thickness. Thus for example, means that if the thickness is doubled, the material becomes eight times stiffer and will only deflect 1/8 as much under the same load.There are a number of different materials used as base films including: polyester (PET), polyimide (PI), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), <b>polyetherimide</b> (PEI), along with various fluropolymers (FEP) and copolymers.

Hybridization is also used {{as a tool for}} structure perfection of multi-phase polymer systems, including, nanocomposites, namely distribution of nanoscale fillers within polymer matrix is improved. Hybridization can be also used for substituting expensive polymer additives with cheaper ones, without losing much of performance characteristics of the composites. It has been shown [1] that in the presence of nanoclay in the polymer based (epoxy, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyamide 6, polyimide) composites percolation threshold is reduced and electrical conductivity, as well as elastic modulus is increased generally due to improved dispersion degree of the conductive nanofiller (graphene, SWCNT, MWCNT, CB) because of reduced re-agglomeration tendency during processing. It has been also shown that geometrically different carbonaceous nanostructures (graphene, SWCNT, MWCNT, ND, CB) prevent agglomeration within the polymer matrix (generally epoxy, styrene-butadienen rubber and high-engineering thermoplastics such as <b>polyetherimides,</b> polysulphones and polyethersulphones) by formation of a co-supporting network of the separate fillers leading to improved mechanical properties, as well as increased electrical and thermal conductivities.

40|$|Fabricating primary {{aircraft}} and spacecraft structures using advanced composite materials entail both benefits and risks. The benefits come from much improved strength-to-weight ratios and stiffness-to-weight ratios, potential for less part count, ability to tailor properties, chemical and solvent resistance, and superior thermal properties. On the other hand, the risks involved include high material costs, lack of processing experience, expensive labor, poor reproducibility, high toxicity for some composites, {{and a variety of}} space induced risks. The purpose of this project is to generate a manufacturing database for a selected number of materials with potential for space applications, and to rely on this database to develop quantitative approaches to screen candidate materials and processes for space applications {{on the basis of their}} manufacturing risks including costs.

It can undergo different constraints like heat or high voltage which influence its performances as insulator. In this study, {{the effects of}} heating on structural and electrical properties of <b>polyetherimide</b> (Ultem 1000) are studied. Approach: PEI samples were heated at different temperatures below the glass transition temperature (175, 190 and 205 °C).

40|$|In this work, {{a method}} for the rapid {{synthesis}} of metallic microtracks on <b>polyetherimide</b> is presented.

40|$|It {{can be seen}} by Dynamic Electrical Analysis {{that the}} {{electrical}} properties of <b>polyetherimide</b> at temperatures above the glass transition are strongly influenced by space charge. We have studied space charge relaxation in two commercial grades of <b>polyetherimide,</b> Ultem 1000 and Ultem 5000, using this technique. The electric modulus formalism has been used to interpret their conductive properties. In both grades of <b>polyetherimide,</b> asymmetric Argand plots are observed, which are related to a sublinear power-law dependency (ω^n with n< 1) in the real part of the conductivity. This behaviour is attributed to correlated ion hopping. The imaginary part of the electric modulus exhibits a peak in the low frequency range associated to conduction. Modelling of this peak allows us to obtain the dependence, among other parameters, of the conductivity (σ_ 0), the fractional exponent (n) and the crossover frequency (ω_p) on the temperature. The α relaxation, that appears at higher frequencies, has also to be modelled since it overlaps the conductivity relaxation. The study of the parameters in terms of the temperature allows us to identify the ones that are thermally activated. The difference between the conductivity relaxation time and the Maxwell relaxation time indicates the presence of deep traps. The coupling model points out that the correlation of the ionic motion diminishes with temperature, probably due to increasing disorder due to thermal agitation...|$|E

Using an in-situ polymerization technique, up to 20 wt. % Cu 3 (BTC) 2 could be homogenously dispersed in all three PEIs. The ODPA-P 1 matrix crystallized when Cu 3 (BTC) 2 was introduced as a filler. Gas permeation studies were performed by analyzing membrane performance using a 50 : 50 CO 2 :CH 4 mixed gas feed.
