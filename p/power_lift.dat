500|$|The {{pumping station}} {{was built by}} John Rennie between 1809 and 1813 to {{overcome}} water supply problems on the canal. It uses a [...] wide wooden breastshot water wheel to drive two Boulton and Watt [...] long cast iron rocking beams, which <b>power</b> <b>lift</b> pumps to raise water [...] up to the canal. The pumping station has undergone several modifications since its initial construction, including revising the wheel into two sections each [...] wide separated by a [...] gap.

5000|$|He {{started working}} as a {{messenger}} boy in Humboldt, Kansas in 1870. Two years later he moved to Peru, Illinois where he became a clerk in the hardware store owned by A. L. Shepard. In 1874 he started work as a machinistâ€™s apprentice at the Peru Plow Company. It was during this time that he invented the first <b>power</b> <b>lift</b> sulky plow in 1878. The device allowed the farmer to remain seated on his horse-drawn plow and press a lever to raise the plow from the earth. Prior to his invention the farmer had to manually lift the plow blade {{at the end of}} each furrow. [...] Most farm implement manufacturers adopted the plow. [...] Bettendorf went on to work at the Moline Plow Company in Moline, Illinois for ten months before becoming the foreman in the fitting department of the Parlin & Orendorff Company in Canton, Illinois, which manufactured plows and other agricultural implements. In 1882 he left Canton and returned to Peru as a supervisor at the Peru Plow Company, where he had been an apprentice. It was here that he invented the Bettendorf metal wheel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Cross-correlation {{of unknown}} {{encrypted}} signals between two Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers {{is used for}} spoofing detection of publicly-known signals. This detection technique {{is one of the}} strongest known defenses against sophisticated spoofing attacks if the defended receiver has only one antenna. The attack strategy of concern overlays false GNSS radio-navigation signals on top of the true signals. The false signals increase in <b>power,</b> <b>lift</b> the receiver tracking loops off of the true signals, and drag the loops and the navigation solution to erroneous, but consistent results. This paper uses hypothesis testing theory to develop a codeless cross-correlation detection method for use in inexpensive, narrow-band civilian GNSS receivers. The detection method is instantiated by using the encrypted military GPS P(Y) code on the L 1 frequency in order to defend the publicly-known civilian GPS C/A code. Successful detection of spoofing attacks is demonstrated by off-line processing of recorded RF data from narrow-band 2. 5 MHz RF front-ends, which attenuate the wide-band P(Y) code by 5. 5 dB. The new technique can detect attacks using correlation intervals of 1. 2 sec or less. Index terms [...] GPS, Global Navigation Satellite System, spoofing detection, hypothesis testing...|$|E
