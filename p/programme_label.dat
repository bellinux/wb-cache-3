The structures of the producers, the influence of compulsory measures, as for example breeding programmes, maintenance and transport conditions, were taken into consideration. 71. 068 fattening pigs from 110 farms were examined at the abattoir. The health and meat quality from two different marketing (producer) organsitions (PIQ 1 and PIQ 2) were compared with that of pigs coming from farms without any meat <b>label</b> <b>programme</b> (PIQ 0). From the frequency of pathological organs in the pigs of farms producing quality label meat (PIQ 1 and PIQ 2) it was clear that compared with the pigs of the producers belonging to PIQ 0 these had not achieved their aim of permantently improving the health of the stock and therefore increasing the quality of the product. The comparison of the meat quality in the three groeups shows that the animals from the meat <b>label</b> <b>programmes</b> (PIQ 1 and PIQ 2) clearly produce meat of better quality than the carcasses from the producers without a meat <b>label</b> <b>programme</b> (PIQ 0).

40|$|Awareness campaigns, {{education}} and training <b>programmes,</b> <b>label</b> schemes and smart metering are all initiatives {{based on the principle}} that more and better information will encourage consumers to use less energy. Initiatives of this type can realise efficiency savings of up to 30 %, and are likely to remain politically popular while preferred by the public to legislation or fines. While widespread, such programmes can have mixed performance, with savings often not reaching potential. This article investigates whether existing theoretical models can usefully be combined for evaluations of such message-oriented programmes. To do this it examines relationships between the variables of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) using empirical data from participants exposed to energy behaviour change projects. Analysis revealed that when used together, the theories may offer insight into the impact of messaging. While a single exploratory study can only describe what has occurred, it offers initial evidence to advocate further analysis of the potential of the combined framework.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{scientific}} evidence that preventive physical exercise is effective even in high age. In contrast, there are few opportunities of preventive exercise for highly aged people endangered by or actually in need of care. For example, {{they would not be}} able to easily go to training facilities; standard exercises may be too intensive and therefore be harmful to them; orientation disorders like dementia would exacerbate individuals and groups in following instructions and keeping exercises going. In order to develop appropriate interventions, these and other issues were assigned to different levels: the individual-social level (ISL), the organisational-institutional level (OIL) and the political-cultural level (PCL). Consequently, this conceptional framework was utilised for development, implementation and evaluation of a new strength and balance exercise programme for old people endangered by or actually in need of daily care. The present paper contains the development of this <b>programme</b> <b>labeled</b> "fit for 100 ", and a study protocol of an interventional single-arm multi-centre trial. Methods The intervention consisted of (a) two group training sessions every week over one year, mainly resistance exercises, accompanied by sensorimotor and communicative group exercises and games (ISL), (b) a sustainable implementation concept, starting new groups by instructors belonging to the project, followed by training and supervision of local staff, who stepwise take over the group (OIL), (c) informing and convincing activities in professional, administrative and governmental contexts, public relation activities, and establishing an advisory council with renowned experts and public figures (PCL). Participating institutions of geriatric care were selected through several steps of quality criteria assessment. Primary outcome measures were continuous documentation of individual participation (ISL), number of groups continued without external financial support (at the end of the project, and after one year) (OIL). Secondary outcome was measured by sensorimotor tests and care-related assessments in the beginning and every 16 weeks (ISL), by qualitative outcome descriptions 12 months after group implementation (OIL) and by analysis of media response and structured interviews with stakeholders, also after 12 months (PCL). Conclusion Exemplarily, preventive exercise has been established for a neglected target population. The multi-level approach used here seems to be helpful to overcome institutional and individual (attitude) barriers. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 55213782 </p...|$|R

40|$|Green Freight Asia is {{a three-part}} case series {{featured}} in the 2014 APEX Business-IT Global Case Challenge. The case is best used for group projects or workshop assignments concerning business-IT related topics. In this case, students take {{on the role of}} a small firm pitching to collaborate with GFA on an IT solution partnership to support GFA’s programme for the adoption of green freight practices in the Asia Pacific region. The case could also be adapted for classroom facilitation with adequate preparation. The first part, Green Freight Asia (A) : Driving the Adoption of Sustainable Supply Chain Practices, chronicles the formation of Green Freight Asia (GFA), a private sector initiative that grew out of a network of companies that came together in 2011 to reduce air pollution and CO 2 from road freight emissions in the Asia Pacific region. GFA’s primary goal was to incentivise the adoption of green freight practices by creating a label that recognised and rewarded companies for their commitment to improving fuel efficiency and reducing vehicle emissions. In August 2013, GFA was formally incorporated as a Singapore-based not-for-profit organisation. Over the next seven months, the fledgling organisation developed the GFA <b>Label</b> <b>programme.</b> The programme established four levels of recognition, each represented by a logo with a corresponding number of Green Leafs. The criteria for earning the Leafs depended on whether the GFA member operated its own fleet of vehicles, used third-party fleets, or both. By the time the structure of the GFA <b>Label</b> <b>programme</b> was finalised in March 2014, it had already attracted the interest of numerous shippers, freight carriers, and logistics service providers. However, GFA still lacked the necessary data management systems and processes to run the programme. For example, to earn a Green Leaf, a company had to report on having met certain pre-requisite criteria for that Leaf. This meant that GFA needed a mechanism to collect, verify and incorporate company reported data into the <b>labelling</b> <b>programme.</b> These operational elements were crucial to encouraging broad participation and establishing the credibility of the GFA Label. To address this issue, in May 2014, Stephan Schablinski, {{the chief executive officer of}} GFA, sought potential partners to collaborate with GFA on a comprehensive IT solution for the programme. He was not interested in a typical IT services arrangement – in part because GFA lacked the financial resources to pay the development costs up front – but also he believed that working with GFA could provide ample business opportunities for a partner that was creative and entrepreneurial. However, Schablinski was anxious. In just one week, the GFA <b>Label</b> <b>Programme</b> was due to be launched at the Green Freight Asia Spring Meeting. At that event, he intended to announce the IT solution partnership and commit to an aggressive target of growing GFA’s member base from nine to 200 companies operating in 10 countries within a year of launching the programme. Will a potential partner come forward with a realistic solution for a data management system in time for the meeting – and will that solution be enough to help GFA meet its goals...|$|R

Studies conducted earlier, indicated that the programmes {{had no effect on}} consumers' eating behaviour. Consequently, the more specific {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify explanations for the ineffectiveness of the programmes and to formulate recommendations for future programmes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The environmental <b>programmes</b> included <b>labelling</b> of healthy products and increasing the range of healthy foods on offer. The education programme consisted of several elements, such as brochures and a self-help guide. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 managers of supermarkets and worksite cafeterias where the programmes were implemented. RESULTS: Although materials were not always entirely compatible with the different supermarkets and worksite cafeterias, the degree of implementation was satisfactory. According to the managers, the programmes were not striking enough, the labelling would have been more effective if it had discriminated between different brands of a product, and the number of new products was too small compared with the total range of foods on offer. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that programmes should be promoted intensively. Furthermore, the relevant manufacturers and wholesalers supplying worksite cafeterias should be encouraged to increase their range of suitable low-fat products.

They were {{individually}} weighed at hatching and during the growing stage, and the daily feed intake was recorded. A sample of 12 males of each genetic type was slaughtered for carcass characteristics. Sensory analysis was done on each genetic type after boiling or roasting. The Label Rouge chickens were heavier than the local chickens at hatch (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Background of the {{document}} With the 6 th Framework Programme (FP 6) having entered into its second half, preparations are underway for FP 7 {{which is due to}} be launched in late 2006. The multi-annual framework programmes are an important instrument for the implementation of the European Research Area, and the activities in the area of "Human Resources and Mobility", i. e. the Marie Curie Actions, are an essential part of this. At a "Stakeholders Meeting" in Brussels on 20 December 2004, the European Commission presented its ideas and proposals regarding the future of the Marie Curie Actions to a selected group of participants. The Chair of the MCFA attended this meeting on behalf of the Association. Shortly before the meeting the Commission sent a number of (draft) documents to the participants in order to prepare the discussions. These documents were declared "confidential" so that the MCFA did not have the chance to conduct a broad consultation of its members regarding the Commission's plans for the Marie Curie Actions in FP 7. However, following internal discussions the MCFA Administrative Board and Advisory Board prepared a document in reply to the proposals discussed at the meeting. This document was sent to the Commission in early January 2005. Marie Curie Actions in FP 7 - proposals by the European Commission 	"Individual Marie Curie fellowships for life-long training and career development" For the Individual Marie Curie Fellowships the European Commission suggests the co-funding of regional, national or international programmes which are corresponding to the Framework Programme objectives. The individual applicants would then submit their proposals to the co-funded programme under a joint Marie Curie fellowship action and the <b>programme's</b> <b>label.</b> During a transitional period the current application mode would remain in existence. However, the idea is to phase out the current (Intra-European) Individual fellowships completely and to switch entirely to a co-funding mechanism. 	"Marie Curie Networks (MCN) for early-stage researchers" The European Commission plans to merge the actions Early Stage Research Training (EST) and Research Training Networks (RTN) to one single action, the "Marie Curie Networks" (MCN) in FP 7. This action would be implemented through the selection of small- to medium sized networks with typically not less than 3 and not more than 10 partners. 	"Expanding the industry dimension in Marie Curie Actions in FP 7 " The participation of industry in the Marie Curie Actions will receive special attention in FP 7. In order to achieve this, the Commission proposes a new Industry-Academia partnership scheme, similar to the one currently implemented in FP 6, but with more flexible rules concerning the criteria for the eligibility of researchers to be recruited within this scheme. 	"Realising the full research potential of EU 25 : The “XXXX” scheme" The main objective of this new scheme is to expand the collaborations between research centres/researchers from less-favoured regions in Europe and other EU research centres. It includes special measures to fight brain-drain from the less favoured regions of the EU and to encourage the return of nationals from these regions having left their country. 	"The international dimension of Marie Curie Actions in FP 7 " (draft) Under this header the Incoming/Outgoing International Fellowships are discussed, which will be continued but with more flexible conditions. It is proposed that the International Reintegration Grants shall become available to researchers having left Europe for three years (instead of the current five years).

Additionally, a detailed questionnaire was filled out with all producers to determine risk factors potentially associated with lesions. Data were analysed using hierarchical proportional odds models. About 33 % of the does examined had lesions, including wounds that were almost healed and small scratches. Severe lesions were counted on 9 % of the animals. Differences between seasons in lesions score were identified, with the extent of lesions being higher in summer than in spring. Fewer lesions occurred on farms on which mastitis was more common. More lesions were found on farms where the does were isolated between littering and artificial insemination than on farms without isolation. According to the producers, most of the aggression occurred directly after the isolation phase when the does were regrouped again. We conclude that lesions in group-housed breeding does might be reduced by appropriate reproductive management...|$|R

A diet {{high in fat}} {{results in}} dietary-related diseases, which have reached {{epidemic}} proportions in South Africa. Nutritional labelling {{has the potential to}} alter consumers’ knowledge of attitude and behaviour towards their fat intake. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the effects of nutritional labelling on the population’s fat-intake through a systematic literature review. Electronic databases, reference lists of relevant studies and the Internet were searched, to identify studies that could help to answer the problem statement. Relevant citations were independently identified by two investigators based on the established inclusion-criteria. After this the full text of the selected citations were obtained and filtered independently by each investigator based on the inclusion- and exclusion criteria. The characteristics of each study was recorded in specially developed data extraction forms by the investigator herself and was checked by a second investigator. The primary objective of the study was to investigate nutritional labelling on food packaging. Two other forms of labelling were included to gain a more concise perception of consumers’ knowledge and practices regarding information on fat. These other forms were point-of-sale labelling (in supermarkets, in restaurants, by vending machines) and experimental labelling (labels spesifically designed to indicate the fat-content of a food item). A total of 59 relevant studies were included based on the inclusion-criteria. Although only a few studies assessed the effect of labelling on diet, there was evidence that the use of labels resulted in lower fat intake. Women older than 35 years with higher education levels, who used nutritional supplements, and who were in the maintenance stage of change to a lower fat diet, and who believed in the importance of nutrition, were between 50 % to 80 % higher users of information about fat than their counterparts. Fat is the food component which was most looked at on the food label (50 % to 80 %). Small changes in fat intake occured due to point-of-sale <b>labelling,</b> but <b>labelling</b> <b>programmes</b> which combined <b>labelling</b> with additional information on fat (e. g. pamphlets), increased visibility and nutrition education programmes, were more successful. People generally perceived products lower in fat as less pleasant, but sensory judgement of the products labelled with a low fat content were related to a person’s beliefs and concerns towards fat. Nutritional labelling can be an effective measure, which can be used to reduce the population’s fat intake; however, more research is needed to assess the effect of labelling on fat content of their diet.

40|$|In {{this opinion}} paper we {{introduce}} a school-wide concept at doctoral level aimed at professional practitioners, {{who wish to}} stay in their respective areas of work. The rationale behind this school-wide concept is that in Hungary, where its implementation is currently in progress, gaining a PhD automatically means becoming an academic. However, there is a significant demand amongst high-performing professional practitioners, who are not inclined to become academics, for further learning opportunities at the highest level. They are our target market. We also wish to respond to one of the current challenges the academy is globally facing globally, namely to maintain the highest scholarly standard while achieving high relevance for practice. The school-wide concept that can adequately engage with both of these problems is naturally a work-based one. Thus what we outline here is a professional doctorate in a school-wide context. We frame this new approach based on three principles: Popper’s tentative problem solving process, Nicolescu’s method of transdisciplinarity, and Bourdieu’s approach to reflexivity. From these three principles we have synthesised a transdisciplinary tentative process of creative problem solving, which is both reflexive and reflective. We bring this process into the foreground and build a knowledge landscape in the background. The taught components (content) of the knowledge landscape are delivered by the disciplines involved in the form of high-level meta-knowledge. Since there are two focal dimensions of the <b>programme</b> content, we <b>label</b> it bifocal. The enquiring practitioners, who are also passionate learners, will make their journey through the professional doctoral school. They will follow their own transdisciplinary tentative processes of creative problem solving in this bifocal knowledge landscape, which is composed of taught components and additional elements that are to be discovered or created in the community of New Alexandrians...|$|R
40|$|The trisomy {{of human}} {{chromosome}} 21 (Hsa 21), which causes Down syndrome (DS), {{is the most}} common viable human aneuploidy. In contrast to trisomy, the complete monosomy (M 21) of Hsa 21 is lethal, and only partial monosomy or mosaic monosomy of Hsa 21 is seen. Both conditions lead to variable physiological abnormalities with constant intellectual disability, locomotor deficits, and altered muscle tone. To search for dosage-sensitive genes involved in DS and M 21 phenotypes, we created two new mouse models: the Ts 3 Yah carrying a tandem duplication and the Ms 3 Yah carrying a deletion of the Hspa 13 -App interval syntenic with 21 q 11. 2 -q 21. 3. Here we report that the trisomy and the monosomy of this region alter locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and energetic balance. The expression profiling of skeletal muscles revealed global changes in the regulation of genes implicated in energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. These genes are downregulated in Ts 3 Yah mice and upregulated in Ms 3 Yah mice. The shift in skeletal muscle metabolism correlates with a change in mitochondrial proliferation without an alteration in the respiratory function. However, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from mitochondrial complex I decreased in Ms 3 Yah mice, while the membrane permeability of Ts 3 Yah mitochondria slightly increased. Thus, we demonstrated how the Hspa 13 -App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles certainly as a consequence of change in dose of Gabpa, Nrip 1, and Atp 5 j. Our results indicate that the copy number variation in the Hspa 13 -App region has a peripheral impact on locomotor activity by altering muscle function.

40|$|A {{presentation}} of progress towards a PhD. Abstract PhD proposal: Context. A variety of contexts for learning may be identified - formal, informal and non-formal (Eraut, 2000, EC, 2001). There is {{a proliferation of}} access to ICT in non-formal home and community settings (Lewin, 2004, BESA, 2005). It would seem self-evident therefore that an individual with high ICT capability may have learnt this through formal school programmes, through use of ICT to support other formal study or in non-formal, ‘leisure’ activities. Colley et al define {{of the structure of}} any learning activity (2002), its setting and purposes can be analysed in relation to its process, including assessment, and content. McFarlane (2001) identifies the tension between the use of ICT and its assessment. For most school students, formal external assessment of ICT and other subjects in secondary schools is carried out at three points – the end of Key Stage 3 at age 14, GCSE or equivalent at age 16, and GCE A level at age 18 (with partial, AS assessment at age 17) (DfES, 2005 a). This is a fast changing landscape (McCormick, 2004). Since 2002, students {{have had the opportunity to}} follow ‘vocational’ programmes in ICT, known as Applied ICT at GCSE and GCE level. The first examinations for these programmes took place in 2004 alongside the ‘standard’, or ‘non-applied’, <b>programmes,</b> simply <b>labelled</b> as ICT. At almost the same time, the Tomlinson Review of 14 - 19 Education (DfES, 2004) was published with some of its recommendations leading to a subsequent White Paper (DfES, 2005 b), echoing earlier attempts to bring parity between ‘academic’ and ‘vocational’ routes (Yeoman, 1996). The aims of the 14 - 19 White Paper included making the curriculum more relevant and personalised to the needs of students. A widening of the choice of validated qualifications resulted (QCA, 2006). The 14 - 19 qualification system now includes a range of awards that have been given a level on the National Qualifications Framework (QCA, 2004) and, concomitantly, a ‘equivalence’ to GCSEs or GCEs. Most significant of these awards is the Diploma in Digital Applications (DiDA). This programme has, at its heart, the use of ICT for communication and creative purposes (Edexcel, 2004). It is significant because many schools in the Nottingham Trent University initial teacher education (ITE) partnership are abandoning GCSEs in ICT and Applied ICT in its favour (Williamson, 2006). A strand of initial teacher education (ITE) in Applied ICT has been introduced following the Tomlinson Review of 14 - 19 Education (DfES, 2004 a) and subsequent White Paper (DfES, 2005), In response to these, the Teaching and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) has made funds available for the training of teachers in vocational subjects, including Applied ICT (TDA, 2003). Thus ‘Applied ICT’ has entered the vocabulary of qualifications and curricula, although it means two things – the qualification and the PGCE route of training. It is this route that I am strand leader for at NTU. Alongside the changes to the assessment system there has some research, the majority funded by the Government, into the impact of ICT (Becta, 2002, Passey and Rogers, 2004) and students’ perceptions of ICT (Somekh and Mavers, 2003, Jarvis et al, 2005). Allied to this is the growing importance of personalisation of curriculum to meet individual needs and abilities (DfES, 2004 b, OECD 2006). Rationale. This thesis will critically analyse the relationship between the levels of students’ ICT capability reported by formal external assessment processes and the levels reported on and observed outside of those processes. Anecdotal evidence and informal observations in many schools and home situations leads the author to question whether there is some mismatch between the two. The new ‘vocational’ curricula, including those for ICT, are designed to put learning into a real context (DfES, 2005) resulting in learning that is situated in those contexts. This situated learning (Bruner, 1977, cited in Macleod and Golby, 2003) poses challenges for teachers as they have to ensure that learning is meaningful because it is “fully related to the context in which it is produced” (Macleod and Golby, 2003 : 354). A question remains as to the extent of the relevance to learners of the ‘real contexts’ (DfES, 2005 b) embedded in the school curricula. ICT is reported to have a positive impact on motivation (Becta, 2003 a) and general levels of secondary school attainment (Becta, 2003 b). Are these real contexts the same as those in which students demonstrate their highest levels of capability remains a moot point and a focus for this research. Methodological approach and methods. The research paradigm is qualitative using the criteria of Robson (2002) The personal situation of the author provides for ready access to a number of schools and students in those schools. The research will be carried out in a natural setting of the schools and informal learning settings; it will use the ‘human instrument’ of students, teachers and others, explore tacit knowledge and perceptions through qualitative methods, and adopt purposive sampling through selection of students on Applied ICT and other programmes. Thus it will have a naturalistic (Robson, 2002) and interpretative (Denzin and Lincoln, 2000) approach. For similar reasons, and following Reeves (1993), a wholly quantitative approach to this investigation would yield deficient results. This tradition of research is variously described as ‘interpretative’ ‘qualitative’ (Patton, 1990) or ‘anti positivist’ (Cohen, Manion and Morrison, 2000). There will be elements of case study (Stake in Denzin and Lincoln, 2000) and illuminative evaluation (Parlett and Hamilton, 1972; Patton, 1990). My role in the research will be both as a practitioner and a researcher. The results of my research will also impact on my practice. Thus there are elements of action research (McNiff and Whitehead, 2002) although the nature of the data collection from others lends it a more empirical approach. The data collection on the perceptions of students will come from the students themselves, their teachers and others involved with learning. It will also be based on an examination of the work produced in their learning on ICT programmes. This data collection will come from numerous sources and following Punch (1998) this again leads to a situating of the enquiry in a naturalistic, interpretative frame. The students’ own perceptions, opinions and interpretations of their ICT capability and those of their teachers will be analysed against the reported levels of attainment in formal external secondary school assessments...|$|R
