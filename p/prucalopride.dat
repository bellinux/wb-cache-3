50|$|<b>Prucalopride,</b> a {{first in}} class dihydro-benzofuran-carboxamide, is a selective, high {{affinity}} serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist with enterokinetic activities. <b>Prucalopride</b> alters colonic motility patterns via serotonin 5-HT4 receptor stimulation: it stimulates colonic mass movements, which provide the main propulsive force for defecation.|$|E
50|$|The {{observed}} {{effects are}} exerted via highly selective action on 5-HT4 receptors: <b>prucalopride</b> has >150-fold higher affinity for 5-HT4 receptors than for other receptors. <b>Prucalopride</b> differs from other 5-HT4 agonists such as tegaserod and cisapride, which at therapeutic concentrations also {{interact with other}} receptors (5-HT1B/D and the cardiac human ether-a-go-go K+ or hERG channel respectively) and this {{may account for the}} adverse cardiovascular events that have resulted in the restricted availability of these drugs.

50|$|The 5-HT4 {{receptor}} {{is thought}} to {{play a significant role}} in both the physiology and pathophysiology of GI tract motility. Therefore, 5-HT4 receptors have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for diseases related to GI dysmotility such as chronic constipation. Some of these prokinetic agents, such as mosapride and cisapride, classic benzamides, have only moderate affinity for 5HT4 receptors. In recent years, it has become clear that the selectivity profile is a major determinant of the risk-benefit profile of this class of agent. As such, the relatively poor selectivity profile of cisapride versus other receptors (especially hERG ether-a-go-go K+ channels) contributes to its potential to cause cardiac arrhythmias. <b>Prucalopride,</b> a first in class benzofuran, is a selective, high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist that stimulates colonic mass movements, which provide the main propulsive force to defecation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Prucalopride</b> is a {{selective}} and specific 5 -hydroxytryptamine(4) receptor agonist {{that is known}} to increase stool frequency and to accelerate colonic transit. AIM: To investigate the effect of <b>prucalopride</b> on high-amplitude propagated contractions and segmental pressure waves in healthy volunteers. METHODS: After 1 week of dosing (<b>prucalopride</b> or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion), colonic pressures were recorded in 10 healthy subjects using a solid-state pressure catheter with six sensors spaced 10 cm apart. Subjects kept diary records of their bowel habits (frequency, consistency and straining). High-amplitude propagated contractions were analysed visually, comparing their total numbers and using 10 -min time windows. Segmental pressure waves were analysed using computer algorithms, quantifying the incidence, amplitude, duration and area under the curve of all detected peaks. RESULTS: When taking <b>prucalopride,</b> stool frequency increased, consistency decreased and subjects strained less. <b>Prucalopride</b> just failed to increase {{the total number of}} high-amplitude propagated contractions (P= 0. 055).

The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of <b>prucalopride</b> on ICaL, action potentials, refractory period and arrhythmic activity in human atrial myocytes, and to compare these with the effects of 5 -HT, using the whole-cell perforated patch-clamp technique. <b>Prucalopride</b> (10 - 9 - 10 - 4 M) produced a concentration-dependent increase in ICaL amplitude, with a maximum response at 10 µM, from - 5. 3 ± 0. 6 to - 10. 9 ± 1. 5 pA/pF (p&# 60; 0. 05; n= 22 cells, 10 patients), without affecting its voltage-dependency. Subsequent application of 10 µM 5 -HT further increased ICaL to - 17. 7 ± 2. 8 pA/pF (p&# 60; 0. 05; n= 16 cells, 9 patients). The increase in ICaL by <b>prucalopride,</b> 98 ± 15 %, was significantly smaller than that by 5 -HT, 233 ± 26 % (p&# 60; 0. 05). <b>Prucalopride</b> (10 µM) significantly increased the action potential duration at 50 % repolarisation (APD 50) from 12 ± 2 to 17 ± 3 ms (p&# 60; 0. 05; n= 22 cells, 9 patients).

Data sources included published <b>prucalopride</b> clinical trials, published Dutch price/tariff lists, and national population statistics. The model simulated the clinical and economic outcomes associated with <b>prucalopride</b> vs. standard treatment and had a cycle length of 1 month and a follow-up time of 1 year. Response to treatment was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved "normal bowel function". One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the base case. Results: In the base case analysis, the cost of <b>prucalopride</b> relative to continued laxative treatment was 9015 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Extensive sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses confirmed that the base case cost-effectiveness estimate was robust. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the model was most sensitive in response to prucalopride; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from 6475 to 15, 380 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that there is a greater than 80 % probability that <b>prucalopride</b> would be cost-effective compared with continued standard treatment, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20, 000 per QALY from a Dutch societal perspective.

40|$|Background: In the {{gastrointestinal}} tract of several species, facilitating 5 -HT 4 receptors were proposed on myenteric cholinergic neurons innervating smooth muscle by invitro {{study of the}} effect of the selective 5 -HT 4 receptor agonist <b>prucalopride</b> on submaximal cholinergic contractions. This was not yet established in the murine {{gastrointestinal tract}}. Methods: In circular smooth muscle strips from murine fundus, jejunum and colon, contractions were induced by electrical field stimulation in the presence of guanethidine, L-NAME and for colon also MRS 2500. Submaximal contractions were induced to study the influence of <b>prucalopride.</b> Key Results: Electrical field stimulation at reduced voltage induced reproducible submaximal neurogenic and cholinergic contractions as the contractions were abolished by tetrodotoxin and atropine. Hexamethonium had no systematic inhibitory effect but mecamylamine reduced the responses, suggesting that part of the cholinergic response is due to activation of preganglionic neurons. <b>Prucalopride</b> concentration-dependently increased the submaximal cholinergic contractions in the three tissue types, reaching maximum from 0. 03 mol/L onwards. The facilitation in the different series with 0. 03 mol/L <b>prucalopride</b> ranged from 41 % to 104 %, 30 % to 76 % and 24 % to 74 % in fundus, jejunum, and colon, respectively.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the pharmacokinetic properties and excretion of <b>prucalopride</b> in healthy individuals, using a microtracer approach with 14 C radioactivity detection using liquid scintillation counting and accelerator mass spectrometry. MethodsThis was a single-period, open-label, nonrandomized absorption, metabolism, and excretion study of [14 C]prucalopride. Participants were 6 healthy men aged 18 to 50 years. After screening, participants were administered a single dose of [14 C]prucalopride succinate 2 mg (~ 200 nCi). Postadministration, urine, feces, and blood samples were collected over a 10 -day period. Safety and adverse event data were also collected. FindingsAlmost 100 % of the administered dose of radioactivity was recovered, with a mean (SD) of 84. 2 % (8. 88 %) recovered in urine and 13. 3 % (1. 73 %) recovered in feces. The mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of 1. 9 indicated uptake of <b>prucalopride</b> into blood cells. The renal clearance of <b>prucalopride</b> was 17. 0 (2. 5) L/h, which is higher than the glomerular filtration rate in healthy individuals, suggesting active renal transport of <b>prucalopride.</b> <b>Prucalopride</b> was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) has {{negative effects on}} quality of life (QOL). <b>Prucalopride</b> is a new, selective 5 -HT 4 agonist and enterokinetic with strong clinical data in chronic constipation. This study investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of <b>prucalopride</b> in patients with noncancer pain and OIC. Methods A phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 196 patients randomized to placebo (n = 66), <b>prucalopride</b> 2 mg (n = 66) or 4 mg (n = 64), for 4 weeks, was carried out. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with increase from baseline of C 1 spontaneous complete bowel movement (SCBM) /week. Secondary endpoints [proportion of patients with C 3 SCBM/week, weekly frequency of (SC) BM, severity of constipation, and efficacy of treatment], adverse events (AEs), and safety parameters were also monitored. Results More patients had an increase from baseline of C 1 SCBM per week (weeks 1 – 4) in the <b>prucalopride</b> groups [35. 9 % (2 mg) and 40. 3 % (4 mg) ] versus placebo (23. 4 %), reaching statistical significance in week 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{constipation}} (CC) {{is common}} {{and there is}} a need for more effective and better-tolerated agents that normalize bowel function without affecting secretion. <b>Prucalopride</b> is a novel, selective serotonin(4) receptor agonist with enterokinetic properties. AIMS: Pilot study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of <b>prucalopride</b> and placebo in patients with severe CC referred to a tertiary centre. METHODS: After 4 -weeks' run in, patients were randomized to 4 weeks' once daily, double-blind treatment with either <b>prucalopride</b> 4 mg (n = 27) or placebo (n = 26). A 50 % dose reduction after 2 weeks' treatment was possible for patients with an excessive gastrointestinal response to the study medication (severe cramps, abdominal pain, and diarrhea). Patients assessed efficacy using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and recorded bowel function in daily diaries. The investigator assessed efficacy and total gut transit time (marker study). RESULTS: Patient VAS assessment demonstrated that <b>prucalopride</b> was significantly more effective than placebo in softening stools, and decreasing straining and time to first stool. <b>Prucalopride</b> also had a positive effect on stool frequency, feeling of complete evacuation and total gut transit time, although these differences were not statistically significant compared with placebo. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms and headache; most were mild to moderate. There were no clinically relevant effects on cardiovascular or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily <b>prucalopride</b> 4 mg for 4 weeks is effective and well tolerated in patients with severe CC. It improves whole gut transit, reducing straining, softening stools and reducing time to first bowel movement. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Georges CoremansDivision of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, University of Leuven, Leuven, BelgiumIntroduction: Chronic {{constipation}} is {{a common}} condition {{that is difficult to}} treat. Existing options for the treatment of patients with different subgroups of constipation are limited. A new efficacious and safe drug is needed to limit the frequently observed adverse effects induced by laxatives, to improve general wellbeing and quality of life, and to provide an alternative for enemas or even resectional surgery in patients in whom stimulant laxatives cause disabling adverse effects or fail to increase bowel movement frequency. Aims: The {{purpose of this article is}} to assess the current evidence supporting the use of the selective and high affinity serotonin- 4 (5 -HT 4) receptor agonist <b>prucalopride</b> in the management of chronic constipation. Evidence review: There are now convincing data from phase II and multicenter phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that <b>prucalopride</b> treatment results in a clinically meaningful increase in the number of spontaneous complete bowel movements, a reduction of perceived severity of symptoms and improved disease-related quality of life in a significant proportion of patients. There is a rapid onset of the effect and the improvement is maintained for at least 12 weeks. <b>Prucalopride</b> in a dose of up to 4 mg per day appeared generally well tolerated and devoid of serious cardiac events. Adverse events, most frequently headache and nausea, are usually mild or moderate and occur mainly during the first days of treatment. <b>Prucalopride</b> should be used with prudence and with careful assessment of the benefit-risk ratio until more clinical and electrophysiologic data become available, because relatively few patients have been exposed to the drug for long periods of time. Place in therapy: <b>Prucalopride</b> 1 &ndash; 2 mg once daily may be given to patients suffering from chronic constipation for whom laxatives do not provide adequate relief of their symptoms. Patients with severe constipation and slow transit, who frequently develop tolerance to stimulant laxatives, are also eligible for <b>prucalopride</b> treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVES:Prucalopride is {{effective}} at alleviating symptoms of chronic constipation in women. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the efficacy of 12 weeks of <b>prucalopride</b> treatment compared with placebo in men with chronic constipation. METHODS:This was a multicenter, stratified, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT 01147926). The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a mean of three or more spontaneous complete bowel movements (SCBMs) per week across the treatment period. Efficacy end points were assessed using daily electronic diaries, global assessment of the severity of constipation and efficacy of treatment, and Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM) and Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) questionnaires. RESULTS:In total, 374 patients were enrolled in the study. Significantly more patients achieved a mean of three or more SCBMs per week in the <b>prucalopride</b> group (37. 9 %) than in the placebo group (17. 7 %, P< 0. 0001). The proportion of patients rating their constipation treatment as "quite a bit" to "extremely" effective at the final on-treatment visit was 46. 7 and 30. 4 % in the <b>prucalopride</b> and placebo groups, respectively. The difference between treatment groups was statistically significant (P< 0. 0001). The proportion of patients with an improvement of at least 1 point in PAC-QOL satisfaction subscale score was 52. 7 and 38. 8 % in the <b>prucalopride</b> and placebo groups, respectively (P= 0. 0035). <b>Prucalopride</b> had a good safety profile and was well tolerated.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A {{strategy}} to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{is to increase}} the soluble form of amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha), a promnesic protein, in the brain. Because strong evidence supports beneficial effects of 5 -hydroxytryptamine 5 -HT(4) receptor agonists in memory and learning, we investigated the role of 5 -HT(4) receptors on APP processing in 8 weeks-old male C 57 BL/ 6 j mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice were given, subcutaneously, <b>prucalopride</b> or ML 10302 (s. c.), two highly selective 5 -HT(4) receptor agonists and, up to 240 min later, the hippocampus and cortex were analysed by Western blot for sAPPalpha determination. KEY RESULTS: <b>Prucalopride</b> (5 or 10 mg kg(- 1)) significantly increased sAPPalpha levels in the hippocampus and cortex, but did not modify the expression level of APP mRNA as detected by quantitative RT-PCR. A selective 5 -HT(4) receptor antagonist, GR 125487 (1 mg kg(- 1), s. c.) inhibited <b>prucalopride</b> induced- increase in sAPPalpha levels. In addition, levels of sAPPalpha were increased by ML 10302 only at 20 mg kg(- 1) and was limited to the cortex. Also, <b>prucalopride</b> increased sAPPalpha levels in the cortex of a transgenic mouse model of AD, expressing the London mutation of APP. Furthermore, the combined injection of a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil and <b>prucalopride</b> induced a synergic increase in sAPPalpha levels in the cortex and hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results demonstrate that the 5 -HT(4) receptor {{plays a key role in}} the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP metabolism in vivo and give support to the beneficial use of 5 -HT(4) agonists for AD treatment. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} study 5 -HT 4 receptors in canine stomach {{contractility}} both in vivo and in vitro. In anaesthetized Beagle dogs, the selective 5 -HT 4 receptor agonist <b>prucalopride</b> (i. v.) induced dose-dependent tonic stomach contractions under isobaric conditions, an effect that was antagonized by the selective 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonist GR 125487 (10 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.). Electrical field stimulation (EFS) of corpus longitudinal muscle strips resulted in atropine- and tetrodotoxin-sensitive contractions (L-NOARG (0. 1 [*]mM) {{present in all}} organ bath solutions). <b>Prucalopride</b> increased these contractions (maximal response after single-dose addition (0. 3 [*]μM) : 165 % of initial value, or after cumulative addition: 188 %). In the presence of methysergide (3 [*]μM), 5 -HT also increased EFS-contractions (after single-dose addition (0. 3 [*]μM) : increase to 192 %, after cumulative addition: 148 %). The selective 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonists GR 113808 (0. 1 [*]μM) or GR 125487 (10 [*]nM) antagonized the <b>prucalopride</b> (0. 3 [*]μM) -induced contraction increments. When EFS-induced contractions were blocked by atropine or tetrodotoxin, <b>prucalopride</b> was ineffective. In the presence of methysergide (3 [*]μM), the contraction increases to 5 -HT (0. 3 [*]μM) were prevented by GR 113808 (0. 1 [*]μM). The <b>prucalopride</b> curve (pEC 50 7. 9) was shifted in parallel to the right by GR 113808 3 [*]nM (pA 2 9. 4). In the presence of methysergide (3 [*]μM), the curve to 5 -HT (pEC 50 8. 1) was competitively antagonized by GR 113808, yielding a Schild slope of 0. 8 ± 0. 2 (pKB of 9. 1 with unit Schild slope). In corpus circular muscle strips, the <b>prucalopride</b> (0. 3 [*]μM) -induced augmentation of EFS-contractions (258 %) was also prevented by GR 113808 (0. 1 [*]μM) (124 %). In conclusion, the effects of 5 -HT 4 receptor agonists on proximal stomach motor activity in vivo {{can be explained by}} an effect on 5 -HT 4 receptors on cholinergic nerves within the gastric muscle wall...|$|E
