25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} film capacitors is {{their ability to}} withstand high peak voltage or <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> surge pulses. This capability depends on all internal connections of the film capacitor withstanding the <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> loads up to the maximum specified temperature. The collateral contact layers (schoopage) with the electrodes can be a potential limitation of <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> carrying capacity.|$|E
25|$|At sin(ωt) = -1, the {{capacitor}} has {{a maximum}} (or <b>peak)</b> <b>current</b> whereby I0 = ωCV0. The ratio of peak voltage to <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> {{is due to}} capacitive reactance (denoted XC).|$|E

25|$|Solid {{tantalum}} {{electrolytic capacitors}} can be damaged by surge, peak or pulse currents. Tantalum capacitors, which {{are exposed to}} surge, peak or pulse currents should be used with a voltage derating up to 70% in highly inductive circuits. If possible, the voltage profile should be a ramp turn-on, as this reduces the <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> seen by the capacitor.|$|E

25|$|Small (diameter <25nbsp&mm) {{aluminum}} {{electrolytic capacitors}} with non-solid electrolytes can normally be charged {{up to the}} rated voltage without any current surge, peak or pulse limitation up to a <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> value of about 50nbsp&A. This property {{is a result of}} the limited ion movability in the liquid electrolyte, which slows down the voltage ramp across the dielectric, and the capacitor's ESR. Only the frequency of peaks integrated over time must not exceed the maximal specified ripple current.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors {{can be used}} to {{supplement}} batteries in starter systems in diesel railroad locomotives with diesel-electric transmission. The capacitors capture the braking energy of a full stop and deliver the <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> for starting the diesel engine and acceleration of the train and ensures the stabilization of catenary voltage. Depending on the driving mode up to 30% energy saving is possible by recovery of braking energy. Low maintenance and environmentally friendly materials encouraged the choice of supercapacitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} simple snubber circuit {{consists}} {{out of a}} film capacitor and a resistor in series, connected in parallel with a semiconductor component to suppress or damp undesirable voltage spikes. The capacitor absorbs the inductive turn-off <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> temporarily, so that the resulting voltage spike is limited. But the trend in modern semiconductor technology is towards higher power applications, which increases the peak currents and switching speeds. In this case, the boundary between a standard electronic film capacitor and a power capacitor is blurred, so that larger snubber capacitors belong more {{in the area of}} power systems, electrical installations and plants.|$|E

25|$|In DC {{circuits}} and pulsed circuits, {{current and}} voltage reversal {{are affected by}} the damping of the system. Voltage reversal is encountered in RLC circuits that are underdamped. The current and voltage reverse direction, forming a harmonic oscillator between the inductance and capacitance. The current and voltage tends to oscillate and may reverse direction several times, with each peak being lower than the previous, until the system reaches an equilibrium. This {{is often referred to as}} ringing. In comparison, critically damped or overdamped systems usually do not experience a voltage reversal. Reversal is also encountered in AC circuits, where the <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> is equal in each direction.|$|E
25|$|Positive {{lightning}} strikes {{tend to be}} much more intense than their negative counterparts. An average bolt of negative lightning carries an electric current of 30,000 amperes (30 kA), and transfers 15 coulombs of electric charge and 500 megajoules of energy. Large bolts of negative lightning can carry up to 120 kA and 350 coulombs. The average positive ground flash has roughly double the <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> of a typical negative flash, and can produce peak currents up to 400,000 amperes (400 kA) and charges of several hundreds coulombs. Furthermore, positive ground flashes with high peak currents are commonly followed by long continuing currents, a correlation not seen in negative ground flashes.|$|E
25|$|The oldest form of {{rechargeable}} battery is the lead–acid battery, which {{are widely used}} in automotive and boating applications. This technology contains liquid electrolyte in an unsealed container, requiring that the battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe dispersal of the hydrogen gas it produces during overcharging. The lead–acid battery is relatively heavy {{for the amount of}} electrical energy it can supply. Its low manufacturing cost and its high surge current levels make it common where its capacity (over approximately 10 Ah) is more important than weight and handling issues. A common application is the modern car battery, which can, in general, deliver a <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> of 450 amperes.|$|E

Hi-Fi Journal wrote that [...] "the NAIT excelled in musical terms... and would comfortably drive loudspeakers that caused other amplifiers to sound lumpen and distinctly unmusical". And for that reason, many people who owned the Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) [...] which are known to be a very difficult load for amplifiers [...] would choose the NAIT to drive their speakers. Reviewers attribute the perception of power of the NAITs to the over-engineered, dedicated power supplies that ensure generous current delivery for musical transients.|$|E

2500|$|Snubber {{circuits}} usually incorporate film capacitors, mostly {{polypropylene film}} caps.
