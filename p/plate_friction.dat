50|$|The viscous type is {{generally}} simpler because {{it relies on}} hydrodynamic friction from fluids with high viscosity. Silicone-based oils are often used. Here, a cylindrical chamber of fluid filled {{with a stack of}} perforated discs rotates with the normal motion of the output shafts. The inside surface of the chamber is coupled to one of the driveshafts, and the outside coupled to the differential carrier. Half of the discs are connected to the inner, the other half to the outer, alternating inner/outer in the stack. Differential motion forces the interleaved discs to move through the fluid against each other. In some viscous couplings when speed is maintained the fluid will accumulate heat due to friction. This heat will cause the fluid to expand, and expand the coupler causing the discs to be pulled together resulting in a non-viscous plate to <b>plate</b> <b>friction</b> and a dramatic drop in speed difference. This is known as the hump phenomenon and it allows the side of the coupler to gently lock. In contrast to the mechanical type, the limiting action is much softer and more proportional to the slip, and so is easier to cope with for the average driver. New Process Gear used a viscous coupling of the Ferguson style in several of their transfer cases including those used in the AMC Eagle.|$|E

A simple model of traction was developed, in which the total traction was equal to the <b>plate</b> <b>friction</b> plus the ploughing traction of studs. The ploughing traction increased and the <b>plate</b> <b>friction</b> decreased with the number of studs, due to lift that was generated by each stud as the sled moved across the surface.

The model is developed by applying both the average flow model and the elastic contact model between the friction disk and separator plate. The key components during wet clutch engagement are the separator <b>plate,</b> <b>friction</b> disk, and lubricant. The one-dimension transient models of heat transfer in radial direction for the three components are built {{on the basis of}} the heat transfer theory and the conservation law of energy. The friction transmission model and transient heat transfer models are coupled and solved by using the Runge-Kutta numerical method, and the radial temperature distribution and their detailed parametric study for the three components are conducted separately. The simulation results show that the radial temperature for the three components rises with the increase of radius in engagement. The changes in engagement pressure, lubricant viscosity, friction lining permeability, combined surface roughness RMS, equivalent elasticity modulus, difference between dynamic and static friction coefficients, and lubricant flow have important influence on the temperature rise characteristics.

In this project we aim to find the optimum design of a multi disc friction clutch through operations research techniques. The two methods used are stochastic programming and geometric programming. The existing design procedure treats design variables as deterministic ones. In actual practice due to manufacturing tolerances etc. design variables do not remain deterministic but become probabilistic. The probabilistic nature of these should be given proper consideration while designing.

40|$|Objectives] The {{reliability}} of propeller stress {{has a great}} influence on the safe navigation of a ship. To predict propeller stress quickly and accurately, [Methods] a new numerical prediction model is developed by coupling the Boundary Element Method(BEM) with the Finite Element Method (FEM). The low order BEM {{is used to calculate}} the hydrodynamic load on the blades, and the Prandtl-Schlichting <b>plate</b> <b>friction</b> resistance formula is used to calculate the viscous load. Next, the calculated hydrodynamic load and viscous correction load are transmitted to the calculation of the Finite Element as surface loads. Considering the particularity of propeller geometry, a continuous contact detection algorithm is developed; an automatic method for generating the finite element mesh is developed for the propeller blade; a code based on the FEM is compiled for predicting blade stress and deformation; the DTRC 4119 propeller model is applied to validate the {{reliability of}} the method; and mesh independence is confirmed by comparing the calculated results with different sizes and types of mesh. [Results] The results show that the calculated blade stress and displacement distribution are reliable. This method avoids the process of artificial modeling and finite element mesh generation, and has the advantages of simple program implementation and high calculation efficiency. [Conclusions] The code can be embedded into the code of theoretical and optimized propeller designs, thereby helping to ensure the strength of designed propellers and improve the efficiency of propeller design...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the yacht}} testing {{community}} {{there has been}} a continuing interest in and concern with, the effectiveness of techniques used to extrapolate model scale resis- tance tests to full scale values. While there are many aspects which influence the effectiveness of scaling results from model yacht experiments; this thesis has inves- tigated the use of hot-films to characterise boundary layer state so as to provide guidance in selection of model scale. A primary focus of this thesis was to ensure the method selected to characterise the boundary layer was suitable for commercial testing programs. The methodology included a robust technique for the installation and application of glue-on hot-film sensors and a modified data analysis method. The hull form used for this research was based on an International America's Cup Class yacht. The hull type has several features desirable in researching yacht hy- drodynamics including; non-immersed transom, minimal distortion to the hull lines and high aspect ratio foils. From data obtained from the hot-film sensors a series of conclusions were made. With turbulence stimulation, the on body flow was found to be fully turbulent for all Froude numbers tested (0. 05 to 0. 46). This implies that with appropriate boundary layer stimulation, the state of the boundary layer is not a limiting factor in the testing of a 1 / 8 th scale IACC yacht model. The hot-film data also showed that the change in Cf due to waves generated by the hull were half that of the change due to natural transition. The lower limits of applicability of the Grigson flat <b>plate</b> <b>friction</b> line were also examined using this experimental data. For the 1 / 8 th scale model tested these limits lie at a model ReL = 2 : 6 _ 106 (Froude num- ber of 0. 27) as opposed to that reported in his paper as ReL = 1 : 5 _ 106 (Froude number of 0. 15). In general it was concluded that if a yacht hull-form is slender with fair lines and no immersed transom and testing is at model speeds above 1. 28 m/s (Froude number of 0. 27) then it is possible to use a simple analytical approach to decide the correct model scale. If there is concern that there might be an issue with transition be- haviour {{it has been shown that}} it is possible and relatively simple to use hot-films to verify the boundary layer state...|$|E
