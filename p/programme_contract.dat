50|$|In April 2016 The Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that Varnish's Olympic Podium <b>Programme</b> <b>contract</b> with British Cycling {{had not been}} renewed, with Performance Director Shane Sutton stating that the decision was due to Varnish's performances over the previous three years, and denying that it was related to comments she had made in interviews at the 2015 UCI Track Cycling World Championships which were critical of the selections {{that had been made}} for the women's team sprint squad in their qualifying campaign for the 2016 Summer Olympics, which was ultimately unsuccessful. Varnish claimed in the two year Olympic qualifying period she had gained more qualifying points than any other British cyclist, in the team sprint she had consistently performed in the world top 5 and also qualified for the Olympic places in individual sprint and Keirin. In a subsequent interview with the Daily Mail, Varnish made allegations that Sutton had made sexist comments when discussing the non-renewal of her contract.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 2010s, there was {{interest}} in the White Rose project taking {{part of the new}} governmental subsidies, most especially the CCS Commercialisation Programme and the EU New Entrant Reserve (NER) 300, both of which aimed at funding low-carbon energy projects to scale commercially. In 2014, the CCS Commercialisation Programme awarded the White Rose project with a 2-year Front End Engineering Design (FEED) <b>Programme</b> <b>contract,</b> which would finalize the engineering and financials of the project Also at this time, the White Rose project also received EUR 300 million from the European Commission. However, in November 2015, six months before the funding was supposed to be received, the UK government announced the end of the CCS commercialization Programme due to the UK Treasury’s concerns of high consumer costs and taxpayer money funding CCS before it reached its cost-efficiency. The Treasury cites the fact that no examples of the technology working after attempting to fund the idea in 2011 and in 2012. Unfortunately, since the cancellation, there have been no new updates from the White Rose project, even though the operation was expected to start in 2020.|$|E
