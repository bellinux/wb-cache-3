5|$|Uttar Pradesh has a humid {{subtropical}} climate and experiences four seasons.

Summers are extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between 0°C and 50°C in <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> The Gangetic plain varies from semiarid to sub-humid. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 650mm in {{the southwest corner of}} the state to 1000mm in the eastern and southeastern <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian monsoon is the major bearer of rain in most parts of state. It is the south-west monsoon which brings most of the rain here, although rain due to the western disturbances and north-east monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation of the state.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> began {{suffering}} {{the consequences of}} poor farming practices, extended drought and high winds. Known as the Dust Bowl, areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated {{out of the state}} after the Dust Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Los Cabos in Baja California Sur, large swells capsized a fishing boat with seven people aboard on August25. Four were able to swim back to shore while the other three {{remained}} missing and were later presumed dead. Strong rain bands along the outer fringes of Hurricane Marie brought heavy rain to <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> Landslides blocked several roads near Los Cabos while gusty winds downed trees and power lines. Owing to the dangerous conditions, all schools Los Cabos were closed on August25.|$|E
5|$|The five largest ancestry {{groups in}} South Dakota are: German (40.7%), Norwegian (15.3%), Irish (10.4%), Native American (8.3%), and English (7.1%).

American Indians, largely Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota (Sioux) are predominant in several counties, mostly {{in the western part}} of the state. South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state.|$|E
25|$|Because Oklahoma is {{situated}} between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico watershed, <b>the</b> western <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{is subjected to}} extended periods of drought and high winds in the region may then generate dust storms, and <b>the</b> eastern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> is humid subtropical climate zone. Tribes that are indigenous to <b>the</b> current-day <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Oklahoma include both agrarian tribes settling in <b>the</b> eastern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and hunter-gatherer tribes adopting a horse culture settling in <b>the</b> western <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> These indigenous tribes are the only tribes currently residing in <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Oklahoma that would qualify as having aboriginal title to their land.

5|$|Tropical Storm Bob flooded {{roads and}} downed trees in Florida. Rough seas broke over sea walls in southwestern <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> and the {{combination}} of high tides and heavy rain caused forced the closure of causeways to Sanibel Island and Marco Island, leaving the islands temporarily isolated. They were re-opened when the waters receded, though the causeway to Sanibel Island sustained some damage. Florida Power & Light Co. reported that 1,200 to 1,500residences were without power on July 23. In Palm Beach County, rainfall from the storm caused agricultural damage.|$|E
5|$|Tropical dry {{deciduous}} {{forests are}} found {{in all parts of}} the plains. Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant. Large tracts of these forests have been cleared for cultivation. Tropical thorny forests, consisting of widely scattered thorny trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> These forests are confined to areas which have low annual rainfall (50–70cm), a mean annual temperature of 25–27°C and low humidity.|$|E
5|$|When steamboats were {{superseded}} by the railroad, the river {{lost much of}} its significance to the state. The influx of immigrants to Florida settled primarily south of Orlando, adversely affecting the natural order of wetlands there.

In the upper basin, population increased by 700 percent between 1950 and 2000, and is expected to rise another 1.5 million by 2020.|$|E
