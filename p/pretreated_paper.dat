40|$|Anaerobic <b>pretreated</b> <b>paper</b> {{process water}} was {{characterized}} {{in terms of}} readily biodegradable, slowly biodegradable, very slowly biodegradable and inert wastewater fractions under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The anaerobic <b>pretreated</b> <b>paper</b> process water contained a relatively high amount of slowly biodegradable components and few easily biodegradable components {{as indicated by the}} ratio of short term BOD over the BOD 5. Wastewater readily biodegradable COD, determined as short term BOD, was almost similar when measured under both temperature conditions. Fractions of slowly biodegradable COD and inert COD of the same wastewater were found to depend on the type of biomass involved in the test. Thermophilic aerobic biomass was not able to degrade the wastewater to the same extent as the mesophilic biomass resulting in higher apparent inert COD levels. Furthermore, wastewater colloidal COD did not flocculate under thermophilic conditions and was thus not removed from the liquid phase...|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{addition}} of paper tube residuals to a nitrogen-rich mixture of organic waste obtained from industrial and municipal activities. This nitrogen-rich mixture, called buffer tank substrate (BTS) in the following text, is used in a large-scale biogas plant. The effects were investigated in semi-continuous co-digestion processes, and variations in operational conditions were studied. The addition of paper tubes had stabilizing effects, prevented the failure of the process, and made it possible to decrease the hydraulic retention time from 25 to 20 days. Furthermore, synergetic effects were found, with 15 - 34 % higher methane yields, when paper tubes were co-digested with BTS. Moreover, steam explosion pretreatment of the paper tube waste {{with the addition of}} 0 - 2 % NaOH was evaluated by batch digestion experiments. Increasing the NaOH concentrations used in the pretreatment resulted in increasing methane yields, with the highest of 403 N mL of CH 4 g(- 1) of volatile solids (VS) corresponding to an increase by 50 % compared to that when untreated paper was digested (268 N mL of CH 4 g(- 1) of VS). The long-term effects of this best pretreatment were further investigated by continuous co-digestion experiments, leading to a higher methane yield when <b>pretreated</b> <b>paper</b> tubes were used in the co-digestion process compared to untreated...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{optimization}} of the production of ethanol from waste paper using yeast. There were used 4 kinds of paper as a substrate - office paper, non-recycled workbook, recycled workbook and newspaper. All <b>papers</b> were <b>pretreated</b> with the following procedures: grinding, microwaves + NaOH, microwave + H 2 SO 4 and microwave + H 2 SO 4 + NaOH. The glucose concentration was determined in enzymatic hydrolysis by HPLC. Saccharomyces cerevisiae were chosen for ethanol production. The production of ethanol was carried out with all the <b>pretreated</b> <b>papers</b> in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. During hydrolysis, the <b>pretreated</b> <b>papers</b> have reached the highest results in the combination with microwave + H 2 SO 4 + NaOH. Non-recycled workbook was the only exception, where the highest concentration of glucose has been obtained by the pretreatment of microwaves + H 2 SO 4. Following results have been acquired: office paper 24, 69 gdm- 3, non-recycled workbook 22, 47 gdm- 3, recycled workbook 16, 94 gdm- 3 and newspapers 15, 36 gdm- 3. SSF was carried out again with all the papers and their pretreatments. The highest concentration of ethanol has been achieved in microwave pretreatment + H 2 SO 4 + NaOH. The highest overall concentration has been gained from the office paper, amounted to 16, 98 gdm- 3. The maximum concentration of ethanol for non-recycled workbook has been 15, 25 gdm- 3, for recycled workbook 12, 2 gdm- 3 and for newspapers 12, 59 gdm- 3...|$|R
40|$|In this <b>paper,</b> <b>pretreated</b> pencil {{graphite}} electrode (Pre-PGE) {{was used for}} the determination of insulin by anodic stripping differential pulse voltammetry (DPASV). The influences of the pretreatment procedures, pH values, accumulation potential and time on the signal enhancement of insulin were optimized, and a novel electrochemical method for the determination of insulin was described. The currents obtained from DPASV measurements at optimum conditions (phosphate buffer solution pH 7. 0), accumulation time (60 seconds), applied potential 400 mV vs. Ag/AgCl/ 3. 0 mol L− 1 KCl) were linearly correlated with the concentration of insulin. Calibration curve was obtained for insulin concentrations in the range of 5. 0 - 200. 0 × 10 - 9 mol L− 1. The limit of detection was found to be 2. 0 × 10 - 9 mol L− 1...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{chemical}} stabilization method, that preserves the tensile strength of artificially aged <b>paper</b> <b>pretreated</b> with an aqueous solution of ionic liquid, is presented. Pure cotton cellulose paper samples were soaked with cholinium glycinate ionic-liquid solution either {{before or after}} the artificial aging process, which was based on thermal degradation in dry air. The tensile strength of artificially aged paper was measured by using the double-folding technique. The role of ionic liquids was investigated by mid-infrared and terahertz time-domain absorption spectroscopy. It was found that the tensile strength of pretreated samples is higher than that of other aged samples. A model for changes in the cellulose structure caused by oxidation and by the binding of ionic liquid molecules is proposed, based on the analysis of the mid-infrared absorption bands in the carbonyl/carboxyl region at 1590 - 1750 cm- 1. Terahertz spectroscopy data indicate that the ionic liquid molecules penetrate in the larger size porosity, acting as binders among cellulose fibers to maintain the tensile strength of paper. © 2016 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate activated sludge biological nutrient removal (BNR) performance at elevated temperatures for possible application of nitrification denitrification (ND) and ND biological excess phosphorus removal (NDBEPR) systems to municipal wastewater treatment in the equatorial and tropical regions or to combined treatment of municipal and anaerobically (thermophilic) <b>pretreated</b> <b>paper</b> and pulp industry wastewaters in the very cold northern forested regions. To accomplish this objective, a ND Modified Ludzack Ettinger (MLE) system and a NDBEPR University of Cape Town (UCT) system were operated at 30 °C and 10 days sludge age for a period of 582 days. During the investigation 41 sewage batches, each lasting about two weeks, of real sewage from the Mitchells Plain municipal wastewater treatment plant (Western Cape, South Africa) were fed to the systems. The two systems were sampled and tested,almost daily for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), Free and Saline Ammonia (FSA), nitrate, nitrite, Total Phosphorus, Volatile Settleable Solids (VSS), Total Settleable Solids (TSS), pH, Oxygen Utilization Rate (OUR) and diluted sludge volume index (DSVI) in the influent, anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic reactors and effluent as appropriate. Also, {{in order to determine the}} kinetic rates of nitrification, denitrification and readily biodegradable COD (RBCOD) conversion to Volatile Fatty Acids (VF A), aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic batch tests were conducted at 30 °C on sludge harvested from the two systems and microscopic examination of the sludges was undertaken every four weeks to identify the filamentous organisms in the systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{bioconversion}} {{of waste}} paper to single-cell protein at pH < 1 by Scytalidium acidophilum is described. Waste <b>paper</b> <b>pretreated</b> with 72 % H 2 SO 4 at 4 °C was diluted {{with water to}} a pH of < 0. 1 and hydrolyzed. This yielded an adequate sugar-containing substrate {{for the growth of}} the fungus. A total of 97 % of the sugars (glucose, galactose, mannose, xylose, arabinose) in the hydrolysates were converted to cell biomass. Microbial contamination was not observed. Based on the sugars consumed, S. acidophilum produced higher yields in shake cultures than many other Fungi Imperfecti. In aerated cultures, productivity increased, and yields of 43 to 46 % containing 44 to 47 % crude protein were obtained. This compares favorably with Candida utilis, a yeast used commercially to produce single-cell protein. The chemical constituents and the essential amino acids of the fungal cells were similar to those of other fungi. The nucleic acid content was characteristic of microbes containing low levels of nucleic acid. The advantages of using S. acidophilum for single-cell protein production are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of Whatman no. 1 {{filter paper}} by purified cellulolytic components from Trichoderma reesei and the synergistic action of binary combinations of these enzymes {{on the same}} substrate were investigated. At 20 milligrams filter paper, enzyme concentrations needed to obtain half-maximal hydrolysis rates (KE values) were in the 3 - 4 microM range for the cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) and 0. 05 - 0. 10 microM for the endoglucanases (EGs). Catalytic-core proteins of CBH I and EG III, lacking the cellulose-binding domain, exhibit KE values 2. 3 and 5. 1 times {{higher than those of}} the intact enzymes. In synergistic combinations of two cellulases, the KE value of at least one enzyme was 3 - 10 -fold reduced. CBH I/CBH II and CBH I/EG III combinations showed the most powerful synergism, and optimal ratios were a function of the total protein concentration. Results obtained in activity and adsorption assays using filter <b>paper</b> <b>pretreated</b> with one component, followed by inactivation and subsequent hydrolysis with the same or another cellulase component, point to a sequential enzymic attack of the cellulose and seems consistent with the mathematical model presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} simple {{approach}} {{based on a}} chemical reduction method to synthesize aqueous inorganic ink comprised of hexagonal MnO 2 nanosheets. The MnO 2 ink exhibits long-term stability and continuous thin films can be formed on various substrates without using any binder. To obtain a flexible electrode for capacitive energy storage, the MnO 2 ink was printed onto commercially available A 4 <b>paper</b> <b>pretreated</b> with multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 1035 Fg- 1 (91. 7 mFcm- 2). Paper-based symmetric and asymmetric capacitors were assembled, which gave a maximum specific energy density of 25. 3 Whkg- 1 and a power density of 81 kWkg- 1. The device could maintain a 98. 9 % capacitance retention over 10000 cycles at 4 Ag- 1. The MnO 2 ink could be a versatile candidate for large-scale production of flexible and printable electronic devices for energy storage and conversion.
