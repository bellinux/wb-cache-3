5|$|A deep low {{pressure}} system (with a pressure of 977mbar at its peak) {{moved across the}} Pacific Coast on October 15 and then crossed the Rockies during the following day and touched out some moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, major source for storm development and intensification. Not part of the main outbreak, 3 tornadoes were reported, during the overnight hours of October 16 towards October 17, across Randall County, Texas south of Amarillo on October 16 with 1 of them confirmed as a high EF1. That tornado caused damage to trees, fences, <b>power</b> <b>poles,</b> steel pipes, trailers and barns.|$|E
5|$|After 12:17UTC, the tornado's {{position}} fluctuated between Benton and Washington {{counties in}} northwestern Arkansas. Permanent houses were damaged and mobile homes were destroyed. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped while many other <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> were snapped. Two {{people were injured}} following {{the destruction of a}} mobile home within the Ozark National Forest in Benton County, while another person was injured west of Tontitown, Arkansas in Washington County. The tornado finally dissipated northwest of Tontitown at 12:27UTC after causing four deaths and ten injuries. Overall, the tornado caused $1.835million in damage, which was the sixth costliest total during the tornado outbreak.|$|E
5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid. Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and <b>power</b> <b>poles,</b> and increasing the power supply. This was done to enable the utility to restore power more rapidly {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E

5|$|As Cindy moved inland, tornadoes {{touched down}} in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland along the outer bands of the storm. A tornado was {{observed}} near Nags Head around 17:40UTC on July 10, {{and a second}} was observed 25minutes later. Both tornadoes caused minimal damage– the first damaged four buildings and the second uprooted trees and toppled <b>power</b> <b>poles.</b> In addition, two waterspouts were noted offshore North Carolina, of which one was near New Topsail Beach in the mid-morning of July 8 and another near Sneads Ferry. No damage was reported from the waterspouts.|$|E
5|$|At 5:32 pm CST (2332 UTC), a {{supercell}} thunderstorm {{produced a}} multiple-vortex tornado in Southaven, Mississippi. The tornado first struck Southaven High School, where 30 windows were broken, minor roof damage occurred, and damage was rated EF0. In the nearby Carriage Hill subdivision, several homes sustained minor damage as well. The tornado rapidly intensified to EF2 strength as it crossed {{the intersection of}} Stateline Road and Airways Boulevard, destroying three warehouse buildings. One of the buildings destroyed was the Cooper Lighting Plant, and a gas station in this area was damaged as well. Numerous trees and <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> were also downed in Southaven.|$|E

5|$|When Kate {{struck the}} Florida Panhandle, {{it became the}} first {{hurricane}} to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people {{to lose their jobs}} in the weeks after the storm. Gusts over 100mph (160km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of wind and rain led to downed <b>power</b> <b>poles.</b> Across the remainder of the southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15fatalities and $700million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Although Katia passed well {{north of}} the Lesser Antilles, a yellow alert was hoisted for Guadeloupe to notify {{residents}} of dangerous seas. Strong rip currents along the East Coast of the United States led {{to the deaths of}} two swimmers. After losing its tropical characteristics, Katia prompted the issuance of numerous warnings across Europe. Hurricane-force winds impacted numerous locations, downing trees, toppling <b>power</b> <b>poles,</b> and leaving thousands without electricity. The storm was responsible for two deaths in the United Kingdom: one when a tree fell on a vehicle in County Durham, and another during a multi-car accident on the M54 motorway resulting from adverse weather conditions. The post-tropical cyclone caused approximately £100m ($157million, 2011 USD) in damage in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E

5|$|Hardee County saw {{property}} damage estimated at $750million, along with six injuries, but no deaths were reported. Charley caused blackouts {{in the entire}} county, as well as damage to3,600homes and the destruction of1,400. A radio tower near Sebring was toppled, along with numerous trees and <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> along {{the north and east}} side of Highlands County. Additionally, there were several reports of severely damaged homes in Polk County near Babson Park and Avon Park. In Lake Wales, Florida, a sand mine lake encroached into State Road 60 due to wave action and swallowed a car. Additionally, Lake Wales saw 23,000buildings damaged, as well as the destruction of 739structures. Seven deaths were reported in the county, one of them determined to be direct.|$|E
5|$|Species {{diversity}} is greatest along the lower river and its tributaries. Threatened, endangered, or sensitive species include spring Chinook salmon, winter steelhead, chum salmon, Coho salmon and Oregon chub. In the central valley, several {{projects have been}} done to restore and protect wetlands {{in order to provide}} habitat for bald eagles, Fender's blue butterfly (of which 6,000 remain), Oregon chub, Bradshaw's desert parsley, a variety of Willamette fleabane, and Kincaid's lupine. In the early 21stcentury, osprey populations are increasing along the river, possibly because of a ban on the pesticide DDT and on the birds' ability to use <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> for nesting. Beaver populations, presumed to be much lower than historic levels, are increasing throughout the basin.|$|E
5|$|The {{brunt of}} the {{tropical}} cyclone's damage was inflicted upon coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. A total of 6,240people were killed {{as a result of}} the storm, with 5,708in Bangladesh and 538in West Bengal. Many of the deaths were a result of the destruction of homes or electrocution after strong winds toppled <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> across the region. Along the coast of Bangladesh, strong storm surge caused heavy infrastructure damage and contributed in wiping out an estimated 70% of all harvestable Bangladeshi crops, with an estimated 200,000tonnes (220,000tons) of crops being lost. Widespread power outages cut telecommunications across Bangladesh; in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital city, debris-laden streets paralyzed traffic while electrical outages caused water shortages.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the mountainous}} {{northern}} Barlavento Islands, Fred produced gusty winds and downpours; São Nicolau experienced sustained hurricane-force winds of 80mph (130km/h)—the highest recorded wind speed from the hurricane. Rainfall on that island was moderate, peaking at 3.5in (90mm) at Juncalinho. Many old trees were uprooted, a few landslides took place, and several villages lost power on that island. The strong winds downed <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and wrecked {{the roof of}} a church in the village of Cabeçalinho. In Ribeira Brava, São Nicolau's most populous town, the storm damaged 70homes, destroyed greenhouses, and leveled a farm, leaving several families homeless and others without a source of income. In Carriçal, similar effects were felt as torrential rainfall flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined fruit and hydroponic crops. Much of São Nicolau's livestock, including cattle from Hortelã, was lost in the storm. Damage to property and agriculturein particular banana and sugarcaneon the island reached CVE$50million ($500,000).|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} {{moved into the}} western Atlantic, the Miami U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm {{warnings}} for the North Carolina coastline from Wilmington to Cape Hatteras; the region was warned to prepare for strong winds. The agency also issued a small craft advisory southward through Charleston, South Carolina. Offshore, the storm produced winds of up to 85mph (140km/h), as well as waves up to 35feet (10m) in height. The combination of the winds and rough waves drove a freighter ashore along Portsmouth Island in the Outer Banks, after the engine was damaged when water entered the fuel line. The 26person crew initially planned to evacuate, but they later decided {{to stay on the}} freighter as the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist. The seas damaged a portion of the ship, but the entire crew was rescued without any injuries. The storm later brushed New England, bringing rain, fog, warmer temperatures, and gusty winds. The combination resulted in downed <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> and tree limbs, leaving 10,000houses without electricity.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on December29 and {{continuing}} for three days, the storm system {{associated with the}} tornado outbreak caused strong winds across the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. The winds were further enhanced by isolated showers, and gusts peaked at 79mph (127km/h) in Tatum, New Mexico. Approximately 7mi (11km) west of Levelland, Texas, the winds downed four <b>power</b> <b>poles,</b> sparking a fire that burned nearly 2,000acres (800hectares) of grassland before it was finally contained; the fire caused US$20,000in damage. In Allen, Oklahoma, strong winds associated with one supercell caused an estimated US$20,000 in damage after damaging the carport, chimney, and roof of a house. Hail and strong winds were also reported elsewhere in eastern Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. Widespread and damaging wind gusts and hail later crossed into northwestern Arkansas, causing US$175,000in damage. Several buildings and homes were destroyed by the strong winds; similar impacts were seen in Missouri and Illinois.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the close}} {{passage of the}} storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and {{amounted}} to $175,000. Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5hour span. The brevity of damaging winds limited {{the effects of the}} storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and <b>power</b> <b>poles.</b> Two trailers were overturned, however, and an oil barge sank in the Key West Harbor. Two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed. In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal Palms, and Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily left many customers without phone and electrical service. Residents in nearby Lee Cypress stated that the effects from Isbell were worse than Hurricane Donna which struck the region as a Category4 in September 1960.|$|E
5|$|In Grenada, Earl {{produced}} {{heavy rains}} and strong winds that caused moderate damage. On the main island, roofs were blown off twelve homes while three others were partially damaged; twelve trees and six <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> were also knocked {{down by the}} winds. The heavy rain associated with the tropical storm triggered nine mudslides and three rockslides on the island. Nearby, six homes had their roofs completely blown off while thirteen others were damaged. Flooding was also reported on both islands; however, no known damage resulted from them. During the storm, a nursing home had to be evacuated due to significant damage to the structure. On St Vincent and the Grenadines, at least two homes had their roofs blown off and banana crops sustained moderate damage. In Tobago, numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the island, cutting power to 90% of the island. The highest surface sustained winds in relation to Earl occurred {{on the morning of}} August 15 in Barbados and St. Lucia; winds were reported at 35mph (55km/h). One person was killed by the storm and nineteen others were listed as missing.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Saipan, 50 power lines, 20 transformers, and 6 <b>power</b> <b>poles</b> {{were damaged}} or destroyed, leaving 25{{percent of the}} islands' {{residents}} without power and $300,000 in damages. An estimated 90 percent of the banana trees were knocked down, contributing to the $518,000 in crop losses. Property losses on the two islands was estimated at $1.6million. On the islands of Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan all private homes, a total of six, were destroyed, the food stores and crops were lost, and the water supply was contaminated. The main public facility, which {{was used as a}} storm shelter on Alamagan, sustained heavy damage. Damages from the three islands amounted to $500,000.
