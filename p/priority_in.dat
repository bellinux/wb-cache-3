5|$|Like her {{predecessor}} Rudd, Gillard {{had said}} that health is a <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> her agenda.

She also said mental health would be a <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> her second term, with a $277million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups. As the election delivered a hung parliament, a $1.8billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the battle, they were poorly armed and many were {{equipped}} only with hunting rifles. They relied mostly on light infantry weapons, but obtained a few artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns and improvised their own land mines. They also obtained several hundred anti-tank weapons such as M79 and M80 rocket launchers, but were critically short of ammunition throughout the battle. The capture of JNA barracks somewhat improved the situation as Vukovar had the <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> the supply of arms. It is estimated that the Vukovar battlefield consumed around 55–60 percent of all ammunition available to the Croatian forces.|$|E

In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn emulation is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it a <b>priority.</b> <b>In</b> the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, which would make porting the game difficult.|$|E
5|$|IAU {{protocol}} is that discovery {{credit for}} a minor planet goes to whoever first submits {{a report to the}} MPC with enough positional data for a decent orbit determination, and that the credited discoverer has <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> naming it. This was Ortiz et al., and they proposed the name Ataecina, an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She is the equivalent of the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers. However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{original}} Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed {{greater emphasis on}} conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> all park management decisions. The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of Senegal {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on tourism early in its history.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the large dams prominent in Soviet times largely ended in the 1990s {{with the creation of}} the Russian Federation. In addition, due to the post-Soviet recession, much of the country's infrastructure, including dams, fell into disrepair. Use of oil and gas for energy took <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> Russia and renewable energy was ignored. This policy lasted until 2008, when Medvedev announced reforms to Russia's energy policies in an attempt to focus more on renewable energy.

5|$|The low {{box office}} {{performance}} of 1983's Superman III made feature-film adaptations of comic book properties {{a very low}} <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> Hollywood until the 1990s. In 1985, after a brief option on Spider-Man by Roger Corman expired, Marvel Comics optioned the property to Cannon Films. Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of any film’s revenues. However, the rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990.|$|E
