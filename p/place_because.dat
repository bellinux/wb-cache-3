5|$|The game {{begins in}} a New Republic outpost where Katarn is {{training}} Jade, when Imperial forces attack the base. The player takes control of Katarn {{to defend the}} base from the stormtroopers {{and get to the}} command center. Once there, it is revealed that an evacuation cannot take <b>place</b> <b>because</b> of bombardment by large weapons from two nearby asteroids. Katarn leaves Jade behind as he travels to the asteroids to destroy them.|$|E
5|$|From 1967, a {{place in}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was awarded to the Football League Cup winners, but that season's winners, Queens Park Rangers, could not take up their <b>place</b> <b>because</b> UEFA did not at that time allow third-tier teams to compete in the Fairs Cup. When the same {{situation}} arose two years later with Swindon Town, a two-legged match against that year's Coppa Italia winners, A.S. Roma, was organised by way of compensation. Following the popularity of that event, dubbed the Anglo-Italian League Cup, and as a way to generate income to pay players' wages during the extended close season caused by the 1970 FIFA World Cup, the first Anglo-Italian Cup was inaugurated in 1970.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University {{wrote that}} the {{dromedary}} exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent. He said this substitution could have taken <b>place</b> <b>because</b> of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian camel but {{did not have to}} depend upon its products.|$|E
5|$|Later in Monk's Café, Jerry {{goes back}} on the deal and decides {{not to take the}} <b>place</b> <b>because</b> George wants it. The two {{continue}} to argue about who should own it, and decided that neither of them should take it. A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, {{but it is clear that}} Jerry, George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves. They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, to which all three ask what the apartment's rent is.|$|E
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in <b>place</b> <b>because</b> it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of release}} schedules—especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first <b>place</b> <b>because</b> of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E
5|$|J. E. Wright {{took over}} as {{secretary}} in 1911, and advocated {{the formation of a}} limited company to run a professional club, believing amateur football would not succeed in a rugby league stronghold. The club turned professional in 1912, and acquired a rough plot of land known as Field View. York were admitted to the Midland League in June 1912, and the new ground was opened with a 2–1 win over Rotherham Town, which was played before 5,000 spectators. They played in the Midland League for three seasons, achieving a highest finish of 10th of 20 teams in 1912–13, before ranking 12th in an 18-team league the following season. York were invited to a meeting to discuss the formation of a Third Division of the Football League, but with the outbreak of the First World War the meeting did not take <b>place.</b> <b>Because</b> of hostilities, the Midland League was suspended after 1914–15, in which York ranked 16th out of 20 teams. The club went into liquidation through the bankruptcy court in August 1917 after a creditor pressed for payment for the ground's stand. York's ground was taken over by the York Corporation, who leased it to allotment-holders.|$|E

5|$|The 8 March Revolution {{has often}} been viewed as a mere {{military}} coup, but it had many of the ingredients of national revolts from below. The revolution was led by an anti-oligarchical alliance of a radicalised lower middle class, strategic members of the officer corps, marginalised minorities and {{a significant number of}} peasants who were mobilised for agrarian conflict. In an international context, the revolution took <b>place</b> <b>because</b> the state boundaries established by France were artificial and the hostility within the newly established Syria to the creation of Israel. The traditional elite that took power in Syria when the country gained independence had come to power during the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The external imposition of arbitrary state boundaries on Syria with no corresponding popular acceptance led to discontent. The national struggle was shaped by ideologies such as Arab nationalism, pan-Islamism and Greater Syrianism. The plebeian character of the struggle, and the radical ideologies, spawned radical solutions to the agrarian problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Pellissier made 27 league {{appearances and}} scored three goals, {{two of which}} were scored against Siena in a 2–1 victory, and marked his first brace. During the 2004–05 season, he scored seven times in 34 appearances. He scored twice in a 3–1 victory against Brescia. 2005–06 was Pellissier's breakout season; he made {{a significant contribution to}} Chievo's campaign, scoring 13 of Chievo's 54 league goals. Among them, Pellissier scored in four consecutive matches and twice in the matches against U.S. Lecce and Reggina Calcio. The season was an important one; the 2006 Italian football scandal ensured that Chievo finished in fourth <b>place</b> <b>because</b> of various points deductions to other sides, qualifying Chievo for the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{continued}} to tour with the Pixies through 2005 and 2006. Though the Catholics were effectively defunct, they released two separate albums of B-sides and rarities, Snake Oil and One More Road for the Hit, on iTunes, {{with an eye}} towards a future CD release. Thompson was also working on more new solo material with Feldman {{in the first part}} of 2006, some of which they performed live. In the fall of 2006, Thompson began his first solo tour since 2003, taking Feldman, Billy Block, and Duane Jarvis along as his backing band. In October 2006, Thompson announced plans for the Pixies to start rehearsing and recording a new album in January 2007, but it is believed that no recording took <b>place</b> <b>because</b> of the reluctance of another member of the Pixies to commit to the project. In December 2006, he released the compilation Christmass album; a collection of new studio tracks, hotel room sessions, and live acoustic recordings from a solo tour the previous summer.|$|E

25|$|Naturally, in America {{everyone}} knew that from 1846 to 1861 a free trade system prevailed, and that Representative Morrill carried his protectionist tariff through Congress only in 1861, after the rebellion had already broken out.
