5000|$|Edward Weston {{extensively}} {{improved the}} design. He replaced the fine wire suspension with a pivot, and provided restoring torque and electrical connections through spiral springs rather {{like those of}} a wristwatch balance wheel hairspring. He developed a method of stabilizing the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, so the instrument would have consistent accuracy over time. He replaced the light beam and mirror with a knife-edge pointer that could be read directly. A mirror under the pointer, in the same plane as the scale, eliminated parallax observation error. To maintain the field strength, Weston's design used a very narrow circumferential slot through which the coil moved, with a minimal air-gap. This improved linearity of <b>pointer</b> <b>deflection</b> with respect to coil current. Finally, the coil was wound on a light-weight form made of conductive metal, which acted as a damper. By 1888, Edward Weston had patented and brought out a commercial form of this instrument, which became a standard electrical equipment component. It was known as a [...] "portable" [...] instrument because it was affected very little by mounting position or by transporting it from place to place. This design is almost universally used in moving-coil meters today.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{starts with}} {{a brief review of}} the topic of strong and weak pre- and post-selected (PPS) quantum measurements, as well as weak values, and {{afterwards}} presents original work. In particular, we develop a nonperturbative theory of weak PPS measurements of an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter, for arbitrary initial states. New and simple analytical formulas are obtained for the average and the distribution of the meter pointer variable, which hold to all orders in the weak value. In the case of a mixed preselected state, in addition to the standard weak value, an associated weak value is required to describe weak PPS measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the generalized Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal two new regimes of weak PPS measurements: the strongly-nonlinear regime and the inverted region, where the system-dependent contribution to the <b>pointer</b> <b>deflection</b> decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal conditions for weak PPS measurements are achieved in the strongly-nonlinear regime, where the magnitude of the average <b>pointer</b> <b>deflection</b> is equal or close to the maximum. This maximum is independent of the measurement strength, being typically of the order of the pointer uncertainty. We show that the amplification in the weak PPS measurements is a product of two qualitatively different quantities: proper amplification and enhancement. The effects of the free system and meter Hamiltonians are discussed. We also identify optimal meters for weak measurements. Exact solutions are obtained for a certain class of the measured observables. These solutions are used for numerical calculations, the results of which agree with the theory. Moreover, the theory is extended to allow for a completely general post-selection measurement. We also discuss time-symmetry properties of PPS measurements of any strength.

40|$|We study a {{class of}} quantum {{measurement}} models. A microscopic object is entangled with a macroscopic pointer such that each eigenvalue of the measured object observable is tied up with a specific <b>pointer</b> <b>deflection.</b> Different pointer positions mutually decohere {{under the influence of}} a bath. Object-pointer entanglement and decoherence of distinct pointer readouts proceed simultaneously. Mixtures of macroscopically distinct object-pointer states may then arise without intervening macroscopic superpositions. Initially, object and apparatus are statistically independent while the latter has pointer and bath correlated according to a metastable local thermal equilibrium. We obtain explicit results for the object-pointer dynamics with temporal coherence decay in general neither exponential nor Gaussian. The decoherence time does not depend on details of the pointer-bath coupling if it is smaller than the bath correlation time, whereas in the opposite Markov regime the decay depends strongly on whether that coupling is Ohmic or super-Ohmic.

40|$|Subjects {{pressed a}} {{telegraph}} key to illuminate a meter dial on which <b>pointer</b> <b>deflections</b> appeared at fixed intervals. Upon detecting a deflection {{they were required}} to press another key to reset the pointer to zero. This detecting and resetting operation reinforced the behavior of pressing the light-flashing key (i. e., the observing responses). The usual pattern of responding on the light-flashing key was a long pause following the reinforcement and an abrupt transition to a steady response rate {{toward the end of the}} interval. When the subjects were required to perform a concurrent subtraction task, the pattern of responding changed in varying degrees, ranging from complete loss of typical fixed-interval behavior to a slight shortening of the post-reinforcement pause. These effects were attributed to the disruption of the self-produced verbal chains (counting or reciting) that ordinarily govern human behavior on this schedule...|$|R
40|$|Many {{scientific}} studies investigate and technical applications use the acoustical localization {{in the field}} of vision. Therefore it is suitable to display the perceived auditory direction by a light point. In formerly known methods subjects use a hand-held light pointer or a pointer mounted on a revolvable axle in front of them. However, the subjectâ€™s motor system or the optical parallax may influence the results of those techniques. The calibration of the system and data logging also turn out to be difficult. The proposed new method utilizes a laser <b>pointer</b> with a <b>deflection</b> unit instead, which is controlled by a computer. Subjects enter the perceived sound direction with a trackball. The laser spot moves according to the rotation of the ball smoothly on a defined track. A complicated mechanical calibration can be avoided by calibrating the deflection unit by a computer. The intuitive experimental operation and the high resolution of the system make this method particularly suitable for localization research in audiology, psychoacoustics, and virtual acoustics. The symmetric, bimodal outlay of the experimental task reduces interaction effects between different modalities. Localization results for variable and fixed initial laser position obtained by this method are presented and compared to results acquired by other methods. PACS no. 43. 66. Yw, 43. 66. Qp, 43. 66.
