5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E
5|$|Several tyrannosaurid skeletons {{from the}} Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana {{probably}} belong to Gorgosaurus, although it remains uncertain whether {{they belong to}} G. libratus or a new species. One specimen from Montana (TCMI 2001.89.1), housed in the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, shows evidence of severe pathologies, including healed leg, rib, and vertebral fractures, osteomyelitis (infection) {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw resulting in <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> loss, and possibly a brain tumor.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} {{in humans}} {{is a process}} in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments {{play an important role}} in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.|$|E
50|$|As {{a person}} ages, their <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> {{have been exposed}} to normal {{mechanical}} forces, such as chewing, and also more abnormal mechanical forces, such as bruxism (grinding) and traumatic injury. <b>Permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> may also be affected by oral disease. There are many ways in which a person may protect his or her <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> from loss.|$|R
50|$|Serial {{extraction}} is {{the planned}} extraction of certain deciduous <b>teeth</b> and specific <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> {{in an orderly}} sequence and predetermined pattern to guide the erupting <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> into a more favorable position.|$|R
50|$|From {{the age of}} two-and-a-half {{until about}} six years, the {{deciduous}} teeth maintain stability, until a set of molars (also called “Six Year Molars”) appear in the lower jaw; these are the child’s first <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth.</b> From this point on, for the approximate next twelve years, {{the rest of the}} deciduous teeth will be replaced by all of the <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth.</b> Additional <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> will erupt {{in the back of the}} mouth in order to enlarge the mouth. When the process of all <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> coming in is over, the adult mouth will have thirty-two teeth.|$|R
5|$|Four {{specimens}} (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) {{are thought}} to represent second upper incisors (I2) of Ferugliotherium. 702A (height 1.5mm; width 1.1mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2mm; width 0.9mm) and 702D. The smaller incisors cannot be lateral incisors (I3), because 702C's wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper incisors are identified as central incisors (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that Ferugliotherium was variable in size or that the smaller incisors were deciduous precursors of the larger <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth.</b> They considered it less likely that multiple species with similar incisors were present. The upper incisors have enamel only on the dorsal side. The wear facet at the tip is preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the dorsal side, and is more concave than the facet in the lower incisors. 702A–D are recognizable as upper incisors {{because they have a}} less acute angle at the tip and are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical in cross section.|$|E
25|$|Although tooth {{eruption}} occurs {{at different times}} for different people, a general eruption timeline exists. Typically, humans have 20 primary (baby) teeth and 32 permanent teeth. Tooth eruption has three stages. The first, known as deciduous dentition stage, occurs when only primary teeth are visible. Once the first <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> erupts into the mouth, the teeth are in the mixed (or transitional) dentition. After the last primary tooth falls out of the mouth—a process known as exfoliation—the teeth are in the permanent dentition.|$|E
25|$|Dilaceration is an {{abnormal}} bend {{found on a}} tooth, and is nearly always associated with trauma that moves the developing tooth bud. As a tooth is forming, a force can move the tooth from its original position, leaving {{the rest of the}} tooth to form at {{an abnormal}} angle. Cysts or tumors adjacent to a tooth bud are forces known to cause dilaceration, as are primary (baby) teeth pushed upward by trauma into the gingiva where it moves the tooth bud of the <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth.</b>|$|E
50|$|Type 2 : <b>Permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> show {{abnormally}} large pulp chambers, {{known as}} Thistle tube appearance. Deciduous teeth show amorphous and atubular dentin in radicular portion, while coronal dentin is normal. The <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> have multiple pulp stones.|$|R

Methods: Teeth were randomly {{divided into four}} groups, including <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> enamel group, <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> dentin group, primary teeth enamel group, and primary teeth primary teeth. The crystal structure and mechanical characteristics of teeth were tested by XRD and contact angle meter. The results were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Results: The crystalline and grain size of enamel were significantly larger than dentin’s. The crystalline and grain size of enamel and dentin of <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> were also larger than primary teeth.

25|$|Dental {{avulsion}} {{is a real}} dental {{emergency in}} which prompt management (within 20–40 minutes of injury) affects the prognosis of the tooth. The avulsed <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> should be gently but well rinsed with saline, with care taken not to damage {{the surface of the}} root which may have living periodontal fiber and cells. Once the tooth and mouth are clean an attempt can be made to re-plant in its original socket within the alveolar bone and later splinted by a dentist for several weeks. Failure to re-plant the avulsed tooth within the first 40 minutes after the injury may result in a less favorable prognosis for the tooth. If the tooth cannot be immediately replaced in its socket, follow the directions for Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth and cold milk or saliva and take it to an emergency room or a dentist. If the mouth is sore or injured, cleansing of the wound may be necessary, along with stitches, local anesthesia, and an update of tetanus immunization if the mouth was contaminated with soil. Management of injured primary teeth differs from management of permanent teeth; avulsed primary tooth should not be re-planted (to avoid damage to the permanent dental crypt).|$|E
500|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} {{caused by}} environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. Enamel hypoplasia {{is a condition}} in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate. This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency {{than the rest of the}} tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors, an exanthematous disease (chicken pox, congenital syphilis), undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, hypocalcemia, dental fluorosis, birth injury, preterm birth, infection or trauma from a deciduous tooth. [...] Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis. Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad. Turner's hypoplasia is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from antineoplastic therapy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{treatment}} for permanent teeth consists of replantation, immediately if possible. Deciduous teeth {{should not be}} replanted due {{to the risk of}} damaging the <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> germ. Immediate replantation ensures the best possible prognosis but is not always possible since more serious injuries may be present. Studies have shown that teeth that are protected in a physiologically ideal media can be replanted within 15 minutes to one hour after the accident with good prognosis. The success of delayed replantation depends on the vitality of the cells remaining on the root surface. In normal conditions, a tooth is connected to the socket by means of the periodontal ligament. When a tooth is knocked out, that ligament stretches and splits in half. Maintaining the vitality of the cells that remain attached to the root surface is the key to success following replantation. Years ago, it was thought that the key to maintaining root cell vitality was keeping the knocked-out tooth wet, thus giving rise to storage media recommendations such as water, the mouth and milk. Recent research has shown that one of the key elements for maintaining vitality is storing the tooth in an environment that closely resembles the original socket environment. This environment is one that has the proper [...] osmolality (cell pressure), pH, nutritional metabolites and glucose. There are scientifically designed storage media that provide this environment. These storage media are now available in retail products. Use of devices that incorporate the ideal storage media and protective apparatuses have increased the success rate of replanted knocked-out teeth to over 90% when used within sixty minutes of the accident.|$|E
