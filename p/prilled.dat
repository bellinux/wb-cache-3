40|$|Ammonium nitrate (AN) is {{commonly}} used as an explosive and as a fertilizer. In both roles it is provided as <b>prills</b> or pellets, approximately spherical and a few millimetres in diameter. The microstructures of several commercially-available AN compositions were investigated using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and X-ray microtomography. Those intended for explosive use {{were found to be}} more porous than those intended for fertilizer use. The pores in explosive <b>prills</b> were also found to form a connected network. The elemental composition of pellets of mixed AN and dolomite was investigated using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX); the dolomite additive was found to take the form of grains roughly 50 μm in size. The compaction behaviour of confined cylindrical beds of these <b>prills</b> and pellets was studied at strain rates between 4 × 10 − 4 s− 1 and 200 s− 1. Quasi-static experiments were performed using a screw-driven instrumented press, while higher-rate experiments used a drop weight, instrumented with a line laser and load cell. The resistance of a bed to compaction was found to depend on the microstructure of its <b>prills</b> in most cases. Denser <b>prills</b> offered greater resistance to compaction. The exception to this rule was a pellet, rather than <b>prill,</b> formulation. Beds were also found to offer more resistance to compaction at higher strain rates. The Kawakita compaction model was found to agree well with the experimental data. A commercial fertilizer, not containing any AN, was assessed for use as an inert mock for AN <b>prills</b> and pellets. <b>Prills</b> of a suitable size for this purpose were found using EDX to consist of P 2 O 5, with a coating of unknown composition. They were supplied mixed with smaller K 2 CO 3 and urea <b>prills.</b> The mixture was found to have comparable compaction behaviour to AN compositions, indicating that it was useful as a mock for those compositions. In a plate impact experiment on a single layer of P 2 O 5 <b>prills,</b> very little light was observed. This indicated that these <b>prills</b> were sufficiently inert for these purposes. The light produced by shocked granular ammonium nitrate beds and single <b>prill</b> layers was investigated using high-speed framing photography, photodiodes and gated visible-light spectroscopy. Framing photography of <b>prill</b> layers suggested that reaction in <b>prill</b> beds was dominated by effects internal to <b>prills.</b> This was further supported by the similarity between photodiode recordings of <b>prill</b> beds and beds of inert <b>prills</b> containing a single reactive <b>prills.</b> Framing photography of drop weight experiments searching for a mechanism for initiation of reaction by interaction between <b>prills</b> found nothing. Decay of the light output of the beds suggested that in both granular and <b>prill</b> beds this light output was due to small regions heated to thousands of kelvin, which then cooled. Spectroscopic study confirmed this. These regions were found to reach a peak temperature of 6660 ± 20 K, well in excess of the approximately 2000 K predicted by a simple chemical model.

Methane emission peaked from 100 to 125 days after transplanting followed by a decline in rainfed lowland field plots. Application of <b>prilled</b> urea did not enhance methane emission significantly over that of the untreated control. Subsurface application of urea supergranules was, however, effective in reducing the methane flux over that of the control. Methane emission was lowest in plots treated with the mixture of <b>prilled</b> urea and Nimin (a nitrification inhibitor). Under irrigated shallow conditions, the application of <b>prilled</b> urea and green manure (Sesbania rostrata), singly and in combination, significantly increased methane emission over that of the control. Cumulative methane efflux from control and <b>prilled</b> urea treated lowland rice field was about 4 – 10 times higher than that in irrigated shallow fields.

50|$|Until the 1970s most urea plants {{produced}} their fertilizer in {{the form}} of <b>prills.</b> In the <b>prilling</b> process, droplets of urea ‘melt’ (obtained by concentrating the product solution from the urea plant to a very high level) are cast into an upward flow of air, solidifying as they fall.

On account of their relatively low strength, <b>prills</b> are susceptible to breakage during handling and transportation, which increases the risk of caking (concretion) of the product during storage and gives rise to dust when the urea is spread on the land.Stamicarbon developed a new technology to improve the impact strength, known as ‘seeding’.

40|$|Northern highbush {{blueberry}} (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) {{is adapted to}} acidic soil conditions and often grows poorly when soil pH is greater than 5. 5. When soil pH is high, growers will usually mix <b>prilled</b> elemental sulfur (So) into the soil before planting (converted to sulfuric acid by soil bacteria) and, if needed, inject acid into the irrigation water after planting. These practices are effective but often expensive, time consuming, and, {{in the case of}} acid, potentially hazardous. Here, we examined the potential of applying micronized So by chemigation through a drip system as an alternative to reduce soil pH in a new planting of ‘Duke’ blueberry. The planting was located in western Oregon and established on raised beds mulched with sawdust in Oct. 2010. The So product was mixed with water and injected weekly for a period of ≈ 2 months before planting and again for period of ≈ 2 months in late summer of the second year after planting (to assess its value for reducing soil pH once the field was established), at a total rate of 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg·ha− 1 So on both occasions. Each treatment was compared with the conventional practice of incorporating <b>prilled</b> So into the soil before planting (two applications of 750 kg·ha− 1 So each in July and Oct. 2010). Within a month of the first application of So, chemigation reduced soil pH (0 – 10 cm depth) from an average of 6. 6 with no So to 6. 1 with 50 kg·ha− 1 So and 5. 8 with 100 or 150 kg·ha− 1 So. However, the reductions in pH were short term, and by May of the following year (2011), soil pH averaged 6. 7, 6. 5, 6. 2, and 6. 1 with each increasing rate of So chemigation, respectively. Soil pH in the conventional treatment, in comparison, averaged 6. 6 a month after the first application and 6. 3 by the following May. In July 2012, soil pH ranged from an average of 6. 4 with no So to 6. 2 with 150 kg·ha− 1 So and 5. 5 with <b>prilled</b> So. Soil pH declined to as low as 5. 9 following postplanting So chemigation and, at lower depths (10 – 30 cm), was similar between the treatment chemigated with 150 kg·ha− 1 So and the conventional treatment. None of the treatments had any effect on winter pruning weight in year 1 or on yield, berry weight, or total dry weight of the plants in year 2.
