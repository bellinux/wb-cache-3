40|$|The name of diploma Environmental {{taxes in}} the tax system of the Czech Republic Abstrakt The problem of the {{environmental}} protection has probably been the most discussed worldwide problem recently. The need to protect the human natural environment grows with the growing number of people and the emerging global company. These days, the environment is primarily endangered by greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. Developed countries try to stop this tendency using different methods. The ecological reforms of specific states - of which an establishment of environmental taxes constitutes the essential part - should help to stop this tendency. This paper deals with the introduction into the legal order of the Czech Republic and reflects also for adjustment the European Union.

The company was founded in 1981 in Meductic, New Brunswick, Canada, by Robert Zildjian, son of Avedis Zildjian III, the head of the Avedis Zildjian Company located in Quincy, Massachusetts. Family tradition had it that the head of the company would pass its secrets down only to the oldest son, but Avedis III gave the information to both his sons, Armand Zildjian and Robert Zildjian. A family feud resulted in Robert leaving Zildjian to form the rival Sabian Cymbals company. Robert Zildjian said, [...] "It {{got to the point where}} they were taking away certain <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>job.</b> I was the export man. I was the advertising. I was the marketing.

Sabian cymbals have been used by many famous drummers in the world, including Tony Royster, Jr. (Jay Z), Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil Peart of Rush, and Mike Portnoy, formerly of Dream Theater.

40|$|Service-learning is a high-impact {{educational}} practice that engages students (Kuh, 2008) {{and is a}} growing trend in higher education (Campus Compact, 2011). In 2008, my coinstructor and fellow library staff member, Cheryl Lauricella, and I incorporated service-learning in our for-credit information literacy (IL) course because we recognized that connecting information literacy {{to the real world}} through service-learning would lead to increased skill retention and engagement with the curriculum (Barry, 2011). Before this realization, when I taught my first few for-credit information literacy courses as a new professional, I asked my students to research a hobby or something related to their major. I thought that choosing a topic of interest to them would be the best way for them to engage with the course. While it was helpful, inevitably a good portion of students conducted research about such weighty topics as Ohio State University’s football team. No offense to the Buckeyes, but I began to realize there must be some way to make better use of the students’ research. After talking to a faculty member on campus who teaches several service-learning courses, {{it occurred to me that}} I could incorporate service-learning in the information literacy course.

40|$|As the {{coordinator}} of an MA-level industrial-organizational psychology graduate program, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> (Michael Gasser) <b>job</b> {{is to develop}} internship opportunities for our students at area companies. Our program {{is located in a}} community of approximately 100, 000 people and the field of I-O psychology is simply not very well known by local business leaders (Gasser, Whitsett, Mosley, Sullivan, Rogers, & Tan, 1998). When meeting with a business leader to discuss internships, I am often asked to explain the difference between one of our students and someone with a comparable degree from a business school. This is a very good question, and although I have an answer, other I-O profes-sionals may not share my opinion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine what distinguishes I-O psychology from academic training in business. In her 2003 SIOP presidential address, Ann Marie Ryan (2003) lamented the fact that industrial-organizational psychology is not very well known or understood. One solution she suggested was to change the name of industrial-organizational psychology to something that would be clearer and better received by business professionals. SIOP members voted on this issue in 2003 and our name remains unchanged. Although a name change may be beneficial in communicating with the business community and, in the least, a shorter name would be easier to say, the name change would not solve the broader problem of communicating about and advancing understanding of I-O psy-chology. Changing our name is irrelevant unless we market our profession, and we cannot carve out a market unless we have a clear understanding of our own identity. We must market our profession if others are going to understand what we do. We believe there are two relevant issues here: (a) How should we adver-tise I-O psychology? and (b) What should we say about ourselves? We pre-viously touched on the first issue, finding that word of mouth and mail brochures were the most common methods for advertising I-O psycholog...|$|R
