NICE made three specific recommendation for diet: (1) reduction of dietary salt to 3 g per day by 2025; (2) halving consumption of saturated fats; and (3) eliminating the use of industrially produced trans fatty acids in food. However, the recommendations were greeted unhappily by the food industry, which stated that it was already voluntarily dropping the trans fat levels to below the WHO recommendations of a maximum of 2%.|$|E

The city of Peterborough, Ontario, was a noted hotbed of opposition to metrication, having been one of the government's three test centres for the metrication process. Bill Domm, a Member of Parliament representing the riding of Peterborough, was one of the country's most outspoken opponents of metrication.

Acknowledging that thousands of building materials are available and many might have adverse impact to the environment, careful selection of green building products could help enhance the environmental performance of construction facilities. To facilitate decision-makers selecting green building materials, a reliable and transparent mechanism is needed and a green building <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> scheme would be the way forward.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of environmental issues}} in the media has contributed {{to an increase in}} environmental consciousness amongst the public. In order to cater to the needs and desires of this quickly growing market segment, companies have begun to adapt their marketing strategies. By displaying a pro-environment third-party organisation (TPO) seal-of-approval endorsement in the <b>product</b> <b>labelling,</b> marketers hope to legitimise their environmental claims and convey a perception of environmental consciousness to consumers. Although the effect of endorsements on consumers and their purchase intentions has been researched quite extensively, relatively little has focused on the effect of endorsements from a TPO. Moreover, literature relating to the effect of the presence of a pro-environment TPO endorsement in <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> is nearly non-existent. This study was designed to answer the research question: Does the presence of a proenvironment TPO endorsement and/or the presence of an environmental claim in <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> affect consumers’ product-labelling likeability, brand likeability and purchase intention? It also aimed to help determine if consumers are vulnerable to being misled by proenvironment TPO endorsements. Other independent variables, including perceived TPO credibility and participants’ product involvement, were also measured to determine if they had an impact on participants. Environmental consciousness, environmental behaviour, environmental knowledge and scepticism were also evaluated to determine if they had a moderating or confounding influence on the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variables. To investigate the research question and test the hypotheses, the study employed an experimental, between-subjects design consisting of 8 different conditions. Using an online questionnaire distributed via an online panel, data was obtained from 268 Australian residents. The data was tested using various analyses in SPSS, such as bivariates, analyses of variances (ANOVAs), analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) and multiple analyses of variance (MANOVAs). Results indicate that displaying a pro-environment TPO endorsement in the <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> can be a beneficial marketing tool in influencing consumers’ product-labelling likeability, brand likeability and/or purchase intention, but consumers’ level of product involvement, amount of environmental behaviour and their level of environmental knowledge can affect this influence. Consumers with high-product involvement had greater purchase intention when they viewed <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> that did not have a pro-environment TPO endorsement than when it did. This finding may mean that the presence of a pro-environment TPO endorsement in the <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> actually deters participants with high-product involvement from intending on purchasing the product. Although there was not a significant difference in purchase intention of participants with low-product involvement who viewed <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> with a TPO endorsement and without a TPO endorsement, a relationship between low involvement and the effect of the presence of the pro-environment TPO endorsement on purchase intention was found. Thus, it is suggested that displaying a pro-environment TPO endorsement would be most advantageous if the product were a fast moving consumer good (FMCG) rather than a typically high-involvement product, such as jewelry. However, this suggestion should be further researched before it is applied as a marketing strategy. No correlation was found between environmental objective and subjective knowledge, which indicates that although consumers think they are quite knowledgeable about the environment, they may actually know very little. Participants’ level of environmental objective knowledge was found to {{have a significant impact on}} their purchase intention when the TPO endorsement was present in the <b>product</b> <b>labelling.</b> When the TPO endorsement was present in 7 the <b>product</b> <b>labelling,</b> participants who were labelled as having no objective environmental knowledge had significantly higher purchase intentions than participants who were labelled as having high objective knowledge. This finding is quite significant as the majority of participants were found to have little or no objective knowledge. Although many public policy groups claim that scepticism helps compensate for consumers’ lack of knowledge and enables them to decipher between legitimate and illegitimate claims, in this study, scepticism was not found to affect participants’ purchase intention. This finding highlights the need for a legislating body that extensively evaluates TPO endorsements, environmental claims and their legitimacy to ensure that consumers are not misled. Additionally, individuals that reported that they frequently engage in other forms of environmental behavior, such as recycling, had greater purchase intention when they viewed <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> that featured an environmental TPO and/or environmental claim than when it did not. This finding may indicate that a spill-over effect occurs in regards to environmental behaviour, in that people who engage in one form of environmental behavior are likely to engage in other forms of environmental behavior...|$|E

40|$|M. A. This study {{focuses on}} empirically {{determining}} the branding role that <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> plays {{as a strategic}} element in Integrated Marketing Communication functioning within the food and beverage industry. This research topic was selected {{for a number of}} reasons. Firstly, there is a general misconception of the definition of the term Integrated Marketing Communication. Secondly, there is also an emergence of the perception that labelling plays an important role as a strategic element in Integrated Marketing Communication functioning. Thirdly, there is also speculation regarding what this actual role is, that labelling plays within the Integrated Marketing Communication functioning. Fourthly, on closer investigation, it becomes evident that although there is a degree of literaturebased evidence that identifies the role that <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> plays (within Integrated Marketing Communication), as that of branding, there is no empirical research to substantiate these claims. For these combined reasons there is a direct need for research into these issues. To facilitate the effective fulfilment of the research goals, there was a thorough examination of the theoretical literature available and the completion of an empirical study. Furthermore {{it was found that the}} examination of the branding role that <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> plays as a strategic element in Integrated Marketing Communication functioning would be attainable if the research goal was restricted to a manageable field. To satisfy this aim, the study was focused on the food and beverage industry. The key terms of branding as well as Integrated Marketing Communication were investigated and defined. From the literature available, the branding role that <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> plays as a strategic element in Integrated Marketing Communication functioning was examined and also defined. From this context it was found that ample evidence was available to conduct empirical research into this area. It became clear that the identification of the branding role that <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> plays as a strategic element in Integrated Marketing Communication functioning within the food and beverage industry would rest upon the identification of the transmission of functional and non-functional attributes, consequences and values to consumers via verbal and visual images. The method best suited to identifying the transmission of these values was shown to be that of qualitative research. The proof of the transmission of these functions within the sample formed the focus of the empirical study. Ultimately this proof would illustrate the branding role of labelling. Within the context of the qualitative research, it was shown that the most appropriate approach to identify the transmission of functionality was through the use of the Means-end theory utilising the laddering technique. Within the context of the research document through the laddering technique, it also became apparent that there is a clear role that <b>product</b> <b>labelling</b> plays as a strategic element in Integrated Marketing Communication functioning within the food and beverage industry.
