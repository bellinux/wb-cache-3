5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, <b>phytosociology</b> and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E
50|$|His {{interests}} included plant taxonomy, floristics, phytogeography, and <b>phytosociology.</b>|$|E
50|$|He educated many eminent botanists, {{including}} Józef Paczoski, {{the founder}} of <b>phytosociology.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... ——————— (1970) The <b>phytosociology</b> of the {{northern}} conifer-hardwoods of the Appalachian foothills in Southern Quebec. M.Sc. Thesis, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.|$|E
50|$|Kerner was {{particularly}} {{active in the}} fields of phytogeography and <b>phytosociology.</b> He died in 1898 in Vienna at the age of 67.|$|E
50|$|Westhoff {{published}} 700 scientific {{papers on}} <b>phytosociology</b> and conservation, {{as well as}} articles on classical music. He {{was a member of}} the International Association for Vegetation Science.|$|E
50|$|He was the Secretary General of the Fédération {{international}}e de phytosociologie from 2000 {{until his}} death. In 2010, he was honored {{at an international}} symposium on the one hundredth anniversary of <b>phytosociology.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phytosociology</b> is {{the branch}} of science which deals with plant communities, their {{composition}} and development, and {{the relationships between the}} species within them. A phytosociological system is a system for classifying these communities.|$|E
5000|$|... plant {{sociology}} (or <b>phytosociology,</b> synecology - however, this field doesn't prescind from flora study, as {{its approach to}} study vegetation relies upon a fundamental unit, the plant association, which is defined upon flora).|$|E
50|$|Charles Henri Marie Flahault (October 3, 1852 - February 3, 1935) was a French botanist, {{among the}} early pioneers of phytogeography, <b>phytosociology,</b> and forest ecology. The word relevé for a plant {{community}} sample is his invention.|$|E
50|$|He {{was mainly}} {{known for his}} works on <b>phytosociology,</b> plant ecology and his {{vegetation}} studies applied to nature conservation. He was a specialist in European coastal vegetations. He also {{played a major role}} in the characterization of the plant communities of Algeria.|$|E
50|$|In Josias Braun-Blanquet's dissertation, {{supervised}} by Charles Flahault, {{he worked on}} the <b>phytosociology</b> of the southern Cévennes. Subsequently he established the modern way of classifying vegetation according to floristic composition. This is what makes him {{one of the most influential}} botanists until today.|$|E
50|$|In 1920 famous {{sociologist}} Florian Znaniecki {{founded the}} first Polish department {{of sociology at}} the university, one of the first such departments in Europe. In the same period of the university's history, botanist Józef Paczoski founded the world's first institute of <b>phytosociology.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rooted in {{phytogeography}} {{and as such}} considered {{sometimes a}} field of geobotany, <b>phytosociology</b> emerged simultaneously in Poland (Paczoski), France (Braun-Blanquet) and Sweden (Du Rietz), but hardly penetrated in Anglo-Saxon world, where prevailed the continuum concept of community, opposed {{to the concept of}} plant associations.|$|E
5000|$|Schröter was {{a pioneer}} in the fields of {{phytogeography}} and <b>phytosociology.</b> He introduced the concept of [...] "autecology" [...] to explain the relationship of an individual plant with its external environment, and [...] "synecology" [...] to express relationships between plant communities and external influences.|$|E
50|$|In <b>phytosociology</b> and {{community}} ecology an association {{is a type}} of ecological community with a predictable species composition, consistent physiognomy (structural appearance) which occurs in a particular habitat type. The term was first coined by Alexander von Humboldt and formalised by the International Botanical Congress in 1910.|$|E
50|$|After the Polish-Soviet War in 1921, {{the core}} of the forest was {{declared}} a National Reserve. In 1923, Professor Józef Paczoski, a pioneer of the science of <b>phytosociology,</b> became a scientific manager of the forest reserves in the Białowieża Forest. He carried out detailed studies of the structure of forest vegetation there.|$|E
5000|$|Nowadays, phytosociologists try {{to include}} {{higher levels of}} {{complexity}} {{in the perception of}} vegetation, namely by describing whole successional units (vegetation series) or, in general, vegetation complexes. These lie in the scope of Landscape <b>Phytosociology.</b> Other developments include the use of multivariate statistics for the definition of [...] "syntaxa" [...] and their environmental interpretation.|$|E
50|$|A {{compendium}} (plural: compendia) is a concise {{compilation of}} a body of knowledge. A compendium may summarize a larger work. In most cases the body of knowledge will concern a specific field of human interest or endeavour (for example: hydrogeology, logology, ichthyology, <b>phytosociology</b> or myrmecology), while a general encyclopedia {{can be referred to}} as a compendium of all human knowledge.|$|E
50|$|Cover-abundance is {{a measure}} of plant cover, used in <b>phytosociology</b> (or {{vegetation}} science). It is based on percentages at the top end, but uses abundance estimates for species with a low cover plant cover. Several scales of cover-abundance are used, e.g. the original 5-point cover scale of Braun-Blanquet or the Domin scale, with finer subdivisions (from simple presence through 10 grades of linked cover-abundance).|$|E
50|$|In <b>phytosociology,</b> {{description}} of forest associations was physiognomically based. Many of his forest associations overlap modern ideas of dry and moist forests. The climate in Fiji is tropical marine and is consistently warm {{for the majority}} of the year, with extreme weather being a rarity. The warm season is from November till April, and the cooler season May to October. Temperatures in the cool season average 22 C.|$|E
50|$|On the one hand, {{some authors}} {{consider}} <b>phytosociology</b> {{to be in}} the scope of contemporary vegetation science, a successful approach because of its highly descriptive and predictive powers, and its usefulness in nature management issues. On the other hand, there are numerous critics who have focused on several methodological limitations: the absence of statistical approaches, the complexity and non-stability of the nomenclatural system, the mistakes in the predictive models, and certain basic assumptions.|$|E
5000|$|Léopold Reichling {{began his}} career in 1949 as a teacher of biology at the [...] "Lycée de garçons" [...] in Luxembourg-city. In 1957, he became {{professor}} of botany to the [...] "Cours supérieurs de Luxembourg" [...] (precursor of University of Luxembourg). Reichling is considered a pioneer of <b>phytosociology</b> in Luxembourg and an eminent specialist in the flora of the Grand Duchy. After his retirement in 1981, he intensively devoted himself to the investigation of terrestrial heteroptera in Luxembourg.|$|E
50|$|Even if in {{continental}} Europe, {{a complete}} synsystem describing vegetation types {{has been developed}} {{and it is a}} basis for habitat-type classification (e.g. NATURA 2000 typology and habitat network), there are numerous scientific experts who do not have a positive opinion about the suitability for <b>phytosociology</b> to be the main geobotanical approach for managing vegetation systems. An important point of disagreement is the floristic-phytosociological assumption that the forest patches of the Mediterranean species of pines mainly derived from afforestations, non-stables and incidentals.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} {{paradigm in}} <b>phytosociology</b> in Trinidad and Tobago {{has been the}} work of John Stanley Beard {{carried out in the}} 1940s. His description of forest associations was physiognomically based. Many of his forest associations overlap modern ideas of dry and moist forests. Most work which seeks to classify dry forest in this country, e.g., WWF classification, underestimate the extent of dry forest in Trinidad and Tobago by restricting it to the driest category of forests that Beard came up with for Trinidad.|$|E

50|$|Influenced by Pius Font i Quer and by {{the founder}} of the <b>phytosociology</b> Josias Braun-Blanquet, Bolòs would publish Les groupements végétaux moyen du bassin de l'Ebre et leur dynamisme with Braun-Blanquet in (1958). As a flora writer his main work was the Flora dels Països Catalans (Flora of Catalonia) (1984-2001), which was an effort to track {{comprehensively}} all that was known to then, the publishing was edited jointly with Josep Vigo Bonada. Published work by Bolòs include more than 200 titles of books, articles and contributions to other works.|$|E
5000|$|... « The {{concept of}} {{itinerant}} students {{went back to}} earlier times when students throughout Europe would travel to other countries and institutions to complete their education in real situations rather than be restricted to dry home and university study ». But as the College was also conceived as an educational and research center, the Scottish Pavilion housed too the SIGMA (International Station of Mediterranean and Alpine Geobotany) laboratory founded by Josias Braun-Blanquet, the Swiss botanist settled in Montpellier after he submitted a dissertation on <b>phytosociology</b> supervised by Flahault.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the floristic and taxonomic research and <b>phytosociology,</b> he devoted to the naming of cultivated plants and botany nomenclature, having submitted numerous proposals for amendments to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature and intervening in the discussion and vote during the sessions of Nomenclature of the International Botanical Congress of Stockholm - where he represented the National Agricultural Station and the Botanical Institutes of Coimbra and Porto - and Paris, representing the National Agricultural Station. In that Congress {{was appointed to the}} Committee for Spermatophyta of which was part from 1950 to 1969 and who presided until requested excuse.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{an early}} pioneer of the science of <b>phytosociology,</b> the study of natural plant communities. In 1896 he coined the term [...] "phytosociology". In 1923 he became a {{scientific}} manager of the forest reserves in the Białowieża Forest. He did much of his research on the vegetation of the Białowieża National Park. He {{was a member of}} the Polish Academy of Learning (Polska Akademia Umiejętności), the predecessor of the Polish Academy of Sciences. He established the first Institute of Plant Sociology in the world, at Poznań University. From 1925 to 1931 he was Professor of Plant Systematics and Sociology at that University.|$|E
50|$|She was {{the editor}} {{responsible}} for the 2nd edition of the Red Book of Rare and Endangered Plant and Fungi of Azerbaijan (2013). She {{is the author of}} the Azerbaijani section of Red List of the Endemic Plants of the Caucasus, (2013, English). It was the first time that the status of populations of rare species included in the Red Book were comprehensively studied, special monitoring system were prepared and a dynamic database was created. She studied the future dynamics of several sensitive plant species in danger of extinction via the application of mathematical modeling. She pioneered new approaches to population ontogenesis, ethnobotanics, <b>phytosociology,</b> and biodiversity informatics at the Institute of Botany.|$|E
5000|$|Professor Dostál {{published}} {{a number of}} professional, scientific and popular-scientific works in many fields of botany. His professional activities include higher plant systematics, taxonomy, floristics, morphology, <b>phytosociology,</b> phytogeography, Czechoslovak vegetation, dendrology, conservation, genetics and more. His major work was [...] "Flora of Czechoslovakia" [...] and [...] "Key to the complete flora of Czechoslovakia." [...] Professor Dostál 's diligence, his talent and vitality achieved international scientific recognition. He was a regional adviser to Flora Europea and prepared the material on ferns for an edition of Hegi's Flora von Mittel-Europa. He took {{an active part in}} many international congresses and meetings (England, Spain, Italy, Greece, Crete, Cyprus, Turkey and Egypt). He {{was a member of the}} Czech, Slovak and Bulgarian Botanical Societies.|$|E
50|$|His {{professional}} {{fields were}} phytomorphology, <b>phytosociology</b> and phytogeography. He was also known {{to draw from}} humanist subjects such as philology, ethnology and history. His first work was Die Vegetation und Flora des Sylenegebietes, about the mountain flora of the Sylane range, released by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 1927-1928. Versuch einer neuen Einteilung der subalpinen-alpinen Vegetation Norwegens came in 1936. His main work was Sikkilsdalen og Norges fjellbeiter (Sikkilsdalen and Norway's mountain pastures). En plantesosiologisk monografi, released in 1943. More popular releases were the text volume of Norsk flora in 1940 and Våre ville planter. The latter book was released in eight volumes between 1950 and 1958 in which he contributed with four other authors: Torstein Lagerberg, Jens Holmboe, Einar Du Rietz and John Axel Nannfeldt.|$|E
5000|$|The aim of <b>phytosociology</b> is {{to achieve}} a {{sufficient}} empirical model of vegetation using plant taxa combinations that characterize univocally vegetation units. Vegetation units as understood by phytosociologists may express largely abstract vegetation concepts (e.g. the set of all hard-leaved evergreen forests of western Mediterranean area) or actual readily recognizable vegetation types (e.g. cork-oak oceanic forests on Pleistocene dunes with dense canopy in SW-Iberian Peninsula). Such conceptual units are called [...] "syntaxa" [...] (singular [...] "syntaxon") and can be set in a hierarchy system called [...] "synsystem" [...] or syntaxonomic system. The act of creation, amelioration or adjusting the synsystem is called [...] "syntaxonomy". Therefore, the syntaxonomic system is putatively a sufficient empirical representation of vegetation of a given territory. An International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature, issuing the rules for naming [...] "syntaxa" [...] exists and its use has increased among vegetation scientists.|$|E
50|$|Smith's major {{contributions}} came as {{a consequence}} of the death of his brother, Robert. Like his brother, Robert Smith had studied at Dundee, but then went on to the University of Montpellier, where he had studied under Charles Flahault, a pioneer of phytogeography and <b>phytosociology.</b> Robert Smith adapted Flahault's sampling method to better suit Scottish vegetation and went on to pioneer vegetation mapping in the British Isles. When he died suddenly in 1900, William Smith completed his brother's unfinished manuscript and took up his own surveys of the vegetation of Yorkshire. In 1903, together with Charles Edward Moss and W. Munn Rankin, he published the first vegetation maps of England. In 1904, together Arthur Tansley, Moss, Rankin and others, Smith established the Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation, later renamed the British Vegetation Committee. The group set about coordinating ongoing vegetation surveys and standardising methodology between them. In 1906 the committee produced a pamphlet entitled Suggestions for Beginning Survey Work on Vegetation. In 1913, the committee organised the British Ecological Society, the first ever professional body of ecologists. Smith served as president of the society in 1918 and 1919.|$|E
50|$|His {{studies in}} {{taxonomy}} and floristics yielded {{a substantial number}} of new taxa, among which stand out the Silene rothmaleri Pinto da Silva, Convolvulus Fernandes Pinto da Silva & Teles and Digitalis Heywoodii (Pinto da Silva & M. Silva), including new taxa for the flora of Portugal and the Azores and a better knowledge of the area of many plants and their nomenclature. Since 1958, despite the shortage of staff, he assembled a Phytochorion Atlas covering more than half the area of Portugal. He organized the herbarium of the National Agronomic Station, which under his action went from just over 3,000 to almost 100,000 entries. He also developed complementary collections (diaspore in Portuguese flora, paleoethnobotany, etc.) and miscellaneous files. He edited the Index Seminum and organized the service of exchange and registration of seeds of that station from 1939 to 1982. First {{with the help of the}} principal investigator eng. AN Telles, then as a member of the Technical Council of the League for the Protection of Nature, of which he was one of the founders, established the first lists of Portuguese botanical areas to protect. Regarding the vegetation, he began systematic studies of <b>phytosociology</b> in Portugal with the collaboration of the Swiss botanist Josias Braun-Blanquet, having studied various plant communities and associations as oak forest, rivers, woods, Quercus coccifera forests, dunes, salty, vegetation, limestone soils and ultramafic rocks, vineyards, meadows, pastures.|$|E
