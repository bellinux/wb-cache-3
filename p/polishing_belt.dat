40|$|Strontium {{titanate}} (SrTiO 3, STO) {{ceramic substrate}} is an incipient ferroelectric material with a perovskite structure {{and which has}} {{a wide range of}} applications in the fields of microwave, millimetre wave, and optic fibre. This paper reports on a system of experiments carried out on STO substrates using a new magnetorheological (MR) finishing process where dynamic magnetic fields are formed by magnetic poles rotate. The results show that a circular ring shaped <b>polishing</b> <b>belt</b> with a stability evaluation zone appears on the surface after being polished by MR finishing with a single-point dynamic magnetic field. The dynamic magnetic fields are stronger when the revolutions of magnetic pole increase and eccentricity of pole enlarge, with the surface finish is smoother and more material is removed. The optimum machining times, machining gap, oscillation distance, eccentricity of pole, revolutions of the workpiece and magnetic pole are 60 min, 0. 8 mm, 0 mm, 7 mm, and 350 r min− 1 and 90 r min− 1, respectively, and the best MR fluid consists of 6 wt% of diamond abrasives in W 1 particle size and 18 wt% of carbonyl iron powder in W 3. 5 particle size. A surface roughness of Ra and a material removal rate of 8 nm and 0. 154 μm min− 1 can be obtained in these optimum process conditions. Finally, the polishing mechanism for dynamic magnetic fields and the mechanism for removing material from STO ceramic substrates are discussed in detail...|$|E

5|$|The {{first task}} is to <b>polish</b> Howard's <b>belt</b> buckles. Howard tends to stand {{too close to the}} urinal and urine often {{splashes}} back onto the buckles. Sheldon is given a black light and several dozen belt buckles to clean. Sheldon performs the task flawlessly. For his second task, Sheldon is forced to wear a French maid costume that Howard originally bought for his girlfriend Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Sheldon is seen in the cafeteria at Caltech with everyone staring at him.|$|R

Calculation process of cutter-contact point data is given in this paper, the process mainly includes acquisition and discrete of polishing tool path and the associated vector calculation. Subsequently, detail of the process such as tool path pattern, row spacing, step distance and best contact conditions are analyzed and calculated. Finally, in visual studio environment, the cutter-contact point data of gun-receiver surface is generated by calling UG / Open API function. 1...|$|R

Linke has notably competed in the European Championship, NAGA, Grapplers Quest, ADCC and the Pan American Games. Linke is currently in talks with top Polish promotion Konfrontacja Sztuk Walki to negotiate a 2 fight contract to close out his mixed martial arts career by the end of 2015, Linke has stated despite retiring from fighting he will still continue his grappling career and is rumored to be in the 2014 ADCC Polish Trials to enter the 2015 ADCC World Championship.|$|R
50|$|Slutsk sash is {{declared}} to be a cultural heritage of Belarus.Kontush Sash an Attribute of a Nobleman.Kontush Sash (belt) has oriental provenance rooted in Persian and Turkish tradition. Intense contacts between Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Persia {{and even more}} with Turkey developed vast trade roots and raised popular interest in oriental art and decoration all over “Eastern” Europe. The Ideology of Sarmathism created in XVIc a wide super-ethnos embracing many Central European nations. Kontush Belt was a visual manifestation of Sarmathian identity. Kontush belt was widely popular in Lithuania and Belarus, in Poland, Ukraine, Hungary, Saxony, Moldavia, Besarabia and some parts of Russia. Kontush belts were worn by Nobility, Cossack elders and high municipality officials. The time of prosperity over the period of XVI - XVIIIc created surplus financial resources often channeled into culture, art and decorations. Polish Armenian merchants imported objects of luxury: oriental carpets, weapons decorated with gold and stones, expensive fabrics. Kontush belts especially emphasized {{the status of the}} bearer and were unusually expensive. At the certain moment the demand for the Kontush belts became so large that it was necessary to open the local manufacturing on the territory of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The workshops producing Kontush Belts in Slutsk, Grodno, Lvov, Vilno, Buchach, Kobylki, Kraków, Gdansk, Lipkow were opened mostly by <b>Polish</b> Armenians. The <b>belts</b> that were made there still had a lot of oriental ornamentation, but had their own distinct character - different from the belts formerly imported from Persia and Turkey. There was a practical part to it as well. Folded in half and wrapped around the body, the belt served as a pocket for money and documents. Most belts are about 30 cm wide and around 3,5m long. As the result of weaving technique - one side of the belt was a negative of the other. This way it was possible for the belt to have two different color schemes (so called two-sided belt). Further division of the belt allowed to make four color compositions (four-sided belt). The price of the belt depended on the materials used (sometimes they added silver and gold thread). The complexity of the design raised the price even more since it required more complicated manufacturing machinery, higher qualifications of the craftsmen and longer production cycle. The four-sided belts were the most expensive. They were meant to be worn on different occasions: bright side - for wedding, dark side for the funeral, green side for the green kontush etc. Very often the belt served as a table decoration - it was placed at the center along the table cloth.|$|R
