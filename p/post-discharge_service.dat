40|$|Background: The {{literature}} evaluating 90 -day episodes is {{recent and}} mostly {{limited to the}} Medicare population. The present study expands upon existing knowledge on 90 -day episode costs and readmissions in a younger and privately insured population. Understanding the cost and <b>post-discharge</b> <b>service</b> component differences is crucial for successful implementation of bundled payments in total joint replacement (TJR). Methods: We obtained claims data for the years 2008 to 2013 from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas (BCBSTX) for primary TJR procedures. We used an episode of care approach to evaluate cost determinants of a 90 -day episode-of-care using multilevel regression. Costs were aggregated using “allowed amount” payments to providers. Then, we evaluated whether specific post-discharge care follow-up events such as initiation of rehabilitative care and visits to a primary care physician or orthopedic specialist {{were significantly associated with}} the likelihood of any 90 -day readmission using logistic GEE models. Results: The mean total cost for a 90 -day episode for TJR was 47, 700. A prolonged length of stay (RR: 1. 19; 95...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Shorter {{periods of}} {{hospitalisation}} and increasing warfarin use have placed stress on community-based healthcare services {{to care for}} patients taking warfarin after hospital discharge, a high-risk period for these patients. A previous randomised controlled trial demonstrated that a <b>post-discharge</b> <b>service</b> of 4 home visits and point-of-care (POC) International Normalised Ratio (INR) testing by a trained pharmacist improved patients' outcomes. The current study aims to modify this previously trialled service model to implement and then evaluate a sustainable program to enable the smooth transition of patients taking warfarin from the hospital to community setting. Methods/Design The service will be trialled in 8 sites across 3 Australian states using a prospective, controlled cohort study design. Patients discharged from hospital taking warfarin will receive 2 or 3 home visits by a trained 'home medicines review (HMR) -accredited' pharmacist in their 8 to 10 days after hospital discharge. Visits will involve a HMR, comprehensive warfarin education, and POC INR monitoring in collaboration with patients' general practitioners (GPs) and community pharmacists. Patient outcomes will be compared to those in a control, or 'usual care', group. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of patients experiencing a major bleeding event in the 90 days after discharge. Secondary outcome measures will include combined major bleeding and thromboembolic events, death, cessation of warfarin therapy, INR control at 8 days post-discharge and unplanned hospital readmissions from any cause. Stakeholder satisfaction will be assessed using structured postal questionnaire mailed to patients, GPs, community pharmacists and accredited pharmacists {{at the completion of}} their study involvement. Discussion This study design incorporates several aspects of prior interventions that have been demonstrated to improve warfarin management, including POC INR testing, warfarin education and home visits by trained pharmacists. It faces several potential challenges, including the tight timeframe for patient follow-up in the post-discharge period. Its strengths lie in a strong multidisciplinary team and the utilisation of existing healthcare frameworks. It is hoped that this study will provide the evidence to support the national roll-out of the program as a new Australian professional community pharmacy service.

40|$|Introdução: Nos últimos anos, os programas de Triagem Auditiva Neonatal (TAN) têm sido responsáveis por antecipar o diagnóstico das deficiências auditivas sensorioneurais e condutivas, quando ambas estão presentes ao nascimento. O presente estudo relata uma experiência de triagem auditiva iniciada antes da alta hospitalar na UTI Neonatal e de orientação para triagem no Berçário Comum após a alta. Com o passar dos anos, o programa estendeu-se para atendimento também no Berçário Comum. Objetivos: Descrever um programa de Triagem Auditiva Neonatal em uma maternidade da rede privada de Salvador, no período de 2000 a 2006, no que se refere ao seu contexto histórico, ao processo de implantação e às modificações ocorridas ao longo dos anos; também são discutidos os achados audiológicos e a relação com os critérios de qualidade propostos pelo Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, de 2000. Material e método: trata-se de um estudo retrospectivo, de caráter transversal. Foram triados 4997 neonatos e lactentes com emissões otoacústicas, equipamento Echocheck, e observação do reflexo cócleo-palpebral. Os sujeitos foram divididos em quatro grupos: AI= UTI Neonatal e triagem na pré-alta; AII= UTI Neonatal e triagem na pós-alta; BI= Berçário Comum e triagem na pré-alta; BII= Berçário Comum e triagem na pós-alta. Resultados: Foi descrito o processo de evolução e implantação da triagem auditiva no período de 2000 a 2006. Quanto aos achados audiológicos, foram descritos os resultados da triagem auditiva de 2001 a 2006. Houve cobertura em 38, 9 % dos neonatos e lactentes em 2001, chegando a 79, 5 % em 2006. Na análise dos atendimentos na pré-alta, o grupo AI/BI apresentou índices de falha de 8, 1 % a 11, 2 %; na análise de atendimentos na pós-alta, no grupo AII/BII, os índices de falha mantiveram-se em 2, 6 %. Como resultados finais, no grupo AI/BI, do total de 1739 triagens, houve 21 casos confirmados de alterações auditivas, sendo 17 condutivas (9, 8 : 1. 000) e quatro sensorioneurais (2, 3 : 1000). No grupo AII/BII, do total de 3256 triagens, houve 24 casos confirmados de alterações auditivas, sendo 20 condutivas (6, 1 : 1000) e quatro sensorioneurais (1, 2 : 1000). Conclusão: os dados indicaram que o atendimento antes da alta para UTI Neonatal e sua extensão gradual para o Berçário Comum são viáveis, desde que o protocolo seja continuamente ajustado. Embora representasse a terça parte da amostra, o grupo AI/BI apresentou uma prevalência maior de alterações auditivas, evidenciando a importância da TAN antes da alta hospitalar para o diagnóstico precoce de alterações auditivas congênitasIntroduction: The Newborn Hearing Screening Program {{have been}} {{responsible}} for anticipating the sensorineural and conductive hearing loss diagnoses for the last few years. This study refers to the experience of a hearing screening starting before the hospital discharge in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and also to the orientation to the Well-baby Nursery screening after the discharge. Aims: Describe a Newborn Hearing Screening Program in a maternity hospital of the privative network in Salvador, from 2000 to 2006, considering the historical context, the process of implementation, the changes through the years, as well as the hearing findings and the relation with the quality criteria proposed by the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing 2000. Method and Material: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. 4997 newborns and infants were screened through the use of Echocheck, the otoacoustic emissions equipment and through the observation of the cochlear-palpebral reflex. The results were divided in four groups: AI = NICU and screening in the pre-discharge; AII = NICU and screening in the post-discharge; BI = Well-baby Nursery and screening in the pre-discharge; BII = Well-baby Nursery and screening in the post-discharge. Results: A description of the evolution and implementation process of the hearing screening from 2000 to 2006 was done; in relation to the audiological findings, the hearing screening results described were the ones from 2001 to 2006. There was an assessment of 38, 9 % of the newborns and infants in 2001, and 79, 5 % in 2006. According to the pre-discharge service analyses, the group AI/BI had from 8, 1 % to 11, 2 % of fails; in the <b>post-discharge</b> <b>service</b> analyses, the group AII/BII maintained the fail index in 2, 6 %. As final results of the AI/BI group, from the total of 1739 screenings, there were 21 confirmed cases of hearing alterations, being 20 conductive(6, 1 : 1000) and 4 sensorineural (1, 2 : 1000). Conclusion: The data indicates that the service before the discharge to the NICU and a gradual extension to the Well-baby Nursery is workable, ever since the protocol is continuously adjustable. Although the AI/BI group was the third part of the sample it represented a higher prevalence of hearing alterations. These show the importance of the hearing screening before the hospital discharge, so a higher number of congenital hearing problems can be assesse...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{measure the}} type and {{frequency}} of complications for surgical patients 1 month after discharge. Methods: A post-discharge patient survey was conducted in 2000 for patients who had undergone one of five elective operations: transurethral resection of the prostate, hysterectomy, major joint replacement, cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy. Two hundred and fourteen patients (74 %) returned the survey forms, which were sent 1 month after surgery. Patients were recruited from two teaching hospitals in the Hunter Area Health Service, New South Wales, Australia. Results: One hundred and thirty-five (63 %) patients reported one or more complications and 78 (37 %) received treatment for 109 complications. Eighty-six per cent reported pain after discharge and 41 % reported moderate to severe pain. Seventeen per cent reported infections after discharge and 94 % of these patients were given treatment. Twenty-eight per cent reported bleeding after discharge and 20 % of these were given treatment. Eleven (5 %) patients were readmitted for treatment of problems related to their surgery including four who required further surgery. One hundred and seventy-two patients accessed a range of health services during the first month after discharge, resulting in 266 occasions of service. Twenty-eight per cent of <b>post-discharge</b> <b>services</b> were unplanned. Conclusions: The lack of post-discharge monitoring conceals information about surgical outcomes. Patient reporting is an effective method of monitoring post-discharge outcomes. There is scope to develop <b>post-discharge</b> <b>services</b> {{to improve the quality}} of care in the areas of post-discharge pain management, the use of prophylactic measures and to provide treatment for complications that occur during this period...|$|R

40|$|Background: Autoimmune {{encephalitis}} (AE) {{occurs in}} response to an antibody-mediated central nervous system disease and can lead to significant neurodisability. Prior research on family adjustment has described a reciprocal relationship between caregiver functioning, distress and clinical outcome in parents and children with encephalitis. There has been no previous research exploring the experiences of caregivers with a child with AE. Aims: To explore the perspectives of parents and/or caregivers with a child diagnosed with AE regarding (i) their own adjustment from hospital admission to post-discharge, and (ii) their experiences of care and service provision. Methods: A purposive sampling approach was used. Five parents of children with AE participated in a semi-structured interview exploring their experiences of caring for their child and service provision during acute care and post-discharge. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to analyse the transcripts. Main findings and conclusions: Four shared super-ordinate themes with related subthemes emerged: (a) uncertainty, (b) managing our recovery, (c) changes in my child, (d) experiences of service provision. Participants reported emotional distress, often underpinned by recurrent experiences of uncertainty, and ‘loss’ of the previous child, and mediated by coping strategies and social support. While an overall positive experience of inpatient services was reported, parents often perceived <b>post-discharge</b> <b>services</b> as lacking in co-ordination, communication and formal follow-up, resulting in unmet support needs. Implications and recommendations for services, practitioners and future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the perceptions of}} people taking on a new or expanded caring role for an elderly patient recently hospitalised with a new or intensified health problem. Design: Observational study collecting qualitative data monthly for six months following patients’ discharge from hospital and attempted return to independent living in the community. Setting: Four South Australian acute hospitals (one metropolitan, three country). Subjects: 34 unpaid carers were nominated by 100 patients. 24 carers participated (17 elderly spouses, 3 younger family members, 4 neighbours and/ or friends). Results: The study highlighted carers’ perceptions of being unprepared for their new tasks, and their frustrations at the long-term and frequently significant changes to their lives brought about by assuming a caring role. Many carers felt their role had been imposed upon them without real choice, and that their own physical and emotional fitness for their new role had not been considered during discharge planning. Carers {{claimed to have been}} provided with little information about how to care for the patient, particularly when community services were seldom provided in the first week after discharge. Stresses developed in many of the carer-patient relationships, and patient and carer morale was often low for months post-discharge. Discussion: Carers indicated that their tasks could have been made easier by more timely, targeted education about their patient’s condition and their role in managing it. They would have liked greater inclusion in discharge planning processes whilst the patient was in hospital, and more timely and appropriate provision of <b>post-discharge</b> <b>services</b> that were patient- and carer-focused, and which addressed their ability to live independently in the community. Conclusion: Discharge planning systems should take greater account of the motivation and needs of carers, especially when this role is new or becoming expanded, and of the barriers they face in undertaking their role...|$|R

40|$|Background Medication misadventure is {{greatest}} {{at times}} of change such as the transition from hospital to community. Patients with heart failure are prone to medication misadventure due to polypharmacy, inappropriate medication use and frequent readmissions. Objective To identify the barriers encountered when implementing a Liaison Pharmacist facilitated <b>post-discharge</b> medication management <b>service</b> for patients with heart failure. Method A Liaison Pharmacist contacted the patient’s General Practitioner (GP), sent them a medication discharge summary and organised an appointment for the patient with the GP approximately 2 days post-discharge to make a Home Medicines Review (HMR) referral. The patient’s community pharmacist was also contacted, sent a medication discharge summary and requested to engage an accredited pharmacist to undertake the HMR. The Liaison Pharmacist arranged for the HMR report {{to be sent to}} the outpatient department clinic to enable assessment of outcomes at the outpatient department follow-up 12 weeks post-discharge. Main outcome measure: GP HMR referral rates. Results 90 patients were offered the service. Fifty-nine patients (66 %) agreed to have their GP contacted with 56 GPs agreeing to order a HMR and 41 patients having an HMR post-discharge. Barriers to the implementation of a HMR post-discharge included: patient withdrawal, low GP awareness of the HMR process and conducting the HMR in a timely manner. Conclusion This study provides evidence for the feasibility of a <b>post-discharge</b> pharmacy <b>service</b> for patients with heart failure although barriers to implementation have been identified.

40|$|Previously a {{long-term}} {{mental health treatment}} option, inpatient psychiatric care is now an acute service for brief crisis stabilization and psychiatric reconstitution. Although lengths of stay have declined, rehospitalization rates have risen, calling into question the effectiveness of inpatient treatment {{and the extent to}} which inpatient and <b>post-discharge,</b> community-based <b>services</b> are working together to promote community tenure for youth. The present study had three aims: (1) evaluate the utility of the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS; Lyons, 1999) as an outcome assessment and decision support tool for youth inpatient hospitalization, (2) confirm a social ecological theory-informed factor structure of the CANS, and (3) identify individual youth and greater social ecological factors predicting time to psychiatric rehospitalization. Demographic, service-related variables, CANS, and Acuity of Psychiatric Illness [...] Child/Adolescent version (CAPI; Lyons, 1998) data was collected from 226 youth admitted to a private psychiatric inpatient hospital (M age= 8. 71, SD= 1. 95). Results from factor analysis strategies revealed that none of the tested models demonstrated good fit and factor analysis strategies did not converge with respect to the number of factors extracted and the items comprising these factors. However, results suggested a model of youth social and emotional functioning comprised of multiple, inter-related components. Survival analysis identified history of fire setting and previous psychiatric hospitalization as significant predictors of time to psychiatric rehospitalization. Future research identifying evidence-based assessment tools for use in this treatment milieu and identifying factors across the social ecologies of youth that promote psychiatric stabilization and community tenure is indicated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Readmissions are {{costly and}} have {{implications}} for quality of care. Studies {{have been reported to}} support effects of transitional care programs in reducing hospital readmissions and enhancing clinical outcomes. However, there is a paucity of studies executing full economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of these transitional care programs. This study is therefore launched to fill this knowledge gap. Methods Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial that examined the effects of a Health-Social Transitional Care Management Program (HSTCMP) for medical patients discharged from an acute regional hospital in Hong Kong. The cost and health outcomes were compared between the patients receiving the HSTCMP and usual care. The total costs comprised the pre-program, program, and healthcare utilization costs. Quality of life was measured with SF- 36 and transformed to utility values between 0 and 1. Results The readmission rates within 28 (control 10. 2 %, study 4. 0 %) and 84 days (control 19. 4 %, study 8. 1 %) were significantly higher in the control group.

OBJECTIVE: to {{investigate}} the relationship between adherence to six of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) Ten steps to successful breast feeding and the duration of breast feeding in first-time mothers. DESIGN: a prospective study to assess the duration of breast feeding up to 6 months postpartum. Survival analysis techniques (Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models) were used to interpret the data. PARTICIPANTS: 317 women who {{had given birth to}} their first baby (at term) in a large teaching maternity hospital in Adelaide, South Australia, during the period March to November 2003. FINDINGS: ignoring all other factors, we found that women whose babies received a bottle feed, used a pacifier or dummy, or who used a nipple shield during their postnatal stay, were at significantly greater risk of weaning (p 0. 05). After adjusting for socio-demographic variables, self-efficacy, intended duration of breast feeding, and method of delivery, the results unexpectedly showed that the only significant predictor of early weaning was breast feeding on demand. However, a composite variable indicating use of one or more of nipple shields, a dummy or bottle feeds while in hospital resulted in a significantly greater risk of weaning (p= 0. 05). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: socio-demographic and cultural factors may be more important determinants of the duration of breast feeding than some of the very specific hospital practices targeted in the Ten steps to successful breast feeding. From a public health perspective, we may influence the duration of breast feeding through better <b>post-discharge</b> support <b>services,</b> or through interventions that improve attitudes to breast feeding in specific socio-cultural and economic groups.

40|$|Objectives: The {{poor health}} profile {{of people who}} are {{homeless}} results in a disproportionate use of health resources by these people. An in-hospital count of demographic and health data of homeless patients was conducted on two occasions at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney as an indicator of health resource utilisation for the Sydney region. Methods: Two in-hospital counts were conducted of homeless patients within the boundaries of St Vincent’s Hospital to coincide with the inaugural City of Sydney homeless street counts in winter 2008 and summer 2009. Data collected included level of homelessness, principal diagnosis, triage category, bed occupancy and linkages to services post hospital discharge. Results: Homeless patients at St Vincent’s utilised over four times the number of acute ward beds when compared with the state average. This corresponds to a high burden of mental health, substance use and physical health comorbidities in homeless people. There was high utilisation of mental health and drug and alcohol services by homeless people, and high levels of linkages with these <b>services</b> <b>post-discharge.</b> There were relatively low rates of linkage with general practitioner and ambulatory care services.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{effectiveness}} of individualised cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) on the psychological adjustment of patients undergoing rehabilitation for newly acquired spinal cord injury. Setting: South Australian Spinal Cord Injury Service, Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre, South Australia, Australia. Methods: Eleven participants received individual CBT {{as part of their}} spinal rehabilitation. Self-reported levels of depression, anxiety and stress were assessed before the intervention, at week 12 of rehabilitation and at 3 months post-discharge, using the depression, anxiety and stress scales (DASS- 21). Functional independence was also assessed, using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Responses were compared with 13 participants, closely matched on demographic and injury variables, who received standard psychological care (that is, assessment and monitoring only). Results: Depression scores for treatment participants showed a significant time effect, with worsening symptoms reported at three-month follow-up, after CBT was discontinued. In contrast, the DASS- 21 scores of standard care participants remained at subclinical levels throughout the study. Clinical improvements in symptoms of anxiety and stress were also reported by the treatment group as inpatient therapy progressed. Conclusion: Targeted, individualised psychological treatment contributed to short-term, meaningful improvements in emotional outcomes for individuals reporting psychological morbidity after recent spinal injury. The results also highlight the need for ongoing access to specialised, psychological <b>services</b> <b>post-discharge.</b> Replication of these results with a larger sample is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

40|$|Aim: This study {{describes}} clinical staff {{opinions on}} the availability and suitability of resources to provide trauma care to {{children and their families}} and any perceived strengths, gaps and potential interventions to strengthen care. Methods: A mixed-method study was conducted in five Australian paediatric trauma centres. The trauma coordinator at each site participated in a structured interview to determine models of care and trauma activity at their site. This informed the development of an electronic survey, which sought staff opinion on child and family access to services and perceived gaps in care. Results: Five trauma coordinators were interviewed, and 214 clinicians (medical, nursing, allied health) from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland completed the survey. Each site had a trauma director and coordinator, and there was variance in resource availability. Almost all survey participants (92. 5 %) considered their hospital met the physical needs of injured children, 68. 2 % thought that the psychosocial needs of children were met and 82. 1 % thought that the needs of families were met. The least accessible services reported were clinical psychology/family counselling, mental health and behaviour management services. No routine follow-up support <b>services</b> <b>post-discharge</b> for the child or their families were identified. Conclusion: Staff providing care for injured children report that physical needs are better met than psychosocial needs. There is variability in resource levels across paediatric trauma centres. A coordinated model of care that provides psychosocial care both during hospitalisation and post-discharge could reduce this gap in care for injured children and their families. 5 page(s...|$|R

It may be helpful in expanding our knowledge in areas where research evidence is poor such as experiences of hospital discharge planning for the family carers of people with dementia. Methods: A rapid review. All study designs published in the English language were eligible for inclusion. Databases included: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Cochrane library and Web of Knowledge. A qualitative analysis was undertaken. Results: Four themes were identified: preparation for hospital discharge – dissatisfaction with being kept informed, discharge arrangements and management of conditions; little time to prepare. Communication between staff and families at discharge – insufficient communication regarding services, not being listened to and being undervalued as a resource could compromise <b>post-discharge</b> care. Support <b>services</b> post discharge – carers need help negotiating, and working with, services with regard to timing, and meeting requirements. Coping post hospital discharge – inadequate understanding about ability to cope, and patient's impairment, and family conflict over care may lead to unnecessary re-admission to hospital, or long term care. Evidence of specialist dementia models at discharge is described. Discussion: Carers are not always involved in hospital discharge planning as well as they might be. Issues are complex and depend on a number of factors. Poor communication can be overcome and carers can be better supported to cope post discharge as illustrated in the dementia models. The evidence base is weak but the absence of evidence does not indicate an absence of good practice. Conclusion: Carers who may feel their world is far removed from the academic world may not ordinarily participate in research studies. Service users, as co-researchers, may be able to improve trust and rapport between research and communities, collect fresh insights and gain deeper and more insightful data from participants...|$|R

Results: Four themes were identified: preparation for hospital discharge – dissatisfaction with being kept informed, discharge arrangements and management of conditions; little time to prepare. Communication between staff and families at discharge – insufficient communication regarding services, not being listened to and being undervalued as a resource could compromise <b>post-discharge</b> care. Support <b>services</b> post discharge – carers need help negotiating, and working with, services with regard to timing, and meeting requirements. Coping post hospital discharge – inadequate understanding about ability to cope, and patient&# 39;s impairment, and family conflict over care may lead to unnecessary re-admission to hospital, or long term care. Evidence of specialist dementia models at discharge is described. Discussion: Carers are not always involved in hospital discharge planning as well as they might be. Issues are complex and depend on a number of factors. Poor communication can be overcome and carers can be better supported to cope post discharge as illustrated in the dementia models. The evidence base is weak but the absence of evidence does not indicate an absence of good practice. Conclusion: Carers who may feel their world is far removed from the academic world may not ordinarily participate in research studies. Service users, as co-researchers, may be able to improve trust and rapport between research and communities, collect fresh insights and gain deeper and more insightful data from participants.

40|$|When {{individuals}} with serious mental illness are discharged to the community, continuous and coordinated care are both desirable and necessary. A lack of continuity places the individual {{at risk for}} becoming lost to further services. This study explores continuity of care for persons discharged from state psychiatric facilities in Virginia to communities. Continuity of care {{is defined as the}} successful initiation and maintenance of face-to-face contact by CSB staff with individuals to be discharged from state hospitals, and the subsequent provision of <b>services</b> <b>post-discharge.</b> This study identifies factors that influence continuity of care, examines the degree to which these factors play a role and the relationships between continuity of care and client characteristics. Predictor variables include characteristics of the population-at-risk: predisposing factors (i. e., age, gender, race), enabling factors (i. e., living situation, catchment area change, and geographic location of the CSB) and need factors (i. e., length of stay, legal status, and primary diagnoses). Data sources include two large data bases, 1) survey of CSB staff on the outcome of individuals discharged to their area in FY 1992, and 2) demographic information from state mental health authority. Findings from the survey show that 83 % of persons discharged had a record of the discharge at the CSB. Inhospital contact by CSB staff prior to discharge was lower (54 %). Results show that individuals are more likely to receive continuity of care if they are discharged to a CSB in a rural area, have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and do not have a primary diagnosis of substance abuse. The theoretical framework, based on the Community Support System principles and the notion of vulnerability, leads to important policy and practice implications. For example, the study suggests that new and different programs might be more effective for {{individuals with}} substance abuse diagnoses, especially in urban areas. Recommendations include a mandate for nursing provision of services, or oversight of services to assure continuity of care between service settings. Future research could improve upon the measurement of the variables, and examine consumer and provider perceptions of continuity of care as an outcome...|$|R
40|$|M. A. (Social Work) In South Africa {{very few}} {{facilities}} {{exist for the}} treatment of chemical substance dependency, and-many chemically dependent persons who, because of work and family commitments cannot admit themselves to a long-term inpatient government or registered treatment facility, are deprived of an opportunity to receive appropriate treatment for their condition. Riverfield Lodge, a private treatment centre, was designed and built to meet the need for a shorter-term intensive inpatient treatment programme for individuals and their families whose physical, psychological and social functioning, and work performance have become impaired {{as a result of their}} abuse of psychoactive chemical substances. Realizing the responsibility to be accountable both to the clients served and to the funding agents of this project, the need for an accountable empirically-based treatment programme which can be used at Riverfield Lodge was identified. This study was undertaken with the aim to develop a short-term treatment programme for chemically dependent persons in a therapeutic community, based on research findings and a literature study of already existing intervention strategies (social technology) and treatment programmes. This study is undertaken within the practice-research paradigma- - a new perspective which calls for social workers to adopt systematic research procedures to shape, direct and monitor their practice activities (in this case the treatment of chemically dependent persons), and (since theultimate aim of this study is to design new social technology) Development research, a relatively new research model 'that was designed by Edwin Thomas, is used as research design. In order to ascertain whether the treatment of chemically dependent persons is necessary and successful, and to identify and determine which treatment methods are most effective when treating chemical substance dependency, vailable literature on the treatment of chemical substance dependency was studied. Based on the finding of this investigation, a short-term treatment programme was designed. Although this programme was designed on request of the Management of Riverfield Lodge, it can also be adapted and used by any other praciitioners who render treatment services to persons who are addicted to chemical substances. The Riverfield Lodge treatment programme takes an holistic approach to treating the individual, rather than treating the symptoms. Symptomatic treatment of drug dependency is rarely successful, and this treatment programme provides for the' physical restoration, resocialization and psychological integration of the dependent individual and those close to him. It entails improvement in physical and social functioning, self image, self esteem, interpersonal relationships, positive family interaction and productivity, the establishment and attainment of realistic life goals, and a healthy lifestyle adjustment without chemical substances. Treatment at Riverfield Lodge will be rendered in a therapeutic community, and medical treatment, individual psychotherapy and social work intervention, group work, behaviour modification, occupational therapy and family therapy will be used as treatment methods. The importance of continuing, prolonged aftercare is emphasized, and <b>post-discharge</b> support <b>services</b> and follow-up counselling will be provided. Based on research findings it is recommended that, although a general treatment programme has been developed, it is imperative to assess every patient individually to determine which combination of the available forms of treatment methods are best suited in the case concerned. It is likely that in the individual suffering from chemical substance dependence, a number of interacting predisposing and precipitating factors have been at work to produce the condition which itself in turn produces physical, psychological, emotional and social changes. For these reasons it is unlikely that one and the same method of treatment would be effective for every individual case. Finally it is emphasised that the treatment of chemical substance dependency is not the prerogative or the responsibility of one profession. The multi-dimensional nature of this social problem necessitates the participation of a multi-disciplinary team of trained and skilled professionals in the treatment process. In addition the dependents family and friend, his employer and colleagues and other support systems have to work in close co-operation with the multi-professional team to achieve the best possible results. This short term, twenty eight day inpatient treatment programme will hopefully offer an extensive and comprehensive foundation for recovery from chemical substance dependence, and combined with long term aftercare treatment programmes, it is expected to make a significant contribution to the alcohol and drug treatment field in South Africa...|$|R
