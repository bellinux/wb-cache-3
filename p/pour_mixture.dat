40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} influence of fillers on viscosity, especially of six mixtures that contain different amount of ferrite powder. It was made {{in order to find}} out an effect of introduced ferrite powder on epoxy resin processing conditions and parameters. Additionally viscosity of pure epoxy resin was determined for reference purposes. The influence of temperature on composites viscosity was also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Viscosity of mixtures based on epoxy resin that contain ferrite powders and pure epoxy resin using Hoeppler viscometer was measured. Procedures of viscosity measurements were performed for three temperatures and for three filler contents. Findings: Higher temperature of measurement resulted in lower values of viscosity while higher quantity of ferrite powder increased viscosity of mixtures. There was no difference between results of viscosity that were obtained for barium ferrite and strontium ferrite. Research limitations/implications: The main problem of this work was limitations of research method. Mixtures before measurement had to be put to the vacuum venting in order to remove air bubbles that were introduced through mixing. Also an amount of powder introduced into the matrix was limited because for higher contents {{it was not possible to}} <b>pour</b> <b>mixtures</b> into glass pipe of measurement device. Practical implications: Applied method allowed to determine the influence of temperature, kind and quantity of filler on viscosity. Viscosity is the main factor defining processing parameters in many processing technologies. Originality/value: Results of viscosity for searched composites are not known up till now. Achieved results are planned in order to use them in future works of authors on polymeric magnetic composites...|$|R

In contrast, we find only spontaneous segregation when the large grains are more rounded than the small grains. The stratification is related to the occurrence of avalanches; during each avalanche the grains comprising the avalanche spontaneously stratify into a pair of layers through a "kink" mechanism, with the small grains forming a sublayer underneath the layer of large grains.

5000|$|A {{story of}} the origin of the dish {{involves}} Don Carlos Antonio López (the first constitutional president of the country between 1841 and 1862) and one of his cooks (called machú in the Guarani language). It is said that the great governor, a famously obese man, liked a white soup made with milk, Paraguay cheese (fresh cheese), egg and corn flour. One day the machú mistakenly added too much corn flour to the mixture. Near noon, she found herself with two problems: first, the mixture was too thick for tykuetî; second, she didn't have time to start the process over , or replace the favorite dish with another. So, showing off a decided attitude, a mix of fear and wit, she <b>poured</b> the <b>mixture</b> into an iron container and cooked it in the tatakua ("hole of fire", a rustic Guarani oven made of clay and adobe), from which she obtained a [...] "solid soup".

When we <b>pour</b> a <b>mixture</b> of Large Rough grains (LRG) and Small Smooth grains (SSG) into a quasi-two dimensional Hele-Shaw cell, a stratification pattern of alternate LRG and SSG is formed spontaneously. In a formation of the stratification pattern, a congestion wave (kink) is observed. Ordinary, the kink is generated {{at the bottom of}} a sand pile and then the kink goes toward a top of the sand pile. In our experiment of a large sand pile, we found a new stratification pattern with two wavelengths. A wavelength is short in an upper region of the sand pile, while the other is long in the lower region. When the dual stratification is formed, the kink is generated not only at the bottom (ordinary kink) but also on the way of the sand pile slope (trapped kink). Both two kinks make the short wavelength of the upper region different from the ordinary stratification pattern. Therefore in our experiment of the large sand pile, the dual stratification is formed...|$|R
50|$|Croak's dirt {{sculpture}} technique goes as follows. First a {{model is}} selected and photographed {{from many different}} angles. The photograph is then dressed with a grid {{in order to allow}} for accurate size referencing. Second, an armature is created from steel and aluminum that is strong enough to support two hundred pounds of clay. Third, the clay is sculpted {{in the presence of the}} model over the span of more than one hundred hours in order to replicate the model's body as precisely as possible. Fourth, smaller and more minute details like the face are refined. Fifth, the sculpture is then cut into pieces and a two layer mold (a rubber layer and a plaster layer) is made from those pieces. Sixth, Croak digs up or acquires a large amount of dirt and dries it with the aid of large fans. Seventh, Croak mixes the dirt with a binder, then <b>pours</b> the <b>mixture</b> into the mold.
