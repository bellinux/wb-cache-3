5|$|Since the 1990s, SR520 {{has been}} {{expanded}} with high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) and new interchanges {{to serve the}} Overlake area. The original Evergreen Point Floating Bridge was replaced in 2016 by a wider bridge, {{as part of a}} multibillion-dollar expansion program that is scheduled to be completed in the 2020s. The program also includes the construction of new bus infrastructure at Montlake and on the Eastside, as well as a bicycle and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>path</b> along most of the highway's length.|$|E
5|$|In Lillesand, the {{right-of-way}} {{has been}} converted to a road around the city center, although parts have been converted to a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>path.</b> Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land. From Storemyr, the route went through a forest, and has become an overgrown forestry road. From Eikeland to Tveite, the line {{has been converted}} to a hiking trail. At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village, part of the line {{is used as a}} pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in. The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept, the building at Lillesand has been preserved, while the station at Birkeland was dismounted because it was {{in the way of a}} new road.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{line into}} Preston {{was that of}} the Preston and Blackburn Railway, which opened on 1 June 1846, joining the North Union line {{immediately}} south of Farrington Station (respelt “Farington” from October 1857). The railway company was absorbed into the East Lancashire Railway (ELR) on 3 August 1846. Once again, the NUR charged high tolls for the use of its line which led the ELR to build its own line into Preston. The line was initially opposed by Preston Corporation, but was eventually permitted on condition that the embankment north of the Ribble (which later became the dividing line between Avenham and Miller Parks) be ornamentally laid out, and that a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>path</b> (still in use today) be provided on the river bridge. The line ran into new platforms built {{on the east side of}} the North Union station, which were managed and staffed by the ELR, and which had their own booking hall and entrance in Butler Street. The new platforms were effectively a separate station. The new line and station opened on 2 September 1850.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of I-35E is at exit 88A in Burnsville, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35W heads {{north into}} Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W here, but Dakota County Road 42 (exit 88B), {{immediately to the}} north, connects the two Interstates in Burnsville. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 (MN77, signed as Cedar Avenue—exit92) at Apple Valley– Eagan and Interstate 494 (exit99) in Mendota Heights. Between exits94 and 97, the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake. As it crosses I-494, I-35E turns more to the north, crossing MN110 (exit101) and MN13 (exit102) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul. This portion of I-35E is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between MN77 and MN110, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes—four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN13—as well as a bicycle and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>path.</b> The bridge has an innovative automatic anti-icing system that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather.|$|E

The bike friendly neighborhood and vintage shops has made this a part of the San Fernando Valley that is frequented by Hipsters.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} was {{to remove the}} double {{balanced}} cantilever span. From the several alternatives available the dismantling method was chosen over options that involved demolition by explosives. In this process the bridge was disassembled, removing individual pieces mostly in the reverse order of the original construction. This required the construction of temporary support structures such as {{were used in the}} original construction. A concurrent effort removed the temporary S-curve allowing completion of the new span's bicycle and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>path</b> and improvement of the east-bound vehicular approaches.|$|E
25|$|The City of Albuquerque {{has applied}} for federal funds to change the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>path</b> at the {{railroad}} tracks by changing the underpass to a level crossing with the tracks. Currently, pedestrians must go the corner of 1st and Central before they {{can get to the}} underpass or the ATC. The underpass has been considered an undesirable area, and the plans to change it {{will make it easier for}} pedestrians and bicyclists to get to and from the ATC, as well as crossing Central Ave.|$|E

25|$|The line {{still exists}} {{as far as}} Springs Road at Prebbleton, the {{overbridge}} having been demolished in the late 1990s. The couple of kilometres still in use serves a number of industries and is shunted when required. Part of the formation near Prebbleton has been incorporated into the Little River Rail Trail, and a motorway being built just north of Prebbleton will see the line truncated just past the Watties siding, with incorporation of the disused track between the motorway and Marshs Road into the rail trail being proposed. Most of the land around the old Prebbleton yard has been developed for housing {{in the last five}} years, although some is in reserves and a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>path</b> runs along part of the formation south of Tosswill Road.|$|E
25|$|The station {{received}} a face-lift in the 1930s, {{at which time}} the restaurant was moved from the southern to the northern wing. It was moved back after renovations in 1954, which also saw the main entrance moved to the road side and the offices and ticket booths renovated. Water closets were installed. To shorten {{the distance to the}} ferry quay, a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>path</b> was built in the 1950s. Following the 1962 opening of the Brevik Bridge the railway saw a sharp decline in patronage as the bus service was rerouted, capturing more of the traffic. Thus NSB decided to terminate the commuter trains to Skien from 1 February 1964. The express trains followed suit and since 26 May 1968 there has only been freight trains on the line. Brevik Station remained in use until 1 February 1982.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge was}} built wide {{enough that the}} <b>pedestrian</b> <b>path</b> can be {{converted}} to a car lane, allowing for a three lanes. In the municipal transport plan published in 2007, it was stated that had the bridge been planned then, it would have received four lanes. There have also been proposals for a second bridge to be built next to the existing bridge which would allow for a four-lane motorway. Another proposals is to build the Cross Link, which would consist of two projects, a subsea road tunnel from just south of Herdla in northern Askøy eastwards to Meland, and a ferry connection from northern Askøy westwards to Øygarden. The project is planned to reduce transport times within Nordhordland, and from there to Askøy and Øygarden. It would also relieve some traffic from Bergen City Center. The Hardanger Bridge is scheduled for completion in 2013 and will then overtake the Askøy Bridge as the longest-spanned bridge in Norway.|$|E

500|$|Clackline Bridge {{continued}} to be a safety concern, with several accidents occurring in the 1970s. The narrow road and small curve radius were considered major factors in the accidents, and there was roughness in the road surface between the original and widened sections. A reinforced concrete overlay was installed on the bridge in 1978, initially with a single coat surface, but then upgraded to a [...] bituminous concrete surface in 1987. The 1980s saw the closure and removal of the Perth–Northam railway line, as well a number of major and sometimes fatal accidents involving prime movers. There were also several car accidents, and the [...] "screaming brakes of cars and hiss of airbrakes" [...] were often heard at night in Clackline. After each accident, damaged sections of the bridge – usually the guardrails, handrails, or bridge entry section – needed to be repaired. A 1989 prime mover accident severely damaged the footpath. Rather than repair the narrow footpath, and given that the railway had been removed, a new <b>pedestrian</b> <b>path</b> was constructed on the ground below the bridge.|$|E

40|$|Mestrado em Arquitectura Paisagista - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaNowadays, it is denoted that {{tourism in}} {{protected}} areas has been intensified in an unbalanced way, putting {{the values that}} it contain at risk. Hiking has been revealed {{as one of the}} main modalities responsible for this unbalance {{by the fact that it}} is considered a modality for everyone. We denote that the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>paths</b> as being the primary target of this modality, started to reveal some degradation over the years, exposing its weaknesses. Given the issues mentioned, it becomes necessary to take further action to take control of this situation and to raise awareness among the hikers to the problems that comes from this uncontrolled influx. In this sense signaling in the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>paths</b> is so crucial because that is signs are the first contact that visitors encounter with the natural park and in that way improve communication and handover any type of information.
