5|$|Some {{species of}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp,</b> {{especially}} in the Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. For example, in Brazil, farmers control sugarcane borers with the <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp</b> Trichogramma galloi. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid {{of a range of}} species of whitefly. It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control whitefly pests of tomato and cucumber, {{and to a lesser extent}} of aubergine (eggplant), flowers such as marigold, and strawberry. Several species of <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp</b> are natural predators of aphids and can help to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach-potato aphid.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{spruce budworm}} {{is an example}} of a {{destructive}} insect in fir and spruce forests. Birds are a natural form of biological control, but the Trichogramma minutum, a species of <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp,</b> has been investigated as an alternative to more controversial chemical controls.|$|E

50|$|Biological controlThe use of two <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasps</b> (Cotesia flavipes) and (Xanthopimpla stemmator) can {{attack and}} {{subsequently}} kill C. partellus pests. These <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasps</b> can lay eggs into C. partellus (C. flavipes on adult and X. stemmator on the pupae) and upon hatching, these eggs feed internally into the pest. They then exit and spin cocoons. Therefore, management of habitats that conserve these <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasps</b> could also {{result in the}} decline of C. partellus populations.|$|R

25|$|Other {{avenues of}} control {{that have been}} {{explored}} include weevil-resistant strains of cotton, the <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp</b> Catolaccus grandis, the fungus Beauveria bassiana, and the Chilo iridescent virus. Genetically engineered Bt cotton is not protected from the boll weevil.|$|E
25|$|Other {{limitations}} on boll weevil populations include extreme heat and drought. Its natural predators include fire ants, insects, spiders, birds, and a <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp,</b> Catolaccus grandis. The insects sometimes emerge from diapause before cotton buds are available.|$|E
25|$|Vespula austriaca is an obligate <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp,</b> parasitizing {{the nests}} {{of other species}} in the genus Vespula. Its common host species include V. acadica in the United States and V. rufa in Europe, Japan, and East Siberia. It is {{sometimes}} called the cuckoo yellowjacket wasp due to its inquiline lifestyle. V. austriaca wasps pollinate orchids.|$|E
40|$|Many diverse {{lineages}} of parasitoids {{exist in}} addition to <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasps.</b> •The community ecology of these ‘NH-parasitoids’ is poorly known. •NH-parasitoid assemblages vary with host traits, habitats, and landscape structure. •They often differ from <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasps</b> in host specificity and food-web structure. •Recent technical and conceptual advances hold great promise for further research...|$|R

500|$|A new genus of ferns, Gaga, and two species, G. germanotta and G. monstraparva {{have been}} named in her honor. The name monstraparva alluded to Gaga's fans known as [...] "little monsters" [...] since their symbol is the outstretched [...] "monster claw" [...] hand, which resembles a tightly rolled young fern leaf prior to unfurling. Gaga also has an extinct mammal, Gagadon minimonstrum, and a <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp,</b> Aleiodes gaga, named for her.|$|E
500|$|At {{least five}} {{species have been}} given {{scientific}} names honoring Colbert. In 2008 a species of California trapdoor spider was named Aptostichus stephencolberti. The spider was named for Colbert after he reported on his television series that Jason Bond, a {{professor of biology at}} East Carolina University, had named a different species of spider Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi after the Canadian rock star Neil Young, and began to appeal for a species of animal to be named after him. On a later edition of The Colbert Report, Colbert revealed that Bond would name a spider after him, with Colbert claiming, [...] "And all I had to do was shamelessly beg on national television." [...] Other species named for Colbert include a species of Venezuelan diving beetle named Agaporomorphus colberti and a Chilean stonefly named Diamphipnoa colberti, both formally described in 2008. On his 45th birthday, Colbert was sent a framed print of his eponymous beetle by the biologists who named it. In 2014, a species of <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp</b> from Ecuador, Aleiodes colberti, was named for Colbert, along with newly described species named for celebrities Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, Ellen DeGeneres, and Shakira, and in 2016 a rove beetle, Sonoma colberti, was named after Colbert's on-screen persona.|$|E

2500|$|Despite their {{two-stage}} camouflage scheme, some caterpillars of Papilio demoleus {{are found}} by parasitic wasps which lay dozens of eggs in them. The <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp</b> larva eat the caterpillar from the inside. Initially the vital organs are avoided, {{but by the}} time the caterpillar is ready to pupate even the vital organs are consumed. Shortly before, or soon after the caterpillar pupates, the parasitoids emerge from their host thus killing it.|$|E
2500|$|Insects {{include the}} {{intertidal}} ground beetle Dicheirotrichus gustavi which emerges from cracks or holes {{to feed on}} the salt marshes after dusk. Despite living in a coastal environment, it has no cycle of behaviour linked to the tides, simply scurrying for dry land when caught by the approaching sea. Another intertidal beetle, Bledius spectabilis, shows very unusual behaviour for an insect in that it actively protects its larvae from the <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp</b> Barycnemis blediator and from the predatory Dicheirotrichus [...] gustavi.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{symbiont}} found in P. erythrocephalus nests is Pachysomoides stupida, {{a type of}} parasitic ichneumon. Papery cocoon's of Pachysomoides stupida are found in many P. erythrocephalus nests while adults are seldom found. Other parasites of P. erthrocephalus include some species of Oxysarcodexia or flesh flies and Brachymeria conica (Brachymeria is a <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasp</b> genus). [...] Both these species parasitize the larva and pupa of P. erythacephalus. [...] Additionally, some Xenon species parasitize P. erythrocephalus adults, acting as permanent entomophagous endoparasites by dwelling in the abdomen.|$|E

50|$|Within {{their natural}} ecosystems, other <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasps</b> are {{the enemies of}} host insects. Many species live in leaf litter: Some have reduced or absent wings, so they cannot fly. The size that <b>parasitic</b> <b>wasps</b> reach {{is limited by the}} size of their host. Smaller ones, such as Rotoita basalis, we would expect develop inside small hosts, like insects’ eggs, or scale insects.|$|R
