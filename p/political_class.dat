5|$|Following an 1866 {{conflict}} between the increasingly authoritarian Cuza and the <b>political</b> <b>class,</b> various trends organized a coup which brought Prince Carol, a Hohenzollern, to the Romanian throne—echoing a will expressed {{by some of the}} 1848 activists to have a foreign dynasty rule over a unified state. In 1877, {{as a consequence of the}} Russo-Turkish War, Romania proclaimed her independence.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus {{was born}} in Caesarea Mauretaniae (modern Cherchell, Algeria) in the Roman {{province}} of Mauretania to an equestrian family of Berber origins. He received an education which allowed him to ascend to the Roman <b>political</b> <b>class.</b> Over the years, he {{earned a reputation as}} a skilled lawyer; and, under Emperor Septimius Severus, he became an important bureaucrat. Severus' successor Caracalla later appointed him a prefect of the Praetorian Guard.|$|E
5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially {{over the issue of}} land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original <b>political</b> <b>class</b> in united Romania.|$|E

5|$|On 11th May, William and Mary {{formally}} {{accepted the}} Scottish throne and on 5th June, the Convention was {{converted into a}} full Parliament. William tried to avoid abolishing Episcopacy but Dundee's 1689 Highland campaign on behalf of James highlighted his reliance on Presbyterian support. He withdrew his opposition and the measures were approved by Parliament in 1690. The Glorious Revolution in Scotland resulted in a Parliament and Kirk far more independent than before but ending Episcopacy isolated {{a significant part of}} the <b>political</b> <b>class.</b> This was a major factor in political debates over the 1707 Act of Union and the Scottish Jacobite movement.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's <b>political</b> <b>class,</b> social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, prosperous patrician {{families}} of merchants, bankers, or industrial investors, many of German origin, still conducted large-scale business operations in Europe or lent money to Polish noble interests, including the royal court. Some regions were highly urbanized {{in comparison to}} {{most of the rest of}} Europe. In Greater Poland and Lesser Poland at the end of the 16th century, for example, 30% of the population lived in cities. 256 towns were founded, most in Red Ruthenia. The townspeople's upper layer was ethnically multinational and tended to be well-educated. Numerous sons of burghers studied at the Academy of Kraków and at foreign universities; members of their group are among the finest contributors to the culture of the Polish Renaissance. Unable to form their own nationwide <b>political</b> <b>class,</b> many blended into the nobility in spite of the legal obstacles.|$|E

50|$|The {{roots of}} {{national}} liberalism {{are to be}} found in the 19th century, when conservative liberalism and/or classical liberalism was the ideology of the <b>political</b> <b>classes</b> in most European countries and in particular those of Central Europe, then governed by hereditary monarchies.|$|R
5000|$|Wijeweera {{felt that}} one of the more {{important}} tasks was to politically educate the masses. Following deliberations on this issue, it was decided that an uncomplicated Marxist analysis of the socio-politico-economic problems of the country should be the introductory step. The Marxist analysis was split into five discussions along with five main themes. Throughout the rest of 1968, Wijeweera walked the length and breadth of the country conducting <b>political</b> <b>classes</b> for the members of the party. The five basic <b>political</b> <b>classes</b> were followed by an education camp. Precautions had to be taken to keep this educational camp a secret to avoid alarming the government as well as the [...] "old left". The classes, all conducted by Wijeweera, stretched from 17 to 18 hours a day, interrupted only by meals.|$|R
5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the <b>political</b> <b>class.</b> The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked to himself that it could not survive him.|$|E
5|$|The MAS gained {{increasing}} popularity as {{a protest}} party, relying largely on widespread {{dissatisfaction with the}} existing mainstream political parties among Bolivians living in rural and poor urban areas. Morales recognized this, and much of his discourse focused on differentiating the MAS from the traditional <b>political</b> <b>class.</b> Their campaign was successful, and in the 2002 presidential election the MAS gained 20.94% of the national vote, becoming Bolivia's second largest party, being only 1.5% behind the victorious MNR, whose candidate, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, became President. They won 8 seats in the Senate and 27 in the Chamber of Deputies. Now {{the leader of the}} political opposition, Morales focused on criticising government policies rather than outlining alternatives. He had several unconstructive meetings with Lozada, but met with Venezuela's Hugo Chávez for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The prince's {{early death}} (and the later demise of his younger brother) had an {{enormous}} impact on PedroII: on a personal level, on his future conduct as monarch, and on the empire. In his eyes, the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage the end of the imperial system. Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, in the male-dominated society of the time he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the <b>political</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1969, Georges Pompidou, {{formerly}} Prime Minister {{under the}} presidency of Charles de Gaulle, was elected President of France for a seven-year term.

50|$|The Piusverein (Pius Association) was a Roman Catholic society, {{founded in}} 1848 in Germany, and named for Pope Pius IX.

50|$|The most {{immediate}} consequence {{was that the}} monarchy emerged powerfully reinforced {{in the eyes of}} the public and the <b>political</b> <b>classes.</b> Over the longer-term, the coup's failure may be seen to have marked the final occasion on which Spain's democratic future was at all seriously in danger at the hands of Francoist survivors.|$|R

25|$|Originally, heerlijkheden {{were held}} {{exclusively}} by the nobility. However, starting around the 16th century, lordship over a heerlijkheid was not synonymous with nobility.
