40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{design by}} Balazs et al (ACS Nano, 2008), {{in which two}} particles are propelled forward by changing their interaction with a compliant surface by releasing nanoparticles, was attempted to be implemented. Initial studies showed that the design needed to be altered slightly to overcome the friction encountered between the particles and the surface, and to alter the surface by a way other than by the adsorption of nanoparticles. These alterations to the design included changing the interactions present from totally adhesive, to partially or completely repulsive to overcome friction, and substituted a catalytic chemical reaction {{for the release of}} nanoparticles used in theoretical design. An implementation of the theoretical design which used repulsive van der Waals forces to change the <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interaction</b> from adhesive to repulsive, by the catalytic conversion of benzene and bromine to bromobenzene, was investigated. It was found that although the <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interaction</b> could be converted from attractive to repulsive, the rate of the catalytic reaction was too slow to surround the catalytic particles with enough bromobenzene to propel particles forward. Electrostatic repulsions between a particle and surface were investigated and found to be unable to significantly change the <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interaction,</b> so were of no use in implementing the theoretical design. Another implementation of the theoretical design which used the steric forces exerted between a particle and surface to alter the <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interaction</b> was investigated. It was found that these steric interactions could significantly influence particles and were able to control their position on a surface. Ways to change the steric interactions from repulsive to more repulsive by a chemical reaction were found and catalytic particles which could release the required reagent created. In all cases {{it was found that the}} rate of catalytic reaction was too slow to modify the surface in the correct way to produce propulsion. It was concluded that substituting a catalytic chemical reaction for the release of nanoparticles in the theoretical design is not a viable alternative which can be used to alter a surface and thus change the <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interaction</b> to create propulsion. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} a multibody {{collision}} model, amenable to large-scale computation, is developed to simulate material removal with particulate flows.

40|$|This work {{involves}} {{the development of}} a new technique that integrates Diffusing Colloidal Probe Microscopy (DCPM) and luminescence to simultaneously measure multiple particle-wall interactions. DCPM can be used to map potential energy profiles of multiple <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interactions</b> simultaneously and accurately. Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots were used for spectral multiplexing to enable monitoring of multiple analytes at the same time. DCPM combines Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRM) and Video Microscopy to simultaneously measure multiple <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interactions</b> with nanometer resolution in particle-surface separation. By acquiring the scattered intensity emitted by the particles, the separation distance can be calculated and subsequently the forces of interactions between the particle and the surface. This work demonstrates the use of luminescence instead of scattering as the mode of detection in DCPM. The luminescence is provided by quantum dots which are incorporated into polystyrene microspheres. The unique optical properties of quantum dots enable the creation of an optically multiplexed system where microspheres are tagged by quantum dots of different emission wavelengths. Scattering in DCPM may result in erroneous calculation of the potential energy profiles because of particle polydispersity. Since scattering is dependent on particle size, luminescence is introduced into the system and some interesting results are obtained. These results illustrate that the effect of particle polydispersity is significantly reduced when luminescence is used as the mode of detection. This combined with the DCPM system?s sensitivity would enable the monitoring of multiple functionalized particlesurface interactions simultaneously and accurately...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, we {{describe}} a novel method {{that we call}} Diffusing Colloidal Probe Microscopy (DCPM), which integrates Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRM) and Video Microscopy (VM) methods to monitor three dimensional trajectories in colloidal ensembles levitated above macroscopic surfaces. TIRM and VM are well established optical microscopy techniques for measuring normal and lateral colloidal excursions near macroscopic planar surfaces. The interactions between particle-particle and particle-substrate in colloidal interfacial systems are interpreted by statistical analyses from distributions of colloidal particles; dynamic properties of colloidal assembly are also determined from particle trajectories. Our studies show that DCPM is able to detect many <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interactions</b> simultaneously and provides an ensemble average measurement of <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interactions</b> on a homogeneous surface to allow direct comparison of distributed and average properties. A benefit of ensemble averaging of many particles is the diminished need for time averaging, which can produce orders of magnitude faster measurement times at higher interfacial particle concentrations. The statistical analyses (Ornstein- Zernike and three dimensional Monte Carlo analyses) are used to obtain particle-particle interactions from lateral distribution functions and to understand the role of nonuniformities in interfacial colloidal systems. An inconsistent finding is the observation of an anomalous long range particle-particle attraction and recovery of the expected DLVO particle-wall interactions for all concentrations examined. The possible influence of charge heterogeneity and particle size polydispersity on measured distribution functions is discussed in regard to inconsistent particle-wall and particle-particle potentials. In the final part of this research, the ability of DCPM is demonstrated to map potential energy landscapes on patterned surfaces by monitoring interactions between diffusing colloidal probes with Au pattern features. Absolute separation is obtained from theoretical fits to measured potential energy profiles and direct measurement by sticking silica colloids to Au surfaces via electrophoretic deposition. Initial results indicate that, as colloidal probe and pattern feature dimensions become comparable, measured potential energy profiles suffer some distortion due to the increased probability of probes interacting with surfaces {{at the edges of}} adjacent pattern features. Measurements of lateral diffusion via analysis of mean square displacements also indicated lateral diffusion coefficients in excellent agreement with rigorous theoretical predictions...|$|R

40|$|In case of {{a nuclear}} plant {{accident}} or a deliberate explosion of a radiological dispersion device, human health and environmental risk assessments caused by radiation exposure are based on theoretical predictions of atmospheric dispersion of radionuclides. Because of large discrepancies between theory and observations after nuclear accidents, however, improving predictive modeling of radioactivity transport is a top priority. In general, {{it is assumed that}} the microphysical processes of atmospheric particles containing radionuclides are independent of electrostatic surface interactions. Radioactive decay of radionuclides, on the other hand, can lead to significant surface charging; therefore, electrostatic <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interactions</b> should be included in predictive models of radioactivity transport to reduce uncertainty in radiation risk assessments. This study investigates the influence of radioactivity on <b>particle-surface</b> <b>interactions</b> in the atmosphere. The investigations include (i) verification of radioactivity-induced charging mechanisms, (ii) evaluation of radioactivity-induced charging effects on particle size growth, and (iii) development of theoretical frameworks to couple the charging effects with the microphysical behavior of radioactive particles. Radioactivity-induced charging is examined using scanning surface potential microscopy. It is found that radioactivity induces charge accumulation on the surface of particles via emission of electrons and diffusion of negative and positive ions. These charging mechanisms should be included as competing terms in a charge balance. Analysis of the charge balance, including the charging mechanisms, suggests that radioactive particles can be highly charged in open air and thus may experience strong electrostatic interactions during short- and long-range transport. As an example, it is shown that because of surface charging caused by radioactive decay, the size growth rates of radioactive particles by aggregation can be significantly different from those of typical atmospheric particles. Systematical approaches {{with a wide range of}} complexity are developed to incorporate electrostatic interactions produced by radioactivity-induced charging into microphysical aerosol-transport models of any scale. Examples are given to show that the approaches developed in this work can also be applied to several investigations using radiation sources. This study contributes toward a better understanding of the microphysical behavior of radioactive particles in environmental systems, and the models developed can be employed to reduce the uncertainty in estimations of local and global radioactivity levels and the corresponding environmental and health risks. The results are useful in atmospheric dispersion modeling of radioactive plumes released by severe nuclear events, such as the recent accident of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan. Ph.

A recent investigation by CNES examined the use of drag scale factors from SPOT 2 to constrain the ERS- 1 orbit. An improvement to that methodology is to consider along-track mismodelling as observed by timing errors in the Doppler data for each pass of SPOT 2. The along-track correction to the acceleration as derived from SPOT 2 can then be applied to ERS- 1 orbits, solving for a scale factor to absorb systematic errors - particularly that arising from the 50 km altitude difference. Results are presented of the associated improvement in ERS- 1 orbits as derived from concurrent SPOT 2 arcs. It will be seen that the procedure not only improves the laser range fit, but more importantly, leads to more precise radial positioning as evident in the altimeter and crossover residuals...|$|R
