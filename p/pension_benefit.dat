The lack of disclosure and transparency has gained <b>pensions</b> <b>benefits</b> greater attention {{as a significant}} part of the total remuneration received by executive directors. Due to the associated problems there is a greater need for better disclosure and in turn heightened transparency towards shareholders.   This qualitative case study focuses on general retailers in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Due to the lack of research five general retailers from respective country were chosen to be examined and compared during 2006 - 2010. The aim is to examine the disclosure of individual <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> of executive directors and the development in levels of <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> in the following general retailers Bilia, Clas Ohlson, Debenhams, Dunelm Mill, Fenix Outdoor, Halfords, JD Sports Fashion,  Kappahl, Mekonomen and N Brown Group.

The level of disclosure has differentiated, where UK general retailers have a higher level of individual disclosure. The development in levels of <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> has shown that there are higher amounts of <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> in Swedish general retailers. A negative trend in the development of the Chief Executive Officers amounts of <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> has mainly been present in 2007 - 2009.

25|$|The <b>pension</b> <b>benefit</b> is not {{insignificant}} {{because it}} is estimated to cost 25% of salary over the entire 25-year period to fund a <b>pension</b> <b>benefit</b> of half the salary at age 55 for someone who starts employment at age 30. While this estimate {{is based on a}} 5% interest rate for discounting present values, a 3.5% annual salary growth rate and mortality according to the Annuity 2000 Merged Gender Mod 1 Table with ages set back 2.0 years. The key point to use the same assumptions to compare the annual yearly cost as a percent of salary for a half pay pension for someone starting at age 30 and retiring at age 62. The additional seven-year wait would drive the cost down to under 17% of salary annual cost. In essence, the MTA's proposal was a greater than 8% salary cut across the board. Using a slightly worse mortality table, the effective salary cut is still within the 7% to 6% salary cut range in terms of value given up. By not accepting the MTA pension offer, Local 100 of the TWU was not forced to a cut. Citing the rising cost of health care, the MTA wanted new employees to contribute 1% of their salary to pay for health insurance. Transit workers currently do not pay for health insurance.|$|E

Unemployed workers ineligible for jobless benefits were given back the right to claim sickness insurance that they had lost in 1979 while the reimbursal of the costs of dental fees, hearing aids, and glasses was improved. An 80-franc-per-month charge that had been imposed on certain long-term illnesses was abrogated, and certain individuals who had retired before 1973 had the base upon which their pensions were calculated adjusted upward.

30|$|Due {{to various}} reforms of social security, {{the number of}} years one needs to work {{in order to be able}} to retire with the maximum level of <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> depends on {{individual}} birthday.

40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} phases for all economic agents is post-retirement standard of living. Irrespective of the higher returns on pension contribution and varied pension reforms, there are possible factors that can render these <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> inadequate, which can affect the longevity of retirees. Studies conducted in other countries have concluded that inflation deteriorates the value of <b>pension</b> <b>benefits.</b> Aim: This study, thus, sought {{to assess the impact}} of some major economic indicators in the Ghanaian environment on <b>pension</b> <b>benefits.</b> Setting: This study was carried out in Ghana by obtaining quarterly data frequencies on <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> and economic indicators spanning the period 2000 Q 1 to 2014 Q 4. Method: The Auto-regressive Distributed Lag Model was utilised to examine the long run and short run dynamics of some major economic indicators and <b>pension</b> <b>benefits.</b> Results: The empirical evidence indicated that inflation deteriorates total <b>pension</b> <b>benefits.</b> Increasing monetary policy rate and depreciation of the domestic currency should be an issue to contend with only in the short run rather than in the long run. The study also found the prominence of the implementation of the National Pension Reform in 2008. Conclusion: The study concluded that if policy makers target the reduction in the monetary policy rate and the appreciation of the domestic currency in an effort to stabilise the value of total <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> in the long run, it would not be effective in the long run because of their insignificant nature. Policy makers should rather target inflation as the prime tool for stabilising the standard of living of retirees in the long run...|$|R
25|$|Employment {{rights for}} women include {{non-discriminatory}} access {{of women to}} jobs and equal pay. The rights {{of women and men}} to have equal pay and equal benefits for equal work were openly denied by the British Hong Kong Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association 香港政府華員會 (1965–68), contributed to the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the <b>pension</b> <b>benefit.</b> Some of them even lost their jobs. Since nurses were mostly women, this improvement of the rights of married women meant much to the nursing profession. In some European countries, married women could not work without the consent of their husbands until a few decades ago, for example in France until 1965 and in Spain until 1975. In addition, marriage bars, a practice adopted from the late 19th century to the 1970s across many countries, including Austria, Australia, Ireland, Canada, and Switzerland, restricted married women from employment in many professions.|$|E

2500|$|Another major {{personnel}} controversy {{erupted in}} December 2009 when the Washington Times reported that Deputy Chief Kenneth B. Ellerbe left {{the department to}} take a job in Sarasota County, Florida, but had secured a deal to receive a full pension. The pension agreement was apparently approved by Fire Captain Brian Lee, and Fire Chief Rubin did not learn about it until it was reported in the media. Ellerbe left DCFEMS in July 2009, although he would not be eligible to receive full pension benefits until he turned 50 years old on April 10, 2010. Under the terms of the deal, DCFEMS places Ellerbe on [...] "leave without pay", which kept him technically employed by the District of Columbia. Ellerbe agreed to resign from DCFEMS on April 11. Because Ellerbe remained on the force until he turned 50, he was then able to collect 80 percent of his final pay {{for the next five years}} (an amount equal to about $600,000). When he turned 55, he qualified for a full <b>pension</b> <b>benefit</b> (100 percent of his final salary). The agreement stated that the purpose of allowing Ellerbe to go to Florida was to give him the opportunity to [...] "acquire experience as a fire chief in a municipal fire department and thereby be better able to provide the experience of leadership in an executive manager's role". Ellerbe said it was mere coincidence that he agreed to resign on April 11, and the deal was not designed to keep him on the city payroll until he turned 50.|$|E

2500|$|The Pension Reform Law (1972) {{guaranteed}} all retirees {{a minimum}} pension {{regardless of their}} contributions and institutionalized the norm that the standard pension (of average earners with forty years of contributions) should not fall below 50% of current gross earnings. The 1972 pension reforms improved eligibility conditions and benefits for nearly every subgroup of the West German population. The income replacement rate for employees who made full contributions was raised to 70% of average earnings. The reform also replaced 65 as the mandatory retirement age with a [...] "retirement window" [...] ranging between 63 and 65 for employees {{who had worked for}} at least thirty-five years. Employees who qualified as disabled and had worked for at least thirty-five years were extended a more generous retirement window, which ranged between the ages of 60 and 62. Women who had worked for at least fifteen years (ten of which had to be after the age of age 40) and the long-term unemployed were also granted the same retirement window as the disabled. In addition, there were no benefit reductions for employees who had decided to retire earlier than the age of 65. The legislation also changed the way in which pensions were calculated for low-income earners who had been covered for twenty-five or more years. If the <b>pension</b> <b>benefit</b> fell below a specified level, then such workers were allowed to substitute a wage figure of 75% of the average wage during this period, thus creating something like a minimum wage benefit. According to one study, the 1972 pension reform “enhanced” the reduction of poverty in old age.|$|E
2500|$|Five main {{rights for}} {{beneficiaries}} in ERISA 1974 include information, funding, vesting, anti-discrimination, and fiduciary duties. First, each beneficiary should receive a [...] "summary plan description" [...] in 90 days of joining, plans must file annual reports with the Secretary of Labor, and if beneficiaries make claims any refusal must be justified with a [...] "full and fair review". If the [...] "summary plan description" [...] is more beneficial {{than the actual}} plan documents, because the pension fund makes a mistake, a beneficiary may enforce the terms of either. If an employer has pension or other plans, all employees must be entitled to participate after at longest 12 months, if working over 1000 hours. Second, all promises must be funded in advance. The <b>Pension</b> <b>Benefit</b> Guaranty Corporation was established {{by the federal government}} to be an insurer of last resort, but only up to $60,136 per year for each employer. Third, employees' benefits usually cannot be taken away (they [...] "vest") after 5 years, and contributions must accrue (i.e. the employee owns contributions) at a proportionate rate. If employers and pension funds merge, there can be no reduction in benefits, and if an employee goes bankrupt their creditors cannot take their occupational pension. However, the US Supreme Court has enabled benefits to be withdrawn by employers simply amending plans. In Lockheed Corp v Spink a majority of seven judges held that an employer could alter a plan, to deprive a 61-year-old man of full benefits when he was reemployed, unbound by fiduciary duties to preserve what an employee had originally been promised. In dissent, Breyer J and Souter J reserved any view on such [...] "highly technical, important matters". Steps to terminate a plan depend on whether it is individual, or multi-employer, and Mead Corp v Tilley a majority of the US Supreme Court held that employers could recoup excess benefits paid into pension plans after PBGC conditions are fulfilled. Stevens J, dissenting, contended that all contingent and future liabilities must be satisfied. Fourth, as a general principle, employees or beneficiaries cannot suffer any discrimination or detriment for [...] "the attainment of any right" [...] under a plan. Fifth, managers are bound by responsibilities of competence and loyalty, called [...] "fiduciary duties". Under §1102, a fiduciary is anyone who administers a plan, its trustees, and investment managers who are delegated control. Under §1104, fiduciaries must follow a [...] "prudent" [...] person standard, involving three main components. First, a fiduciary must act [...] "in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan". Second, they must act with [...] "care, skill and diligence", including [...] "diversifying the investments of the plan" [...] to [...] "minimize the risk of large losses". Liability for carelessness extends to making misleading statements about benefits, and have been interpreted by the Department of Labor to involve a duty to vote on proxies when corporate stocks are purchased, and publicizing a statement of investment policy. Third, and codifying fundamental equitable principles, a fiduciary must avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest. He or she must act [...] "solely {{in the interest of the}} participants... for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits" [...] with [...] "reasonable expenses", and specifically avoiding self-dealing with a related [...] "party in interest". For example, in Donovan v Bierwirth, the Second Circuit held that trustees of a pension which owned shares in the employees' company as a takeover bid was launched, because they faced a potential conflict of interest, had to get independent legal advice on how to vote, or possibly abstain. Remedies for these duties have, however, been restricted by the Supreme Court to disfavor damages. In these fields, according to §1144, ERISA 1974 will [...] "supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan". ERISA did not, therefore, follow the model of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 or the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which encourage states to legislate for improved protection for employees, beyond the minimum. The preemption rule led the US Supreme Court to strike down a New York that required giving benefits to pregnant employees in ERISA plans. It held a case under Texas law for damages for denying vesting of benefits was preempted, so the claimant only had ERISA remedies. It struck down a Washington law which altered who would receive life insurance designation on death. However, under §1144(b)(2)(A) this does not affect 'any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.' So, the Supreme Court has also held valid a Massachusetts law requiring mental health to be covered by employer group health policies. But it struck down a Pennsylvania statute which prohibited employers becoming subrogated to (potentially more valuable) claims of employees for insurance after accidents. Yet more recently, the court has shown a greater willingness to prevent laws being preempted, however the courts have not yet adopted the principle that state law is not preempted or [...] "superseded" [...] if it is more protective to employees than a federal minimum.|$|E
