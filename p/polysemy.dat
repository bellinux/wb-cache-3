40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the {{conceptual}} organization of polysemous prototypical qualities. This study, based on data collected in 24 languages, makes use of a single notional space composed of 110 notions. This space enables us to separately represent the <b>polysemies</b> observed in each language as well as polysemous patterns observable in several languages in order to contrast the variability specific to each language with the linguistic invariance. The results show that what is common in the language sample is based on recurring <b>polysemies</b> organized in networks. This method will also be useful in explaining how the linguistic variability is built up. Indeed, some of the qualities involved in these networks always take part in polysemous associations specific to only one language. Such qualities, called federative notions, are characterized {{by the fact that they}} are regularly involved in polyse?mous patterns, and across numerous languages...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe first AustKin project (AustKin I) {{collected}} a large database of kinship terms from Aboriginal languages all over Australia, endeavouring to maintain standards of spelling, kin formulae and group identities, without losing {{the details of}} original sources used. An online geospatial interface {{has been used to}} map distributions of forms of terms and their <b>polysemies</b> or equations. The patterns of the latter provide identification of kinship systems as defined in ethnology. The project proposed and tested hypotheses about the evolution of such systems in Australia based on knowledge of the common <b>polysemies</b> and related changes. The next stage, AustKin II, builds on hypotheses from the current authors and others, testing these further by adding two more components to the database: the marriage rules and the social categories used by each group. Of the latter, section and subsection systems are unique to Australia. The aim is to gauge how these different systems fit together and propose how they evolved over time and how they influenced each other...|$|R
25|$|The type of {{construction}} grammar associated with linguists like Goldberg and Lakoff looks mainly at the external relations {{of construction}}s {{and the structure of}} constructional networks. In terms of form and function, this {{type of construction}} grammar puts psychological plausibility as its highest desideratum. It emphasizes experimental results and parallels with general cognitive psychology. It also draws on certain principles of cognitive linguistics. In the Goldbergian strand, constructions interact with each other in a network via four inheritance relations: <b>polysemy</b> link, subpart link, metaphorical extension, and finally instance link.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its broad}} etymology, the term rumba {{historically}} retained {{a certain degree}} of <b>polysemy.</b> By the end of the 19th century, Cuban peasants (guajiros) began to perform rumbitas during their parties (guateques, changüís, parrandas and fiestas patronales). These songs were actually in the form of urban guarachas (not proper rumbas), which had a binary meter in contrast to the ternary meter of traditional rural genres such as tonada and zapateo. Similarly, in Cuban bufo theatre {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, the guarachas that were sung at the end of the show were referred to as rumba final despite not sharing any musical similarities with actual rumba.|$|E

40|$|Since long it {{has been}} noted that cross-linguistically {{recurring}} <b>polysemies</b> can serve {{as an indicator of}} conceptual relations, and quite a few approaches to model and analyze such data have been proposed in the recent past. Although – given the nature of the data – it seems natural to model and analyze it with the help of network techniques, {{there are only a few}} approaches which make explicit use of them. In this paper, we show how the strict application of weighted network models helps to get more out of cross-linguistic <b>polysemies</b> than would be possible using approaches that are only based on item-to-item comparison. For our study we use a large dataset consisting of 1252 semantic items translated into 195 different languages covering 44 different language families. By analyzing the community structure of the network reconstructed from the data, we find that a majority of the concepts (68 %) can be separated into 104 large communities consisting of five and more nodes. These large communities almost exclusively constitute meaningful groupings of concepts into conceptual fields. They provide a valid starting point for deeper analyses of various topics in historical semantics, such as cognate detection, etymological analysis, and semantic reconstruction. ...|$|R

[...] The Scully-obsessed writer in Carter's 1999 episode [...] "Milagro" [...] was read by some as his alter ego, realizing that by this point [...] "she has fallen for Mulder despite his authorial intent".

500|$|From the {{academic}} world, positive reviews came from Michael Campbell, author of Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes On, {{who felt that}} the soothing melody of the track resembles British singer Steve Winwood's 1986 single [...] "Higher Love". The author noted the song for merging disparate and contradictory musical features in it. He found that the simple melody of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] offered an easy listen, but the contrasts in sound, rhythm and texture appealed to different target audiences. Australian rock music journalist Toby Creswell wrote in his book 1001 Songs that [...] "'Like a Prayer' is a beautifully crafted devotional song {{in the guise of}} perfect pop. God is the drum machine here." [...] Scholar Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna as Postmodern Myth: How One Star's Self-Construction Rewrites Sex, Gender, Hollywood and the American Dream, noted that there is a <b>polysemy</b> in [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] since the singer addresses either God or her lover, and in doing so [...] "Madonna achieves the gold-card of attaining her own divinity. Whenever someone calls her name, it alludes to the song". Theologian Andrew Greeley compared [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] with the biblical Song of Songs. Greeley, although focusing more on the video, acknowledged the fact that sexual passion may be revelatory, and complimented Madonna for glorifying ideologies of female subjectivity and womanhood in the song.|$|E
500|$|Some {{linguists}} {{and philosophers}} of language have criticized Fodor's self-proclaimed [...] "extreme" [...] concept nativism. Kent Bach, for example, takes Fodor {{to task for}} his criticisms of lexical semantics and <b>polysemy.</b> Fodor claims {{that there is no}} lexical structure to such verbs as [...] "keep", [...] "get", [...] "make" [...] and [...] "put". He suggests that, alternatively, [...] "keep" [...] simply expresses the concept KEEP (Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties, names or other such entities). If there is a straightforward one-to-one mapping between individual words and concepts, [...] "keep your clothes on", [...] "keep your receipt" [...] and [...] "keep washing your hands" [...] will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor's theory. This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping. But, if this is true, then RETAIN must pick out a different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT, since one can't retain one's clothes on or retain washing one's hands. Fodor's theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes, differently, to the contents of FAST CAR, FAST DRIVER, FAST TRACK, and FAST TIME. Whether or not the differing interpretations of [...] "fast" [...] in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English, or are the result of pragmatic inference, is a matter of debate. Fodor's own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in Concepts: [...] "People sometimes used to say that exist must be ambiguous because look at the difference between 'chairs exist' and 'numbers exist'. A familiar reply goes: the difference between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems, on reflection, strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs. Since you have the latter to explain the former, you don't also need 'exist' to be polysemic." ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter breaks {{new ground}} by {{highlighting}} {{the role of}} concession in semantic change, drawing examples cross-linguistically from English, French and German. It contributes to theories of semantic change which support cognitive and social-interactional motivations. The paper argues that the metonymic contiguity of terms like though with contexts relating to the negotiation of meaning and the “Cardinal Concessive Frame” (X – statement, X’ – concession, Y – potential refutation) (Couper-Kuhlen and Thompson, 2000) has led them {{to be used in}} situations where X and X’ are unexpressed. This procataleptic tendency affects similar adversative and concessive conjunctions and adverbs in different languages; while the etymologies, <b>polysemies</b> and position in the clause of these terms differ, the fundamental cognitive reflex is similar across languages, suggesting the underlying motivation for the recruitment of such usages is universal, arising from social-interactional exigencies related to questions of face...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{forms and}} functions of verbal reflexives/reciprocals in some Formosan languages. Two issues are addressed: one is their <b>polysemies</b> {{and the other is}} related to their reduced transitivity. For verbal reflexives, the extended uses in Formosan languages center around reflexive, decomitative and anticausative. For verbal reciprocals, the extensions are confined within the semantic domain of reciprocal, chaining, collective and distributive. None of their (reflexives and reciprocals) distributions and functions overlaps with each other, which suggests that reflexives and reciprocals in Formosan languages take two divergent paths of developments, very unlike the one proposed in Geniušienė (1987) and Kemmer (1993) {{in a wide variety of}} languages. Regarding the issue of transitivity, many previous studies (e. g., Gerdts 2000, McGregor 2000, Mchombo 1993) often conclude that syntactically the derived reflexive/reciprocal constructions are intransitive. This is not exactly what we found in (some) Formosan languages. A careful examination reveals that a verbal reflexive/reciprocal does not necessarily derive an intransitive construction.

Thus far, semantic maps have been the result of empirical research involving laborious consideration of cross-linguistic data in order to identify the relevant categories and then to arrange those categories into a conceptual space. The arrangement of these categories reflects the actual overlapping <b>polysemies</b> found in the data, so that connections between concepts accord with Croft’s Semantic Map Connectivity Hypothesis. The specific constructions found in any language can subsequently be mapped onto this space in accord with Croft’s hypothesis and the space can be refined if necessary as further languages are added.

Concerning this point, Simon-Vandenbergen (1996 : 405 – 406) points out that I think in different contexts can express lack of commitment as well as certainty. Holmes (1990 : 187) also distinguishes between tentative and deliberative usages of I think, the former profiling a limited commitment to the truth, the latter conveying confidence and certainty (cf. also Holmes 1984 : 354). In a similar fashion, Traugott (1995 : 38) argues that I think developed a more subjectified meaning conveying a speaker’s epistemic attitude. Nuyts (2001 : 113) also considers that the verb to think can express either epistemic possibility or certainty. Tantucci (2015 a) observes that epistemic predicates show a tendency to acquire new factual <b>polysemies</b> through time, viz. from epistemic inclination (expressing guess or conjecture) to epistemic result (conveying SP/W’s certainty). Interestingly while evidence suggests that factualization occurs as a widespread and unidirectional phenomenon, there is no data in the literature that might suggest cases of de-factualization, viz. a process of semantic change of verbs of certainty towards uncertainty.|$|R
