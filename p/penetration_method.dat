40|$|Consistency {{limits are}} {{extensively}} used in geotechnical engineering practice. These limits are {{commonly referred to}} the Atterberg Limits and the limits are the liquid limit, plastic limit and shrinkage limit. Consistency limits is potentially useful as an index property for predicting the behaviour of clay soils. The liquid limit in particular is used in many correlations with engineering properties. It provides a good basis form predicting the soil properties such as deformability, expansion, hydraulic conductivity and strength. Therefore, liquid limit has strong links to underlying mechanical behaviour. However, {{the determination of the}} liquid limit by Casagrande Liquid Limit Device and Cone <b>Penetration</b> <b>Method</b> which are in international standards have their own limitation as they requires several points to determine liquid limit of soil as these both methods uses trial and error method. This study presents the investigation on the use of oedometer method as an alternative way to determine the liquid limit of zeolite from saturated slurried condition by using a small consolidation pressure of 0. 9 kPa and 6 kPa. Thus by doing this, one can determine the liquid limit by one point determination technique as the equilibrium water content reached from the consolidation will be equivalent or nearer to the liquid limit of soil under the consolidation pressure either 0. 9 kPa or 6 kPa. The physical properties of zeolite were determined and the liquid limit of zeolite was determined from cone <b>penetration</b> <b>method.</b> The test results shows that by using a consolidation pressure of 0. 9 kPa, the value of liquid limit obtained from oedometer method is much nearer to the value of liquid limit obtained from the cone <b>penetration</b> <b>method</b> and the difference between those values obtained is less than 1 %. Meanwhile, the liquid limit value obtained by using consolidation pressure of 6 kPa does not tally and far away from the value of liquid limit obtained from cone <b>penetration</b> <b>method.</b> Hence, by using consolidation pressure of 0. 9 kPa, oedometer method can be used to determine the liquid limit of soil and for consolidation pressure of 6 kPa, other methods or different soil should be used and applied for determination of liquid limit value...|$|E

30|$|The {{plastic limit}} test (thread rolling method as devised by Atterberg) {{has become one}} of the {{standard}} test in soil engineering practice. According to Sridharan and Prakash [21], and Haigh [5], the two liquid limit test methods (cup and cone methods) measure different physical quantities. Cup method gives higher values of LL compared to cone method when the liquid limit is larger; whereas cone method gives higher values than cup method at lower liquid limits. This is primarily because of the controlling mechanisms involved in mobilisation of shearing resistance, primarily viscous resistance with soil of higher liquid limit and mobilisation of frictional resistance for soils at lower liquid limits [21]. According to Sridharan and Prakash [20], the cone <b>penetration</b> <b>method</b> is a measure of the undrained cohesion or undrained frictional resistance of the soil or both. Liquid limit and plastic limit determined by the cone <b>penetration</b> <b>method</b> conceptually do not represent the soil plasticity characteristics because they also represent undrained friction. Recently Haigh et al. [6] has brought out that the plastic limit is a measure of soil brittleness and does not correspond to fixed soil strength and that the plastic limit by fall cone method is not the plastic limit described by Atterberg.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{non-metallic}} {{materials in}} armor {{has become more}} and more of interest during the last years. The optimal application of such materials supposes the understanding of the interaction process between projectile and target. To achieve this goal, the depth of <b>penetration</b> <b>method,</b> the time-resolved observation method and the laminated target test are applied to obtain information on the interaction process, the protection ranking of the non-metallic materials and the optimal construction of real targets. These three methods are discussed and applied to a series of ceramics and composites.

It is shown that the three methods look at special aspects of the problem and complement each other. The depth of <b>penetration</b> <b>method</b> mainly delivers the protection ranking of the non-metallic materials. The time-resolved observation with the flash X-ray techni que makes it possible to obtain pictures of the projectile inside the non-metallic material.
