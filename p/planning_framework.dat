25|$|Airport {{policing}} in the United Kingdom {{has taken}} many forms since {{the rise of}} scheduled airline services in the post-war period. Policing at major civilian airports was the responsibility of specialist constabularies operated by three central government departments until 1974, when the rise in international terrorism saw armed police from territorial police forces deployed to major airports under {{the provisions of the}} Policing of Airports Act. As more minor airports grew in size, they too switched to armed police provided by local police forces. However, the funding agreements for the provision of such services varied wildly from airport to airport, leading to disagreements between airport operators and Chief Constables. A new regime, the Airport Security <b>Planning</b> <b>Framework,</b> came into force in January 2010, and brought airport operators, airlines and police forces together to develop joint security and policing plans for all passenger airports.|$|E
25|$|A fixed {{crossing}} of Hurumlandet and the Oslofjord was first proposed by Anton Grønsand in 1958. It was followed up in a regional transport plan published in 1963, with a horizon of forty years. Road planning {{was in the}} following decade reorganized so that most planning fell within the jurisdiction of a single county. As a {{crossing of}} the Oslofjord invariable would have to cross a county border, plans fell outside the natural <b>planning</b> <b>framework.</b> As the idea {{fell out of the}} main workload of planners, a limited company, A/S Fjordbroene, was established in 1967. Initiated by Hurum Municipality, it was also partially owned by larger companies in the municipality. It attempted to revitalize the proposal and launched a detailed plan in 1974 which called for two bridges which would connect each side of the fjord to the island of Håøya. The cost of the project was steep, the Håøya bridges alone estimated at 510 million 1981 Norwegian krone (NOK). The plans were rejected by the road administration because of the steep cost and low traffic prognosis, while others criticized the environmental impact it would create on Håøya and at the towns of Svelvik and Drøbak.|$|E

His report {{recommended}} that partnership working be enhanced and that the system of [...] "designations" [...] be discontinued. The Policing and Crime Act 2009 introduced a new statutory framework, the Airport Security <b>Planning</b> <b>Framework,</b> which applies to airports designated by direction of the Department of Transport Security and Contingencies Directorate (see below). Under this framework, two groups are established at each airport: a Risk Advisory Group and a Security Executive Group. The Risk Advisory Group assess the security risks to the airport and issues Risk Reports. The Risk Reports feed into the Security Executive Group, who draw up an Aerodrome Security Plan (ASP). The ASP covers the measures in place at the airport, who is responsible for the measures and how those measures will be monitored.|$|E
