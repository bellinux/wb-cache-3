The data are analyzed by Correlation Analysis and Kruskal-Wallis Test. As a result, the ECERS- R mean scores {{are found to be}} below the “good” level and no significant difference is found among three kinds of <b>preschools</b> in terms of educational environment.

40|$|Scheduled {{time for}} {{reflective}} work is common at many Swedish <b>preschools.</b> Reflection {{is a complex}} concept {{that is being used}} with many different purposes in <b>preschools.</b> The reflective work in Swedish <b>preschools</b> today {{has its roots in the}} theories from Vygotskij about how children learn by watching and cooperating with others. Also, many Swedish <b>preschools</b> have taken inspiration from the <b>preschools</b> in Reggio Emilia in Italy, who see the reflective work as something necessary in their work around children’s learning processes. “The learning group” is a way of seeing children and adults as members of groups who capture knowledge by social interaction, taken from the <b>preschools</b> in Reggio Emilia. In 1998, Swedish <b>preschools</b> got their first curriculum, which also took inspiration from Vygotskij and his visions of children’s learning. The aim of this study is to find out how reflective work can be done at some Swedish <b>preschools,</b> and also to investigate a group of teacher’s thoughts on reflective work. The issues in my study are: What meaning can lie in the concept of reflection in <b>preschools?</b> In what situations can teachers and children in <b>preschools</b> use reflection? What can be the purpose of this reflection? To answer these questions, I did interviews with teachers and observations of meetings and of the work that was being done with the children. The result shows that the term of reflection is ambiguous and is being used with different interpretations in the <b>preschools</b> I have studied. Reflection is for instance retelling events, solving problems, cooperating and curiosity. Teachers and children use reflection in various situations everyday, both at planned and spontaneous activities. The purpose of the reflection at the <b>preschools</b> I have visited was for instance to find a focus in working with the children, to know how to move on and to get deeper into what you do...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} which routines <b>preschools</b> had regarding food processing and if the routines were sufficient in order to the regulation.

30|$|Another {{study in}} Finland found that {{elementary}} school teachers’ reports of cooperation with <b>preschools</b> on curricula and passing on written information about children were significant positive predictors of children’s academic skills at school entry, {{but they were}} also the least commonly used practices (Ahtola et al. 2011). Despite this study’s contribution to understanding the effects of contact around curriculum between <b>preschools</b> and elementary schools, Finland’s school structure linking <b>preschools</b> directly to local elementary schools may not be applicable to many other locales (e.g., United States of America, and Norway) where <b>preschools</b> and elementary schools function in non-overlapping systems.|$|R
40|$|Background: Children’s {{beverage}} {{consumption patterns}} have received increased attention {{in light of}} the obesity epidemic in this group. In day care centers (DCCs), children spend up to 10 h a day, and typically consume half to three quarters of their daily food intake. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate what beverages are typically served to children in <b>preschools</b> in Poland, and to evaluate the practices associated with adding sugar and other sweetening agents to beverages. Methods: Direct interviews with <b>preschools</b> staff were conducted with a questionnaire regarding offered beverages and adding sugar and other sweetening agents. The menu of 10 consecutive days and inventory reports were analyzed to verify information. Results: A total of 720 <b>preschools</b> were included in the study. Cocoa and milk coffee substitute were served in 95 % of <b>preschools,</b> followed by compote (92 %), tea (84 %), fruit/herbal tea (73 %) and water (69 %). Water was the only beverage available between meals (93 % DCCs). 86 % of <b>preschools</b> added sugar to tea/cocoa/coffee substitute drinks, and 74 % to compote. Conclusions: In the majority of <b>preschools,</b> beverages which are not recommended were offered. Such an assortment of beverages and common practice of sweetening can increase the amount of added sugar in a children diet. Nutrition education and legal regulations concerning the assortment of beverages served in <b>preschools</b> are urgently needed...|$|R

40|$|With {{this study}} we intend to {{investigate}} and analyse three different <b>preschool’s</b> holdings of toys and discuss the result {{in relation to the}} creation of subject. The investigation in this study consists of an inventory of the holdings of toys at three different <b>preschools.</b> We have used an already existing system for classification which is composed by Nilsson and Nelson (2002). The results give a detailed survey of collected material in the form of tables in which we indicate the comparisons which are relevant to our purpose. In the analysis we have compared the <b>preschool’s</b> holdings of toys and, among other findings, concluded that the class of Household appliance/food is dominating at all the <b>preschools</b> we have visited. Furthermore we have found that the different <b>preschools</b> create a limited conception of the world through their toys. In the study we can confirm that toys give children a perception of what the world looks like and, in that way, contribute to the children’s subject creation.

During the early 1980s, the CTW created the <b>Preschool</b> Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers.

A qualitative investigation of parent involvement in four rural <b>preschools</b> in the Kavango region was conducted. The data were analysed, discussed and synthesised.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine how the {{activities}} of two <b>preschools</b> develop the language in matter of the teacher’s work of procedure. The following research questions were essential for the survey and therefore formed the basis of the examination: How do the teachers in both <b>preschools</b> work in a language evolving way? What significance does the environment have for the language development? Are there similarities and differences between the <b>preschools</b> in their language development approach? The study is based on a qualitative method, where the teachers of both <b>preschools</b> were interviewed with the purpose of obtaining information. The teacher’s statements and interviews were analyzed in relation to previous research, where the theories of different writers form the base of the theoretical connection to the study. The teachers view in developing the language regarding to their aspirations in measuring the language an important position in their operation, can be portraied as the conclusions of this study. Both <b>preschools</b> share a common view that the linguistic development is of great importance and should for that reason be highlighted as well as emphasized in the teachers working methods. However, the teachers in both <b>preschools</b> differ in their view considering language development due to their different ideas of witch working methods best stimulate the students linguistic abilities to development. The <b>preschools</b> working methods can be seen from a positive point of view and also from a critical one in relation to the examination, where the teacher’s interviews were analyzed and discussed.
