In total 64 matches were played there. The attention will be paid to players in offensive and defensive attacks, particularly during the fast counter - attack finished by goal. The next aim of the thesis is detailed {{analysis of}} all fast counter - attacks from a qualitative and quantitative points of view, especially the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment,</b> execution time of the attack and the number of players who participated in the match. The other aims of the thesis include to plot all goals from the fast counter - attack, describe action and find out the main mistakes. Methods: The main technique which is used for the data acquisition related to scored goal is the indirect observation. Successfully finished counter - attacks are analyzed from the two points of view, which are quantity and quality. The first one is dedicated to forms of attacks, the technique of kicking and to the numbers of players who participated. The quality research is focused on the analysis of scored goals after the fast counter - attack. Subsequently these situations are plotted and described. They also could be a specific [...] ...|$|E

This study explores {{the characteristics of the}} Italian Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India and aims to fill the gap identified in literature by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of this issue. The study specifically focuses on the localization drivers of Italian MNCs that internationalized in India. In order to investigate the research questions, a unique database of Italian firms that invested in India was created. The number of Italian companies with subsidiaries in India was found to be low. In terms of geographical distribution, the sample showed prevalence in New Delhi, followed by Mumbai and Bangalore. The main driver for localization choice was found to be the general economic importance of the city, and a majority of the sampled companies chose the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> of their Indian subsidiary mainly based on the location of their clients (prospect and actual). This data was consistent with the idea that ‘market seeking’ is the primary strategic goal for the companies analyzed. A typical ‘multidomestic’ approach was adopted by customizing products and services to the local needs and demands. This supports the progressive embeddedness of the subsidiary into the local market. Under this perspective, FDIs could also represent a way to access local knowledge to be combined at a global scale to contribute to the overall performance of the MNC...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis is to assess the {{activities}} of travel agencies {{in terms of value}} added tax. The work is focused on characterization and use of a special VAT scheme for travel services not only domestically, but also at European level, with emphasis on evaluation of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} special tax arrangements. The thesis is divided into three chapters. In the first chapter is an analysis of the current regulatory regime for special travel service in the Czech Republic. With the help of illustrative examples is ready basis for comparisons with subsequent modifications by the European Union and selected EU countries. The second chapter is devoted to the using of taxation of travel services from the perspective of European directives and requirements of the EC Commission. At the same time in the second chapter describes the system of taxation of travel services in Ireland, which represents a different taxation of this services. Aim of this thesis, which is to evaluate the use of special arrangements in selected Member States of the European Union, is achieved in the third chapter. Using the comparison it is shown that it is possible to gain a competitive advantage in the provision of services depending on the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> of the travel services and therefore the legislation, which is governed by the service provider.

40|$|Social Networking Sites (SNS) {{as global}} {{providers}} of Internet services raise new {{challenges in the}} field of conflict of laws. The most prominent service providers have their headquarters in the US and their business models allow them to offer global services to users around the world under the same terms or conditions. SNS providers typically have recourse to standard terms intended to be applicable to all their users and include choice of forum and choice of law clauses in favour of US courts and US laws. Against this background, the present contribution analyzes applicable law issues raised by social networking sites {{from the perspective of the}} European Union (and its Member States). The article addresses the position of SNS providers in the light of the EU harmonization rules on e-commerce and the influence of the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> in the scope of obligations imposed on them. Also the law applicable to the agreements concluded with users is discussed focusing on the implications of their possible characterization as consumer contracts and on the aspects related to the formation of the contract. Determining the law applicable to online activities involving SNS is also essential for the protection of rights and interests of third parties, in particular with regard to intellectual property and personality rights. Additionally, the effective enforcement of EU law to Internet activities in key areas such as data protection requires now determining the mandatory scope of international application of EU or national law with respect to the activities of SNS...|$|E

However, not all soil is well used in the constructions field, as there are several types of soil that are problematic {{in terms of both}} the soil bearing capacity and deformation. The clay with carrying capacity and low shear strength needs to stabilized {{in order to meet the}} technical requirements to be used as sub grade. The add materials that are typically used for soil stabilization are cement, lime or a mixture of two or three of the added materials. In this study, the added material use volcanic ash of Mount Sinabung at North Sumatera and sugarcane bagasse ash. The purpose of this study was to determine an index value of properties as the result of the addition of 4 % volcanic ash and variations in content of bagasse ash on clay and then to determine the compressive strength for maximum testing UCT (Unconfined Compression Test) and understand the value of CBR (California Bearing Capacity) as the consequence of the addition of a stabilizing agent, as well as optimum level of addition of bagasse ash. The result showed that the original soil sample has the water content 12. 35 %, specific gravity of 2. 65, liquid limit of 46. 73 % and plasticity index of 26. 44 %. The compressive strength value of 1. 38 kg/cm 2.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} the most important establishment criteria for companies whointend to do a new establishment. There are differences between regions regarding attraction on startup. Some regions have few new businesses while others continuously expanded its activities in variousfields. The biggest focus on the thesis is the Gävle- Borlänge region where MellansvenskaHandelskammaren is active. Mellansvenska Handelskammaren saw a need for the assignment after the magazine ”IntelligentLogistik” ranked the Gävle region at 15 :th place and Falun/Borlänge at 20 :th place in the list over thetop 25 best logistics locations in Sweden. This made them wonder what {{could be made to}} develop intoa better area with more amenities and a better place in the ranking of the magazine. As a foundation tothe future development of the region this thesis has been written. The method we used is part a literature review and part a survey sent to different companies indifferent regions. The answers to the surveys was then compiled and compared with the literature tofind the most important criteria. The participation of the survey was lower then what we hoped for,however the responses aligned with the earlier observations of the literature review. The group has made an overview {{of some of the most}} successful regions and their available assets,such as roads, railway, port, aviation, businesses, establishment opportunities, training and skills andnetworks in the region. A more detailed review where also made of the Gävle- Borlänge region andthis was used to descried the strengths and weaknesses of the region. There are good opportunities inthe region to develop into an attractive area of establishment, a project to link Gävle and Oslo via anew road under the name E 16 may come to provide a significant benefit at a regional level. Thisrelated to the expansion of the East Coasts largest container port can help to make Gävle an importanthub in the region.
