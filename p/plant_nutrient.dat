5|$|In biology, borates {{have low}} {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient.</b> There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although {{there is some evidence}} it supports bone health.|$|E
5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient,</b> required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E

25|$|Although fire {{can occur}} {{during the growing}} or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most {{effective}} at increasing the grass and forb cover, biodiversity and <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake in shortgrass prairies. Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire {{if they want to}} restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because this is the time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.|$|E
2500|$|Phosphorus is an {{essential}} <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> (often the limiting nutrient), and the bulk of all phosphorus production is in concentrated phosphoric acids for agriculture fertilisers, containing as much as 70% to 75% P2O5. Its annual demand is rising nearly {{twice as fast as}} the growth of the human population. That led to large increase in phosphate (PO43−) production {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Artificial phosphate fertilisation is necessary because phosphorus is essential to all life organisms, natural phosphorus-bearing compounds are mostly insoluble and inaccessible to plants, and the natural cycle of phosphorus is very slow. [...] Fertiliser is often in the form of superphosphate of lime, a mixture of calcium dihydrogen phosphate (Ca(H2PO4)2), and calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O) produced reacting sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate.|$|E

40|$|The {{challenge}} for agriculture {{over the coming}} decades will be to meet the world’s increasing demand for food in a sustainable way. Declining soil fertility and mismanagement of <b>plant</b> <b>nutrients</b> have made this task more difficult. In this brief, Peter Gruhn, Francesco Goletti, and Montague Yudelman point out {{that as long as}} agriculture remains a soil-based industry, major increases in productivity are unlikely to be attained without ensuring that plants have an adequate and balanced supply of nutrients. They call for an Integrated Nutrient Management approach to the management of <b>plant</b> <b>nutrients</b> for maintaining and enhancing soil, where both natural and man-made sources of <b>plant</b> <b>nutrients</b> are used. The key components of this approach are described; the roles and responsibilities of various actors, including farmers and institutions, are delineated; and recommendations for improving the management of <b>plant</b> <b>nutrients</b> and soil fertility are presented.
