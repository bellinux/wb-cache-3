25|$|In year 1900 Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works {{invested}} on pneumatic tools. A separate {{air compressor}} building was constructed {{next to the}} steam boiler building, and the premises were equipped with a comprehensive <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> supply network. The new tools increased productivity especially at the dockyard.|$|E
25|$|The {{compressor}} {{should be}} provided with an accumulator and a relief valve. The accumulator functions as an additional water trap, but the main purpose {{is to provide a}} reserve volume of <b>pressurised</b> <b>air.</b> The relief valve allows any excess air to be released back to the atmosphere while retaining the appropriate supply pressure in the accumulator.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Egrett, {{which was}} {{powered by a}} single {{turboprop}} engine, the Strato was powered by two wing-mounted pusher compound engines consisting of a turbocharged piston engine with the Gas Generator from a PW127 turboprop engine to provide a constant supply of <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> to the piston engine at high altitude. This {{had the advantage of}} maintaining power at high altitudes. Each engine drove a 6m (19ft 8in) diameter five-bladed propeller.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: In 1942-43 the UK Government {{carried out}} {{extensive}} testing for oxygen toxicity in divers. The chamber is <b>pressurised</b> with <b>air</b> to 3.7 bar. The {{subject in the}} centre is breathing 100% oxygen from a mask.|$|R
500|$|During {{hyperbaric}} oxygen therapy, {{the patient}} will usually breathe 100% oxygen from a mask while inside a hyperbaric chamber <b>pressurised</b> with <b>air</b> to about [...] Seizures during the therapy are managed {{by removing the}} mask from the patient, thereby dropping the partial pressure of oxygen inspired below [...]|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to combustion is the water rocket, which uses water <b>pressurised</b> by compressed <b>air,</b> carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or manual pumping, for model rocketry.|$|R
500|$|French {{physiologist}} Paul Bert was {{the first}} to understand it as DCS. His work, La Pression barométrique (1878), was a comprehensive investigation into the physiological effects of air pressure, both above and below the normal. He determined that inhaling <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> caused nitrogen to dissolve into the bloodstream; rapid depressurisation would then release the nitrogen into its gaseous state, forming bubbles that could block the blood circulation and potentially cause paralysis or death. Central nervous system oxygen toxicity was also first described in this publication and is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Paul Bert effect".|$|E
2500|$|The power a Formula One engine {{produces}} {{is generated}} by operating {{at a very high}} rotational speed, up to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Cosworth DFV and the mean effective pressure had stayed at around 14 bar MEP. Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves {{to the point where the}} loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. [...] They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault, which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. [...] Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers used pneumatic valve springs with the <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000rpm.|$|E
50|$|Air-supported {{structures}} are {{a form of}} tensile structures where the fabric envelope is supported by <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> only.|$|E
50|$|The smelter melts {{the copper}} mixed with {{limestone}} in the Isasmelt furnace. The copper is <b>pressurised</b> by the <b>air,</b> then oxidised, and finally poled. The copper is then {{taken to the}} refinery.|$|R
50|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBOT), in which {{pressurised}} oxygen is inhaled inside a hyperbaric chamber, {{has been studied}} under the theory that improving oxygen availability to damaged brain cells can reactivate {{some of them to}} function normally. HBOT results in no significant difference from that of <b>pressurised</b> room <b>air,</b> however, and some children undergoing HBOT may experience adverse events such as seizures and the need for ear pressure equalisation tubes.|$|R
50|$|Each tank is vented (or <b>pressurised)</b> {{to allow}} <b>air</b> {{into the tank}} {{to take the place}} of burned fuel; otherwise, the tank would be in {{negative}} pressure which would result in engine fuel starvation. A vent also allows for changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature.|$|R
5000|$|The Vell-os in Escape Velocity Nova use telekinesis to hold bubbles of <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> {{around them}} to {{traverse}} space.|$|E

50|$|The S8, {{like its}} related A8, utilises a {{multi-link}} suspension layout front and rear, with <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> springs. However, for the S8, the effective spring and damper rates are noticeably firmer, along with re-engineered suspension mounts.|$|E
25|$|In some engines, {{bleed air}} is also tapped to provide power for accessories, {{as well as}} a {{mechanical}} shaft drive. Bleed air is particularly useful when a source of compressed air is specifically needed, either to <b>pressurise</b> cabin <b>air,</b> or as a supply of cooling air to other components (to avoid excess heat, this is taken for a low-pressure tapping, or from the LP compressor of a two-shaft engine). One important use for bleed air is for cross-starting of other engines in a multi-engine aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The Yakovlev Yak-25 was a Soviet {{military}} aircraft, {{an early}} turbojet-powered interceptor aircraft {{designed by the}} Yakovlev OKB. The designation was later reused for a different interceptor design. Tasked by the Council of Ministers in a directive issued on 11 March 1947, with producing a straight winged fighter similar to the earlier Yak-19, but powered by a Rolls-Royce Derwent V, OKB-115 swiftly produced the Yak-25, which blazed several trails as the first Soviet fighter with a fully <b>pressurised</b> cockpit, <b>air</b> conditioning, jettisonable canopy, and hydraulic airbrakes on the fuselage amongst other innovations.|$|R
50|$|The Norton Wankel {{engine was}} further {{developed}} at Staverton into the MidWest aero-engine. The MidWest engine's output increased from BSA's 85 bhp to nearly 110 bhp by improving volumetric efficiency. This {{was achieved by}} dumping overboard (rather than burning) the hot rotor cooling air, and by feeding <b>pressurised</b> fresh cool <b>air</b> to the combustion chambers.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 {{the airline}} {{introduced}} Fokker F27 aircraft {{and so was}} able to operate current generation scheduled services with <b>pressurised,</b> <b>air</b> conditioned aircraft and cabin service. The Heron aircraft were replaced with Beechcraft B80 Queen Airs.|$|E
50|$|Ozone gas is {{produced}} during electric discharge by sparking or corona discharge for example. Static electricity can build up within machines like compressors with moving parts constructed from insulating materials. If those compressors feed <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> into a closed pneumatic system, then all seals {{in the system}} {{may be at risk}} from ozone cracking.|$|E
50|$|Starting of a {{gas turbine}} engine {{requires}} rotation of the compressor to a speed that provides sufficient <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> to the combustion chambers. The starting system has to overcome inertia of the compressor and friction loads, the system remains in operation after combustion starts and is disengaged once the engine has reached self-idling speed.|$|E
25|$|The multirole Be-200 can be {{configured}} as an amphibious {{water drop}} fire-fighting aircraft, a freighter, or as a passenger aircraft—the <b>pressurised</b> and <b>air</b> conditioned cabin allowing transportation {{of up to}} 72 passengers. The Be-200 can also be equipped for special missions. When configured as an air ambulance, the aircraft can carry up to 30 stretcher patients and seven seated patients or medical crew. In the search and rescue role, the aircraft can be equipped with searchlights and sensors, an inflatable boat, thermal and optical surveillance systems, and medical equipment. The search and rescue variant can accommodate up to 45 persons. The aircraft is also capable of being configured for anti-submarine warfare duties.|$|R
50|$|There is {{currently}} only one unit approved under the US National Standard - ASME PVHO-1 (2007) and Case 12. This unit, {{known as the}} SOS Hyperlite or by the US military as the EEHS (Emergency Evacuation Hyperbaric Stretcher) is, or has been, in service with the US Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, NOAA and NASA {{as well as being}} supplied to other Government Agencies. The EEHS has a length of 2.26 metres (89 inches) and a diameter of 59 cm. (23.5 inches) and operates at a pressure of up to 2.3 bar (33 psi) above ambient pressure with a built-in safety factor of over 6:1. It is <b>pressurised</b> with <b>air</b> and the occupant breaths oxygen or air through a demand mask (BIBS) during treatment.|$|R
25|$|Seven Beechcraft King <b>Air</b> <b>pressurised</b> twin-engined {{turboprop}} aircraft, {{owned and}} operated by the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, are used on Air Wing operations. Three Beechcraft B200 King Air and two Beechcraft B350 King Air aircraft are based in Sydney. An additional two Beechcraft B200 King Air aircraft are based in Dubbo to cover North West and Central West NSW. There are also 14 helicopters currently operating across the State, 12 Category 1 helicopters and 2 Category 2 helicopters.|$|R

50|$|The shore {{station was}} {{purchased}} by the Shetland Amenity Trust in 1995 and has {{been converted into a}} Marine Heritage Centre. The fog signal was discontinued in the 1980s. The notable red horn was removed, however, the building that housed the siren is still in place and now houses a radar mast, and the five <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> tanks are still in place.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} cane guns have been {{produced}} as air weapons, generally using some form of detachable <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> reservoir (a pneumatic air weapon) {{in the form of}} a flask or integrated into the form of a more generously proportioned stick, such as a traditional shillelagh. Some are effectively dart-firing blowpipes, which are far easier to disguise being little more than a hollow tube.|$|E
50|$|Water expands as it heats and {{contracts}} as it cools. A water-loop hydronic system must {{have one or}} more expansion tanks in the system to accommodate this varying volume of the working fluid. These tanks often use a rubber diaphragm <b>pressurised</b> with compressed <b>air.</b> The expansion tank accommodates the expanded water by further air compression and helps maintain a roughly constant pressure in the system across the expected change in fluid volume. Simple cisterns open to atmospheric pressure are also used.|$|R
50|$|In 1938 Renard {{had already}} {{designed}} a fighter with an <b>air</b> <b>pressurised</b> cabin. In fact the Renard R-42 wasa R-40 {{with a double}} fuselage (just like the twin Mustang and the Messerschmitt 109 z). Like the R-40, theR-42 was equipped with an ejection seat. but disgrace at all those promising (theoretical) specifications. The Belgian government showed no interest {{and they decided to}} purchase Hawker Hurricanes MkI. In 1940 when Germany attacked Belgium, Renard tried to save the plans of the R-42 by taking them to France.|$|R
5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous <b>air</b> (<b>pressurised</b> reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|R
50|$|Air hoses {{are used}} in {{underwater}} diving, such as scuba diving, to carry air from the surface or from air tanks or diving pumps to the diver. Air hoses are therefore {{a necessary part of}} standard diving dress and any type of surface supplied diving equipment.They are an essential part of scuba diving equipment, used to deliver <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> from the first stage of a diving regulator to the other components.|$|E

50|$|To {{achieve this}} performance, Chadwick used an engine {{arrangement}} called the 'Master-Slave' layout. The four wing-mounted Rolls-Royce Merlin XX engines driving four-bladed 13 ft diameter Rotol propellers, {{were to be}} supercharged by a fuselage-mounted slave Rolls-Royce Merlin 45 engine driving a large supercharger supplying <b>pressurised</b> <b>air</b> via an intercooler. The output from the slave engine was to be controlled to supply air at 20,000 ft equivalent pressure between 20,000 ft and 40,000 ft.|$|E
5000|$|RAF {{policy from}} the very early days of 1918 was for the station medical officer to attend all {{aircraft}} crashes as, initially at least, the low air speeds meant that many crashes were survivable and first aid would be given before the crews were moved either into Station Sick Quarters or a hospital. A single RAF medical officer, Flight Lieutenant George Desmond Graham (also known as [...] "Doc" [...] Graham), is credited with <b>pressurising</b> the <b>Air</b> Ministry into forming the RAF Mountain Rescue Service (MRS). Graham {{was one of several}} RAF medical doctors who organized teams at RAF Llandwrog in North Wales in 1943, at RAF Millom (southern Lake District), and at Harpur Hill (Peak District), where Flt Lt (later Air Commodore) David Crichton performed a similar role. Graham's team rescued dozens of allied airmen from Snowdonia before Graham was posted to Burma, where he took part in an early para-rescue operation (strikingly similar to one generally credited as the beginning of United States Air Force Pararescue), saving the life of a Royal Canadian Air Force navigator, Flying Officer W Prosser.|$|R

50|$|The {{tanks were}} <b>air</b> <b>pressurised,</b> {{the fuel tank}} by engine {{compressor}} bleed air and the oxidiser tank by ram air and additionally by the stored air bottle. Ram air {{was taken from the}} supersonic inlet boundary layer bleeds. A single timer-controlled valve opened the stored air supply which then opened the pneumatic LP cocks. A second valve, after a delay, engaged the turbopump clutch. HP cocks were opened by a single hydraulic piston, driven by fuel pressure controlled through a third timed valve. Both fuel and oxidiser first flowed through a small pilot valve for ignition, before their main valves opened. Correct opening of all four valves was monitored by the timer control, to ensure a safe mixture.|$|R
