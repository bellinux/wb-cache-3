40|$|Background <b>Patent</b> <b>blue</b> dye <b>V</b> (PBV) is in {{widespread}} use for sentinel node biopsy {{in breast cancer}} and melanoma. At present, the best diagnostic approach in investigating possible anaphylaxis due to PBV is not defined. Method We reviewed our experience of patients and the cases {{reported in the literature}} that developed an anaphylactic reaction after injection of PBV and suggest a diagnostic protocol. From May 2006 to April 2009 six patients were known to the Cardiff anaesthetics department to have suffered a severe anaphylactic reaction after injection of PBV. We amalgamated the results of the investigations of our patients with those of 42 case reports published in the literature during the last 10 years. Results Of 40 patients with a documented allergy history 31 patients did not have a past medical history of allergy. The median interval between PBV administration and allergic reaction was 15 min (range 1 min– 180 min). Of 20 patients with hypotension 18 received inotropes. 4 patients had a fall in blood pressure as their sole symptom. 23 patients had urticaria or other allergic skin manifestations, 8 had blue wheals. 5 patients had bronchospasm. 2 patients had a cardiac arrest. They were successfully resuscitated. The median dose of PBV was 2 ml (range 0. 5 ml– 5 ml). Tryptase levels were elevated in 14 of 26 tested patients. Skin prick testing was positive in 24 of 30 tested patients. Intradermal testing was positive in all 13 tested patients. Conclusion Most patients experiencing a severe allergic reaction to PBV have no past medical history of allergy. The value of formal allergy skin testing for PBV-related allergy lies in excluding other agents as the causative factor to avoid their exposure in the future...|$|R

A pesquisa do linfonodo sentinela (LS), jÃ consagrada nos tumores iniciais de mama e nos melanomas, apresenta-se cada vez mais freqÃente no trato digestÃrio, em especial no CaE com resultados animadores. Estudos iniciados nos meados do ano 2000 retratam busca crescente e bastante prÃspera para esclarecimento desta questÃo. O objetivo deste trabalho Ã elaborar um modelo {{experimental}} que possa demonstrar tecnicamente, em laboratÃrio, a viabilidade da pesquisa do LS no antro gÃstrico da cadela. Foram estudadas 25 cadelas com peso aproximado de 11 Kg e idade de 01 a 02 anos, sem raÃa definida (SRD), clinicamente saudÃveis, proveniente do Centro de Controle de Zoonoses do MunicÃpio de Fortaleza (CCZ) que tinham programaÃÃo para eutanÃsia. Com escolha aleatÃria, estes animais foram estudados individualmente e semanalmente. Utilizou-se, separadamente, TecnÃcio (99 mTc) com traÃador/colÃide Fitato e corante vital azul patente V Guerbert 2, 5 % (AP) injetados a 01 cm do piloro, na pequena curvatura no antro gÃstrico da cadela e analisados nos tempos zero, 05, 10, 15 e 20 minutos. ApÃs este perÃodo realizou-se pesquisa âin vivoâ do local de injeÃÃo do marcador e linfonodos encontrados e âex-vivoâ destes linfonodos. Para o estudo com o 99 mTc utilizou-se o aparelho Gamma Probe modelo Nuclearlab DGC-II - detector para cirurgia radioguiada e sonda captadora de irradiaÃÃo acoplada com unidade de contagem e rastreamento sonoro e para o AP, visÃo direta. Para a anÃlise estatÃstica utilizou-se o teste de McNemar e o Coeficiente de ConcordÃncia de Kappa. Foi estabelecido em 5 % o nÃvel de significÃncia (p&# 8804; 0, 05). Com o uso do 99 mTc isolado foi identificado a presenÃa do LS em 20 animais (80 %). Quando se utilizou o corante AP isolado a presenÃa do LS foi identificada em 24 animais (96 %). NÃo houve significÃncia estatÃstica quanto ao uso destes marcadores para a pesquisa do LS no antro gÃstrico da cadela.

The gastrectomy {{with extensive}} lymphadenectomy {{still is the}} gold standard for the dressing treatment of the gastric cancer (GC), even so these procedures can take high index of morbidity or mortality, mainly in the patients who do not present lymphatic dissemination of the illness. The research of sentinel lymph node (SLN), already consecrated in the initial tumors of breast and the melanomas, presents each time more frequent for upper gastrointestinal cancers, specially in GC with encouraging results. Studies initiated in the middles of 2000 portray increasing and sufficiently prosperous search for clarification of this question. The objective of this work is to elaborate an experimental model that can demonstrate technically, in laboratory, the research viability of SLN in gastric antrum of the dog. 25 female dogs had been studied with approach weight of 11 kg and age of 01 / 02 years, without definite race (WDR), healthful clinically, proceeding from the Control Center of Zoonosis of Fortaleza City with programming for euthanasia. With random choice, these animals had been studied individually and weekly. It was used, separately, radioisotopic 99 mtechnetium labeled phytate and <b>patent</b> <b>blue</b> dye (<b>V</b> Guerbert 2. 5 %) injected at 01 cm above the piloro, on the small bending in the antrum gastric of the dog and analyzed in the times zero, 05, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. After this period, the injection place of the markers and gastric lymph nodes were appraised âin vivoâ (in the animal) and the gastric lymph nodes âex vivoâ (out of the animal). For the study with the 99 mtechnetium it was used the device Gamma Probe model Nuclearlab DGC-II (radioguiada surgery with sounding lead of irradiation connected to unit of counting and sonorous tracking) and for the <b>patent</b> <b>blue</b> dye, direct vision. For the analysis statistics were used the test of McNemar and the Quantify agreement with Kappa. The level of significance was established in 5 % (p&# 8804; 0, 05). When the radioisotopic 99 mtechnetium labeled phytate was used single, the LS was identified in 20 animals (80 %). With the <b>patent</b> <b>blue</b> dye single, in 24 animals (96 %). There is no statistic significance with the use of those markers for the LS research in the gastric antrum of the dog. The conclusions are (1) The stomach of the dog is adjusted for experimental model in alive research of the sentinel lymph node (2) The radioisotopic 99 mtechnetium labeled phytate and <b>patent</b> <b>blue</b> dye (<b>V</b> Guerbert 2. 5 %) are efficients as markers of sentinel lymph node of the dogâs gastric antrum...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Create and {{validate}} {{a proposed}} animal model for training in sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} of the stomach. METHODS: In thirty-two rabbits, through a laparotomy, they received a subserosal injection of 0. 1 ml of phytate labeled with technetium- 99 m (0. 2 mCi) in the anterior wall of the gastric corpus, followed by 0. 2 ml of <b>Blue</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>V</b> (R) 2. 5 %, through the same puncture site. Suspicious lymph nodes were searched in vivo at five, ten and 20 minutes, both visually (<b>Blue</b> <b>Patent</b> stained lymph nodes) and with a manual gamma radiation detector (to detect suspected radioactive lymph nodes). After 20 minutes, was performed resection of these for further evaluation of radioactivity (ex vivo) and histological study. RESULTS: Lymph nodes were identified in 30 rabbits (Average of 2. 2 lymph nodes per animal). Of the 90 suspected lymph nodes {{that occurred in the}} study, 70 cases (77. 8 %) were histologically confirmed for lymphoid tissue. Of these, the majority were located in the periesophageal region of the gastric fundus. The sample presented a mortality rate of 6. 25 % and nine complications related to the method, which interfered in the identification of the lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: The animal model for sentinel node biopsy in rabbit stomachs proved to be feasible, with low complexity and reproduced the difficulties encountered for gastric lymph node biopsy in humans, being adequate for surgical training...|$|R

In the synthesis of the catalysts prepared by photochemical deposition, it was evaluated the influence of some parameters, such as deposition time and the intensity of the light source over the physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activity of the materials obtained. An analysis of the effect of the catalyst dosage and initial <b>patent</b> <b>blue</b> <b>V</b> concentration over the dye degradation efficiency was also attempted. In general, it was observed that the presence of Au or Pt on TiO 2 enhances the <b>patent</b> <b>blue</b> <b>V</b> photodegradation; it was found that noble metal particle size and distribution on TiO 2 surface are important factors influencing the dye removal. The highest dye degradation was obtained over the Au-TiO 2 catalyst prepared by photochemical deposition, using high light intensity and 15 min of deposition time during the synthesis. A discoloration and a total organic carbon (TOC) removal of 93 and 67 % respectively, were obtained over this material after 180 min of UV irradiation. These values are higher than that the obtained on S-TiO 2 (discoloration and TOC removal of about 25 % and 3 %, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the potential curative {{role of the}} intraoperative use of a dye, the <b>Patent</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>V,</b> {{for the treatment of}} refractory lymphoceles by mapping the lymphatic leakage and selectively ligating the opened lymphatics. Inguinal lymphocele is a well-known complication after inguinofemoral lymph node dissection for penile cancer, and a variety of curative approaches have been reported. METHODS: From 1995 to 2007, 40 patients had undergone partial or total penectomy for squamous cell cancer. Superficial inguinal lymph node dissection with saphenous vein sparing or deep lymph node dissection was performed in 15 patients. It was unilateral in 14 and bilateral in 1 patient. When the lymphoceles were refractory to conventional therapy, ligation of the lymphatic vessels after mapping of the leakage with the <b>Patent</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>V</b> dye was the treatment of choice. RESULTS: Overall, 5 lymphoceles were detected in 4 patients that were continuously increasing in size after discharge and were treated conventionally. In the 2 refractory lymphoceles, we then opted for the intraoperative use of a dye, the <b>Patent</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>V,</b> to map the lymphatic leakage and selectively ligate the opened lymphatics. In both cases, complete resolution of the lymphoceles occurred. No complications were observed with this technique. CONCLUSIONS: The presented technique is able to cure persistent lymphoceles refractory to conventional treatment after inguinal lymph node dissection...|$|E
