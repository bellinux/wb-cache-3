This thesis analytically investigates the relationships among <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> geometry, orientations and ratios of remote principal stresses, and fluid pressure. Results show that main trends of <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> are perpendicular to the least far field stresses during <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> formation, and <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> paths {{can be used to}} determine relative magnitudes of remote principal stresses. Based on the theoretical derivation, <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> geometries are grouped into five main categories: curving-parallel, curving-perpendicular, quasi-curving-parallel, quasi-curving-perpendicular and non-curving geometries. By introducing the concepts of effective stress and effective remote principal stress ratio, it is demonstrated that connectivity between <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> and the pre-existing joint is improved for joints that form under relatively high pore pressures...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between propagating joints and embedded concretions in a Devonian black shale near Seneca Lake, NY, permits {{identification of the}} loading configurations responsible for two joint sets of dierent ages striking at nearly the same orientation. The earlier set consists of systematic joints cut by later Alleghanian joints of the Appalachian Plateau. The later set consists of non-systematic curving <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> that abut these same Alleghanian joints. Field evidence shows that concretions functioned as sti inclusions in a compliant black shale. As a consequence of this elastic contrast, local perturbations in the remote stress field persisted around the concretions during burial, tectonic deformation, and exhumation. These stress perturbations influenced joint propagation paths of both joint sets. Our conclusions about loading configurations are based on finite-element modeling of the eect of the local stress perturbation on concretion-modified joint propagation. Modeling shows that the local stress perturbation from a thermoelastic loading was responsible for deflecting <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> away from concretions in a curved propagation path near the concretion. This load configuration also led to arrest of <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> before they penetrated the shale–concretion interface. At greater distances from the concretion, the propagation path of <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> was controlled by the contemporary tectonic stress field. The interface between concretions and the surrounding shale was strongly bonded, {{as indicated by the}} crossing of the interface by some of the systematic ENE joints. Higher compressive stress levels within the concretions relative to the shale suppressed joint development in the concretion, causing the arrest of those joint...|$|R

40|$|Damage {{analysis}} of the piping material revealed hints of creep crack growth during operation in to circumferential weldment adjoined regions loaded with high bending moments and strain induced material embrittlement along the pipe length. Ultrasonic as well as magnetic nondestructive tests (NDT) have been performed in order to characterize the material state of a pipe segment loaded during service with high bending moments. The results were compared to corresponding test resulting obtained from reference material in the "as delivered state". The NDT have been performed prior to Charpy V toughness testing. The pipe segemtn was scanned in the circumferential direction but - depending on the sensor orientation - NDT - data were recorded in both circumferential and axial direction. Compared to the "as delivered state" an anisotropic behaviour of two NDT-parameters is observed which is not symmetrical {{with respect to the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>cross</b> section. The Charpy V data measured on the pipe circumfer e nce at ambient temperature 80 xC and 150 xC revealed different toughness results depending on the circumferential position and therefor on the bending stress.
