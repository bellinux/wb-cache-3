5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the New York and Putnam Railroad was built along the Saw Mill River from Putnam County to central Yonkers, and thence to Tibbets Creek and the Harlem River. Various <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{operated}} until the 1940s and the 1980s. The main {{line of the}} railroad is now devoted to bicycle and pedestrian paths. They are the South County Trailway on the parts south of Route 119, and the North County Trailway north of 119.|$|E
5|$|On {{completion}} of the Grand Junction Railway, Locke moved on to design part of the London and Southampton Railway and encouraged Brassey to submit a tender, which was accepted. Brassey undertook work on {{the section of the}} railway between Basingstoke and Winchester, and on other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The following year Brassey won contracts to build the Chester and Crewe Railway with Robert Stephenson as engineer and, with Locke as the engineer, the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway and the Sheffield and Manchester Railway.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} bay at Paddock Wood {{from which}} most of the line's trains departed is now part of a car park, with the edge of the platform fenced off. <b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> are still visible, such as the embankment through Swig's Hole valley and the approach to Horsmonden tunnel. Some bridges still remain, although the plate girder bridge over Goudhurst Road, Horsmonden has been removed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between Lucay-le-Male and Buzançais {{has been}} {{preserved}} by the Société d'Animation du Blanc-Argent (SABA). The final section, between Argy and Buzançais, {{has been converted}} to standard gauge to serve a local agricultural industry so Argy is <b>the</b> southern terminus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preserved <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today the {{following}} passenger services use <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|Neither <b>the</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Construction and Transportation nor Korail have {{reconstruction}} {{plans for}} <b>the</b> Suryeo <b>Line</b> as a whole. However, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was reconstructed as a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yongin Everline, and another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{will serve as}} a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gyeonggang <b>Line,</b> allowing Yeoju to have a rail connection with Seongnam and Icheon.|$|R
5|$|Express trains {{operated}} by NSB {{have always been}} the primary passenger service on Bergensbanen. Passenger trains follow the Drammen Line and the Asker Line to Drammen, before heading north to Hønefoss on the Randsfjord Line. The express trains offer both transport from villages along the line to either Bergen or Oslo, as well travel between Norway's two largest cities. Expresses are locomotive-hauled trains with modernized coaches. Six nights a week there is a night train service. Several <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> service places without road access, such as Finse and Myrdal. Operating deficits are covered by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.|$|E
5|$|Obstacles for the {{proposal}} include the proposed Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, {{the lack of}} electrification on the line, and the single-tracking in some <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The current iteration of the plan would have its northern terminus be Co-Op City South using the Hells Gate Branch. The LIRR Bay Ridge Branch and the New York Connecting Railroad have freight operating along them, and are regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). FRA rules require a certain distance between freight and passenger trains that share rights-of-way, {{and as a result}} it is uncertain whether the right-of-way is wide enough or if more durable train cars are needed to be able to share the same tracks. The RPA's 2015 plan considered having FRA compliant light rail vehicles run over the line. In addition to providing transfer opportunities, the line would provide transit access to areas without it in Glendale and Middle Village in Queens, and in Flatlands and Canarsie in Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{colonel in}} 1913, Chauvel became the Australian {{representative}} on the Imperial General Staff but the First World War broke out {{while he was}} still en route to the United Kingdom. Chauvel arranged for the Australian Imperial Force to be diverted to Egypt, where he joined his new command, the 1st Light Horse Brigade, in December. In May 1915, it was sent dismounted to Gallipoli, where Chauvel assumed responsibility for some of the most dangerous <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> He took charge of the 1st Division that November. In March 1916, Chauvel became commander of the Anzac Mounted Division, gaining victories in the Battle of Romani in August and the Battle of Magdhaba in December, and nearly winning the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917. The following month, he took over the Desert Column, later known as the Desert Mounted Corps, thereby becoming the first Australian to command a corps, and the first to reach the rank of lieutenant general. At Beersheba in October 1917, his light horse captured the town and its vital water supply in one of history's last great cavalry charges. By September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of three of his mounted divisions and launch a surprise attack on the enemy that won the Battle of Megiddo. He followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history.|$|E
50|$|The Raritan River Railroad {{ran through}} Milltown, {{but is now}} defunct along this <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> track and freight station still remain.|$|R
50|$|The Wŏnsan−Kowŏn {{section was}} built as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hamgyŏng <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chosen Government Railway (Sentetsu); this <b>line</b> ran on <b>the</b> routing <b>of</b> Wŏnsan−Kowŏn (now <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kangwŏn <b>Line),</b> Kowŏn−Ch'ŏngjin (now <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P'yŏngra <b>Line),</b> and Ch'ŏngjin−Sangsambong (now <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hambuk <b>Line).</b> <b>The</b> Wŏnsan−Kowŏn section was {{completed}} in two parts: Wŏnsan−Okp'yŏng (at the time called Munch'ŏn Station) on 1 August 1915, and Munch'ŏn−Kowŏn−Kŭmya on 21 July 1916; the Kowŏn−Kŭmya section is now <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P'yŏngra <b>Line.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> 1 <b>of</b> Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T).|$|R
25|$|On 24 July 1854 <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> were vested {{with the}} Caledonian Railway; and final {{amalgamation}} occurred on 29 June 1865.|$|E
25|$|The ECML {{is one of}} {{the busiest}} lines on the British rail network and there is {{currently}} insufficient capacity on <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to satisfy all the requirements of both passenger and freight operators.|$|E
25|$|Special tolls {{existed for}} use of boat lifts, {{inclined}} planes and tunnels, but companies {{were not allowed to}} charge different tolls for special customers or over different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> until 1845 (the Canal Tolls Act).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{division}} <b>of</b> Korea cut <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in half in 1945. <b>The</b> South Korean <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> is 88.8 km long between Yongsan and Sintan-ri. The North Korean {{section is}} now <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kangwŏn <b>Line.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also {{branching}} off at Lilydale was <b>the</b> Warburton <b>line.</b> It opened in 1901, and closed on 1 August 1965. The track was removed {{in the early}} 1970s, as was the bridge over the Maroondah Highway. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right-of-way is still intact, and {{has been turned into}} the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail. The exception to this is <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> approximately 800 metres beyond where it branched off at Lilydale. Mount Lilydale Mercy College currently leases this <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> which runs through its property. This is <b>the</b> only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> that is currently obstructed. Boom barriers replaced hand gates at Maroondah Highway in 1985.|$|R
50|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{will have}} a branch-out that links Punggol to Pasir Ris.|$|R
25|$|Following {{completion}} of a major track work project in December 2006, journey times on the line were cut by about 10minutes. Currently major track replacement work is under way on the London Underground <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> to increase maximum speeds.|$|E
25|$|The other primary line, {{mainly a}} freight line, {{included}} Section Two from Michigan City on Lake Michigan to Monon and then Section three from Monon to Indianapolis. Although each route had its primary traffic, freight and passengers were carried over all <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{northern}} part of the route, between Derby and Chesterfield, also forms part of the Cross Country Route operated by CrossCountry. Tracks from Nottingham to Leeds via Barnsley and Sheffield are shared with Northern. East Midlands Local also operates regional and local services using <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Metro {{route to}} Newcastle Airport now follows <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> route.|$|R
50|$|A large stretch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> closely follows <b>the</b> A5127 road.|$|R
50|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> forms {{a section}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Cycle Network as route 73.|$|R
25|$|Trains {{began to}} run on the {{completed}} <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in 1935. In 1941 the line reached El Maitén, where maintenance facilities were built. The first train to Esquel entered the city on May 25, 1945. After President Juan Perón's nationalisation of the railway network in 1948, the Trochita became part of General Roca Railway.|$|E
25|$|The Edgware, Highgate and London Railway was {{a railway}} in north London. The railway was a {{precursor}} {{of parts of}} London Underground's Northern line and was, in the 1930s the core of an ambitious expansion plan for that line which was thwarted by the Second World War. <b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> were closed in the 1950s and have since been removed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s British Rail {{put forward a}} track {{realignment}} scheme to raise speeds on the WCML; a proposed project called InterCity 250, which entailed realigning <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{in order to increase}} curve radii and smooth gradients in order to facilitate higher-speed running. The scheme, which would have seen the introduction of new rolling stock derived from that developed for the East Coast electrification, was scrapped in 1992.|$|E
50|$|From 1928, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was {{electrified}} using surplus {{power from}} the copper mine.|$|R
50|$|The New Castle Branch (and the Wolf Creek Branch, a short spur <b>of</b> it) was <b>the</b> only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western New York and Pennsylvania Railway {{operated}} by the Pennsylvania Company as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lines</b> West <b>of</b> Pittsburgh {{rather than by the}} Pennsylvania Railroad as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lines</b> East <b>of</b> Pittsburgh. <b>The</b> Pennsylvania Company also operated the trackage rights from Stoneboro to Oil City.|$|R
50|$|Lego Super Heroes is a {{theme and}} product range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lego {{construction}} toy, introduced in 2011. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> features both DC Comics and Marvel Comics characters. <b>The</b> DC Comics <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was launched first, being released in late 2011. <b>The</b> Marvel Comics <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was launched on April 10, 2012, to be featured alongside the 2012 film The Avengers.|$|R
25|$|At 4:30a.m. on June 3, {{the three}} Union corps began to advance through a thick ground fog. Massive {{fire from the}} Confederate lines quickly caused heavy {{casualties}} and the survivors were pinned down. Although the results varied in different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> the overall repulse of the Union advance resulted in the most lopsided casualties since the assault on Marye's Heights at the Battle of Fredericksburg in 1862.|$|E
25|$|At the Eppan station {{the tracks}} where {{replaced}} by a new street to guide traffic around the village. In the early 2000s <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> were converted to a bicycle trail. Due {{to the amount of}} bicycle riders the roads from Bolzano towards the Überetsch plateau are jammed by traffic, and officials in Kaltern/Caldaro and Eppan/Appiano are supporting the idea to reactivate the line as a commuter.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{seems to}} have lacked stock-proof fencing in places, clearly {{indicated}} in a postcard of a scene near Chanter's Lane. Presumably the light railway order, low speeds and cow catchers on the locomotives made this unnecessary on some <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> On the same postcard the railway is mistakenly called the 'Bideford, Chanter's Lane, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway'. Substantial wood fencing is present at other sites in surviving photographs.|$|E
25|$|A test {{facility}} for rolling stock, now <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> opened in Odawara in 1962.|$|R
50|$|Its {{main line}} remains {{in use today}} as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between Aberdeen and Inverness.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> from Caiazzo to Cascina Gobba, {{was opened}} on September 1969.|$|R
