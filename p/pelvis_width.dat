5000|$|However, in 2008 Susannah Maidment {{and colleagues}} {{concluded}} that the holotype of Lexovisaurus, BMNH R1989, was undiagnostic, so they split off BMNH R3167 and the French finds naming them as a separate new genus: Loricatosaurus. This made Lexovisaurus a nomen dubium, while O. vetustus {{was found to be}} undiagnostic and declared a nomina dubium. Other workers though, combining the English material collected by Leeds due to its shared provenance, have considered Lexovisaurus a valid taxon. In the meantime, Omosaurus vetustus has been renamed Eoplophysis, although this genus is not regarded as valid. The nomen nudum [...] "Omosaurus leedsi" [...] (mistakenly considered a nomen dubium by Maidment et al. 2008) has since been referred to Loricatosaurus. If Lexovisaurus is limited to the holotype, little information about it is available apart from it having a general stegosaurian build and a <b>pelvis</b> <b>width</b> of 114 centimetres. Part of the material described by Hulke was a left femur, specimen BMNH R1991, with a length of ninety-nine centimetres, indicating a body length of about five metres (16.5 ft). The Fletton and Normandy material, suggesting a body length of about six metres and a weight of two tonnes, show a combination of narrow flat plates on the back and round pointed spines that ran along the tail. A large spine was found that by Hoffstetter was placed on the shoulder, by Galton on the hip and by Maidment on the tail.|$|E

40|$|Free Paper Session 9 - Spine 2 : {{abstract}} no. 9. 5 INTRODUCTION: Jarcho-Levin syndrome (JLS) {{is a rare}} condition {{leading to}} deformity of the spine with a characteristic markedly shortened thorax potentially leading to thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS). Use of vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) {{has been reported in}} cases of JLS. Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGR) allow gradual distractions at small intervals to increase spinal height. To our knowledge, we are the first to report its use in patients with JLS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present our 8 -year experience, utilising a MCGR-VEPTR hybrid construct in an 11 -year-old patient with JLS, with VEPTR inserted at age of 3 years and MCGR inserted at age of 8 years. Serial radiographs were reviewed for changes in spinal length, thoracic height, abdominal height, chest <b>width,</b> <b>pelvis</b> height, and sagittal balance. Anthropomorphic body measurements were also documented. Computed tomographic scan of lung volumetry was used to assess lung function. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Over 3 years, serial VEPTR distraction resulted in a 95. 5 % increase in the total lung volume, reflecting clinically in a transition from preoperative ventilator dependence to complete respiratory independence. A 48. 3 % increase in body height measurement with combined VEPTR and serial MCGR distraction were observed over the 8 -year period. An increase in spinal height on lateral radiographs since commencement of MCGR distraction was noted. Progressive kyphosis was seen with distraction, highlighting a potential shortcoming of distracting with the posteriorly positioned MCGR in a spine with a rigid anterior column...|$|R

The students¿ body weight, height, chest width and <b>pelvis</b> <b>width,</b> {{as well as their}} popliteal height and buttock-popliteal distance were measured. Those measures were compared to the dimensions of the school furniture (height, width and depth of the seat, width of the backrest, backrest-seat inclination and desk height) and those specified in NBR 14006 of ABNT (Brazilian Technical Standards Association). Results: The width only measures of the seat and the backrest were found to be adequate for the measures of the students.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to identify QTL associated with growth trait. An F 2 resource population of Gushi chicken crossing with Anka broiler was used in the current study. Thirty two growth traits at different weeks in this study were measured in the F 2 population which included body weight (measured every 2 weeks from hatch) and body size index measured every 4 weeks containing shank length, shank circle, chest depth chest width, chest angle, <b>pelvis</b> <b>width,</b> breast bone length and body slanting length. A total of 860 F 2 individuals produced from 7 F 1 families their parents and the grandparents F 0 birds were genotyped by 19 microsatellite markers on Chromosome 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13. Interval mapping was conducted to identify putative QTL. For the 32 growth traits, the QTL significant at the genome wide level that affected bodyweight at all ages were identified on Chromosomes 8. The QTL related to BW at early ages were identified on Chromosome 10 and 11 and only one QTL affected body weight were located on Chromosome 13.

40|$|Assessment {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} {{is a prerequisite}} for the management and conservation of animal genetic resources. Appropriate design of breeding programmes is therefore impossible for breeds that have not been adequately characterized either phenotypically and/or genetically. Phenotypic characteristics are important in breed identification and classification in ways that farming communities can relate with. This study phenotypically characterized two breeds of zebu cattle in Kenya. A total of 12 measurements (face length, ear length, horn length, heart girth, height at withers, chest depth, body length, height at rump, <b>pelvis</b> <b>width,</b> corpus length, pin bone width and tail length) were collected on 373 Maasai and 277 Kamba zebu kept by traditional farmers in south-east Kenya. The data were classified on the basis of breed group, age group, sex and coat colour pattern. Breed group, age group and sex significantly influenced all measurements. Coat colour pattern significantly influenced only height at withers, corpus length, ear length and tail length. Except for horn and ear length, all the other measurements were significantly higher for the Maasai zebu. Additionally, the Maasai zebu was taller than it was long. The opposite was true for the Kamba zebu. The Maasai and Kamba zebus can be classified as medium-sized breeds; however, great variations exist in their body sizes within and between the breeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{geometric}} {{method used}} in patterns design of different products categories, gives good results for garments manufacturing in industrial system, meaning type representative bodies. The {{quality of the}} results {{is due to the}} fact that in geometric method the completion of the basic patterns is achieved by prototype implementation followed by viewing the correspondence between the body and the garment, by dressing the human body or industrial mannequin. In the case that the garment, designed and manufactured for type representative bodies according to the standards is dressed by persons that do not fit the type bodies for whom the product was made, the fenomena called “draping defects” apprears. These unconcordances between wearer body and product obtained in industrial system is due to the conformational features of potential users such as: buttocks prominence and form, hips prominence and form, <b>pelvis</b> <b>width</b> and length, ratio between front and anterior-posterior diameters of the pelvis. Anthropometry researches have shown that for a standardized value of the hip perimeter the secondary dimensions of the area (posterior buttock arch, length from waist the buttock point, lower arch of torso) may have different values. In this context, the paper aims to analyze the shape and size of the women’s pelvis and to develop the technical solutions to adapt the basic pattern for “trousers with adjusted silhouette” to concrete particularities of the body shape...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Q {{angle is}} defined as an acute angle between two {{imaginary}} lines drawn from the ASIS {{to the center of}} patella and {{from the center of the}} patella to the tibial tuberosity. Measuring of Q angle usually was conducted in the supine position by two main methods, invasive methods such as radiography and CT scan and non-invasive methods, including goniometer and photogrammetry. The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of a new method for measuring of the Q angle. The Q angle of 9 subjects (18 knees), with mean and standard deviation of age 23. 55 ± 2. 24 (years), mean weight of 73. 00 ± 10. 47 (kg), thigh length of 43. 11 ± 3. 17 cm, <b>pelvis</b> <b>width</b> of 39. 66 ± 3. 00, using CT scan method, innovative method of image processing and goniometer in the supine position were calculated and the correlation between the innovative method of image processing, goniometer and CT scan was measured via Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The findings of this study revealed a significant relationship between Q angles obtained through the innovative method of image processing and CT scan method in the supine (r= 0. 92), It also showed significant relation between Q angle obtained with the goniometer and CT scan in the supine position(r= 0. 81) (p= 0. 001). According to the result of this research, tools and instruments applied for Q angle calculation can be rated according to the correlation rate that they have with the CT scan method. Therefore, the innovative method of image processing can be an appropriate substitute for goniometer method in measuring Q angle in the supine position...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{condition}} {{of a successful}} process of karate training is making diagnosis of any sportsman. Assessment is usually done by a coach {{and it is a}} part of technical process; quantity measurements are also a part of the evaluation which contains these tests. The suggested diagnostic karate tests are based on the knowledge of the specific karate characteristics and on the research which was done so far (Zulić 1985, Milošević and Zulić 1988, Jovanović 1981, 1988, Mudrić 1994, Doder 1998, 2000, 2005, Babiak, Doder, Savić, Golik 2001, Savić, Doder, Babiak 2002). Karate as a type of sport demands diagnosis of many relevant characteristics, abilities and features that are thought to be predominant in the analysis of this kind of sport. Knowing all relevant anthropologic karate dimensions it is possible to select necessary instruments for measuring and to test those dimensions that karate results depend on. Considering all scientific knowledge and achievements in this field the fallowing tests are suggested: Morphologic measures: body height, arm span, arm length, <b>pelvis</b> <b>width,</b> hand ankle diameter, knees diameter, elbow diameter, body weight, parameters of one’s chest, stomach, the upper and lower part of one’s arm and legs, then to examine the skin fold of any sportsman’s arms, back, stomach and legs. Functional diagnosis: measuring of the maximum amount of oxygen breathed in. Mobility tests: the speed of simple movements, the speed of karate technique, deep bow on the bench, shoulders capability of moving, the static strength of hands, legs, shoulders and middle part of a body, jump height, an average jump, and the percentage of maximum achievement in jumping...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} material which was studied has been represented by 34 ROSO SL hybrid that lay eggs, of 45 weeks of age. We have analyzed the 45 weeks age as a middle age for {{the intensity of}} egg laying {{on the level of}} over 80 %. Measurements have been made for the following conformation traits: body weight, body length, former depth, former width, <b>pelvis</b> <b>width,</b> length of the breast-bone careen, thoracic perimeter, shin perimeter and length. The measurements have been made according to the methodology and the known speciality instruments. The observation data have been overworked, this way we have established the average values and the variability parameters for the traits we followed, which fit the values presented in the specialty literature and are even over these for the age group chosen for studies. The body weight of 2058. 82 ± 38. 49 g, superior to the one mentioned in the technological guide, confirms a proper unrolling of the body weight deposits and shows that the Roso SL hybrid will properly support both the body growth in weight and also egg production in parallel, respectively this double effort, fact that gives the hybrid a higher quality. Other registered values are of 18. 06 ± 0. 15 for the body length, of 10. 85 ± 0. 11 cm for the length of the breastbone careen, together with the sizes which maintain a proper egg production, such as the width of the pelvis of 9. 75 ± 0. 14, the former width of 6. 78 ± 0. 10 cm and, why not, even the former depth of 10. 72 ± 0. 12. We would also notice an appreciable uniformity of these values, the limits of the variation factor being between 4. 66 (length of the shin) and 8. 36 (former width). The values that the {{biological material}} represent for the characters we studied, convince us about the hybrid’s availability for being exploited in the egg production...|$|E

Anthropometric measurements {{have been carried out}} using metodology proposed by the International Biological program (IBP). The results of these investigations have shown that there is a certain impact of the socio-eonomic conditions on the growth and development of boys. Children from families that have better living standard are, as a rule, taller, which is indicated by the statistical significant differences (P > 0. 01). This trend indicates also value of Body Mass Index (BMI), which is in younger children from the families with lower living standard 16, while in the same category in the children from the families with better living standard it has value 18. 5. The real impact of living conditions on the dynamics of development could be the best seen in the period of puberty. The number of children in the family has negative relationship with anthropometric features. Statistically significant differences (P > 0. 001) have been detected in numerous analysed features in families with one or two children in comparison with families with three, four, or five children. Therefore, BMI has been significantlly lower (16) in children from familes with several children, while in the families with one child in the same growth class (11 years) it was significanlly higher (17. 4). Similar value of BMI (17. 9) have children from the families with five children and which are 17 years old. Besides socio-economic conditions, high level of environmental pollution which is typicall for Tuzla region for a long time, has also significant impact on the growth and development of children...|$|E
40|$|Observational {{cross-sectional}} study. The {{current study}} aims to yield normative data: i. e., the physiological standard for 30 selected quantitative 3 D parameters that accurately capture and describe a full-skeleton, upright-standing attitude. Specific and exclusive consideration {{was given to}} three distinct categories: postural, spine morphology and pelvic parameters. To capture such 3 D parameters, the authors selected a non-ionising 3 D opto-electronic stereo-photogrammetric approach. This required the identification and measurement of 27 body landmarks, each specifically tagged with a skin marker. As subjects for the measurement of these parameters, a cohort of 124 asymptomatic young adult volunteers was recruited. All parameters were identified and measured within this group. Postural and spine morphology data have been compared between genders. In this regard, only five statistically significant differences were found: <b>pelvis</b> <b>width,</b> pelvis torsion, the "lumbar" lordosis angle value, the lumbar curve length, and the T 12 -L 5 anatomically-bound lumbar angle value. The "thoracic" kyphosis mean angle value was the same in both sexes and, even if, derived from skin markers placed on spinous processes it resulted in perfect agreement with the X-ray based literature. As regards lordosis, a direct comparison was more difficult because methods proposed in the literature differ as to the number and position of vertebrae under consideration, and their related angle values. However, when the L 1 superior-L 5 inferior end plate Cobb angle was considered, these results aligned strongly with the existing literature. Asymmetry was a standard postural-spinal feature for both sexes. Each subject presented some degree of leg length discrepancy (LLD) with μ = 9. 37 mm. This was associated with four factors: unbalanced posture and/or underfoot loads, spinal curvature in the frontal plane, and pelvis torsion. This led to the additional study {{of the effect of}} LLD equalisation influence on upright posture, relying on a sub-sample of 100 subjects (51 males, 49 females). As a result of the equalisation, about 82 % of this sub-sample showed improvement in standing posture, mainly in the frontal plane; while in the sagittal plane less than 1 / 3 of the sub-sample showed evidence of change in spinal angles. A significant variation was found in relation to pelvis torsion: 46 % of subjects showed improvement, 49 % worsening. The method described in study presents several advantages: non-invasive aspect; relatively short time for a complete postural evaluation with many clinically useful 3 D and 2 D anatomical/biomechanical/clinical parameters; analysis of real neutral unconstrained upright standing posture...|$|E
40|$|Today body-building as a spport is {{well known}} and {{accepted}} world-wide. When scientifi researches on this fi eld are in question, {{it is evident that}} they are very rare partly and probably due to its real interpretation as well as due to its insuffi cient affi rmation and popularization here. Reason for this is also the wrong interpretation of the sport’s essence among sports-people – the body-builders themselves and among the experts and scientists from this fi eld. Intrest in the research of morphological sphere of body-builders was inspired by the fact that exercising body-building is a very specifi c physical activity that, due to its nature, demands body-builders to have specifi c morphological characteristics that characterize and differ them from other sports-people. The goal of this research was determining the structure of the morhologicall sphere of a body-builder. It was performed on the sample of 30 selected sportsmen, bodybuilders, of chronological age between 17 and 19 ( 6 months), members of the Sports' Club Strength ''Leskovac'', the Weight Lifters' Club '' Dubočica'' and the Body-building Club '' Dubočica'' from Leskovac. All the examiees have been submitted to training processes during a period longer than a year. For the purpose of determining the structure of the morphological sphere the Factor Analysis has been applied. Based on the data from the matrix of the Factor Structure the isolated factors can be interpreted in the following manner: The fi rst isolated factor in the sphere of applied anthropometric variables can be defi ned as a dimension of the body-volume and the transversal dimensionality of the skeleton sine it’s best defi ned by the following variables: the chest-circumference (AOGKS), the upper-arm circumference (AONAD), the thigh circumference (AOBUT), the body-weight (AMAST) and the shoulder-width (ASIRA). The second isolated factor in the sphere of applied anthropometric variables can be defi ned as the longitudinal dimensionality of the skeleton since it’s best defi ned by the following variables: the body-height (AVIST), the leg-length (ADUNO) and the arm-length (ADURU). The third isolated factor in the sphere of applied anthropometric variables can be defi ned as the transversal dimensionality of the skeleton since it is best defi ned by the following variables: the <b>pelvis</b> <b>width</b> (ASIKA), the width of hips. The fourth isolated factor in the sphere of applied anthropometric variables can be described as a dimension of the fat under-skin tissue since it is best defi ned by the following variables: the upper-arm skinfold (AKNNA), the back skin-fold (ANKLE) and the belly skin-fold (AKNTR) ...|$|E
40|$|Data are {{presented}} {{on the growth}} of range cattle {{over a period of}} four years in a semi-arid region of South Africa. A total of 176 half-bred animals of five different breeds are included in this study. The data consist of live weights taken at bi-monthly intervals of all animals, and linear body measurements taken at bi-monthly intervals for a period of 28 months for three different age groups. Growth in weight is strictly seasonal from weaning to maturity. These seasonal fluctuations are shown to be closely allied to monthly rainfall. The bulk of the annual precipitation occurs from November to February and the period of greatest relative growth in weight lags approximately three months behind the period of heaviest precipitation. The greatest increase in body weight occurs from January to March and the periods of smallest increase or greatest loss in weight occur from July to September. Body measurements are also influenced by seasonal changes but to a lesser extent than body weight. The following measurements are least affected: height at withers, height over hips, body length, depth of chest and depth of flank. The measurements markedly influenced by season of the year are length of <b>pelvis,</b> <b>width</b> at hooks, width at thurls, width of loin and width of chest. Significant differences between the sexes exist from birth, males being heavier than females. Sex differences in body measurements are not so marked, especially in the earlier age groups. When maturity is approached the steers exceed the heifers to a marked degree in all body measurements except those of the pelvic region. The breeds may be divided into two classes in respect to weight and size, Herefords and Sussex comprising one class and Aberdeen-Angus and Afrikander constituting another. The animals of the first class exceed those of the second class in weight and most body measurements. The Shorthorns occupy an intermediate position and the peculiar behaviour of this breed is discussed. The Afrikanders proved to have greater wither height and hip height than all other breeds. The relative importance of genetic and environmental factors on the growth of the animals is discussed. It is shown that the variance in height at withers in this population is approximately three-fourths genetic and one-fourth environmental in origin. In width at thurls and width at hooks more than 60 per cent of the variance is genetic. The variance in body length and live weight is accounted for equally by genetic and environmental factors. In all chest measurements the variance appear to be only slightly hereditary. It is shown that the factor of nutrition plays a very important role in the growth of range cattle under the conditions of this experiment. It is not possible to determine from this study whether permanent stunting results from inadequate nutrition but it is concluded that growth is retarded and maturity delayed.

40|$|Fall-related {{injuries}} are the current leading accidental cause of emergency room and hospital visits, hospitalizations, and injury-related deaths in Ontario. Hip fractures {{in particular are}} associated with poor functional and survival outcomes, and high medical and rehabilitation costs. While {{nearly a third of}} older adults fall in Canada each year, only 2 % of falls result in a hip fracture, and only 10 - 37 % of falls result in any injury requiring medical attention. The Factor of Risk model (i. e. applied loads/fracture tolerance) has been proposed as a conceptual model to explain this discrepancy, however, current approaches used to screen for hip fracture risk focus primarily on bone strength (i. e. only fracture tolerance) and population-level clinical risk factors for which the mechanistic link to fracture risk is unclear. Individual faller and falling characteristics have been proposed to influence the application and distribution of loads during a fall which could add predictive value to the Factor of Risk approach. However, the magnitude and interaction of these factors has not been quantified. Therefore, the focus of this thesis was to examine the influence and interaction of individual anthropometry and falling configuration on impact dynamics during simulated falls, and development of a computational model to predict the magnitude and distribution of loads in the pelvis during a fall. The overarching theme was supported through five studies, with objectives to i) define the relationship between elements of body size (e. g. height) and composition (e. g. percent fat mass, trochanteric soft tissue thickness) and impact dynamic outcomes (i. e. peak vertical force, pressure, contact area and deflection) during a simplified simulated fall protocol; ii) determine the relationship between individual characteristics and model parameters for one- and three-dimensional contact models with elastic and viscoelastic components; iii) assess model performance (namely, Mass Spring, Voigt, Hertz, Hunt-Crossley and Volumetric) for the prediction of applied loads during simulated falls; iv) determine how trochanteric soft tissue influences deflection of skeletal structures during a controlled impact; and iv) examine how the relationships between body size and composition are affected when more complex fall simulation protocols are implemented. Studies 1 and 5 employed in vivo fall simulation protocols, Studies 2 - 3 were performed in silico¬ based on parameters and outcomes drawn from in vivo fall simulations, with comparisons based on both peak and time-varying force outcomes, and in Study 4 an in vitro drop tower protocol was used to apply loads directly to the greater trochanter. In Study 1, pelvis impact dynamics were strongly related to individual characteristics, providing support {{for the development of a}} subject-specific hip fracture model. Peak force was strongly linearly related to mass, while peak pressure, contact area, and deflection were more strongly related to the quantity of adipose tissue overlying the hip. In Study 2, elastic parameters for the Voigt and Hertz models were not linked to any individual characteristic, while the Mass-Spring, Hunt-Crossley and Volumetric elastic parameters were related to body fat, sex and trochanteric soft tissue thickness, respectively. Damping parameters for the Voigt model differed between males and females; for the Hunt-Crossley and Volumetric models varied based on <b>pelvis</b> <b>width.</b> In Study 3, model performance was strongest for the Hunt-Crossley model compared to all other models tested, and improved for three- vs one-dimensional models and models including dampers compared to elastic-only models. In Study 4, when cadaveric greater trochanters were laterally impacted using a drop tower protocol, greater and more consistent deflection was found at the anterior superior iliac spine than the greater trochanter, and low, but substantial, deflection occurred medially at the lateral apex of the pelvic ring and medial border of the ilium. Deflections distributed between structures were different during conditions where trochanteric soft tissues were present vs. conditions where soft tissues were removed. In Study 5, while impact characteristics continued to link closely with individual faller characteristics, they were more strongly linked to fall simulation method. Though vertical impact velocity was similar between protocols, shear forces and pressure were greater when participants initiated a simulated fall from a squat position compared to initiation from a kneeling position or a passive “pelvis release” fall simulation. In sum, the results of these studies provide evidence of the importance of faller characteristics, particularly trochanteric soft tissue thickness, and falling configuration, in predicting the magnitude and distribution of loads during a fall impacting the hip. Additionally, the modeling components point towards the ease of developing and implementing an individualized and mechanistic method of predicting fracture risk in older adults. The results of these studies help to illuminate why some fallers in some configurations experience different risk of injury than would be predicted based on clinical risk factors. These results can be used to improve screening of individuals who might be at greater risk of injury due to poor absorption or distribution of energy by the trochanteric soft tissues. Further, these results may be used to identify which type of hip protector may be appropriate based on individual anthropometry. Finally, risky falling configurations have been identified and can be linked to falling patterns within epidemiological and balance literature—these can be used to develop exercise- and environment-based interventions. Future work should focus on determining how faller strategy influences falling configuration and impact dynamics. Additionally, further model expansion and validation is required to improve the external validity of the models proposed and tested within this thesis, particularly with regards to non-vertical impact dynamics and load distribution within the femur and pelvis...|$|E
