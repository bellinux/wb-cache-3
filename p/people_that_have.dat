5|$|Six {{athletes have}} each won four medals in volleyball. Cuban Ana Fernández and American Kerri Walsh Jennings each have three gold and one bronze, Soviet Inna Ryskal and Brazilian Sérgio Santos have two gold and two silver medals, Russian Sergey Tetyukhin has one gold, one silver, and two bronzes, and Italian Samuele Papi has two silvers and two bronzes. Eight athletes have won three gold medals. Five, {{including}} Fernández, {{were members of}} the Cuban women's indoor team that won consecutive golds in 1992, 1996 and 2000. May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings, as noted above, won beach volleyball gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012. The other is Karch Kiraly, who won gold with the United States men's indoor team in 1984 and 1988 and in beach volleyball in 1996. Kiraly is the only player of either sex to win medals in both indoor and beach volleyball. Kiraly is also one of four <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> won medals both as a player and coach. Apart from May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings, Ricardo Santos and Emanuel Rego of Brazil are the only athletes with three medals in beach volleyball. They have one gold and one bronze as a team, and each has one silver with other partners.|$|E

30|$|The pilot testing showed {{remarkable}} {{differences in}} {{knowledge and skills}} {{as well as the}} competency to act in the simulated situation among the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> gone through the experience-based training and the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> gone through the standard first-aid course. Compared to the 4 -h standard trainings, the 16 -h experience-based-training participants demonstrate more knowledge as well as better skills. They also perform better during simulated emergency situations and declare better comfort and fewer inadequate emotional reactions.|$|R
25|$|Regarding {{locus of}} control, {{there is another}} type of control that entails a mix among the {{internal}} and external types. <b>People</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. <b>People</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control. <b>People</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to {{the internal and external}} loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who will accept the fact that he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging that there are people, mainly doctors and therapists, that are trying to cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of naming Afro-Brazilians with religious surnames was proved even by some indirect approaches. Medical researchers demonstrated {{that there is}} a statistical correlation between a religious name and genetic diseases related to African ancestry such as the sickle-cell disease.

25|$|Esperanto is {{estimated}} to have approximately 100,000 to 2 million fluent speakers. In the same manner estimates {{for the number of}} Ido speakers are far from accurate, but 500 to a few thousand is most likely. It is also important to note the distinction between the number of speakers compared to the number of supporters; the two languages resemble each other enough that a few weeks of study will enable one to understand the other with little difficulty, {{and there are a number}} of <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> learned Ido out of curiosity but prefer to support the larger Esperanto movement and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|Portuguese architecture, {{like all}} aspects of Portuguese culture, is marked by {{the history of the}} country and the several <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> settled and {{influenced}} the current Portuguese territory. These include Romans, Suebians among other related Germanic peoples, Visigoths and Arabs, as well as the influence from the main European artistic centres from which were introduced to the broad architectural styles: Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassicism. Among the main local manifestations of Portuguese architecture are the Manueline, the exuberant Portuguese version of late Gothic; and the Pombaline style, a mix of late Baroque and Neoclassicism that developed after the Great Lisbon earthquake of 1755.|$|E
25|$|One common {{group of}} <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> visual memory {{problems}} are children with reading disabilities. It was often thought that disabilities {{are caused by}} failure to perceive the letters of a written word in the right order. However, studies show {{it is more likely}} that it is caused by a failure to encode and process the correct order of letters within the word. This means that the child perceives the word just as anyone else would, however their brains do not appear to hold onto the visual characteristics of the word. Although initially it was found that children with reading disabilities had comparable visual memory to those without difficulty, a more specific part of the visual memory system has been found to cause reading disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Both hemispheres of {{the brain}} make a {{contribution}} to the McGurk effect. They work together to integrate speech information that is received through the auditory and visual senses. A McGurk response is more likely to occur in right-handed individuals for whom the face has privileged access to the right hemisphere and words to the left hemisphere. In <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> had callosotomies done, the McGurk effect is still present but significantly slower. In people with lesions to the left hemisphere {{of the brain}}, visual features often {{play a critical role in}} speech and language therapy. People with lesions in the left hemisphere of the brain show a greater McGurk effect than normal controls. Visual information strongly influences speech perception in these people. There is a lack of susceptibility to the McGurk illusion if left hemisphere damage resulted in a deficit to visual segmental speech perception. In people with right hemisphere damage, impairment on both visual-only and audio-visual integration tasks is exhibited, although they are still able to integrate the information to produce a McGurk effect. Integration only appears if visual stimuli is used to improve performance when the auditory signal is impoverished but audible. Therefore, there is a McGurk effect exhibited in people with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain but the effect is not as strong as a normal group.|$|E

Actually, that song's about a few people, not one person in particular. Everyone likes to , 'Ah, I know that's about Rene.' It's about a few <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> entered and exited my life." [...] Simon created a similar controversy when she released [...] "You're So Vain".

Smith, and even prominent politicians such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitch McConnell. Rizzo [...] defended the decision to shut down Strasburg and criticized the buzz surrounding it: [...] "It's a good conversational piece, it's a good debatable subject.
