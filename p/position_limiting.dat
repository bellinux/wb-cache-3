Given the growing roles of liquidity and <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> in finance along with recent Wall Street legislation changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, we carry out studies to test how effectively price impact liquidity measures measure liquidity, whether <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> have impacts on market liquidity, and how optimal speculative <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> should be modeled, based on microstructure theories. Using the major New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) energy futures data from Bloomberg, we compare low-frequency liquidity proxies with high-frequency liquidity benchmarks, run an event study on futures contracts’ liquidity following the launching of the Dodd-Frank Act, and develop a theory-based <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> model.

The small-diameter Garrett T5 turbocharger with integral wastegate was manufactured by Garrett AiResearch and produced a maximum of 5 psi (34 kPa) boost at 2200 rpm. The engine had 10.25:1 compression and a single-barrel carburetor. It was rated at [...] at 4600 rpm and [...] at 3200 rpm. In development, the high compression ratio combined with the charged load created problems with spark knock on hard throttle applications, which led Olds to develop and utilize a novel water-injection system that sprayed metered amounts of distilled water and methyl alcohol (dubbed [...] "Turbo-Rocket Fluid") into the intake manifold air-stream to cool the intake charge. If the fluid reservoir was empty, a complex double-float and valve assembly in the Turbo-Rocket Fluid path would set a second butterfly (positioned between the throttle butterfly and the turbocharger) into the closed <b>position,</b> <b>limiting</b> the amount of boost pressure.

40|$|Mutual {{funds are}} often {{restricted}} to allocate certain percentages of fund assets to certain securities that have {{different degrees of}} illiquidity. However, the existing literature on how mutual funds should trade has largely ignored the coexistence of <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> and differential illiquidity and thus the optimal trading strategy for a typical mutual fund is largely unknown. In this paper, we use a novel approach to study the optimal trading strategy of mutual funds who face both <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> and differential illiquidity. We show the existence, uniqueness, smoothness, and characterization of the optimal trading strategy. We provide extensive analytical comparative statics for the optimal trading strategy and an efficient numerical method for computing the optimal trading strategy.

30|$|The {{practical}} depth-of-focus for {{the camera}} presented here was measured using a slanted edge to determine the loss at modulation over a range of spatial frequencies most affected by defocus.

Considering variation of the tether length in the model, dynamics {{of the system is}} modeled using Lagrange’s method. Librational motion of the tether is controlled by adjusting the tether length similar to conventional manipulators,control of the robot is performed by its motors. It is clear that, in the trajectory tracking of the end effector, the tether length should be kept more or less constant, keeping them in a stable <b>position.</b> <b>Limiting</b> the tether length variation while using it as a tool for controlling the tether librational motion, is the main challenging part of the control system. To deal with this problem, a hybrid control  system is proposed to control the system. A nonlinear model predictive control approach (NMPC) is utilized to control the tether librational motion and a modified computed torque method (CTM) is used to control the manipulator motion. Initially the NMPC controller is developed for a simple tethered satellite system. Then it is combined with the CTM controller.  The proposed controller is employed to control motion of a space robot’s end effector on a predefined trajectory. Performance of the controller is then evaluated by numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|Systems {{to provide}} {{improved}} tactile feedback to aircraft pilots {{are being developed}} to help the pilots maintain harmony between their control actions and the positions of aircraft control surfaces, thereby helping to prevent loss of control. A system of this type, denoted a loss-of-control-inhibitor system (LOCIS) can be implemented as a relatively simple addition to almost any pre-existing flight-control system. The LOCIS concept offers at least a partial {{solution to the problem}} of (1) keeping a pilot aware of the state of the control system and the aircraft and (2) maintaining sufficient control under conditions that, as described below, have been known to lead to loss of control. Current commercial aircraft exhibit uneven responses of primary flight-control surfaces to aggressive pilot control commands, leading to deterioration of pilots ability to control their aircraft. In severe cases, this phenomenon can result in loss of control and consequent loss of aircraft. For an older aircraft equipped with a purely mechanical control system, the loss of harmony between a pilot s command action and the control- surface response can be attributed to compliance in the control system (caused, for example, by stretching of control cables, flexing of push rods, or servo-valve distortion). In a newer aircraft equipped with a fly-by-wire control system, the major contributions to loss of harmony between the pilot and the control surfaces are delays attributable to computer cycle time, control shaping, filtering, aliasing, servo-valve distortion, and actuator rate limiting. In addition, a fly-by-wire control system provides no tactile feedback that would enable the pilot to sense such features of the control state as surface flutter, surface jam, <b>position</b> <b>limiting,</b> actuator rate limiting, and control limiting imposed by the aircraft operational envelope. Hence, for example, when a pilot is involved in aggressive closed-loop maneuvering, as when encountering a wake-vortex upset on final landing approach, the control-surface delay can lead to loss of control. Aggressive piloting can be triggered and exacerbated by control-system anomalies, which the pilot cannot diagnose because of the lack of symptoms caused by the absence of feedback through the controls. The purpose served by a LOCIS is to counteract these adverse effects by providing real-time feedback that notifies the pilot that the aircraft is tending to lag the pilot s commands. A LOCIS (see figure) includes cockpit control input-position sensors, control-surface output-position sensors, variable dampers (for example, shock absorbers containing magneto-rheological fluids such that the damping forces can be varied within times of the order of milliseconds by varying applied magnetic fields) attached to the cockpit control levers, electromagnet coils to apply the magnetic fields, and feedback control circuits to drive the electromagnet coils. The feedback control gains are chosen so that the current applied to each electromagnet coil results in a damping force that increases in a suitable nonlinear manner (e. g., exponentially) with the difference between the actual and commanded positions of the affected control surface. The increasing damping force both alerts the pilot to the onset of a potentially dangerous situation and resists the pilot s effort to command a control surface to change position at an excessive rat...|$|E

40|$|The Dodd-Frank Act {{mandated}} the CFTC {{to implement}} <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> {{on a number}} of commodities exempted from such limits currently. CFTC has proposed establishing <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> on commodity index trading, effectively classifying this group as speculators. At the center of this debate is whether the rise in commodity index trading was responsible for creating a speculative bubble in a number of commodity markets. A central tenet of proponents of a speculative bubble is the apparent close association between the change in commodity index trading and prices, particularly during 2007 - 2008 when oil prices and other commodity prices rose sharply. As is shown in the study, simple correlation does not imply causation. In fact, upon closer inspection of the theory of commodity markets and the empirical literature, by far the evidence supports the theory that underlying market fundamentals in commodity markets are directly responsible for commodity price effects. The evidence supporting the speculative bubble theory was found to have a number of limitations that call into question the robustness of the results. The paper also outlines empirical findings that deep and active commodity index trading activity promotes price discovery and liquidity in futures markets, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of these markets for hedgers. The implication for public policy is clear; imposing <b>position</b> <b>limits</b> on commodity index trading activity ignores the extensive literature refuting the speculative bubble theory and in so doing would negatively affect commodity markets, investors and hedgers while increasing risk...|$|R
