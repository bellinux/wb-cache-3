25|$|During the Redskins' {{game on the}} {{afternoon}} of December 7, 1941, against the Philadelphia Eagles, an announcement was made over Griffith Stadium's <b>public-address</b> <b>system</b> commanding all of the American generals and admirals there to report to their duty stations. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was not explicitly announced over the P.A. system; with no small, portable radios available in the 1940s, that left thousands of other spectators to be among the last Americans to learn of the Japanese attack. The Redskins won that game, their last game of the 1941 season, 20-14. They finished the season with a record of six wins and five losses, in third place in the NFL Eastern Division. Although the Redskins enjoyed only one winning record at home (4–2 in 1956) during their final 13 seasons at Griffith, they still finished with an 81-58-6 overall record at the stadium over 24 seasons.|$|E

500|$|On July25,1990, Barr {{performed}} [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] {{before a}} baseball game between the San Diego Padres and Cincinnati Reds at Jack Murphy Stadium. As she later claimed, she was initially having trouble hearing herself over the <b>public-address</b> <b>system,</b> so she was singing as loudly as possible, and her rendition of the song sounded [...] "screechy". Following her rendition, she mimicked the often-seen actions of players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. Barr claimed she had been encouraged by baseball officials to [...] "bring humor to the song". The song and the closing routine received heavy media attention and offended many, including President George H. W. Bush, who called her rendition [...] "disgraceful."

The most common way of facilitating public communications is by using devices that are incorporated into some public venue, such as <b>public-address</b> <b>systems</b> or digital signage.

40|$|This study {{describes}} an evaluation method for non-intrusive speech perception assessment. The proposed method assesses the listening effort related to speech perception in noisy classrooms. It combines an {{estimation of the}} physical signal properties relevant for perception of speech with a perceptual model. For {{a wide range of}} signal-to-noise ratios, the measure can predict differences in listening effort for different positions in the room. It also predicts the benefit of sound-field systems, which boost the teacher’s voice by playing it back over a loudspeaker. This approach therefore seems appropriate for the design and real-time evaluation of <b>public-address</b> <b>systems</b> and room acoustics...|$|R

Access to the two platforms is by steps from the road on either side. There is a ramp to the eastbound platform, {{but it has a}} gradient greater than 1 in 12, and there is no ramp access to trains. There is no ramp access to the westbound platform. Access between the platforms is either by a footbridge, or by walking along the main road under the line.

500|$|In a 2000 interview, William Asher {{described}} Temperatures Rising {{as being}} about: [...] "a young black surgeon {{who was always}} into mischief and things, {{but he was a}} very competent surgeon. James Whitmore was the head surgeon and he used to drive Whitmore crazy". The pilot episode of Temperatures Rising was written by Sheldon Keller, who turned to his This is a Hospital? script for inspiration. It features Noland broadcasting a bingo game in code over the hospital's <b>public-address</b> <b>system.</b> Jack Albertson guest starred as a United States Senator. Subsequent episodes feature Noland performing a secret operation on a young baseball player while Campanelli deals with a hospital inspector (Ed Platt), and John Astin as a gangster wanting Noland to be his personal physician. In another episode, Noland hypnotizes a patient (Alice Ghostley) and, accidentally, Nurse Turner as well. This nearly costs the hospital a large donation from a potential benefactor (Charles Lane). In later episodes, Campanelli is seen having a brief romance with Nurse Turner's aunt (Beverly Garland), Noland helps out a new intern (Bernie Kopell) who has a reputation for being a jinx, and also performs a witchcraft ritual on a patient (Alan Oppenheimer) who thinks he has been cursed.|$|E

50|$|A {{prolific}} inventor and engineer, Olson {{was awarded}} more than 100 patents {{for the various}} types of microphones (including the widely used 44- and 77-series), cardioid (directional) microphones, loudspeaker baffles, air-suspension loudspeakers, isobaric loudspeakers, early video recording equipment, audio recording equipment, phonograph pickups, underwater sound equipment, noise reduction, sound technology in motion-pictures, and <b>public-address</b> <b>systems</b> he developed. He also authored 135 articles and ten books including an interdisciplinary text charting the dynamical analogies between electrical, acoustical and mechanical systems. In 1949, Olson was honored by being the first recipient of the Audio Engineering Society's John H. Potts Memorial Award, an award program which was later renamed the Gold Medal. In 1953-4 Olson {{served as president of the}} Acoustical Society of America, which awarded him the very first Silver Medal in Engineering Acoustics in 1974 and the Gold Medal in 1981.

5000|$|Two {{developments}} {{more than}} any others led sports leagues to regulate artificial noise. The first was advances in electronics which put items like portable bullhorns within reach of the typical fan. These devices could create an incredible level of noise which could make game play almost intolerable. The second was the rise of fan interest in college basketball, which is of course played in indoor venues in which the sound typically dissipates far less than in outdoor ones. Leagues did not desire to end the vocal support of fans, but learned {{that they would have}} to regulate artificial noise made by electronics, horns, bells, and the like, to make game play tolerable. Most leagues eventually banned these devices altogether, banned cheerleaders from access to <b>public-address</b> <b>systems,</b> and prevented bands from playing while the ball was actually in play. Most leagues have also followed the lead of the National Football League and also banned the playing of recorded music while actual game play is occurring, limiting it to when the ball is dead.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the social and}} political significance of media among the Iban of Sarawak, in Malaysian Borneo. It is intended to contribute both to the ethnographic literature on the lban and to a neglected field of inquiry of key theoretical and practical importance: the anthropological study of media. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter introduces the problem by critically reviewing the relevant literature from social anthropology and media studies. The second chapter deals with the production side of modern media from an historical perspective. The production of a modern lban identity through radio and print media in the 1 960 s was superseded in the 1970 s by a more vigorous rival project supported through television and textbooks: the creation of a Malaysian national culture. The third chapter explores the 'social life and afterlife' of television sets in the Saribas region as they enter into the gift and exchange systems that bind the living and the dead, including burial rites at which television sets are destroyed. This approach reveals growing wealth disparities in rural Sarawak as well as culture-specific ways in which media artefacts are appropriated and disposed of. Chapter Four analyses the critical role of radio, television, <b>public-address</b> <b>systems</b> and other media in the organisation of social time and space in Saribas longhouse communities. I argue that these media help local people to routinely naturalize clock and calendar time both in their daily and festive lives. Chapter Five focuses on the relationship between media practices and the local Saribas ideology, or 'ideolect'. A close examination of school essays, public-address speeches and television commentary reveals a consistent set of developmentalist ideas cutting across these diverse practices. Chapter Six compares and contrasts the findings from the Saribas area (chapters 3 - 5) with those from a more remote region, the Skrang. I stress the importance of indigenised Christian prayer books in providing recent converts with tools with which to make sense of troubling reports from television and radio, notably news of war, famine and the spread of infectious diseases. Chapter Seven is a summary and conclusion...|$|R
