50|$|Richard Edward Glover (born February 6, 1950) is {{a former}} {{professional}} football player, a defensive tackle for the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL. He played college football at Nebraska under head coach Bob Devaney. Glover played high school football at Snyder High School in Jersey City, New Jersey. Glover recalls a time when his coach, Roy Corso, instructed each player to bring a garbage <b>pail</b> <b>cover</b> with them for after the game. When asked why, Corso responded it was for their own protection. Glover admits if it wasn't for those covers, they never {{would have made it}} past the losing team throwing rocks at the bus windows {{on the way out of}} the parking lot.|$|E

6000|$|When he got ready, he {{went down}} into the yard, and found that Jonas had got the horse harnessed, and {{everything}} prepared. There was a little bag of oats in the back part of the wagon, and also a tin <b>pail,</b> with a <b>cover,</b> which contained a luncheon. Jonas fastened the horse to a post, and said,-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Feces were {{excreted}} into {{a container}} {{such as a}} chamber pot, and sometimes collected in the container with urine and other waste ("slops", hence slopping out). The excrement in the <b>pail</b> was often <b>covered</b> with earth (soil), which {{may have contributed to}} the term [...] "night soil." [...] Often the deposition or excretion occurred within the residence, such as in a shophouse. This system may still be used in isolated rural areas or in urban slums in developing countries. The material was collected for temporary storage and disposed of depending on local custom.|$|R
25|$|Ice cream {{was made}} by hand {{in a large bowl}} placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a <b>covered</b> <b>pail</b> with a handle {{attached}} to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.|$|R
60|$|At {{the foot}} of a huge oak, that grew a few yards from the fatal saplings, we found the two wooden, <b>covered</b> <b>pails</b> in which we knew Pete had been {{accustomed}} to carry food to Mr. Traverse and the chain-bearers. They were empty, but whether the provisions they unquestionably had contained fell to the share of those for whom they were intended, or to that of the captors, we never learned. No traces of bones, potato-skins, or other fragments were discovered; and, if the Hurons had seized the provisions, they doubtless transferred them to their own repositories, without stopping to eat. Susquesus detected proof that the victim had been seated at {{the foot of}} the oak, and that he had been seized at that spot. There were the marks of many feet there, and some proofs of a slight scuffle. Blood, too, was to be traced on the leaves, from the foot of the oak, to the place where poor Pete was suspended; a proof that he had been hurt, previously to being abandoned to his cruel fate.|$|R
