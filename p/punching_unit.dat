50|$|IBM 533 or IBM 537 Card Read <b>Punch</b> <b>Unit</b> The IBM 533 had {{separate}} feeds {{for reading}} and punching; the IBM 537 had one feed, thus could read and then punch {{into the same}} card.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 056 {{verifier}} {{used most}} of the same mechanical and electrical components as the 024/026 keypunches {{with the exception of}} the <b>punch</b> <b>unit</b> and print head. The <b>punch</b> <b>unit</b> had sensing pins in place of the punches. The holes sensed or not sensed would trip a contact bail when the configuration was other than that entered by the verifier operator. This stopped the forward motion of the card, and presented a red error light on the machine cover. The notching mechanism was located in the area occupied by the print mechanism on a 026 printing keypunch. It had a solenoid which drove the notching mechanism, and another that selected the top notch punch or end of card punch.|$|R

It was also capable of selecting and following one of several sequences of instructions {{as a result of}} operations already performed, and it could store instructions for self-programmed operation. The Calculator consisted of a Type 605 Electronic Calculating Punch and a Type 412 or 418 Accounting Machine. A Type 941 Auxiliary Storage Unit was available as an optional feature. All units composing the Calculator were interconnected by flexible cables. If desired, the Type 412 or 418, with or without the Type 941, could be operated independently of the other machines. The Type 605 {{could be used as a}} Calculating Punch and the <b>punch</b> <b>unit</b> (Type 527) could be operated as an independent gang punch.|$|R

40|$|Packaging {{is gaining}} {{more and more}} {{importance}} for the marketing of products. Already in the early stage of development marketing-relevant considerations are taken into account, which decide over target groups and marketing strategies. For design analysis and the essential sampling of the packaging hitherto manufacturing possibilities were of insufficient quality (manual manufacturing, sample plotter) or verry cost-intensive (<b>punching</b> <b>units).</b> Both manufacturing options are no satisfying alternative from the user's point of view. At the stage of sampling and prototype production, {{as well as the}} individual production of small series, flexible systems are needed, which are capable of quick, cheap and most of all high quality manufacturing of even small series. In the context of this project concepts for manufacturing solutions with the water jet, which consider these requirements, are developed. Therefore, in a first step existing systems and techniques are evaluated. Based on the results, industry-specific hard and sofware concepts for the overall system are provided. This includes the concatenation of the system ant the technical integration of further necessary manufacturing processes (grooving, cutting and milling). With such a system new markets for small series production and sample production of cardboard packaging can be opened for the usually small and middle sized companies of equipment manufacturers. The users of the technology thus could increase their geometrical and logistic flexibility and improve the economy of small series especially...|$|R
5000|$|Characters {{were printed}} using a 5x7 dot matrix array of wires; the device {{from which it}} derived {{the shape of the}} {{character}} was a metal plate, called the [...] "code plate," [...] with space for 1960 pins (35 pins times 56 printable characters). If the dot was not to be printed in a given character, the pin was machined off. By correctly positioning the plate and pressing it against one end of the array of printing wires, only the correct wires were pressed against the ribbon and then the punched card. (This printer mechanism was generally considered by IBM Customer Engineers to be difficult to repair. One of the most common problems was wires breaking in the tightly curved narrow tube between the code plate and the ribbon - extracting the fragments and replacing the bundle of 35 wires was very tedious). The printing mechanism was prone to be damaged if a user attempted to duplicate [...] "binary" [...] cards with non-standard punch patterns. These could cause the code-plate positioning mechanism to try to shift the plate beyond its intended range of motion, sometimes causing damage. Turning off printing did not actually prevent the damage, as many people assumed, because the code-plate mechanism remained engaged with the <b>punch</b> <b>unit</b> and shifted the code plate. Turning off printing only suppressed pressing the printing pins into the ribbon and card.|$|R

Therefore, unlike GPS, there was not an immediate accurate location of the Geoceiver location. A Geoceiver was permanently located at the South Pole Station and operated by United States Geological Survey personnel. Since it was located on the surface of a moving ice sheet, its data was used to measure the ice sheet movement. Other Geoceivers were taken out in the field in Antarctica during the summer and were used to measure locations, for example the movement of the Ross Ice Shelf.|$|R

50|$|An IBM {{card sorter}} is a machine for sorting decks of punched {{cards in the}} format popularized by the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which {{dominated}} the punched card data processing industry {{for much of the}} twentieth century.

40|$|Background and Aims: Leaf {{mechanical}} properties, {{which are}} important to protect leaves against physical stresses, are thought to change with light and nutrient availabilities. This study aims to understand phenotypic changes of leaf mechanical properties with respect to dry mass allocation and anatomy. Methods: Leaf lamina strength (maximum force per unit area to fracture), toughness (work to fracture) and stiffness (resistance against deformation) were measured by punch-and-die tests, and anatomical and physiological traits were determined in Plantago major plants grown at different light and nutrient availabilities. A conceptual approach was developed by which punch strength and related carbon costs can be quantitatively related to the underlying anatomical and morphological traits: leaf thickness, dry-mass allocation to cell walls and cell-wall-specific strength. Key Results: Leaf lamina strength, toughness and stiffness (all expressed on a punch area basis) increased with light availability. By contrast, nutrient availability did not change strength or toughness, but stiffness was higher in low-nutrient plants. Punch strength (maximum force per <b>unit</b> <b>punch</b> area, Fmax/area) was analysed {{as the product of}} leaf mass per area (LMA) and Fmax/leaf mass (= punch strength/LMA, indicating mass-use efficiency for strength). The greater strength of sun leaves was mainly explained by their higher LMA. Shade leaves, by contrast, had a higher Fmax/leaf mass. This greater efficiency in shade leaves was caused by a greater fraction of leaf mass in cell walls and by a greater specific strength of cell walls. These differences are probably because epidermis cells constitute a relatively large fraction of the leaf cross-section in shaded leaves. Although a larger percentage of intercellular spaces were found in shade leaves, this in itself did not reduce 'material' strength (punch strength/thickness); it might, however, be important for increasing distance between upper and lower epidermis per unit mass and thus maintaining flexural stiffness at minimal costs. Conclusions: The consequences of a reduced LMA for punch strength in shaded leaves was partially compensated for by a mechanically more efficient design, which, it is suggested, contributes importantly to resisting mechanical stress under carbon-limited conditions. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of stone}} columns {{as a means}} of ground {{improvement}} has been in use for over 40 years in the United Kingdom and Europe. Their primary purpose is to reduce settlement, reduce consolidation time and increase the bearing capacity of soils. Currently the technique is applied to a variety of soil types, cohesive and granular. Soft cohesive soils have shown a tendency towards higher settlements due to the inability of the soil to restrain the lateral movement or bulging of stone columns. Current analytical design methods are based upon the unit concept which considers a stone column to be part of an infinite array of columns. Such methods have proved useful when designing large arrays such as those utilised beneath embankments or large rafts. Columns within the group are restrained equally on all sides and held in the same vertical stress conditions. However, at the edge of large (wide) load areas and in smaller foundation configurations columns are not generally restrained on all sides by other columns and must rely on the soil to provide restraint in the outward facing directions. The behaviour of small foundation configurations is more complex due to this lack of restraint with columns subject to deformation at lower stress levels than those in infinite arrays. This dissertation is concerned with the behaviour of stone columns and proposed composite stone columns installed in soft clay. This research compares the behaviour of small foundations supported by stone columns to behaviour within an infinite array of columns. Specifically the settlement and deformation behaviour of stone columns are considered to identify the main deformation mechanisms and to examine the effect of key design parameters and soft cohesive soils on column performance. A new form of composite stone column was then examined numerically to assess the potential for enhanced column behaviour and settlement reduction. PLAXIS 3 D Foundation is utilised with column behaviour represented by the Mohr-Coulomb Perfect Plasticity model and the Hardening Soil model adopted to model soil behaviour. The soft soil profile adopted in this research is the well characterised Bothkennar soft clay site which was formerly the UK geotechnical test bed. The influence of key stone column design parameters, area ratio, column length, column confinement and arrangement, column stiffness, column strength, installation effects and the effect of stiff crust thickness was examined for a combination of foundation types with 432 numerical sensitivity studies conducted. The results reveal that area ratio and column length {{have a significant impact on}} the settlement performance of stone columns. Increasing the area ratio was found to reduce the restraint provided by neighbouring columns leading to increased settlement. Increasing column length was found to reduce settlement. When columns were modelled with low area ratios increasing column length had a greater effect on settlement reduction than at higher ratios. The design parameters of area ratio and column length are established as the controlling parameters for the mode of deformation. The mode of deformation was examined utilising settlement inferred deformation ratios (compression and punching) with comparison to total shear strain plots and stress states in the column. Two primary modes of deformation, bulging and punching (including sub-type termed 'block failure') were inferred. Punching failure was inferred for short columns by high punching ratios and low compression ratios with a concentration of shear strain observed at the base of the floating columns. A sub-type of punching, block failure, was inferred from low compression and low punching ratios for closely spaced columns with low area ratios in which the columns act as one <b>unit</b> <b>punching</b> into the underlying soil. Bulging failure was inferred by low punching ratios and high compression ratios coupled with a concentration of shear strain in upper region of the columns. The magnitude of bulging was found to be at its most severe for high area ratios. Bulging as a mode of failure occurred for column length to diameter ratios greater than 4 and area ratios greater than 8. Bulging was found to occur at the weakest of the soil profile which coincides with the top of the lower Carse clay. Consideration was given to a method of reducing the potential for lateral column deformation or bulging by the use of a novel composite column. The deformational characteristics of a stone column were identified for a composite of granular and the experimental Protomix materials. Laboratory testing was carried out to gain an understanding of the cohesive, stiffness and unconfined compressive strength properties of the composite before simulation studies were performed on key design parameters such as area ratio, column length, column confinement and arrangement for a combination of foundation types with 108 numerical analysis sensitivities conducted. The inclusion of a cohesive 'binder' material in the bulging zone was found to reduce settlement for all foundation configurations. Similarly to stone columns area ratio and column length were found to be the design parameters which influenced the results most. The composite stone columns (CSC) offered higher settlement reduction than traditional stone columns (SC). It was discovered that CSC with an area ratio of 8 were able to achieve the same settlement improvement factor as those with a ratio of 3. 5 which suggests the columns could offer the same settlement control but with large column spacing's making their use more economical. The settlement inferred deformation ratios (compression and punching) were studied while monitoring the total shear strain field cross sections to examine if composite stone columns would behave similarly to a stone column. It was noted that the same modes of deformation of punching (including block failure) and bulging failure were observed. The increased stiffness in the bulging zone saw the transfer of bulging type effects to a depth below the composite treated zone. It was only observed for high area ratios. The improved settlement behaviour of CSC compared to SC is due to the treatment of the bulging zone by CSC and improved column restraint at depth provided by the soil. Punching failure was found to have a higher magnitude and occur to a deeper depth of 3. 6 m compared to SC depth of 2. 4 m due to the addition of the composite material. The modes of deformation observed for SC were also observed for the new novel CSC columns. This suggests that the same type of foundations can be used and so avoid the need for reinforcement of the foundations as used with piled foundations...|$|R
