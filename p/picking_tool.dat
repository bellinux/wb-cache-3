40|$|This thesis {{has treated}} a three-axis robot which {{task is to}} serve a larger test machine tomove the modules to be tested, from the storage to the test site. The robot is {{composed}} ofthree linear actuators; two standard components of ball screw type and a custom-builtactuator of trapezoidal type. The work has mainly focused on the custom-built device to seeif it could be replaced with a standard component. Part of the work has been to look into thepicking tool and {{to see if there}} are any possibilities to improve its function. The report presents two different proposals which I decided to call Robot 1 and Robot 2 andthey aim to address the problems arising in the purpose-built linear unit and the X-axislinearity problems. Robot 1 focuses on eliminating the problems that arise around therobot's X-axis, with such simple means as possible and without making excessive materialchanges. The idea behind the solution of Robot 1 is also to be able to apply it onto existingmachinery without too much interference. Robot 2 is significantly more advanced and alsoimplies considerable material changes. The advantage of Robot 2 is that it takes into accountboth the problems with the X-axis and Y-axis, and should absolutely be considered on newmachines, but also for existing machines. For the <b>picking</b> <b>tool</b> the thesis presents the solutionin the form of both a modified existing vacuum tool and a brand new pneumatic gripper forRobot 2 which differ from the vacuum system. I think that the vacuum tool presented shouldbe considered to be implemented even if no other modifications are made on the robotbecause of its simple construction. The thesis presents the functions and problems with the current robot and its <b>picking</b> <b>tool.</b> For the described problems the different solutions have been presented, partly by findingcompletely new market components but also through new self-designed components. During this time, choices of materials and material dimensions have been based onoverestimates and previous material selections, which later were controlled by using FEManalysisin CAD-environment. The work is considered to have gone well and the goals that have been set have beenachieved in a satisfactory manner...|$|E
40|$|Order pickers and {{individual}} {{differences between them}} could have a substantial impact on picking performance, but are largely ignored in studies on order picking. This paper explores the role of individual differences in picking performance with various picking tools (pick by voice, RF-terminal picking and pick to light) and methods (parallel, zone and dynamic zone picking). A unique realistic field experiment with 101 participants (academic students, vocational students and professional pickers) is employed to investigate the influence of individual differences, especially the Big Five personality traits, on picking performance in terms of productivity and quality. The results suggest that (PbV) performs better than RF-terminal picking, and that Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conscientiousness {{and the age of}} the picker {{play a significant role in}} predicting picking performance with voice and RF-terminals. Furthermore, achieving higher productivity appears to be possible without sacrificing quality. Managers can increase picking performance by incorporating the insights in assigning the right pickers to work with a particular <b>picking</b> <b>tool</b> or method, leading to increased picking performance and reduced warehousing costs...|$|E

40|$|Stereotomography {{is a new}} {{velocity}} estimation method. This tomographic approach aims at retrieving subsurface velocities from prestack seismic data. In addi-tion to traveltimes, {{the slope}} of locally coherent events are picked simultaneously in common offset, common source, common receiver, and common midpoint gath-ers. As the picking is realized on locally coherent events, {{they do not need}} to be interpreted in terms of reflec-tion on given interfaces, but may represent diffractions or reflections from anywhere in the image. In the high-frequency approximation, each one of these events cor-responds to a ray trajectory in the subsurface. Stereoto-mography consists of picking and analyzing these events to update both the associated ray paths and velocity model. In this paper, we describe the implementation of two critical features needed to put stereotomogra-phy into practice: an automatic <b>picking</b> <b>tool</b> and a robust multiscale iterative inversion technique. Applications to 2 D reflection seismic are presented on synthetic data and on a 2 D line extracted from a 3 D towed streamer survey shot in West Africa for TotalFinaElf. The exam-ples demonstrate that the method requires only minor human intervention and rapidly converges to a geologi-cally plausible velocity model in these two very different and complex velocity regimes. The quality of the velocity models is verified by prestack depth migration results...|$|E
40|$|Background: Picking {{images of}} {{particles}} in cryo-electron micrographs {{is an important}} step in solving the 3 D structures of large macromolecular assemblies. However, in order to achieve sub-nanometre resolution it is often necessary to capture and process many thousands or even several millions of 2 D particle images. Thus, a computational bottleneck in reaching high resolution is the accurate and automatic picking of particles from raw cryo-electron micrographs. Results: We have developed “gEMpicker”, a highly parallel correlation-based particle <b>picking</b> <b>tool.</b> To our knowledge, gEMpicker is the first particle picking program to use multiple graphics processor units (GPUs) to accelerate the calculation. When tested on the publicly available keyhole limpet hemocyanin dataset, we find that gEMpicker gives similar results to the FindEM program. However, compared to calculating correlations on one core of a contemporary central processor unit (CPU), running gEMpicker on a modern GPU gives a speed-up of about 27 x. To achieve even higher processing speeds, the basic correlation calculations are accelerated considerably by using a hierarchy of parallel programming techniques to distribute the calculation over multiple GPUs and CPU cores attached to multiple nodes of a computer cluster. By using a theoretically optimal reduction algorithm to collect and combine the cluster calculation results, the speed of the overall calculation scales almost linearly with the number of cluster nodes available. 1 Conclusions: The very high picking throughput that is now possible using GPU-powered workstations or computer clusters will help experimentalists to achieve higher resolution 3 D reconstructions more rapidly than before...|$|E

40|$|In the past, mass {{spectrometry}} {{research has focused}} strongly {{on the study of}} peptides, proteins and other positive mode analytes. Negative ion mode research, particularly oligonucleotide research, has been somewhat neglected over the past two decades, largely due to their propensity for forming salt adducts and complex fragmentation pathways. However, the work in this thesis has focused on the use of negative ion {{mass spectrometry}} and ion mobility spectrometry for the characterisation of short, therapeutic-like RNA sequences. nESI-MS/MS-IMS-MS, a novel and robust method for the sequencing of oligonucleotides up to 35 nucleotides in length, is presented. This method utilises IMS separations to de-convolute the complex spectra produced by the fragmentation of oligonucleotides. nESI-MS/MS-IMS-MS has the potential for effective automation of oligonucleotide sequencing, from sample acquisition to final output of sequence. An early version of the program OSeq, a peak <b>picking</b> <b>tool</b> for oligonucleotide MS/MS spectra, is also presented, and is shown to be directly compatible with nESI-MS/MS-IMS-MS data. Oligonucleotide secondary structure is also examined in this thesis, using nESI-IMS-MS. The secondary structures of eight sequences were studied by CD, PAGE and nESI-IMS-MS, with the aim of determining the effectiveness of IMS for the separation of oligonucleotides based upon their secondary structures. Separation of the oligonucleotides was not achieved by IMS; however, evidence is presented for the persistence of structure in the gas-phase. Additionally, mass spectrometry was used to support research into the viruses, hepatitis B and MS 2 bacteriophage. Protein and RNA stoichiometries were examined for the hepatitis B hPOL domain. An accurate mass was determined for a 172 nucleotide RNA, and nESI-IMS-MS was utilised for the de-convolution of an amphipol-swamped spectrum for the hPOL subunit, TP. The binding stoichiometry of RNA and two small molecules was examined by nESI-MS, with a view to unravelling MS 2 capsid assembly inhibition. Mitoxantrone was shown to bind readily to RNA, and binding was increased by the presence of an adenine bulge in the RNA stem-loop, TR. ...|$|E
