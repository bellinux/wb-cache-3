The 'LH' {{stands for}} [...] "Luftmasse-Hitzdraht" [...] - the hotwire anemometer technology {{used to determine}} the mass of air into the engine. This air mass meter is called HLM2 (Hitzdraht-LuftMassenmesser 2) by Bosch. The LH-Jetronic was mostly used by Scandinavian car manufacturers, and by sports and luxury cars produced in small quantities, such as Porsche 928. The most common variants are LH 2.2, which uses an Intel 8049 (MCS-48) microcontroller, and usually a 4 kB <b>programme</b> <b>memory,</b> and LH 2.4, which uses a Siemens 80535 microcontroller (a variant of Intel's 8051/MCS-51 architecture) and 32 kB <b>programme</b> <b>memory</b> based on the 27C256 chip. LH-Jetronic 2.4 has adaptive lambda control, and support for a variety of advanced features; including fuel enrichment based on exhaust gas temperature (ex. Volvo B204GT/B204FT engines). Some later (post-1995) versions contain hardware support for first generation diagnostics according to ISO 9141 (a.k.a. OBD-II) and immobiliser functions.|$|E

40|$|The Disadvantaged Schools Programme (DSP) is the longest-running Commonwealth equity {{programme}} in Australian schooling. It provides extra {{funds to}} those schools serving the poorest students. Initially, the paper traces {{developments in the}} programme {{since its inception in}} 1974 against a backdrop of changing political contexts, from the Keynesian progressivism of Whitlam through the post-Keynesian corporate managerialism and 2 ̆ 7 national 2 ̆ 7 approaches in schooling of the Hawke and Keating Labour governments. The main focus of the paper is on the likely impact of changes to Commonwealth schools programmes introduced by the Howard Coalition government, whereby the DSP has been regrouped as a literacy programme and accountability requirements on the states have been considerably weakened, with the states given the option to 2 ̆ 7 broadband 2 ̆ 7 the programme with English as a Second Language (General Support) and Early Literacy. Simultaneous with these changes have been the moves by all the state systems of schooling towards school-based management. The paper evaluates the likely impact of both the Commonwealth and state level changes on the DSP and documents the potential dangers to the programme, particularly the loss of <b>programme</b> <b>memory,</b> the abdication of system responsibility for the education of all students, the reification of literacy as the only educational problem, and the return of the individual deficit explanation for the links between socio-economic background and school performance...|$|E
40|$|Preservation of {{national}} cultural heritage has been {{during the last}} years actively discussed both on institutional and state levels. In October 2003 the working group on digital preservation by theMinistry of Culture elaborated preservation guidelines Strategy of digital preservation of Estonian cultural heritage for years 2004 – 2007. The strategy {{is based on the}} principles of eEurope 2002 Action Plan (2000) and Lund Principles (2001). The state strategy is aimed to achieve collaboration of different memory institutions in order to elaborate an unified view on cultural heritage and its digitisation as well as to preservation of digitally created cultural heritage. It is also important to guarantee preservation of cultural heritage and to make it accessible to the public use through the contemporary possibilities of informationand communication technologies. Digitisation and preservation of digitized heritage will be coordinated by the state. The main coordinators are the Ministry of Culture, The Ministry of Educationand Science, the State Chancellery and the National Archive. The methodology of decision making for digital preservation is based on the principles of the UNESCO <b>programme</b> <b>Memory</b> of the World. The choice of objects for digitisation is based on need and expediency that can be evaluated on the ground of acultural value of an object, conservation risks, physical condition of an object and necessity of use. In 2004 – 2005 metadata requirements for digital preservation were elaborated. The guidelines foresee that digitized objects will be described by four categories of metadata: administrative andtechnical metadata, metadata on access inhibitors and restrictions of use and descriptive metadata. Estonian documentary heritage is located today in different memory institutions: in state or public institutions like archives, libraries and museums, in private possession, in religious and scientific institutions and in possession of the third sector (different organisations). For reasons of the historical development considerable part of documentary heritage is also located outside Estonia (Sweden, USA, Canada, Australia, Russia etc). The projects of red books as well as different digitisation projects have been in practice for some years in all Estonian memory institutions. Libraries are pioneers in initiating collaborationprojects in digitisation. Due to the joint efforts of the National Library, the Archive Library of the Estonian Literature Museum and the Tallinn University Academic Library a big collection of old Estonian newspapers is available by internet. The project is titled DEA (Digitized Estonian Newspapers). The aim of the project Red Book of Estonian publications, 1535 – 1850 was to create a theoretical basis for elaborating criteria that would enable decision making and determination preservation priorities of the Estonian book heritage. At the moment there is not much collaboration between different types of memory institutions. The joint projects like DEA and Red Bookof Estonian Publications give hope that together difficult problems of preservation can be better solved and users will get better access to Estonian cultural heritage...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis evaluates a <b>memory</b> <b>programme</b> (N = 5) that was specifically designed for middle-aged individuals. A preliminary online survey (N = 409) examined the theory of Selective Optimisation with Compensation (SOC) {{in the context of}} everyday memory. The survey informed some aspects of the <b>memory</b> <b>programme</b> by examining the relationships between cognitive failures, memory compensation efforts, and control beliefs. Results indicated that SOC endorsement accounted for a significant reduction in everyday cognitive failures (i. e., forgetfulness, distractibility, and false triggering) and a higher sense of memory control. The beneficial effects of memory control beliefs were partially mediated by SOC endorsement. Counter to expectations, SOC endorsement did not affect the forgetfulness/memory compensation relationship. The Midlife <b>Memory</b> <b>Programme,</b> containing four treatment components (i. e., goal pursuit, memory and ageing education, strategy training, and group discussions), was evaluated by a before/after design with a three month follow-up.

40|$|In recent decades, {{transitional}} justice has {{featured on the}} political agenda of many post-authoritarian states. In Myanmar, where a partial but palpable transition is currently taking place, accounting for a dark past and securing a democratic future are key demands of opposition groups. However, elite-led reforms implemented after a March 2011 switch to quasi-civilian rule pay little attention to justice. This article thus surveys the possibilities for {{transitional justice}} in Myanmar, highlighting six major options: criminal prosecutions, a truth commission, a lustration programme, a reparations <b>programme,</b> a <b>memory</b> project and symbolic measures. Procedurally, the paper argues for local leadership supported by external engagement designed to ensure that basic global standards are met. Substantively, it explores tensions within transitional justice and across the wider reform process when such an agenda is pursued. To close, it holds that, while transitional justice may take years to gain a secure foothold in Myanmar, robust foundations should be laid now...|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{autoimmune}} diseases (SADs) are a {{group of}} connective tissue diseases with diverse, yet overlapping, symptoms and autoantibody development. The etiology behind SADs is not fully elucidated, {{but a number of}} genetic and environmental factors are known to influence the incidence of SADs. Recent findings link dysregulation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with SAD development. EBV causes a persistent infection with a tight latency <b>programme</b> in <b>memory</b> B-cells, which enables evasion of the immune defence. A number of immune escape mechanisms and immune-modulating proteins have been described for EBV. These immune modulating functions make EBV a good candidate for initiation of autoimmune diseases and exacerbation of disease progression. This review focuses on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) and sum up the existing data linking EBV with these diseases including elevated titres of EBV antibodies, reduced T-cell defence against EBV, and elevated EBV viral load. Together, these data suggest that uncontrolled EBV infection can develop diverse autoreactivities in genetic susceptible individuals with different manifestations depending on the genetic background and the site of reactivation...|$|R

METHODS: Rehabilitation included training of storage and processing components of verbal working memory. Outcome was assessed with specific working memory tests, non-specific tasks requiring working memory, non-target tasks not requiring working memory and questionnaires addressing daily-life functioning. This assessment was performed twice before the experimental therapy and once after. RESULTS: Cognitive measures were stable before therapy. A statistically significant improvement was found for target measures and for daily-life skills. In contrast, no change was found on non-target tasks. CONCLUSION: Improvement was not apparently related to spontaneous recovery, since performance was stable before therapy.

LTLE patients were seen either before surgery or 3 – 6 months after their operation. Improvements in verbal memory were observed in both groups. An effect of brain training was recorded but this did not occur in a consistent direction. Subjective ratings of memory indicated improvements that were significant for the LTLE group but not the controls. Positive changes in the memory outcome measures were associated with improvements in mood. Pre-operative memory rehabilitation was not associated with better outcomes than post-operative intervention.

Holding information about manipulable objects in working memory activated the left ventral premotor cortex and the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). Conversely, non-manipulable objects to be held in working memory co-activated Broca's area and the left angular gyrus. When contrasted directly, manipulable relative to non-manipulable objects activated the left ventral premotor cortex and the anterior intraparietal sulcus, a circuitry that is assumed to mediate the transformation of movement-relevant object properties into hand actions. These results indicate that visual working memory for manipulable objects is based on motor programmes associated with their use.
