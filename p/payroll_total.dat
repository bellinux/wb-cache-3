40|$|The Social Security Scheme was {{launched}} in 1990, covering formal sector private employees for non-work related sickness, maternity and invalidity including cash benefits and funeral grants. The scheme is financed by tripartite contributions from government, employers and employees, each of 1. 5 % of <b>payroll</b> (<b>total</b> of 4. 5 %). The scheme decided to pay health care providers, whether public or private, on a flat rate capitation basis to cover both ambulatory and inpatient care. Registration of the insured with a contractor hospital was a necessary consequence of the chosen capitation payment system. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the operation of the scheme, and to explore the implications of capitation payment and registration for utilisation levels and provider behaviour. A key weakness of the scheme's design is suggested to be the initial decision to give employers not employees the responsibility for choosing the registered hospitals. This was done for administrative reasons, but it contributed to low levels of use of the contractor hospitals. In addition, low levels of use were also probably the result of the potential for cream skimming, cost shifting from inpatient to ambulatory care and under-provision of patient care, though since monitoring mechanisms by the Social Security Office were weak, these effects are difficult to detect conclusively. Mechanisms to improve utilisation levels were gradually introduced, such as employee choice of registered hospitals and the formation of sub-contractor networks to improve access to care. A beneficial effect of the capitation payment system was that the Social Security Fund generated substantial reserves and expenditures on sickness benefits were well stabilised. The paper ends by recommending that future policy amendments should be guided by research and empirical findings and that tougher monitoring and enforcement of quality of care standards are required.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes expense preference {{behavior by}} managers of Nevada casinos. Annual aggregate data is {{obtained from the}} Nevada Gaming Control Board from 1990 to 2010. Using ordinary least squares regression, three models are run to account for various payroll related expenses. The dependent variable in the first model is number of employees. The second model uses salaries and wages {{as the dependent variable}} and the third model uses <b>total</b> <b>payroll.</b> All models include predictor variables of total revenue as an indication of size, a dummy variable for market concentration and a dummy variable for recessionary periods. The finding show that larger casinos spend more in payroll related expenses. Results indicate that for each 1 % increase in revenue, number of employees increases 0. 84 %, salaries and wages increase 0. 96 % and <b>total</b> <b>payroll</b> increases 0. 99 %. The significant positive relationship between revenue and payroll related expense may be an indication of expense preference behavior by managers since larger firms typically have more layers of management. The additional layers also cause a separation between owners and managers and the more layers, the more separation. The market share variable is nonsignificant in all three models. The recession variable was significant and negative in all models. During recessionary periods, Nevada casinos decrease number of employees 35. 5 %, salaries and wages 7. 7 % and <b>total</b> <b>payroll</b> 5. 2 %. The negative significant relationship between the recession variable and payroll related expenses may also be an indication of expense preference behavior by Nevada casino managers during non-recessionary periods. Since managers are able to decrease payroll related expense after controlling for the change in business volumes, they are most likely operating inefficiently during non-recessionary periods...|$|R

The study was cross-sectional and utilized a general linear mixed model with the multinomial distribution specification for data analysis. We verified the results by also running a multinomial logistic regression model. To measure our variables, we used data from (1) the 2007 American Hospital Association (AHA) electronic health record implementation survey, (2) the 2006 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Cost Reports, and (3) the 2006 AHA Annual Survey containing organizational and operational data. Our dependent variable was an ordinal variable with three levels used to indicate the extent of EHR adoption by hospitals. Our independent variables were five financial ratios: (1) net days revenue in accounts receivable, (2) total margin, (3) the equity multiplier, (4) total asset turnover, and (5) the ratio of <b>total</b> <b>payroll</b> to <b>total</b> expenses. For control variables, we used (1) bed size, (2) ownership type, (3) teaching affiliation, (4) system membership, (5) network participation, (6) full time equivalent nurses per adjusted average daily census, (7) average daily census per staffed bed, (8) Medicare patients percentage, (9) Medicaid patients percentage, (10) capitation-based reimbursement, and (11) non-concentrated market. Only liquidity was significant and positively associated with EHR adoption. Asset turnover ratio was significant but, unexpectedly, was negatively associated with EHR adoption. However, many control variables, most notably bed size, showed significant positive associations with EHR adoption. Thus, it seems that hospitals adopt EHRs as a strategic move to better align themselves with their environment...|$|R

As usual, industrial minerals accounted for the bulk of the state's mineral wealth, with stone and sand and gravel representing near-ly 69 percent of the total. The vast increase in production value resulted primarily from the mining of increased quantities of rawmat~rials, plussmall increases in the unit values of the commodities. The low values placed on. stone ($ 1. 20 per ton) and sand and gravel ($ 1. 22 per ton) in the U. S.

Oregon's mineral industry permeates every segment of the state, and contributes importantly to the local economies of many counties.

40|$|This paper extends {{earlier work}} by {{updating}} {{the structure and}} policy parameters of payroll taxes in Canada. Drawing from a newly available dataset, it also reports trends on the level, growth and role of each component of these taxes in recent years. Finally, it compares Canadian payroll taxes {{to those of the}} world's leading developed countries. The following highlights the main findings. Payroll taxes in Canada have grown considerably since the early 1980 s, constituting an increasingly important source of revenues for both the federal and provincial governments. However, the rapid expansion observed in earlier years has in large part slowed down in the early 1990 s. Payroll tax revenues collected from employees and employers in the country have stabilized at around 5. 7 % of GDP or 14. 0 % of total federal and provincial government revenues since 1992; the effective <b>total</b> <b>payroll</b> tax rate has levelled off at around $ 12. 20 for every $ 100 of wages and salaries since 1994. The structure, level, growth, and role of each component of payroll taxes vary considerably from one province to another. Yet, EI premiums have remarkably been the largest component of these taxes in every province in both the 1980 s and the 1990 s, regardless of whether there are provincial payroll taxes; rising EI premiums have also consistently been the leading contributor to the expansion of <b>total</b> <b>payroll</b> taxes during this period. Despite rapid growth in the 1980 s and early 1990 s, Canadian payroll taxes remain one of the lowest in the world's major developed economies. According to data compiled by the OECD, <b>total</b> <b>payroll</b> tax revenues in Canada amounted to 6. 0 % of GDP in 1996 [...] - that is 14 % lower than that of the United States (at 7. 0 % of GDP); the lowest in the G 7 nations; and the 9 th lowest among the 29 OECD member states.
