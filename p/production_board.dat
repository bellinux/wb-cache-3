5|$|Following the storm, {{residents}} were warned to boil their water and be cautious of potential food contamination due to electrical outages. The War <b>Production</b> <b>Board</b> regional office in Dallas offered {{relief to the}} victims of the storm. In La Porte, a makeshift hospital was set up in city hall. At Point Bolivar, where nearly all houses were destroyed, the now-destitute {{residents were}} transported by the Galveston chapter of the American Red Cross to Galveston for housing.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, the Manhattan Project {{employed}} some 129,000 workers, of whom 84,500 were construction workers, 40,500 were plant {{operators and}} 1,800 were military personnel. As construction activity fell off, the workforce declined to 100,000 a year later, {{but the number}} of military personnel increased to 5,600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult. In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the War Manpower Commission. In March 1944, both the War <b>Production</b> <b>Board</b> and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their highest priority.|$|E

5|$|The Bolling Commission (also {{known as}} the Bolling Mission and named after Colonel Raynal Bolling, {{the head of the}} mission) was an {{aeronautical}} commission sent to Europe on behalf of the Aircraft <b>Production</b> <b>Board</b> of the Council of National Defense. Dodd was assigned to the mission, after being replaced as Aviation Officer. His assignment was to evaluate aircraft for use by the AEF, specifically for reconnaissance purposes. Dodd evaluated French aircraft and favored adopting the Salmson two-seater for reconnaissance work. Eventually 705 Salmsons were purchased for the Air Service; of these 557 saw front-line service.|$|E
5|$|The War <b>Production</b> <b>Board</b> {{was asked}} to keep stores in Oak Ridge {{well-stocked}} {{in order to reduce}} absenteeism among the workers. When shortages occurred, the relatively well-paid Oak Ridge residents bought up scarce goods in surrounding areas. In both cases, they attracted the ire of their residents. Personnel employed by the Manhattan District were not exempted from being drafted under the Selective Service System. Efforts were made to employ draft-exempt personnel, and deferments were requested only for critical personnel, mainly young scientists and technicians.|$|E
5|$|Groves made {{critical}} {{decisions on}} prioritizing the various methods of isotope separation and acquiring raw materials {{needed by the}} scientists and engineers. By the time he assumed command of the project, {{it was evident that}} the AA-3 priority rating that Marshall had obtained was insufficient. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide an AAA rating on request for critical materials to remove bottlenecks. Groves went to Donald M. Nelson, the chairman of the War <b>Production</b> <b>Board</b> and, after threatening to take the matter to the President, obtained a AAA priority for the Manhattan project. It was agreed that the AA-3 priority would still be used where possible.|$|E

5|$|The rebooted 1975 {{version of}} Philaletheis, as a {{committee}} of the SGA, was governed by the SGA's president. Membership was by application for all positions. Once the organization split from student government, it was run by a seven-member board and accepted proposals for shows, ranging from musicals to one-act plays. Recently, the Society has accepted proposals for shows {{at the beginning of}} every semester, then the <b>production</b> <b>board</b> has voted on which shows to produce. Each production then holds its own auditions for actors, with no experience required. Directors seeking to produce a full-length show must first direct a shorter directing workshop, usually a scene running 15 minutes or shorter. Directing workshops occur twice a year, early in fall and spring semesters. For the 2015 fiscal year, the group's budget was $12,000.|$|E
5|$|MD 704 {{follows the}} {{abandoned}} {{right of way}} of the defunct WB Railway, an interurban railroad that included a northsouth line between Washington and Baltimore and a branch to Annapolis from Naval Academy Junction in Odenton. Construction on the electric railway began in 1902 and service began between the three cities in 1908. The WB went into receivership in 1931 and shut down in 1935. The Maryland State Roads Commission converted the abandoned railroad right of way into a two-lane highway from the District of Columbia line to US 50 (now MD 450) near Lanham between 1942 and 1944. The WB {{had a pair of}} timber bridges across its right of way. The Chapel Road bridge in Seat Pleasant, which carried what was then MD 389 and is now Addison Road across the railroad, was removed; the junction was regraded as an intersection with the new highway. In 1944, the War <b>Production</b> <b>Board</b> authorized the replacement of MD 202's bridge across the abandoned railroad {{as one of the few}} nonwar-effort highway projects federally funded during World War II. Construction on the new steel-and-concrete bridge began in late 1944 and was completed by 1946. Access between the grade-separated highways at the MD 202MD 704 junction was via a pair of two-way ramps.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1937, Danville {{resident}} Emma Weisiger {{donated the}} land that comprises Constitution Square Historic Site to the Commonwealth of Kentucky in memory of her brother, John. The state made the land into a state park; it was originally called Old Public Square, then Constitutional Square. Using a combination {{of state and local}} funds, the Danville Chamber of Commerce and the local chapter of the American Legion began constructing replicas of the jail, courthouse, and meetinghouse that originally occupied the square. At the time of the park's dedication on April 20, 1942, it was dubbed the John G. Weisiger Memorial State Park. Later, the name was changed to Constitution Square State Shrine. At the time of the dedication ceremony, all non-essential construction projects in the U.S. had been halted by the War <b>Production</b> <b>Board</b> due to the country's entry into World War II, and renovations to the park's attractions had consequently ceased. Dedication speeches by Governor Keen Johnson and Centre College president Robert L. McLeod, Jr. contained reminders of the ongoing war and praise for the ideals of democracy. In addition, a plaque honoring the framers of the first Kentucky Constitution was dedicated by Louisville judge Lafon Allen and unveiled by Johnson's daughter, Judith, and Louise McDowell, a descendent of Judge Samuel McDowell, who presided over all ten constitutional conventions {{that took place in the}} original Constitution Square courthouse.|$|E

5|$|The {{enhanced}} {{police presence}} {{throughout the city}} during the strike helped to keep the calm, and the restrained approach of the police officers generally won praise from all sides, {{even though many of}} the policemen were seen as sympathetic to the striking white workers. The administration of Philadelphia's Republican mayor Bernard Samuel was also seen as quietly sympathetic to the strikers. Throughout the strike, Mayor Samuel, who was {{also a member of the}} PTC board of directors, avoided any attempts of mediation. He refused to call a meeting of the PTC board of directors or to discuss the crisis with the TWU leaders. The mayor denied police protection to the two TWU officials who were willing to travel throughout the city and advocate an end to the strike. Samuel also refused to grant air time to War <b>Production</b> <b>Board</b> representatives who wanted to make a radio plea to end the strike. On August 2, the mayor declined, without an explanation, the NAACP request for permission to send two sound-trucks into black neighborhoods to broadcast appeals for calm. The city's black population felt disappointed and disenchanted with the actions of the local administration.|$|E

50|$|Also {{during the}} war years, Bailey started Westernlore Press to reprint classic texts on the Western United States, whose rarity {{prevented}} most interested libraries from purchasing copies.

The books published by Westernlore—on the same presses used by the 'Advertiser'--were immediate successes and every edition sold out.|$|R
5000|$|The {{answer to}} this problem was {{answered}} by the Lima Locomotive Works in October 1943, when they delivered eight new dual service 4-8-4 locomotives. The engines were nicknamed [...] "Big Apples" [...] by engine crews on {{the western end of}} the railroad. Locomotive numbers were 451-458. Because of the War <b>Production</b> <b>Board’s</b> restriction on designing new engines, they were patterned after the Southern Pacific GS-2 type 4-8-4s.|$|R

25|$|Many {{controls}} {{were put on}} the economy. The most important were price controls, imposed on most products and monitored by the Office of Price Administration. Wages were also controlled. Corporations dealt with numerous agencies, especially the War <b>Production</b> <b>Board</b> (WPB), and the War and Navy departments, which had the purchasing power and priorities that largely reshaped and expanded industrial production.|$|E

Encouraged by this success, Butzner petitioned the War <b>Production</b> <b>Board</b> to support more operations in Scranton.
