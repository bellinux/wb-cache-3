40|$|The European Commission Regulations No 692 / 2008 and No 715 / 2007 set the {{regulatory}} framework for type-approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 / 6). One of the applicable tests is the low temperature emission test (Type VI), which is conducted at sub-ambient temperature conditions (- 7 °C). The low temperature emission test is currently required only for vehicles with <b>positive</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines.</b> However the Type VI test to diesel vehicles is under consideration, {{mainly because of the}} introduction of the new technologies in diesel engines in order to comply with the Euro 5 / 6 emission standards, of which the efficiency in controlling emission may strongly depend on the ambient temperature. This is especially true for Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems and after-treatment systems for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) that are deactivated or not operate in cold weather conditions, may result in elevated NOx emissions. The review should consider whether to extend the low temperature emission test to Euro 6 diesel vehicles and whether emission limit should be introduced in the future. This report provides a picture of the low temperature emission performances of late technology diesel vehicles The main results of the experimental activity carried out at JRC to investigate the behaviour at low temperature of Euro 5 / 6 diesel passenger cars are summarised and discussed.

40|$|Performance of {{the spark}} <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> may be {{increased}} by changing the geometrical compression ratio according {{to the amount of}} charging in cylinders. The designed geometrical compression ratio can be realized as an effective compression ratio under the full load and full open throttle conditions since the effective compression ratio changes with the amount of charging into the cylinder in spark <b>ignition</b> <b>engines.</b> So, this condition of the spark <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> forces designers to change their geometrical compression ratio according to the amount of charging into the cylinder for improvement of performance and fuel economy. In order to improve the combustion efficiency, fuel economy, power output, exhaust emissions at partial loads, compression ratio must be increased; but, under high load and low speed conditions to prevent probable knock and hard running the compression ratio must be decreased gradually.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{combustion}} and emission characteristics under various equivalence ratio up to stoichiometric condition were experimentally investigated in a Cl (compression <b>ignition)</b> <b>engine.</b> In order {{to control the}} equivalence ratio, the O- 2 mole fraction of intake gas was reduced from 21 to 11. 16 % by adding only N- 2 to intake gas while the injected fuel quantity was held constant. The test was used a single-cylinder compression <b>ignition</b> (Cl) <b>engine</b> with a displacement volume of 373. 3 cc, a compression ratio of 17. 8, a re-entrant type piston-bowl. The emission measurement instruments consisted of emission bench (MEXA- 9100 D, HORIBA) and smoke meter (AVL- 415 S, AVL). In the result, the maximum IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure) and fuel conversion efficiency gradually decreased when the equivalence ratio was richer. In particular, the stoichiometric condition (i. e. 1. 0 equivalence ratio) had around 15 % and 11 % losses, respectively. The stoichiometric diesel combustion had a <b>positive</b> <b>ignition</b> dwell over the whole operating condition, leading to {{a large amount of}} THC (total hydrocarbons) and CO emission. Especially, the level of IS (indicated specific) -soot for stoichiometric combustion is significantly higher than the maximum level of IS-soot under the same operating condition without reduced O- 2 mole fraction.
