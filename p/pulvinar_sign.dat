40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) {{is a rare}} but {{important}} cause of dementia and death in young patients and is causally linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Symmetrical hyperintensity in the pulvinar (posterior) nuclei of the thalamus (<b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign)</b> on brain MR images {{was described as a}} specific, noninvasive, diagnostic sign of vCJD in a previous small series. This purpose of this larger study was to evaluate this sign prospectively and further define the MR imaging characteristics of vCJD. METHODS: As part of the ongoing surveillance program in the United Kingdom, MR images of suspected cases of vCJD were collected during a 6 -year period. All available images were assessed prospectively by one observer for the presence of the <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign.</b> Images of neuropathologically confirmed cases were then assessed independently by two neuroradiologists for the degree of hyperintensity of the pulvinar on images of different MR sequences, and for the presence of abnormal hyperintensity {{in other areas of the}} brain. Discrepancies were reviewed jointly and a consensus opinion formed. RESULTS: Prospective analysis identified the <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign</b> in 74 of 82 cases of vCJD. In the retrospective study, the <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign,</b> as defined by hyperintensity of the pulvinar relative to th...|$|E
30|$|Originally {{thought to}} be {{pathognomonic}} of the disease, its role has been widely reconsidered in recent years. Its real incidence has been recently settled in around 3 % of FD cases, with a clear predilection for males with impaired renal function [29], while a positive <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign</b> has been only anecdotally reported in female FD patients [58]. In this minority of cases, the <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign</b> {{could be interpreted as}} a neuroradiological epiphenomenon of a long-term accumulation of undegraded metabolites, whose systemic manifestations gradually appear during the years. In addition to the low incidence, its specificity was also reconsidered, {{with a wide range of}} different conditions in which a spontaneous thalamic T 1 -weighted hyperintensity is present [59, 60]. All these pieces of evidence, taken together, lead to the conclusion that the <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign</b> should no longer be recognised as a neuroradiological finding characteristic of FD, considering its low incidence and specificity.|$|E
30|$|The <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign</b> (symmetrical hyperintensity in the {{posterior}} thalamic nuclei on DWI or T 2 WI), “hockey stick” sign (signal changes affecting the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei) or similar {{changes in the}} periaqueductal grey matter were reported to be specific for variant (vCJD) [67], but can also occur, although less frequently, in sporadic (sCJD).|$|E
40|$|Young onset {{dementia}} is a challenge. We {{describe a}} case, where a patient presented with psychosis, dementia and MRI showing <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign,</b> {{all of this}} typical of variant Cruetzfelt Jacob disease (CJD). Subsequent investigations lead to the diagnosis of a treatable illness and patient was improved and MRI sign reversed, underlining again the importance of search needed for treatable diseases in any "typical" case of fatal illness...|$|E
30|$|Long {{considered}} a common neuroradiological finding in FD [55], the <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign</b> {{is defined as}} a selective signal alteration of the lateral aspect of thalamic pulvinar nucleus on MRI, presenting with symmetric or asymmetric hyperintensity on unenhanced T 1 -weighted brain MRI. It can also be observed as a susceptibility-induced hypointense area on T 2 *-weighted images, which corresponds to an increased attenuation indicating calcifications on CT scans [27, 28]. Its pathogenesis is still unclear, although the hypothesis of subtle dystrophic calcifications caused by chronic hypoperfusion secondary to microvascular alterations is to date the most accepted [11, 28, 56, 57].|$|E
30|$|The use of qMRI {{techniques}} {{allows for}} a quantitative assessment of brain tissue relaxometry parameters and magnetic susceptibility, measuring physical parameters intrinsically related to tissue microstructure and allowing for an accurate in vivo characterisation of brain tissue pathology [88 – 90]. Although very promising, a qMRI approach has only been used in two studies in FD, exploring the relevance and the pathological substrate of the <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign</b> [29] and the possible iron accumulation in the striatonigral pathway of these patients [75]. However, considering the feasibility of this technique for subtle quantitative evaluations, qMRI should be strongly considered in future studies aimed to detect not only markers of neurodegeneration but also the presence of possible glycosphingolipid accumulation in the brain, providing a tool for monitoring disease progression and the treatment’s efficacy.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Fabry disease (FD) is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{associated with}} marked cerebrovascular involvement. Conventional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) shows different abnormalities, like white matter lesions that may already be present {{at an early stage}} in the disease. Aim: To present observations from a series of brain MRIs performed among a cohort of patients with FD and the relationship of imaging abnormalities with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). Methods: A total of 70 patients with FD (43 women) were enrolled. The cardiac, renal, ophthalmic, and peripheral nerve functioning was assessed. The MRI evaluation included assessment for evidence of ischemia, microbleeds, <b>pulvinar</b> <b>sign,</b> Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, and vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD). The presence or absence of CVRFs was examined for all patients. Results: Renal involvement was found in 60 %, cardiac compromise in 30 %, cornea verticillata in 91. 4 %, and acroparesthesias in 87. 1 % of patients. Brain MRI analysis found evidence of cerebral ischemic injury in 25. 9 % of men and 30. 2 % of women. Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia was observed in imaging from 55. 5 % of men and 34. 8 % of women. The logistic regression analysis adjusted for cardiovascular risks factors, using ischemia or VBD as a dependent variable, showed no statistically significant results. Discussion: Our results have demonstrated cerebrovascular involvement before the third decade in many patients with FD. This study is further evidence confirming that women are not just carriers of FD and should be followed clinically and evaluated comprehensively to monitor for disease burden and progression. Although silent brain ischemias in MRI should be included as a key feature for the diagnoses of FD, VBD is an earlier and frequent sign...|$|E
