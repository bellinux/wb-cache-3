When this procedure was used to observe 0. 5 -μ-thick sections of plastic-embedded arteries, images were obtained with greater definition of detail than corresponding micrographs of the area using conventional bright-field microscopy. Since structures with different refractive indices are shown in geometric relief from one another, an apparent three-dimensional image is seen, which, together with the theoretically higher resolution and contrast achieved by this technic, gives an image with definition between conventional light and low magnification electron microscopy. The morphology of fatty streak lesions with aggregates of round and elongated lipid-filled cells was demonstrated, and clear images of different forms and sizes of intracellular lipid droplets were illustrated at magnifications around 1000. In atheromatous plaques, intra- and extracellular lipid droplets were observed, some with partially extracted cores or surfaces, as were amorphous lipid droplets coalescing with crystals whose centers had been extracted.

30|$|The lignin-swelling {{hypothesis}} was proposed by Watanabe and Boyd who noted the compressive L-stress generation and high MFA in compression wood [71, 72]. Inspired by Munch’s classical idea [62], they presumed that a volumetric increase due to irreversible lignin deposition generates a compressive {{force in the}} matrix. In contrast to cellulose-tension hypothesis, some indications of molecular mechanism were suggested. From observations using an ultraviolet <b>photomicroscope,</b> it could be confirmed {{that the increase in}} absorbance occurs in the secondary wall of compression wood tracheids [73 – 76]. Okuyama et al. considered that the accumulation of matrix substance, e.g., lignification, induces the compressive stress in the matrix of maturing cell wall [75]. As a result, the matrix tends to expand in the direction perpendicular to rigid cellulose microfibrils, which forces the compression wood fiber with a high MFA to expand in its axial direction. The origin of a positive T strain {{can be explained by the}} same mechanism. Later, Burgert et al. explained the generation of L stress over a wide range of MFA using the same idea of expansion perpendicular to rigid cellulose microfibrils [77].|$|E

Illustrations were obtained with a digital camera mounted on a <b>photomicroscope.</b> The roots of examined species shared most of the anatomical characteristics observed in other species of the Catasetum genus, and many of them have adaptations to the epiphytic habit, such as presence of secondary thickening in the velamen cell walls, exodermis, cortex, and medulla. Some specific features were recognized as having taxonomic application, such as composition of the thickening of velamen cell walls, ornamentation of absorbent root-hair walls, presence of tilosomes, composition and thickening of the cortical cell walls, presence of mycorrhizae, endodermal cell wall thickening, the number of protoxylem poles, and composition and thickening of the central area of the vascular cylinder. These traits are important anatomical markers to separate the species within the genus and to generate a dichotomous identification key for Catasetum. Thus, providing a useful tool for taxonomists of this grou...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of an 830 -nm gallium-aluminum-arsenic (GaAlAs) diode laser at two {{different}} energy densities (5 and 15 J/cm(2)) on the epiphyseal cartilage of rats by evaluating bone length {{and the number of}} chondrocytes and thickness of each zone of the epiphyseal cartilage. Background Data: Few studies have been conducted on the effects of low-level laser therapy on the epiphyseal cartilage at different irradiation doses. Materials and Methods: A total of 30 male Wistar rats with 23 days of age and weighing 90 g on average were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group (CG, no stimulation), G 5 group (energy density, 5 J/cm(2)), and G 15 group (energy density, 15 J/cm(2)). Laser treatment sessions were administered every other day for a total of 10 sessions. The animals were killed 24 h after the last treatment session. Histological slides of the epiphyseal cartilage were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE), photographed with a Zeiss <b>photomicroscope,</b> and subjected to histometric and histological analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test. All statistical tests were performed at a significance level of 0. 05. Results: Histological analysis and x-ray radiographs revealed an increase in thickness of the epiphyseal cartilage and in the number of chondrocytes in the G 5 and G 15 groups. Conclusion: The 830 -nm GaAlAs diode laser, within the parameters used in this study, induced changes in the thickness of the epiphyseal cartilage and increased the number of chondrocytes, but this was not sufficient to induce changes in bone length...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} {{to determine the effects of}} various substances on the development of the sea urchin embryo due to the lack of appropriate quantitative microassays. Here, a microplate assay has been developed for quantitatively evaluating the effects of substances, such as hyalin, on living sea urchin embryos. Hyalin (330 kDa) is a major constituent of the sea urchin hyaline layer, an extracellular matrix that develops 20 min postinsemination. Function of the hyaline layer and its major constituent, is the adhesion of cells during morphogenesis. Using wide-mouthed pipette tips, 25 microl of 24 -h Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryos were transferred to each well of a 96 -well polystyrene flat-bottom microplate yielding about 12 embryos per well. Specific concentrations of purified hyalin diluted in low calcium seawater were added to the wells containing the embryos, which were then incubated for 24 h at 15 degree C. The hyalin-treated and control samples were observed live and after fixation with 10 % formaldehyde using a Zeiss Axiolab <b>photomicroscope.</b> The small number of embryos in each well allowed quantification of the developmental effects of the added media. Specific archenteron morphologies-attached, unattached, no invagination and exogastrula-were scored and a dose-dependent response curve was generated. Hyalin at high concentrations blocked invagination. At low concentrations, it inhibited archenteron elongation/attachment to the blastocoel roof. While many studies have implicated hyalin in a variety of interactions during morphogenesis, we are not aware of any past studies that have quantitatively examined the effects of exogenous hyalin on specific gastrulation events in whole embryos...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 59 - 61) A new cell-to-cell adhesion assay {{has been}} devised. Using dissociated embryos {{of the sea}} urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, this procedure involves rotating a 0. 100 ml suspension of single cells (500, 000 /ml) with 0. 100 ml of the solution to be tested in the bulb portion of a transfer pipet with the tip removed. After 1 hour of rotation at 60 rpm at 15 C, the contents of each bulb were transferred into individual wells of a 96 -well flat-bottom plate. After the plate was incubated for 1 hour at 15 C, black and white photographs were taken with a 35 mm camera attached to an inverted <b>photomicroscope.</b> Examining a proof sheet i. e., of contact prints, or the negatives directly allowed rapid evaluation of suspected cell adhesion promoting factors. A ranking system {{was used to evaluate}} all samples. The assay was tested by examining the effect of specific solutions i. e., calcium-magnesium free-sea water with or without bovine serum albumin, Millipore-filtered sea water, or supernatant containing cell adhesion molecules colored with or without phenol red, on the aggregation of single cells obtained from dissociated 23 -hour S. purpuratus embryos. Samples were scored as negative when single cells with no clumping were observed while clumping indicated a positive response; larger clumps were scored as increasingly positive. This serological assay differs from other adhesion assays in that it utilizes the rotation of small volumes of cell suspension, employs a scoring method based on the largest clumps observed, and requires only minimal laboratory experience and completely disposable supplies...|$|E
