He distinguished himself with his courageous valour in the Battle of Dybbøl (7–18 April 1864) that marked the defeat of Denmark by the Austro-Prussian coalition. Pleased with the German victory, Victoria expected the military success of her husband would encourage <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> she was the wife of the heir apparent. In a letter to Frederick, she complained of the constant criticism and being considered too British in Prussia and too Prussian in Great Britain.|$|E

Regarding the previous statement, the singer said she wanted <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> she was normal, and how they could relate to her. Tisdale titled the album Headstrong, because she calls herself a [...] "headstrong" [...] type of person, commenting that she was the term in the sense of knowing how she wants to look, sing, and come across. In addition to wanting to record songs that [...] "touched" [...] her and those that she could personally identify with, she co-wrote three songs on the album, [...] "Over It," [...] "Not Like That," [...] and [...] "Suddenly." ...|$|E
2500|$|By mid October 2010, {{the dollar}} had dropped 7% since a 27 August speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke {{in which he}} said there was a {{possibility}} of further easing monetary policy. On 18 October, US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner stated [...] "It is very important for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the United States of America and no country around the world can devalue its way to prosperity and competitiveness." [...] Following this statement {{the value of the dollar}} rose as speculators calculated that at least in the short term it would be less likely for the US to intentionally devalue its currency.|$|E

2500|$|On December 2, it was {{announced}} that Harper's plan was to ask the Governor General to prorogue parliament, delaying a confidence vote until the new year. The coalition leadership sent a letter to Jean—who, at the time, was abroad conducting state visits to various European countries—informing her of the events, upon the receipt of which, Jean announced that she would cut her trip short and return to Ottawa [...] "in light of the current political situation in Canada." [...] Harper visited the Governor General at Rideau Hall, at approximately 9:30 am ET, on December 4. After consulting with the Prime Minister and other advisors for more than two hours, Jean granted Harper's request and parliament was prorogued until January 26, 2009, with the Conservatives scheduled to announce the budget the following day. Near the end of her tenure as vicereine, Jean revealed to the Canadian Press that the two-hour delay in giving her decision was partly to [...] "send a message—and for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> this warranted reflection." [...] She later stated in an interview on The Hour that [...] "I was in a position where I could have said no... And the decision had really to, in my mind, to be in the best interests, really, of the country, looking at all of the circumstances. And I have no regrets." ...|$|E
2500|$|A further {{decision}} on sending more troops {{came after the}} administration completed a broader review of Afghanistan policy. On 27 March 2009, Obama announced after an intense 60-day White House policy review, in which military commanders and diplomats, regional governments, partners, Nato allies, NGOs and aid organisations were consulted, a new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. [...] "So I want the American <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> we have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future. That is the goal that must be achieved. That is a cause {{that could not be}} more just. And to the terrorists who oppose us, my message is the same: we will defeat you," [...] Obama said. For this purpose Obama announced that he plans to further bolster American forces in Afghanistan, increase aid to Pakistan, and set strict standards – like levels of violence and casualties in Afghanistan, Pakistani attacks against insurgents and accounting for U.S. aid – for measuring progress in fighting Al Qaeda and the Taliban in both countries. Part of his strategy was the deployment of 4,000 U.S. troops – beyond the additional 17,000 he authorized in February—to work as trainers and advisers to the Afghan army and police. The move was accompanied by a [...] "surge" [...] in US civilians to Afghanistan to help rebuild the country's infrastructure. In addition to the renewed focus on Afghanistan, the Obama administration was to step up pressure on Pakistan to tackle the al-Qaida and Taliban safe havens in the tribal areas along its border with Afghanistan. US military and civilian aid was to be increased. The last element of the policy was to try to engage Afghanistan's regional neighbours, including Russia and Iran, in helping to pacify Afghanistan.|$|E

5000|$|The prologue is an {{important}} aspect of the book because Valerio uses an in depth narration of {{what it is like to}} be a transsexual to allow his readers to understand the trials and tribulations that one experiences when going through a sex change. In this section, Valerio wants <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> transsexuals are not simply just a branch of lesbian or gay. He wants <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> [...] "transsexual identities must be defined and expressed on our own terms". In Valerio's opinion, transsexuals voices and experiences, until more recently, are unheard and incompletely imagined which is one of the reasons he wanted to write this memoir.|$|E

50|$|A {{criticism}} by Elliot N. Dorff:In order {{to carry out}} the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be discerned from among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for <b>people</b> first <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> word necessitates human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.|$|R

5000|$|William Ockham gives a good {{concept of}} motion {{for many people}} in the Middle Ages. There is an issue with the {{vocabulary}} behind motion which makes people {{think that there is a}} correlation between nouns and the qualities that make nouns. Ockham states that this distinction is what will allow <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> motion, <b>that</b> motion is a property of mobiles, locations, and forms and that is all that is required to define what motion is. A famous example of this is Occam's razor which simplifies vague statements by cutting them into more descriptive examples. [...] "Every motion derives from an agent." [...] becomes [...] "each thing that is moved, is moved by an agent" [...] this makes motion a more personal quality referring to individual objects that are moved.|$|R
