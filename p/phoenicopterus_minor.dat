40|$|This thesis investigates {{remote sensing}} {{as a tool}} for {{monitoring}} the ecohydological sustainability of alkaline-saline lakes in the East African Rift Valley, of critical importance to Lesser Flamingos (<b>Phoenicopterus</b> <b>minor).</b> In Lake Bogoria, an algorithm was developed for retrieving chlorophyll-a as an indicator of cyanobacterial biomass - the Lesser Flamingos' primary food source. Results showed a strong linear relationship between Chl-a and the top-of-atmosphere Landsat ETM+ band ratio R[subscript 835]=R[subscript 660] (R[superscript 2] = 0. 801; SE = 70 µg l[superscript - 1]); valid for Chl-a up to 800 µg l[superscript - 1]. At Lake Natron, the sole breeding site for Lesser Flamingos in East Africa, breeding is hydrologically dependent. Landsat-derived lake surface area estimates and ground-based observations of flamingo breeding showed that breeding takes place on a receding lake level. Upper and lower limits for which breeding is feasible were de fined (700 - 750 km[superscript 2] and 150 - 180 km[superscript 2] respectively) based on the presence of islands in Landsat imagery. Extending to a regional scale, a Landsat-based optical classi fication scheme was developed for alkaline-saline lakes; the scheme was able to distinguish six classes with a classifi cation accuracy of 73...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} the phylogeographic pattern of the two main African populations of Lesser Flamingo <b>Phoenicopterus</b> <b>minor</b> from East and southern Africa was carried out to evaluate possible gene flow. A fragment of mitochondrial DNA encoding the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (ND 2) was sequenced in 27 specimens from these two populations and 11 haplotypes were identified. The phylogenetic analyses, based both on distance and parsimonious methods (neighbour joining and maximum parsimony), showed a homogeneous clade with {{a low level of}} genetic distance (0. 26 % +/- 0. 12 SD), which was also evidenced by the minimum spanning network method. The mismatch distribution analysis suggested a sudden demographic expansion from a single ancestral population. This latter result is also reinforced by the presence of few ancestral haplotypes, by the high level of haplotype diversity (0. 83) and the low level of nucleotide diversity (0. 0015 - 0. 0017). These data support the belief of field ornithologists for restricted interchange between the two populations determined by the geographical distance between the two populations and lack of any observations of movement between them, but with evidence of changes in each population's numbers, giving the concept of a permeable geographic barrier...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} {{seasonal}} {{variations in the}} abundance of Lesser Flamingo (<b>Phoenicopterus</b> <b>minor)</b> in re-lation to phytoplankton abundance in lake Manyara was conducted {{for a period of}} fourteen con-secutive months (July 2007 to August 2008). The aim was to relate the temporal variability in the phytoplankton species abundance and diversity of the lake to the population size of the Lesser Fla-mingo. Lesser Flamingo population numbers were obtained from monthly ground surveys whe-reby the lake was subdivided into defined counting vantage points. Water samples for phytoplankton species composition and biomass analyses were taken to the University of Dar es Salaam for labora-tory analysis. The flamingo population estimates ranged from 9319 in August 2007 to 640, 850 in Au-gust 2008. The Lesser Flamingo populations showed that temporal fluctuations were related to the changes in the abundance and diversity of phytoplankton species. The occurrence of Arthrospira as-sociated with the increase in the abundance of Lesser Flamingo. It was observed that changes in the Lesser Flamingo numbers were influenced by the changes in the abundance and availability of their preferred food. The results indicated that microalgae assemblage positively correlated with ammo-nium and nitrate which were also related to the abundance of lesser flamingo. The phytoplankto...|$|E
40|$|The Tanzanian rift system salt lakes present {{significant}} cultural, ecological, {{recreational and}} economical values. Beyond {{the wealth of}} minerals, resources of these rift salt lakes include unique wildlife, for instance Lesser Flamingo (<b>Phoenicopterus</b> <b>minor)</b> and Cichlids (Alcolapia spp), which adapted chemically aggressive environments like that of Lake Natron. The general hydrochemical equilibria of these salt lakes is governed by Na+> K+>> Ca 2 + ~ Mg 2 +: (CO 32 - + HCO 3 -) > Cl-> SO 42 - ~ F- ionic concentration pattern. Salt accumulation mechanism in these endorheic lakes is considered to base on thermo-mechanical disintegrative stress of the geochemistry sourcing. The rains chemically interact with rift terrains, which are dominated with natrocarbonatitic volcanic materials, thus transporting dissolved salts to the lakes. In addition, hot springs around the shores of these lakes carry significant salinity loads into the lakes. The salt reserves magnifies through recurring evaporative concentration in seasonal cycles. Despite this huge wealth of mineral resource potential of the Tanzanian rift salt lakes, they are still underutilized, thus contributing less into the national economy. It is envisaged that studies on phase rule on separation of pure salts from lake brines as demonstrated herein have a direct industrial value addition to Tanzanian rift salt lakes...|$|E
40|$|Land use {{and land}} cover change {{has become a}} central {{component}} in current strategies for managing natural resources and monitoring environmental changes. To assess the natural resources and to maintain the potentials of the area, a land cover mapping was done. The {{aim of this study}} was to detect the extent and rate of land use and land cover change for the last 28 years. The landsat imageries of 1986, 2000, 2007 and 2014 were taken for land use and land cover classification. For the classification purposes, five land use and land cover classes were identified. Change Detection between the images for all the land use and land cover classes were computed. For Accuracy Assessment Classification error matrix was done. The floristic composition and structure of Hugumburda forest, is described and related to environmental factors. To analyze the forest and environmental data forty plots (10 m x 10 m) were used. For each species the abundance value was estimated. Height and diameter at breast height (DBH) of all woody individuals taller than 2 m and thicker than 2 cm were measured. A total of 41 species belonging to 32 families were recorded. The most extensive land cover category of the study area is farmland i. e. 46. 8 %. The second most extensive land cover category is forest 33. 3 % in 2014. The overall accuracy of classification methodology is 82. 11 % for the 2000 and 2007 images. Seven most abundant families were found namely: Fabaceae, Anacardiaceae, Apocynaceae, Celastraceae, Cupressaceae, Sapindaceae and Solanaceae. Regarding plant life forms, the forest is composed of 56 % shrub, 44 % tree species. Related to the bird species, a total of 66 species of birds grouped under 19 families were recorded. Family Alopochen aegyptiacus (20. 07 %) had the highest number of species. The lowest number of species was under the Families Phalacrocorax carbo (0. 14 %), <b>Phoenicopterus</b> <b>minor</b> (0. 15 %) and Lissotis melanogaster (0. 15 %) respectively. Lake Hashenge has two species of fish and grouped under two families.
