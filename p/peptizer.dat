40|$|The {{mechanisms}} whereby Laponite, {{a synthetic}} clay of the hectorite type, is consolidated, have been identified. This relatively monodisperse clay consists of disc-like anisotropic particles of nanometric size which have strongly anisotropic surface charges as the edges {{have a positive}} charge and the faces a negative one. These colloidal particles aggregate to form, depending on the physicochemical parameters, an isotropic gel. In this study, the inter-particle interactions may be modified by adding a <b>peptizer,</b> tetrasodium diphosphate. This <b>peptizer</b> consists of anions that attach themselves {{to the edges of}} the clay particles and tend to give them a negative surface charge. A large amount of literature is available on this clay, concerning restricted ranges of volume fractions in the dilute to semi-dilute domains, i. e., less than 3 %. These studies was concerned by the influence of inter-particles interactions via the aqueous media on the physicochemical properties, on the structure of the dispersions and at larger length scales on their macroscopic behaviour. Other scarcer studies have considered consolidation as a way to concentrate the dispersions because they cannot be concentrated further using normal mixing techniques. These studies do not try to rely the structure and the macroscopic behaviour of the dispersions during and after consolidation...|$|E
40|$|False {{positive}} peptide identifications are a {{major concern}} {{in the field of}} peptidecentric, mass spectrometry-driven gel-free proteomics. They occur in regions where the score distributions of true positives and true negatives overlap. Removal of these false positive identifications necessarily involves a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Existing postprocessing tools typically rely on a fixed or semifixed set of assumptions in their attempts to optimize both the sensitivity and the specificity of pep-tide and protein identification using MS/MS spectra. Be-cause of the expanding diversity in available proteomics technologies, however, these postprocessing tools often struggle to adapt to emerging technology-specific pecu-liarity.

40|$|International audienceLaponite dispersions in water, at {{moderate}} {{ionic strength}} and high pH, are thixotropic: depending on previous history, {{they can be}} fluids or gels. The mechanisms of the fluid-gel and gel-fluid transitions have been examined through ionic analysis of the aqueous phase, static light, and small-angle neutron scattering, rheological experiments, and centrifugation. The {{results indicate that the}} particles attract each other in edge-to-face configurations. These attractions cause the particles to gather in microdomains, which subsequently associate to form very large fractal superaggregates, containing all the particles in the dispersion. A gel state is obtained when the network of connections is macroscopic. This network is destroyed by the application of sufficient strain, but it heals at rest.

40|$|Nanostructured {{tin oxide}} films were {{prepared}} by depositing different sols using spray pyrolysis {{in a novel}} technique, the so-called spray-gel process. SnO 2 sols were obtained from tin alkoxide Sn(t-OAm) 4 or tin tetrachloride (SnCl 4 5 H 2 O) precursors and stabilized with ammonia or tetra-ethyl ammonium hydroxide (TEA-OH) as <b>peptizers.</b> Xerogels from the different sols were obtained by solvent evaporation under controlled humidity. The Relative Gelling Volumes (RGV) strongly depend {{on the type of}} precursor. Xerogels obtained from inorganic salts gelled faster, while, as determined by TGA, occluding a significant amount of volatile compounds. Infrared spectroscopic analysis was performed on raw and annealed xerogels (500 °C, 1 h). Annealing removes ammonia or alkyl ammonium hydroxide, increasing the number of Sn-O-Sn bonds. SnO 2 films were prepared by spraying the sols for 60 min onto glass and alumina substrates at 130 °C for 60 min. The films obtained from both precursors were amorphous or had a very small grain size, and crystallized after annealing at 400 °C and 500 °C in air for 2 h. XRD analysis showed the presence of the cassiterite structure and line broadening indicated polycrystalline material with a grain size in the nanometer range. SEM demonstrated a strong dependence of the film morphology on the RGV of the sols. Films obtained from Sn(t-OAm) 4 present a highly textured morphology based on fiber-shape bridges, whereas the films obtained from SnCl 4 5 H 2 O have a smoother surface formed by "O-ring" shaped domains. The performance of the films in gas sensor devices was tested. The conductance response for ethanol was of the same order of magnitude for the three kinds of films. The response of the highly textured films was more stable with shorter response times...|$|R
40|$|Inorganic and hybrid {{inorganic-organic}} {{systems for}} conservative treatments {{of stone and}} wood materials The {{research has focused on}} the synthesis, characterization and application of inorganic and hybrid inorganic-organic systems for conservative treatments of stone and wood. The wood preservatives synthesized and tested for biocidal activity are polyamidoamines functionalized with hydroxyl and siloxane groups, while the coatings applied on the stones are water based TiO 2 nanosols with photocatalytic and self-cleaning properties. Firstly is reported the synthesis of amidoamines by addition reaction between an α,β-unsaturated amide (2 -propenamide or N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide) and an amine (ethanolamine or diethanolamine). Their synthesis is a simple system for the study of polyamidoamines. The characterization of the starting reagents and the products of addition was made by means of different techniques (ESI-MS, NMR, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy). The model amidoamines synthesized by aza-Michael addition have allowed the study of the main parameters that influence the reaction It was verified that the reaction proceeds better in water compared to alcohol, and that at 55 °C the reaction takes place relatively quickly (about 4 h). Polyamidoamines under different reaction conditions were then synthesized. The polymers were functionalized with OH groups (PAAOH) and siloxane groups (SiPAA, SiPAAOH). The various polymers were characterized by spectroscopic techniques (ESI-MS, NMR, FTIR, Raman) and with thermal analysis. Polymers were applied on wood samples and their efficacy against fungi and termites has been verified according to UNI EN. The interaction with the substrate, the depth of penetration and the colour changes induced by the treatment were also investigated. The investigations showed that the polymerization reaction for the polymers with hydroxyl side chain is favoured when the amide is completely dissolved in the solvent and added slowly into the solution containing the ethanolamine, in particular when using water or methanol as the solvent. The measurements carried out on the polymers obtained without solvent at 90 °C show that the reaction proceeds up to completeness in less than 3 hours. As regards the polymers functionalized with siloxane, it is noticed that with increasing EtA/APTES ratio the effectiveness of polymerization increases. The DSC has allowed to evaluate the glass transition temperature of the polymers in the range 109 ÷ 120 °C. The hybrid polymers have been incorporated in the lignocellulosic structure of the wood and subjected to heat treatment (103 ± 1 °C for 18 h) in order to increase the crosslinking. The high degree of crosslinking (DOC Degree of Condensation) within the wood has been demonstrated by 29 Si-NMR spectra. Thanks to electron microscopy SEM it has been possible to verify the successful impregnation of wood specimens with different treatments. The preparations were applied as a protective coating on wood samples (sapwood of Pinus sylvestris) and tested for efficacy against biotic attack, both xilophagous insects and fungi, and resulted effective. After aging tests the polymers with siloxane functionality (SiPAA, SiPAAOH) are effective on wood-decay fungi. Finally, the synthesis and characterization of sol-gel TiO 2 based coatings for the photocatalytic self-cleaning of biocalcarenites, are reported. Nanocrystalline titania sols in acid and basic aqueous environments have been prepared by sol-gel, processing titanium isopropoxide with two complexing agents, acetic acid and malonic acid and different <b>peptizers,</b> i. e. acetic acid, nitric acid and triethylamine. To verify the photocatalytic activity, gold nanoparticles {{have been added to the}} sol obtained by acetic acid. The effectiveness of the photocatalytic sols was verified by evidence of degradation of dyes, methyl orange (MeO) and methylene blue (MB), under UV-Vis irradiation. In accordance with the rules on cultural heritage, the harmlessness of coating towards the substrate has been investigated. XRD, Raman and TEM measurements on the corresponding titania powders have revealed nanocrystalline particles of anatase (5 - 6 nm) and of brookite in lesser amount. DLS and ELS-IEP analyses have indicated that preparations with acetic acid, acetic/nitric acids or malonic/triethylamine (basic) gives stable sols. The catalytic photoactivity of the sols under UV irradiation for the degradation of the anionic azo-dye MeO is much faster with acid sols than with the basic one. The cationic MB dye is completely photodegraded only by the basic TiO 2 sol, on which the dye is adsorbed with the formation of trimeric species. Coatings at different pH were applied to biocalcarenites typical of southern Italy (Comiso, Modica, Noto and Lecce stones) used in the Baroque period of interest for cultural heritage. Satisfactory results are obtained by photodegradation under UV irradiation of Modica and Comiso stones coated by acid sol. The colour difference before and after the treatments is acceptable. The coatings do not alter the intrinsic properties of Modica and Comiso stones in the capillarity absorption of water, do not prevent the salts crystallization and leave unchanged the stone characteristics. The sol, used alone or with a silica interlayer, is promising for application in limestone protection. On Pietra di Lecce all the acidic sols showed good photocatalytic activity. All the coatings slightly reduce the capillarity water absorption. Colorimetric analyses show that the coatings do not significantly alter the original colour of the stones. The photocatalytic activity for MeO stain degradation is comparable for all the coatings: the addition of gold nanoparticle improves the cleaning in the first minutes, but the purple coloring prevents its use. On Pietra di Noto, both acid and basic titanium coatings do not alter the proprieties of the stone as the color difference measured is very small and capillarity absorption coefficient are comparable for treated and untreated samples. Referring to durability of the stone, the resistance to salt crystallization is generally improved. As concerns the self-cleaning properties, both TiO 2 coatings exhibit a good photodegradation activity of methylene blue and methyl orange dyes. Both nanosols are suitable for harmlessness protection of Pietra di Noto, but the basic one exhibits better performances in term of filmogenic properties, colour changes, water absorption, durability enhancement and photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes and then it should be preferred for calcarenite substrates. The results highlight the compatibility of the treatments with respect to the properties of the calcarenite stones, showing no chromatic changes, no alteration of physical properties, an improvement of the resistance to salts crystallization and good photocatalytic activity on both dyes. This study has revealed that the basic sol is particularly suited for the self-cleaning of carbonatic stones, widely employed in ancient and modern architecture, opening perspectives for further applications. Sistemi inorganici e ibridi inorganici-organici per trattamenti conservativi di materiali lapidei e lignei La ricerca si è concentrata sulla sintesi, caratterizzazione e applicazione di sistemi inorganici e ibridi organici-inorganici per la protezione di pietra e legno. Il preservante del legno sintetizzato e di cui si è testata l’attività biocida è una poliammidoammina funzionalizzata con gruppi idrossilici e silossanici, mentre il rivestimento applicato su pietre è un nanosol a base di TiO 2 con proprietà fotocatalitiche e autopulenti. Nella prima parte è riportata la sintesi di piccole molecole ammidoamminiche, ottenute dalla reazione di addizione tra un’ammide α,β-insatura (2 -propenammide o N, N'-Methylenebisacrylamide) ed una ammina (etanolammina o dietanolammina). Queste molecole sono state sintetizzate in quanto sistema semplice per lo studio delle poliammidoammine. La caratterizzazione dei reagenti di partenza e dei prodotti di addizione è stata effettuata mediante diverse tecniche (ESI-MS, NMR, FTIR e spettroscopia Raman). Dall’analisi delle molecole modello sintetizzate si è verificato che la reazione procede meglio in acqua rispetto all'alcol, e che a 55 ° C la reazione avviene in modo relativamente rapido (circa 4 h). Successivamente sono state sintetizzate le poliammidoammine (PAA) in diverse condizioni di reazione. I polimeri sono stati funzionalizzati con gruppi OH (PAAOH) e gruppi silossanici (SiPAA, SiPAAOH). I vari polimeri sono stati caratterizzati mediante tecniche spettroscopiche (ESI-MS, NMR, FTIR, Raman) e analisi termica. Quindi, le PAA sono state applicate su campioni di legno e la loro efficacia contro funghi e termiti è stata verificata in accordo alle norme UNI EN. Sono state inoltre studiate l'interazione con il substrato, la profondità di penetrazione e le variazioni di colore indotte dal trattamento. Le indagini hanno mostrato che la reazione di polimerizzazione dei polimeri con catena laterale idrossilica è influenzata dal modo di miscelazione dei reagenti: è favorita quando l'ammide è completamente disciolta nel solvente e aggiunta lentamente nella soluzione contenente l'etanolammina, in particolare quando si utilizza acqua o metanolo come solvente. Le prove effettuate sui polimeri ottenuti senza solvente a 90 °C mostrano che la reazione procede fino a completamento in meno di 3 ore. Per quanto riguarda i polimeri funzionalizzati con gruppi silossanici, si nota che con l'aumentare rapporto EtA/APTES aumenta l’efficienza di polimerizzazione. I polimeri ibridi sono stati incorporati nella struttura lignocellulosica del legno e i provini impregnati sottoposti a trattamento termico (103 °C per 18 ore) per aumentare la reticolazione. L'alto grado di reticolazione dentro il legno è stato dimostrato dagli spettri 29 Si-NMR. Grazie alla microscopia elettronica è stato possibile verificare il successo dell’impregnazione dei campioni di Pinus sylvestris. I trattamenti testati come biocidi contro insetti xilofagi e funghi sono risultati efficaci. Infine, sono descritte la sintesi e la caratterizzazione di rivestimenti self-cleaning a base di TiO 2 per la protezione di materiale lapideo, in particolare di biocalcareniti. Sols di titania nanocristallina sono stati sintetizzati via sol-gel, in ambiente acido e basico da titanio isopropossido, con due agenti complessanti, acido acetico e acido malonico, e differenti peptizzanti: acido acetico, acido nitrico e trietilammina. Per verificare gli effetti sull’attività fotocatalitica, al sol con acido acetico sono state aggiunte nanoparticelle d’oro. L'efficacia fotocatalitica dei sols è stata verificata mediante prove di degradazione di coloranti organici (Blu di Metilene e Metilarancio) sotto irraggiamento UV-Vis. In conformità con le norme sui Beni Culturali, è stata studiata l'innocuità del rivestimento verso il substrato. Analisi XRD, Raman e TEM sulle corrispondenti polveri di titania hanno rivelato particelle nanocristalline di anatasio (5 - 6 nm) e di brookite in minore quantità. DLS ed ELS-IEP hanno indicato che le preparazioni con acido acetico, acido acetico/nitrico o malonico/trietilammina forniscono sol stabili. L’attività fotocatalitica dei sols sotto irraggiamento UV per la degradazione del colorante anionico Metilarancio è risultata molto più veloce con sol acido che con quello basico. Il colorante cationico Blu di Metilene è completamente foto-degradato solo dalla formulazione basica. I coating sono stati applicati a biocalcareniti tipiche dell’Italia meridionale, utilizzate in epoca barocca e di interesse per i beni culturali (pietra di Comiso, Modica, Noto e Lecce). Sulle pietre di Modica e Comiso, trattate con la formulazione acida, sono stati ottenuti risultati soddisfacenti per quanto riguarda la fotodegradazione dei coloranti. La differenza di colore prima e dopo i trattamenti è accettabile. I rivestimenti non alterano le proprietà intrinseche delle pietre: assorbimento d’acqua per capillarità, fuoriuscita dei sali cristallizzati dai pori e caratteristiche estetiche. Sulla Pietra di Lecce i sols hanno mostrato una buona attività fotocatalitica per la degradazione del colorante; inoltre l'aggiunta di nanoparticelle di oro migliora le prestazioni nei primi minuti, ma la colorazione violacea impedisce il suo uso nell’ambito dei Beni Culturali. I rivestimenti riducono leggermente l'assorbimento d'acqua per capillarità e le analisi colorimetriche mostrano che, ad eccezione del sol con aggiunta di nanoparticelle d’oro, essi non modificano significativamente il colore originale delle pietre. Su Pietra di Noto, entrambi i nanosols acido e basico mostrano buone prestazioni in termini di idrorepellenza e la resistenza alla cristallizzazione dei sali. Inoltre non alterano l’aspetto estetico della pietra. Per quanto riguarda le proprietà autopulenti, entrambi i rivestimenti di TiO 2 mostrano una buona attività fotocatalitica per il degrado dei coloranti. Tutti i sol sintetizzati sono risultati efficaci per il foto-degrado di coloranti sulle pietre studiate. Il sol basico è particolarmente adatto come rivestimento self-cleaning per le pietre carbonatiche, ampiamente utilizzate nell'architettura antica e moderna, suggerendo possibilità per ulteriori applicazioni...|$|R

The latter turned this posttranslational protein modification into an interesting biomarker, being either a consequence of the disease or a factor contributing to the disease onset. However, the interpretation of MS and MS/MS data of peptides containing nitrotyrosine has proven to be very challenging and consequently, the risk of linking MS/MS spectra to incorrect peptide sequences exists and has been reported.

40|$|Combined X-ray powder {{diffraction}} (XRD) and high-resolution transmission {{electron microscopy}} (HRTEM) were used to identify and characterize the clay mineral assemblages in 0. 05 - 0. 1 $ mu$m and ${< 0. 05 } mu$m size fractions separated from shales of three depths (4800, 8700 - 8750, and 12500 - 12550 ft) from the Reindeer D- 27 well in the Beaufort-Mackenzie area, Arctic Canada. Ethylene-glycol solvated samples indicated a two-component mixed-layer I/S system, whereas glycerol solvation suggested an additional high-charge expandable component. Exchange with octylammonium (n$ rm sb c$ = 8) and octadecylammonium (n$ rm sb c$ = 18) ions revealed the presence of five distinct types of layer structures: (1) low-charge smectite-group, (2) high-charge smectite-group or vermiculite, (3) double-layers or rectorite-like, (4) expandable illite, and (5) non-expandable illite. The presence and abundance of each type of layer structure changed with burial depth. A comparison of untreated and sodium hexametaphosphate-treated ${< 0. 05 } mu$m size fractions revealed modifications {{to the structure of}} mixed-layer I/S in both ethylene-glycol solvated and alkylammonium-ion exchanged specimens. Changes in peak position, intensity and breadths are apparent in XRD, and these modifications can also be observed in HRTEM. Lattice-fringe images revealed that pretreatment resulted in: (1) increased abundance of 2 : 1 layer silicate packets with expanded interlayers, (2) increased R 1 -ordered sequences, and (3) thinner packets of non-expanded illite interlayers. The use of sodium hexametaphosphate as a <b>peptizer</b> alters the interlayers and modifies the stacking arrangement of the layer structures. If the primary structure is altered, the disruption may be irreversible. It is evident therefore, that reliable ratio determination between expandable and non-expandable components in mixed-layer I/S is dependent on characterizing all the components and resolving the effects of chemical pretreatment...|$|E
40|$|Initiation {{of protein}} {{translation}} is a well-studied fundamental process, albeit high-throughput and more comprehensive {{determination of the}} exact translation initiation sites (TIS) was only recently made possible following the introduction of positional proteomics techniques that target protein N-termini. Precise translation initiation is of crucial importance, as truncated or extended proteins might fold, function, and locate erroneously. Still, as already shown for some proteins, alternative translation initiation can {{also serve as a}} regulatory mechanism. By applying N-terminal COFRADIC (combined fractional diagonal chromatography), we here isolated N-terminal peptides of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome and analyzed both annotated and alternative TIS. We analyzed this N-terminome of S. cerevisiae which resulted in the identification of 650 unique N-terminal peptides corresponding to database annotated TIS. Furthermore, 56 unique N(alpha) -acetylated peptides were identified that suggest alternative TIS (MS/MS-based), while MS-based evidence of N(alpha) -acetylation led to an additional 33 such peptides. To improve the overall sensitivity of the analysis, we also included the 5 ' UTR (untranslated region) in-frame translations together with the yeast protein sequences in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. To ensure the quality of the individual peptide identifications, peptide-to-spectrum matches were only accepted at a 99 % probability threshold and were subsequently analyzed in detail by the <b>Peptizer</b> tool to automatically ascertain their compliance with several expert criteria. Furthermore, we have also identified 60 MS/MS-based and 117 MS-based N(alpha) -acetylated peptides that point to N(alpha) -acetylation as a post-translational modification since these peptides did not start nor were preceded (in their corresponding protein sequence) by a methionine residue. Next, we evaluated consensus sequence features of nudeic acids and amino acids across each of these groups of peptides and evaluated the results in the context of publicly available data. Taken together, we present a list of 706 annotated and alternative TIS for yeast proteins and found that under normal growth conditions alternative TIS might (co) occur in S. cerevisiae in roughly one tenth of all proteins. Furthermore, we found that the nucleic acid and amino acid features proximate to these alternative TIS favor either guanine or adenine nucleotides following the start codon or acidic amino acids following the initiator methionine. Finally, we also observed an unexpected high number of N(alpha) -acetylated peptides that could not be related to TIS and therefore suggest events of post-translational N(alpha) -acetylation...|$|E
