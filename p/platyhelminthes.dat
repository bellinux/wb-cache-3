5|$|The <b>Platyhelminthes</b> {{excluding}} Acoelomorpha contain {{two main}} groups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, {{both of which}} are generally agreed to be monophyletic (each contains all and only the descendants of an ancestor that {{is a member of the}} same group). Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about whether these could be combined in a single monophyletic group, but a study in 2008 concluded they could, therefore <b>Platyhelminthes</b> could be redefined as Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{confidently}} identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs {{found in}} a Permian shark coprolite, but helminth hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles. The oldest known free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber {{and placed in the}} monotypic species Micropalaeosoma balticus, while the oldest subfossil specimens are schistosome eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies. The <b>Platyhelminthes</b> have very few synapomorphies, distinguishing features that all <b>Platyhelminthes</b> and no other animals have. This makes it difficult to work out both their relationships with other groups of animals and the relationships between different groups that are described as members of the <b>Platyhelminthes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parasitic infestations, stings, and bites {{in humans}} {{are caused by}} several groups of organisms {{belonging}} to the following phyla: Annelida, Arthropoda, Bryozoa, Chordata, Cnidaria, Cyanobacteria, Echinodermata, Nemathelminthes, <b>Platyhelminthes,</b> and Protozoa.|$|E

5|$|Other {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses {{agree the}} redefined <b>Platyhelminthes</b> are most {{closely related to}} Gastrotricha, and both {{are part of a}} grouping known as Platyzoa. Platyzoa are generally agreed to be at least closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that includes molluscs and annelid worms. The majority view is that Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority of researchers regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.|$|E
5|$|These {{are often}} called flukes, as most have flat rhomboid shapes {{like that of}} a {{flounder}} (Old English flóc). There are about 11,000 species, more than all other <b>platyhelminthes</b> combined, and second only to roundworms among parasites on metazoans. Adults usually have two holdfasts, a ring around the mouth and a larger sucker midway along what would be the underside in a free-living flatworm.|$|E
5|$|While {{analyses}} by {{molecular phylogeny}} {{are confident that}} members of Lophotrochozoa are {{more closely related to}} each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. The Lophotrochozoa are generally divided into: Lophophorata (animals that have lophophores), including Phoronida and Brachiopoda; Trochozoa (animals many of which have trochophore larvae), including molluscs, annelids, echiurans, sipunculans and nemerteans; and some other phyla (such as <b>Platyhelminthes,</b> Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and Rotifera).|$|E

In this review we show how TEM and appropriate cytochemical methods have been helpful in clarifying issues related to female germ cell differentiation and more in general to the cellular aspects of the reproductive biology in these lower metazoans.

40|$|Schistosomiasis is an {{infectious}} disease caused by parasites of the phylum <b>platyhelminthe.</b> Here, {{we describe the}} identification and characterization of a Bcl- 2 –regulated apoptosis pathway in Schistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni. Genomic, biochemical, and cell-based mechanistic studies provide evidence for a tripartite pathway, {{similar to that in}} humans including BH 3 -only proteins that are inhibited by prosurvival Bcl- 2 –like molecules, and Bax/Bak-like proteins that facilitate mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization. Because Bcl- 2 proteins have been successfully targeted with “BH 3 mimetic” drugs, particularly in the treatment of cancer, we investigated whether schistosome apoptosis pathways could provide targets for future antischistosomal drug discovery efforts. Accordingly, we showed that a schistosome prosurvival protein, sjA, binds ABT- 737, a well-characterized BH 3 mimetic. A crystal structure of sjA bound to a BH 3 peptide provides direct evidence for the feasibility of developing BH 3 mimetics to target Bcl- 2 prosurvival proteins in schistosomes, suggesting an alternative application for this class of drugs beyond cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|Delineating the phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{among members of}} a protein family can provide {{a high degree of}} insight into the evolution of domain structure and function relationships. To identify an early metazoan member of the high molecular weight serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily, we initiated a cDNA library screen of the cnidarian, Cyanea capillata. We identified one serpin cDNA encoding for a full-length serpin, jellypin. Phylogenetic analysis using the deduced amino acid sequence showed that jellypin was most similar to the <b>platyhelminthe</b> Echinococcus multiocularis serpin and the clade P serpins, suggesting that this serpin evolved approximately 1000 million years ago (MYA). Modeling of jellypin showed that it contained all the functional elements of an inhibitory serpin. In vitro biochemical analysis confirmed that jellypin was an inhibitor of the S 1 clan SA family of serine proteinases. Analysis of the interactions between the human serine proteinases, chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, and elastase, showed that jellypin inhibited these enzymes in the classical serpin manner, forming a SDS stable enzyme/inhibitor complex. These data suggest that the coevolution of serpin structure and inhibitory function date back to at least early metazoan evolution, approximately 1000 MYA...|$|R
5|$|In {{traditional}} medicinal texts, <b>Platyhelminthes</b> {{are divided}} into Turbellaria, which are mostly non-parasitic animals such as planarians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated. Free-living flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments, such as leaf litter. Cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes) have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts. The eggs of trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids that detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs. Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting aquatic animals, and their larvae metamorphose into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum <b>Platyhelminthes)</b> which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail that lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. The problem here is that these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} these, <b>Platyhelminthes,</b> {{includes}} the flatworms, tapeworms, and flukes. They have a flat, ribbon- or leaf-shaped {{body with a}} pair of eyes at the front. Some are parasites.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} helminths in the sanitation field are the human parasites, {{which is why}} most people relate the term helminth to them, where they are classified as nemathelminthes (nematodes) and <b>platyhelminthes,</b> depending on whether they possess a round or flat-shaped body respectively. The latter are further divided into cestodes and trematodes depending {{on whether or not}} they have a segmented body.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no clear}} {{consensus}} on the taxonomy of helminths; it {{is more of a}} commonly used term to describe certain worms with superficial similarities. These are flatworms (<b>platyhelminthes),</b> namely cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes), and roundworms or nemathelminths (nematodes) – both of these are parasitic worm types – and the annelida, which are not parasitic or at the most ectoparasites like the leeches.|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} {{species in the}} genus Dugesia, flatworms in the Turbellaria {{sub-division}} of the phylum <b>Platyhelminthes,</b> include polyploid individuals that reproduce by parthenogenesis. This type of parthenogenesis requires mating, but the sperm does {{not contribute to the}} genetics of the offspring (the parthenogenesis is pseudogamous, alternatively referred to as gynogenetic). A complex cycle of matings between diploid sexual and polyploid parthenogenetic individuals produces new parthenogenetic lines.|$|E
25|$|The Platyzoa {{include the}} phylum <b>Platyhelminthes,</b> the flatworms. These were {{originally}} considered {{some of the}} most primitive Bilateria, but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors. A number of parasites are included in this group, such as the flukes and tapeworms. Flatworms are acoelomates, lacking a body cavity, as are their closest relatives, the microscopic Gastrotricha. The other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate. The most prominent are the Rotifera or rotifers, which are common in aqueous environments. They also include the Acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms, the Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and possibly the Cycliophora. These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are called the Gnathifera.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} domesticated, both terrestrial and aquatic, including {{some such as}} Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies and the freshwater cnidarian Hydra for research into genetics and physiology. Few {{have a long history}} of domestication. Most are used for food or other products such as shellac and cochineal. The phyla involved are Cnidaria, <b>Platyhelminthes</b> (for biological control), Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda (marine crustaceans as well as insects and spiders), and Echinodermata. While many marine molluscs are used for food, only a few have been domesticated, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus, all used in research on behaviour and neurology. Terrestrial snails in the genera Helix and Murex are raised for food. Several parasitic or parasitoidal insects including the fly Eucelatoria, the beetle Chrysolina, and the wasp Aphytis are raised for biological control. Conscious or unconscious artificial selection has many effects on species under domestication; variability can readily be lost by inbreeding, selection against undesired traits, or genetic drift, while in Drosophila, variability in eclosion time (when adults emerge) has increased.|$|E

500|$|Because they do {{not have}} {{internal}} body cavities, <b>Platyhelminthes</b> were regarded as a primitive stage in the evolution of bilaterians (animals with bilateral symmetry and hence with distinct front and rear ends). However, analyses since the mid-1980s have separated out one subgroup, the Acoelomorpha, as basal bilaterians—closer to the original bilaterians than to any other modern groups. The remaining <b>Platyhelminthes</b> form a monophyletic group, one that contains all and only descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a member of the group. The redefined <b>Platyhelminthes</b> is part of the Lophotrochozoa, one of the three main groups of more complex bilaterians. These analyses had concluded the redefined <b>Platyhelminthes,</b> excluding Acoelomorpha, consists of two monophyletic subgroups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, with Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea forming a monophyletic subgroup within one branch of the Rhabditophora. Hence, the traditional platyhelminth subgroup [...] "Turbellaria" [...] is now regarded as paraphyletic, since it excludes the wholly parasitic groups, although these are descended from one group of [...] "turbellarians".|$|E
500|$|Nemerteans' affinities with Annelida (including Echiura, Pogonophora, Vestimentifera {{and perhaps}} Sipuncula) and Mollusca make the ribbon-worms members of Lophotrochozoa, which [...] include {{about half of}} the extant animal phyla. Lophotrochozoa groups: those animals that feed using a lophophore (Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Phoronida, Entoprocta); phyla in which most members' embryos develop into trochophore larvae (for example Annelida and Mollusca); and some other phyla (such as <b>Platyhelminthes,</b> Sipuncula, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, Nemertea, Phoronida, <b>Platyhelminthes</b> and Rotifera). These groupings are based on {{molecular}} phylogeny, which compares sections of organisms DNA and RNA. While analyses by molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear.|$|E
500|$|<b>Platyhelminthes</b> are bilaterally {{symmetrical}} animals: {{their left}} and right sides are mirror images of each other; this also implies they have distinct {{top and bottom surfaces}} and distinct head and tail ends. Like other bilaterians, they have three main cell layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm), while the radially symmetrical cnidarians and ctenophores (comb jellies) have only two cell layers. Beyond that, they are [...] "defined more by what they do not have than by any particular series of specializations." [...] Unlike other bilaterians, <b>Platyhelminthes</b> have no internal body cavity, so are described as acoelomates. They also lack specialized circulatory and respiratory organs, both of these facts are defining features when classifying a flatworm's anatomy. Their bodies are soft and unsegmented.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "traditional" [...] view {{before the}} 1990s was that <b>Platyhelminthes</b> formed the sister group {{to all the}} other bilaterians, which include, for example, arthropods, molluscs, annelids and chordates. Since then {{molecular}} phylogenetics, which aims to work out evolutionary [...] "family trees" [...] by comparing different organisms' biochemicals such as DNA, RNA and proteins, has radically changed scientists' view of evolutionary relationships between animals. Detailed morphological analyses of anatomical features in the mid-1980s and molecular phylogenetics analyses since 2000 using different sections of DNA agree that Acoelomorpha, consisting of Acoela (traditionally regarded as very simple [...] "turbellarians") and Nemertodermatida (another small group previously classified as [...] "turbellarians") are the sister group to all other bilaterians, including the rest of the <b>Platyhelminthes.</b> However, a 2007 study concluded that Acoela and Nemertodermatida were two distinct groups of bilaterians, although it agreed that both are more closely related to cnidarians (jellyfish, etc.) than other bilaterians are.|$|E
500|$|The flatworms, flat worms, <b>Platyhelminthes,</b> Plathelminthes, or platyhelminths (from the Greek πλατύ, platy, meaning [...] "flat" [...] and ἕλμινς (root: ἑλμινθ-), helminth-, meaning [...] "worm") are a phylum of {{relatively}} simple bilaterian, unsegmented, soft-bodied invertebrates. Unlike other bilaterians, they are acoelomates (having no body cavity), {{and have no}} specialized circulatory and respiratory organs, which restricts them to having flattened shapes that allow oxygen and nutrients to pass through their bodies by diffusion. The digestive cavity has only one opening for both ingestion (intake of nutrients) and egestion (removal of undigested wastes); as a result, the food cannot be processed continuously.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} of gastrotrichs to other phyla is unclear. Morphology {{suggests that they}} {{are close to the}} Gnathostomulida, the Rotifera, or the Nematoda. On the other hand, genetic studies place them as close relatives of the <b>Platyhelminthes,</b> the Ecdysozoa or the Lophotrochozoa. [...] As of 2011, around 790 species have been described. The phylum contains a single class, divided into two orders: the Macrodasyida and the Chaetonotida. Edward Ruppert et al. report that the Macrodasyida are wholly marine, but two rare and poorly known species, Marinellina flagellata and Redudasys fornerise, are known from fresh water. The Chaetonotida comprises both marine and freshwater species.|$|E
500|$|English-language {{writings}} have conventionally treated nemertean as [...] "primitive" [...] acoelomate bilaterians {{that are}} most closely related to flatworms (<b>Platyhelminthes).</b> These pre-cladistics analyses emphasised as shared features: multiciliated (with multiple cilia per cell), glandular epidermis; rod-shaped secretory bodies or rhabdites; frontal glands or organs; protonephridia; and acoelomate body organization. However, multiciliated epidermal cells and epidermal gland cells are also found in Ctenophora, Echiura, Sipuncula, Annelida, Mollusca and other taxa. The rhabdites of nemertea have a different structure from those of flatworms at the microscopic scale. The frontal glands or organs of flatworms vary a lot in structure, and similar structures appear in small marine annelids and entoproct larvae. The protonephridia of nemertea and flatworms are different in structure, and in position – the flame cells of nemertea are usually in {{the walls of the}} fluid vessels and are served by [...] "drains" [...] from which the wastes exit by a small number of tubes through the skin, while the flame cells of flatworms are scattered throughout the body. Rigorous comparisons show no synapomorphies of nemertean and platyhelminth nephridia.|$|E

2500|$|In biology, [...] "worm" [...] {{refers to}} an {{obsolete}} taxon, vermes, used by Carolus Linnaeus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck for all non-arthropod invertebrate animals, now seen to be paraphyletic. The name stems from the Old English word [...] Most animals called [...] "worms" [...] are invertebrates, but the term is also used for the amphibian caecilians and the slowworm Anguis, a legless burrowing lizard. Invertebrate animals commonly called [...] "worms" [...] include annelids (earthworms and marine polychaete or bristle worms), nematodes (roundworms), <b>platyhelminthes</b> (flatworms), marine nemertean worms ("bootlace worms"), marine Chaetognatha (arrow worms), priapulid worms, and insect larvae such as grubs and maggots.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} fish, coral reef fish harbour parasites. Since coral reef fish are {{characterized}} by high biodiversity, parasites of coral reef fish show tremendous variety. Parasites of coral reef fish include nematodes, <b>Platyhelminthes</b> (cestodes, digeneans, and monogeneans), leeches, parasitic crustaceans such as isopods and copepods, and various microorganisms such as myxosporidia and microsporidia. [...] Some of these fish parasites have heteroxenous life cycles (i.e. they have several hosts) among which sharks (certain cestodes) or molluscs (digeneans). The high biodiversity of coral reefs increases {{the complexity of the}} interactions between parasites and their various and numerous hosts. Numerical estimates of parasite biodiversity have shown that certain coral fish species have up to 30 species of parasites.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{definite}} {{limit to}} the contexts in which terms may be modified to qualify each other in such combinations. Generally the modifier term is truncated and an [...] "o" [...] or an [...] "i" [...] is added in prefixing it to the qualified term. For example, a view of an animal from an aspect at once dorsal and lateral {{might be called a}} [...] "dorsolateral" [...] view; and the effect of dorsolateral flattening in an organism such as a krait gives its body a triangular cross section. Again, in describing the morphology of an organ or habitus of an animal such as many of the <b>Platyhelminthes,</b> one might speak of it as [...] "dorsiventrally" [...] flattened as opposed to bilaterally flattened animals such as ocean sunfish.|$|E
