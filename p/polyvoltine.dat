40|$|The silkworm, Bombyx mori is a lepidopteron insect {{by virtue}} of its {{economic}} importance for over a century has been used in many genetical experiments in several countries,especially China, India, Japan, Soviet Russia, Korea and many Southeast Asian and European countries. Many of the economic traits of this insect are known to be controlled by large number of polygenes. The silkwormvarieties include univoltines, bivoltine and <b>polyvoltines</b> races. These races are utilized by silkwormgeneticists to programme crossing and selection experiments. Since, silkworm races are open genetic system crossing and hybridization experiment through out the world resulted in the evolution of new breeds and hybrids. However, the gene expression in Bombyx mori is known to be greatly influenced by environmental factors because of long course of domestication. It is important that the estimates of genetic variability in the breeding materials and the magnitude of genetic effects governing the yield and other economically important attributes and unbiased estimates of other genetic parameters are highly useful for a successful breeding programme.

40|$|Heat shock {{proteins}} (HSPs) {{are known}} to play ecological and evolutionary roles in this postgenomic era. Recent research suggests that HSPs are implicated in cardiovascular biology and disease development, proliferation and regulation of cancer cells, cell death via apoptosis, and several other key cellular functions. These activities have generated great interest amongst cell and molecular biologists, and these biologists are keen to unravel other hitherto unknown potential functions of this group of proteins. Consequently, the biological significance of HSPs has led to cloning and characterization of genes encoding HSPs in many organisms including the silkworm, Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae). However, {{most of the past}} investigations in B. mori were confined to expression of HSPs in tissues and cell lines, whereas information on their specific functional roles in biological, physiological, and molecular processes is scarce. Naturally occurring or domesticated <b>polyvoltines</b> (known to be the tropical race) are more resistant to high temperatures and diseases than bi- or univoltines (temperate races). The mechanism of ecological or evolutionary modification of HSPs during the course of domestication of B. mori - particularly in relation to thermotolerance in geographically distinct races/strains - is still unclear. In addition, the heat shock response, thermal acclimation, and hardening have not been studied extensively in B. mori compared to other organisms. Towards this, recent investigations on differential expression of HSPs at various stages of development, considering the concept of the whole organism, open ample scope to evaluate their biological and commercial importance in B. mori which has not been addressed in any of the representative organisms studied so far. Comparatively, heat shock response among different silkworm races/strains of poly-, bi-, and univoltines varies significantly and thermotolerance increases as the larval development proceeds. Hence, this being the first review in this area, an attempt has been made to collate all available information on the heat shock response, HSPs expression, associated genes, amino acid sequences, and acquired/unacquired thermotolerance. The aim is to present this as a valuable resource for addressing the gap in knowledge and understanding evolutionary significance of HSPs between domesticated (B. mori) and non-domesticated insects. It is believed that the information presented here will also help researchers/breeders to design appropriate strategies for developing novel strains for the tropics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 1. Among a great {{diversity}} of other strategies, insects have evolved polymodal emergence patterns that can increase {{survival in the}} face of annual variations in environmental conditions. Delia radicum L. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) is a <b>polyvoltine</b> pest that attacks several cultivated cruciferous species. At the time of emergence, most populations show a polymodal emergence of type A (i. e. all individuals that enter diapause in the same year terminate diapause the following growing season, and exhibit a bimodal emergence curve). This results in the occurrence of two sympatric phenotypes, early and late, which differ by the timing of adult emergence in both diapausing and non-diapausing generations. 2. In Brittany, D. radicum pupae can be heavily parasitised by three parasitoids, Aleochara bilineata Gyll. (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), Aleochara bipustulata L., and Trybliographa rapae (Hymenoptera: Eucoilidae). As in all parasitoids species, the successful development of both Aleochara species and T. rapae larvae depends mainly on the amount and quality of the food provided by the host. 3. The relationship between early and late host phenotype and (i) the parasitis...|$|E
40|$|Chrysomela tremula is a <b>polyvoltine</b> oligophagous leaf beetle {{responsible}} for massive attacks on poplar trees. This beetle {{is an important}} model for understanding mechanisms of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal toxins, because a resistant C. tremula strain {{has been found that}} can survive and reproduce on transgenic poplar trees expressing high levels of the Cry 3 Aa Bt toxin. Resistance to Cry 3 Aa in this strain is recessive and is controlled by a single autosomal locus. We used a larval midgut transcriptome for C. tremula to search for candidate resistance genes. We discovered a mutation in an ABC protein, member of the B subfamily homologous to P-glycoprotein, which is genetically linked to Cry 3 Aa resistance in C. tremula. Cultured insect cells heterologously expressing this ABC protein swell and lyse when incubated with Cry 3 Aa toxin. In light of previous findings in Lepidoptera implicating A subfamily ABC proteins as receptors for Cry 2 A toxins and C subfamily proteins as receptors for Cry 1 A and Cry 1 C toxins, this result suggests that ABC proteins may be targets of insecticidal three-domain Bt toxins in Coleoptera as well...|$|E
40|$|Tomato {{leaf miner}} (Tuta absoluta Meyrick) is {{extremely}} dangerous pest in tomato grown in greenhouses. The larvae of T. absoluta mine the leaves, damage the stems and bore in the fruits, causing significant losses. The {{control of the}} pest is difficult because of the hidden way of life of the larvae in the mines, the high reproductive potential, the <b>polyvoltine</b> development and occurrence of resistance to {{a great part of}} the insecticides. The use of synthetic sex pheromone is a modern ecological technique that is applied in the complex of practices against T. absoluta. During the period 2016 - 2017 experiments on indeterminate tomato varieties were carried at the Maritsa Vegetable Crops Institute - Plovdiv in order to be determined the possibilities of synthetic sex pheromone produced in Russia to reduce the density of the pest and control on it in unheated greenhouses. The synthetic sex pheromone 0, 5 mg/traps at a rate one trap per 20 m 2 significantly reduces the percentage of damaged plants, the average number of mines per leaf and the percentage of damaged fruits.

The inoculative introduction of the specific elder aphid Aphis sambuci L. (Homoptera: Aphididae) in late March 2002 and again in 2003 led to the complete hedgerow turning into an early and productive alternative prey reservoir for indigenous syrphids. The species Scaeva pyrastri (L.), S. selenetica (Meigen), Syrphus ribesii (L.), S. vitripennis Meigen, Epistrophe eligans (Harris), E. nitidicollis (Meigen), Platycheirus scutatus (Meigen), Eupeodes corollae (F.), Meligramma triangulifera (Zetterstedt) and Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer) developed on the elder hedgerow during the spring 2002 taking advantage of the aphid infestation. The season 2003 was characterised by a quite different species abundance pattern as, contrary to the previous year when both monovoltine and <b>polyvoltine</b> species were equally represented, the monovoltine syrphids (Epistrophe spp.) represented the dominant group exploiting the elder aphids.

40|$|Paralytic peptide binding {{proteins}} (PP-BP) are 30 KP {{proteins that}} show similarity to ENF binding proteins. The ENF-BP act as active regulators of ENF peptides. ENF peptides are multifunctional insect cytokines. The comparison of gene expression in diapause induced and non-diapause eggs at different time intervals after oviposition showed an upregulation of PP at 18 h {{as well as}} PP-BP at 12 and 18 h after oviposition along with few other genes. The current study has been taken up to investigate the role of PP as well as PP-BP in diapause induction in <b>polyvoltine</b> silkworms and to study the multigene organization of PP-BP in the Bombyx mori genome. The tissue specific expression analysis revealed that, PP-BP is highly expressed in fat body followed by egg and brain while no expression was observed in mid-gut.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{subfamily}} Aphrodinae {{is represented}} in the Nearctic Region by eight species contained in a single tribe, Aphrodini, and genus Aphrodes. The external and internal morphology, biology and ecology of the Nearctic members of the genus Aphrodes were investigated. Distributional evidence indicates that six of the eight species, belonging to the subgenera Aphrodes and Anoscopus, have been introduced from the Palearctic Region, presumably via maritime shipping. These six species occur either within the West Coast and adjacent land area or the East Coast and Great Lakes region and adjacent land areas, or both. The other two species, belonging to the subgenus Stroggylocephalus, {{are believed to be}} indigenous to North America and are not known to occur elsewhere. These two species have been recorded from numerous North American localities between 35 °N and 58 °N latitude. The irregular distribution of Nearctic members of the subgenus Stroggylocephalus indicates that these species now exist as relict populations. Two species of the subgenus Stroggylocephalus are recorded from Europe with one, agrestis, reported as occurring in North America. However, records of agrestis in North America were not verified, and prior records are believed to be erroneous. A single female of the subgenus Stroggylocephalus from Kentucky apparently represents a new species, the third known from North America. The Nearctic species of Aphrodes are here assigned to three subgenera: Aphrodes s. s., Anoscopus and Stroggylocephalus. Species differentiation is based primarily on features of the male genitalia. The structure, length, and number of retrorse spines of the aedeagus is unique for each species. The structure of the pygofer hook and style, the shape and setation of the genital plate and the absence or presence of a secondary papilliform structure adjacent to the pygofer hook were found to be useful in discriminating between some species and species groups. Morphological differentiation of females of some species is nearly impossible. The number of dentations on valve II of the ovipositor was found to be unreliable for discriminating species or species groups, in contrast to Readio's findings (1922). Color and color pattern of the forewing, face and crown in males and some females were frequently found to be useful for recognition of some species and species groups even though considerable amounts of variation occur within a species. Wing venation is variable; the venation of the two forewings of the same insect are often different. However, the length of the forewing was found to be a reliable character for distinguishing members of Aphrodes s. s. and Stroggylocephalus from Anoscopus. Crown L:W ratios of the females are usually smaller than the males and ratios of both sexes are unreliable for species differentiation because of the amount of infras pecific variation. Evidence regarding anatomy of the reproductive organs of species of Aphrodes, studied for the purpose of comparison with representatives of other genera and subfamilies of leafhoppers, although limited in scope, provides information useful for species differentiation in sexually mature males. The structure of the reproductive tracts supports the conclusion that the species studied belong to a single genus Aphrodes, or at most to two genera, Aphrodes and Stroggylocephalus. The Nearctic species of the genus Aphrodes are characterized through illustrations, verbal descriptions and a diagnostic key. Infraspecific variation consists primarily of differences in color, color pattern and size. The male genitalia are relatively uniform with some minor differences occurring in the length and rugosity of the styles, rugosity and crenulations on the lateral margin and apex of the pygofer hooks, and length and position of the retrorse spines of the aedeagus. The nymphal instars of three species [...] A. bicinctus, albifrons and serratulae [...] are described. The color and color pattern were found to be distinct for each of these species from the second ins tar to the final molt. Field and laboratory studies demonstrate {{that at least some of}} the species of Aphrodes are polyphagous. Two species, serratulae and albifrons, appear to prefer grasses, but will also feed on clovers. Those Nearctic species of Aphrodes that have been studied with reference to habitat preference are found in such places as near the base of plants, in soil surface litter, and under or around rocks and boards. Members of Aphrodes s. s. and Anoscopus are univoltine, with a few females surviving the winter. Adults of Stroggylocephalus have been recorded during nearly every month which suggests a <b>polyvoltine</b> life cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{silkworm}} (Bombyx mori L.) is {{an insect}} {{belonging to the}} lepidopteran order, family Bombycidae: {{it is one of}} the two unique species belonging to the genus Bombyx, together with its ancestor – Bombyx mandarina Moore. In the past, silkworm exploitation in Europe was particularly related to the agricultural sector and the production of the silk thread but this type of activity has being disappearing from the old continent, in favour of some Asian countries, especially China, where cost of labour is low. In spite of the decline of these traditional activities the silkworm started to be used as a tool in a lot of technological applications and as a model in scientific research in various fields. Silk is regarded as a promising biomaterial because of its physical and chemical features both on the macro and microscale as well as in nano-technologies. Furthermore biology and biotechnology are interested in silkworm, or in its cell cultures, as a bioreactor to produce recombinant proteins which should otherwise be produced in bacteria or yeasts. The silkworm has a suitable size even for complex experiments with respect to other organisms used for the same aims, however it does not require large rearing rooms or high quantity of food, it can be easily reared under controlled conditions and its biological cycle is short (it lasts about 45 days), representing thus, also a model for basic research in life sciences. Moreover, to use the silkworm as a technological platform, important steps were achieved by sequencing the whole genome and by developing new optimized artificial diets for this insect (strictly monophagous), which freed rearing from seasonal constraints coming from mulberry leaf production in temperate climates. Thus, the above-mentioned new potentialities and a revived interest from the textile industry, about a silk supply chain outside Asia, establish the background of the research work described in this thesis. In fact, performed experiments relate with relaunching basic research activities about B. mori and aimed at meeting the needs of a silk industry, possibly developing in temperate countries. The starting material, that is the B. mori strains, belongs to the germplasm collection of Consiglio per la Ricerca e la sperimentazione in Agricoltura – Unità di ricerca di Apicoltura e Bachicoltura (CRA-API) of Padua and consists of about 200 strains, which differ in their phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. From the aforementioned collection, a selection process based on a mixed rearing strategy on both mulberry leaves and artificial diet has been started. The final goal was to select new strains characterized by high nutritional efficiency in order to optimize the cost-benefit ratio in all those application oriented to productivity. As already stated selection was based on a mixed approach: the first and more traditional step consisted in rearing silkworm larvae on mulberry leaf without any limitation in its quantity, by selecting only for the most important commercial parameters. On the other hand, the second step was a rearing cycle on artificial diet with a limited food amount fed to fifth instar larvae, followed by a selection process according to the most important productive traits. After three years and six generations of selection and genetic improvement, the obtained strains were compared among each other and with the unselected populations on the base of nutritional indexes which permitted an assessment of their conversion efficiency of proteins contained in the food matrix to body mass and silk. The final evaluation allowed to highlight the efficacy of the adopted strategy in selecting the desired features, although a difference related to diverse adaptability of the strains to the diet was recorded. In particular, for some of them, an additional preparatory step of selection on diet appears to be appropriate. During the period when experiments aimed at selection of highly efficient strains were performed, other relevant experimental data were produced. First of all, a new micro-organism which proved itself to be pathogenic for the silkworm reared on artificial diet was isolated and characterized; then, in-depth measurements about cold hardiness of eggs of a <b>polyvoltine</b> silkworm strain belonging to CRA-API’s collection were carried out. Described results to date do not represent the final goal but, an intermediate stage of a selection process that will continue at CRA-API and also, the starting point for the production of new hybrids with improved performances and suited to be reared on both mulberry leaf and artificialdiet...|$|E
