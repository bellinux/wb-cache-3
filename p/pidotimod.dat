40|$|Despite {{the use of}} {{antibiotics}} and vaccines, the frequency of respiratory tract infections is still high and these infections interest {{a wide range of}} patients, from children to aged people, including in particular these extreme categories because of the deficiency of their immune system, due to immaturity in the former case and to "immunosenescence" in the latter. For that reason immunostimulant drugs are getting more important to prevent and to attenuate infections. <b>Pidotimod</b> (3 -L-pyroglutamyl-L-thiazolidine- 4 carboxylic acid) is a synthetic dipeptide with immunomodulatory properties. We reviewed studies conducted on different categories of patients, with particular attention on children and senile patients suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections, associated, or not, with asthma or COPD. The outcomes considered are both clinical and laboratory parameters. The common end-point of these studies is that <b>Pidotimod</b> has an immunomodulatory activity which is able both to improve the clinical conditions of patients and to enhance and stimulate their immunity cells (lymphocytes but not only) functions acting on adaptive and innate immunity. <b>Pidotimod</b> is also able to increase the concentration of salivary IgA directed against bacteria; furthermore, it can modulate airway epithelial cells functions up-regulating the expression of toll-like receptors and acting on adhesion molecules. According to studies conducted on patients with atopic asthma, it seems that <b>Pidotimod</b> could affect T-lymphocytes balance with a possible addictional anti-allergic activity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated an improvement of FEV 1 and PEF in asthmatic patients treated with <b>Pidotimod.</b> Main clinical outcomes are the reduction of the number of infectious episodes, lesser severity of signs and symptoms and, consequently, a reduction in use {{of antibiotics}} and symptomatic drugs, less working and school days lost, less mortality and morbidity. The studies considered give positive results, confirming Pidotimod's efficacy. Furthermore, many studies show a good safety profile of the drug, without recording serious adverse events and mutagenic potential, and a very low incidence of side effects. <b>Pidotimod</b> is also a more safe solution in patients subjected to vaccination, if compared to lyophilized polibacterial, which can't be administered for thirty days before vaccination...|$|E

The efficacy of <b>pidotimod</b> was studied in frequently sick children; {{its influence on}} the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines with leucocytes in peripheral blood was evaluated. The study was performed ex vivo with 15 samples of peripheral blood of frequently sick children 4 years old. The rate of interferon (IFN) status, sensitivity to <b>pidotimod,</b> concentration of pro-inflammatory (IFN, Interleukin [Il] 18) and anti-inflammatory (Il 4, 10) cytokines were detected before and after processing the samples with the drug. Pidotimodex vivo induced more than 4 times increase of initially low production of IFN with leucocytes of peripheral blood (from 11. 5 ± 3. 4 to 51. 8 ± 8. 3 U/ml). It did not influence the production of IFN _ (432 ± 49 and 448 ± 30 U/ml — before and after processing the samples correspondingly). The drug stimulated production of IFN ex vivo; the concentration of IFN compared to its spontaneous production increased from 2. 3 ± 0. 9 to 11. 8 ± 1. 6 picogram/ml correspondingly. Stimulation of PGA-induced production of IFN was less expressed; it increased in correlation with the time of exposition 1. 5 – 2. 5 times higher compared to induction of IFN synthesis without the drug.

METHODS: Databases were searched for any published and ongoing studies of respiratory tract diseases in children and adults with Down's syndrome. These databases were searched for controlled trials, cohort studies and controlled before-after studies. Trial registries were searched for ongoing studies. Initially, all study types were included to provide a broad overview of the existing evidence base. However, those with a critical risk of bias were excluded using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: A total of 13, 575 records were identified from which 5 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and 3 fulfilled our criteria for data extraction. One randomized controlled trial of moderate risk of bias compared zinc therapy with placebo. Outcome data were only reported for 50 (78 %) children who presented with extreme symptoms; no benefit of zinc therapy was found. One non-randomized controlled trial with serious risk of bias included 26 children and compared <b>pidotimod</b> (an immunostimulant) with no treatment; <b>pidotimod</b> was associated with fewer upper RTI recurrences compared with no treatment (1. 43 vs. 3. 82).

40|$|Respiratory tract {{infections are}} one of the most common {{childhood}} illnesses, especially in pre-school children. These infections impose an enormous burden on both the healthcare system (frequent medical consultations and hospitalizations), and on society (parental absenteeism and loss of productivity). Their recurrence still poses a diagnostic challenge in pediatrics due to the difficulty in discriminating between otherwise healthy children and those with more serious underlying pathologies. Moreover, even if viral agents are typically the main cause being responsible of up to 95 % of all upper respiratory tract infections, high antibiotic prescription is often reported in clinical practice. It is well known that frequent inappropriate antibiotic use has now led to a significant increase in bacterial resistance. In this context immunostimulants could be a promising preventive approach.

The pulmonary function detector was used to detect FEV 1, FVC, and PEF. Follow-up visits were paid to record the asthma attack times, readmission rate, re-first aid rate, and first aid times after discharge within 1 year. Results: IgA and IgG after treatment in the two groups were significantly elevated (P 0. 05). The elevated degree of IgA and IgG in the observation group was significantly greater than that in the control group (P< 0. 05). FEV 1 (L), FVC (L), and PEF (L/min) after treatment in the two groups were significantly elevated when compared with before treatment (P< 0. 05). The elevated degree of FEV 1, FVC, and PEF in the observation group was significantly greater than that in the control group (P< 0. 05). The asthma attack times, readmission rate, re-first aid rate, and first aid times after discharge within 1 year in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: The routine treatment in combined with montelukast can better effectively control the symptoms in children with asthma, and improve the pulmonary function. After discharge, the extended care can be more beneficial to control the asthma attack, and enhance the living quality...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pidotimod</b> (3 -L-pyroglutamyl-L-thiaziolidine- 4 -carboxylic acid) (PDT) is a {{synthetic}} dipeptide with in vitro and in vivo immunomodulatory properties {{that is largely}} used for treatment and prevention of infections in paediatric and disease-prone patients. However, the effects of PDT on cellular immune responses are still poorly characterized {{and there is little}} information on the mechanism of action of this compound. It has been speculated that PDT action may be exerted through the interaction with a Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR). Therefore, to gain a further understanding of the immune pathways involved by PDT, we first decided to investigate whether PDT could modify the immune response triggered by TLR ligands. Monocytic cells were exposed to PDT then stimulated with a panel of TLR agonists. Under these experimental conditions, we observed a significant decrease in the synthesis of key proinflammatory mediators in comparison to the production observed in TLR-stimulated cells that were not treated with PDT. Using RT² Profiler PCR Array we have observed that PDT specifically up-regulates the expression of the NOD-like receptor NLRP 12 mRNA {{in the absence of any}} further costimulation. Increase of NLRP 12 in cells treated with PDT was confirmed using specifically designed real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting assays where a clear increase in the amount of NLRP 12 protein was detected. Furthermore, in myeloid/monocytic cells we demonstrated that PDT treatment counteracts the NLRP 12 reduction induced by TLR agonists. Finally, the results obtained using NLRP 12 silenced cells showed that down-regulation of the proinflammatory function occurring in PDT-treated cells upon interaction with TLRs is associated with the increased levels of NLRP 12 induced by PDT. To our knowledge this is the first evidence of an immunomodulatory peptide that upregulates NLRP 12 and, through this molecule, antagonizes the TLR-induced inflammatory response. These results pave the way for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at controlling different pathological settings such as tumorigenesis, systemic inflammatory processes and autoimmunity, where NLRP 12 plays a crucial role...|$|E
