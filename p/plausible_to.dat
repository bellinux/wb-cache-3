5|$|There {{were several}} {{differences}} between Sullivan's adaptation and Stevenson's novella. Stevenson used multiple narrators and a circular narrative (allowing material {{presented at the}} end to explain material presented at the beginning), but Sullivan wrote a linear narrative in chronological order. This linear approach and the onstage action conveyed a stronger impression of realism, eliminating uncertainties in Stevenson's narrative. Although making the story more straightforward and less ambiguous was not necessary for a theatrical adaptation, Sullivan's approach {{was typical of the}} era's stage melodramas and made the material more acceptable to audiences. The stage presentation's realism also allowed Sullivan to drop the novella's scientific aspects. Although Stevenson used science to make the Jekyll-Hyde transformation <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> readers, Sullivan could rely on the onstage transformation.|$|E
5|$|Continuity-based {{theories}} {{are held by}} a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition, whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation. Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen. Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years and that: Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit {{the trauma of the}} Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that the}} natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E

5|$|Bones in the {{secondary}} burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> assume that the distribution process {{was the result of}} symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to {{the secondary}} burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Studies such as Belief in Conspiracy Theories {{state that}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{relating to the}} assassination of JFK, the moon landing and the September 11th attacks are united by a common thread: distrust of the government-endorsed story.

Someone with a distrust of the government will likely reject any and all stories or reports directly issued by state agencies or other authorities that are {{seen as part of}} the establishment.

25|$|The name swamp adder is an invented one, and the {{scientific}} treatises of Doyle's time do not mention any kind of adder of India. To fans of Sherlock Holmes who enjoy treating the stories as altered accounts of real events, the true identity of this snake has been a puzzle {{since the publication of}} the story, even to professional herpetologists. Many species of snakes have been proposed for it, and Richard Lancelyn Green concludes the Indian Cobra (Naja naja) is the snake which it most closely resembles, rather than Boa constrictor, which is not venomous. The Indian cobra has black and white speckled marks, {{and is one of the}} most lethal of the Indian venomous snakes with a neurotoxin which will often kill in a few minutes. It is also a good climber and is used by snake charmers in India. Snakes are deaf in the conventional sense but have vestiges to sense vibrations and low-frequency airborne sounds, making it remotely <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> signal a snake by whistling.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mention of}} a Capitoline triad refers to the Capitolium Vetus. The only ancient source who refers to the {{presence}} of this divine triad in Greece is Pausanias X 5, 1-2, who mentions its existence in describing the Φωκικόν in Phocis. The Capitoline triad poses difficult interpretative problems. It looks peculiarly Roman, since there is no sure document of its existence elsewhere either in Latium or Etruria. A direct Greek influence is possible but it would be also <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> consider it a local creation. Dumézil advanced the hypothesis it could be an ideological construction of the Tarquins to oppose new Latin nationalism, as it included the three gods that in the Iliad are enemies of Troy. It is probable Latins had already accepted the legend of Aeneas as their ancestor. Among ancient sources indeed Servius states that according to the Etrusca Disciplina towns should have the three temples of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva at the end of three roads leading to three gates. Vitruvius writes that the temples of these three gods should be located on the most elevated site, isolated from the other. To his Etruscan founders the meaning of this triad might have been related to peculiarly Etruscan ideas on the association of the three gods with the birth of Herakles and the siege of Troy, in which Minerva plays a decisive role as a goddess of destiny along with the sovereign couple Uni Tinia.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the overall}} literacy, the sources allow us only a rough image. In total, only around 5% of all known written records of Christian Nubia {{come from the}} domains of Alodia. The thought of Ochala, that {{northern}} Nubia produced more sources mostly because of its proximity to Egypt should be rejected, not only because, as he also says, the north is way more studied than the south, {{but also because of}} the fact that Alodia housed the very heartland of the former Meroitic kingdom, a kingdom which was considerable literate. It seems <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> suggest that like in other Medieval societies, the art of reading and writing was taught by the clerics to nobles and officials, but would the average population have had basic writing skills as well. In the case of Alodia, the latter can be attested by two types of sources: First, ostraca and other incised pottery as well as a few incised bricks predominantly coming from Soba and second, graffiti incised into former Meroitic monuments and sites. The graffiti from Meroitic sites have hitherto been largely ignored by scholars and therefore comprise only a fraction of all known written sources, but is a study in preparation now. Content-wise, all known inscriptions consist of personal names, names of saints (Often in the form of monograms) and short, predominantly religious, sentences. Except of graffiti, the Alodians also used to write books, which they did, according to the Fung Chronichle, in Greek, but commentated upon them in Nubian.|$|E

500|$|The cyclol {{model was}} {{consistent}} with the general properties then attributed to folded proteins. [...] (1) Centrifugation studies had shown that folded proteins were significantly denser than water (~1.4 g/mL) and, thus, tightly packed; Wrinch assumed that dense packing should imply regular packing. [...] (2) Despite their large size, some proteins crystallize readily into symmetric crystals, consistent with the idea of symmetric faces that match up upon association. [...] (3) Proteins bind metal ions; since metal-binding sites must have specific bond geometries (e.g., octahedral), it was <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> assume that the entire protein also had similarly crystalline geometry. [...] (4) As described above, the cyclol model provided a simple chemical explanation of denaturation and the difficulty of cleaving folded proteins with proteases. (5) Proteins were assumed to be responsible for the synthesis of all biological molecules, including other proteins. [...] Wrinch noted that a fixed, uniform structure would be useful for proteins in templating their own synthesis, analogous to the Watson-Francis Crick concept of DNA templating its own replication. [...] Given that many biological molecules such as sugars and sterols have a hexagonal structure, it was <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> assume that their synthesizing proteins likewise had a hexagonal structure.

500|$|A few radical {{philosophers}} like Xenophanes of Colophon {{were already}} beginning to label the poets' tales as blasphemous lies in the 6th century BC; Xenophanes had complained that Homer and Hesiod attributed to the gods [...] "all that is shameful and disgraceful among men; they steal, commit adultery, and deceive one another". This line of thought found its most sweeping expression in Plato's Republic and Laws. Plato created his own allegorical myths (such as the vision of Er in the Republic), attacked the traditional tales of the gods' tricks, thefts and adulteries as immoral, and objected to their central role in literature. Plato's criticism was the first serious challenge to the Homeric mythological tradition, referring to the myths as [...] "old wives' chatter".

500|$|The Canadian {{historian}} Elliot Rose {{suggested that}} the reason that Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her [...] "imposing credentials" [...] {{as a member of}} staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy {{in the eyes of many}} readers. He further {{suggested that the}} Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed [...] "the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [...] Graves would be familiar with". Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it [...] "appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age", including [...] "the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. Related to this, the folklorist Jacqueline Simpson suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a [...] "sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument" [...] between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like Montague Summers, who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers.

Lucan borrowed £4,000 from his mother and asked Marcia Tucker for a loan of £100,000. Having no luck there, he wrote to Tucker's son, explaining how he wished to [...] "buy" [...] his children from Veronica; the money was not forthcoming. He turned to his friends and acquaintances, asking anyone <b>plausible</b> <b>to</b> loan him money to fund his gambling addiction. The financier James Goldsmith guaranteed a £5,000 overdraft for him, which for years remained unpaid. Lucan also applied to the discreet Edgware Trust. On request, he supplied details of his income, which was apparently around £12,000 a year from various family trusts. He was required to provide a surety and received only £3,000 of the £5,000 he asked for. Much to their managers' consternation, his four bank accounts were overdrawn; Coutts, £2,841; Lloyds, £4,379; National Westminster, £1,290; Midland, £5,667. Even though by then he was playing for much lower stakes than had previously been the case, Lucan's gambling remained completely out of control.
