The aggregate must be of good quality, free of dust and other debris, and dry.

The separator itself may be a polymer, such as a microporous film of polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP); thus, even when the cell has a liquid electrolyte, it will still contain a [...] "polymer" [...] component. In addition to this, the positive electrode can be further decomposed in three parts: the lithium-transition-metal-oxide (such as LiCoO2 or LiMn2O4), a conductive additive, and a <b>polymer</b> <b>binder</b> of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF). The negative electrode material may have the same three parts, only with carbon replacing the lithium-metal-oxide.|$|E

50|$|Another {{nanoparticle}} {{approach is}} using conducting polymers {{as both the}} binder and the additive for nanoparticle batteries. One study examined a three-dimensional conducting polymer and hydrogel network inside which silicon nanoparticles reside. The framework resulted in a marked improvement in electrode stability, with over 90% capacity retention after 5,000 cycles. However, the potential for inexpensive scale up has not been thoroughly investigated. Researchers at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland offered another potential solution, utilizing slurry coating techniques - which are currently employed at large scales for electrode production - with a conducting <b>polymer</b> <b>binder.</b> In general, the conducting polymer additive provides both mechanical stabilization and an avenue for conduction, replacing the conventional two-material system of a polymer stabilizer and carbon black particles. The substitution allows both better stabilization and better conduction.|$|E
50|$|Several metal {{consolidation}} {{techniques are}} used to produce the final product. Metal injection moulding (MIM) otherwise known as powder injection moulding is a well-established and cost-effective method of fabricating small-to-moderate size metal components in large quantities. It {{is derived from the}} method plastic injection moulding, whereby mixing of a metal powder with a <b>polymer</b> <b>binder</b> forms the feedstock, which is then injected into a mould, after which the binder is removed via heat treatment under vacuum before final sintering. With titanium however, the binders used in MIM results in the introduction of carbon into the matrix due to insufficient binder removal prior to sintering and/or deleterious reactions between the decomposing binder, the debinding atmosphere, and the metal phase. This results in titanium parts with mechanical properties unsuited for critical aerospace applications, but suitable for parts where tensile and impact properties are less important. Recently, work has been carried out to reduce the binder to < 8% volume fraction, resulting in the complete removal of the binder from the moulded component during heat treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Solid {{propellants}} {{are either}} [...] "composites" [...] composed mostly of large, distinct macroscopic particles or single-, double-, or triple-bases (depending {{on the number}} of primary ingredients), which are homogeneous mixtures of one or more primary ingredients. Composites typically consist of a mixture of granules of solid oxidizer (examples: ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate, potassium nitrate) in a <b>polymer</b> <b>binder</b> (binding agent) with flakes or powders of energetic compounds (examples: RDX, HMX), metallic additives (examples: aluminium, beryllium), plasticizers, stabilizers, and/or burn rate modifiers (iron oxide, copper oxide). Single-, double-, or triple-bases are mixtures of the fuel, oxidizer, binders, and plasticizers that are macroscopically indistinguishable and often blended as liquids and cured in a single batch. Often, the ingredients of a double-base propellant have multiple roles such as RDX which is both a fuel and oxidizer or nitrocellulose which is a fuel, oxidizer, and plasticizer. Further complicating categorization, there are many propellants that contain elements of double-base and composite propellants, which often contain some amount of energetic additives homogeneously mixed into the binder. In the case of gunpowder (a pressed composite without a polymeric binder) the fuel is charcoal, the oxidizer is potassium nitrate, and sulphur serves as a catalyst. (Note: sulphur is not a true catalyst in gunpowder as it is consumed to a great extent into a variety of reaction products such as K2S.) During the 1950s and 60s researchers in the United States developed ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP). This mixture is typically 69-70% finely ground ammonium perchlorate (an oxidizer), combined with 16-20% fine aluminium powder (a fuel), held together in a base of 11-14% polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN) or Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (polybutadiene rubber fuel). The mixture is formed as a thickened liquid and then cast into the correct shape and cured into a firm but flexible load-bearing solid. Historically the tally of APCP solid propellants is relatively small. The military, however, uses a wide variety of different types of solid propellants some of which exceed the performance of APCP. A comparison of the highest specific impulses achieved with the various solid and liquid propellant combinations used in current launch vehicles is given in the article on solid-fuel rockets.|$|E

40|$|Low-volume roads with an AADT {{less than}} 3000 make up 90 % of the Norwegian road network. Although {{considerable}} effort {{is being made}} to improve its quality, deterioration of existing low-volume roads is a significant concern. There are many deterioration mechanisms which affect Norwegian low-volume roads. The literature study conducted for this thesis found that permanent deformation and rutting in the asphalt pavement caused by heavy traffic loads and climatic conditions {{one of the most}} substantial types of distress on low-volume roads. Polymer modification of bitumen has been shown to improve the stability of asphalt pavements and significantly reduce rutting. The literature regarding use of polymer modified bitumen on low-volume roads is, however, limited. This study will investigate the effect polymer modification of bitumen has on the deformation characteristics of low-traffic asphalt pavements. Low-volume roads with a high percentage of heavy vehicles are exposed to greater traffic loads than regular low-volume roads. To increase pavement lifetime, it is possible to use <b>polymer</b> modified <b>binder</b> instead of neat bitumen. Research reviewed during the work for this thesis show improved resistance to permanent deformation and rutting of asphalt mixtures containing polymer modified bitumen. To evaluate the potential polymer modified bitumen has for use in pavements for low-volume roads with considerable amounts of heavy traffic, an experimental program was carried out. Performance Grading of two <b>polymer</b> modified <b>binders</b> and two neat bitumens was done, and Multiple Stress Creep Recovery Test was conducted to evaluate and compare the two <b>polymer</b> modified <b>binders</b> under heavy traffic loading. Wheel Track testing of AC 11 mixtures with neat and polymer modified bitumen was used to assess the effect of <b>polymer</b> modified <b>binder</b> has on rutting resistance. The results of the PG-classification show that the two <b>polymer</b> modified <b>binders</b> meet the criteria for permanent deformation resistance at both higher and lower temperatures for rutting and low-temperature cracking respectively than the neat bitumens.
