40|$|Whole-house {{surveillance}} for healthcare-associated {{infection is}} no longer the recommended practice because of the large personnel time investment required. We developed a computer-based tracking system using microbiologic data as an aid in detecting potential outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections on a hospital-wide basis. Monthly total isolates of 25 clinically significant hospital pathogens were tallied from 1991 to 1998 to form a database for future comparison. Two different algorithm tools (based on increases of organism numbers over baseline) were applied to determine alert thresholds for <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreaks</b> using this information. The first algorithm (2 SD) defined an alert as two standard deviations above the mean monthly number of isolates. The second (MI) defined an alert as either a 100 % increase from the baseline organism number over 2 months or a ≥ 50 % increase (compared to baseline) during a three-consecutive-month period. These two methods were compared to standard infection control professional surveillance (ICP) for the detection of clonal outbreaks over 12 months. Overall, a total of seven clonal outbreaks were detected during the 1 -year study. Using standard methods, ICP investigated nine <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> four of which were associated with clonal microbes. The 2 SD method signaled a <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreak</b> 15 times, of which three were clonal and ICP had detected one. The MI method signaled a <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreak</b> 30 times; four of these were clonal, and ICP had detected one. The sensitivity and specificity values for ICP, 2 SD, and MI for detecting clonal outbreaks were 57, 43, and 57 % and 17, 83, and 67 %, respectively. Statistical methods applied to clinical microbiology laboratory information system data efficiently supplement infection control efforts for outbreak detection...|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} that clinicians promptly report all cases of suspected or confirmed meningococcal disease to local public health authorities and that the serogroup of the meningococcal strain involved be identified.
