5|$|Mainstream <b>parallel</b> {{programming}} languages remain either explicitly <b>parallel</b> or (at best) partially implicit, {{in which}} a programmer gives the compiler directives for parallelization. A few fully implicit <b>parallel</b> programming languages exist—SISAL, <b>Parallel</b> Haskell, SequenceL, System C (for FPGAs), Mitrion-C, VHDL, and Verilog.|$|E

5|$|Plasticity: The synapses between <b>parallel</b> {{fibers and}} Purkinje cells, and the synapses between mossy fibers and deep nuclear cells, are both {{susceptible}} to modification of their strength. In a single cerebellar module, input from {{as many as}} a billion <b>parallel</b> fibers converges onto a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells, and the influence of each <b>parallel</b> fiber on those nuclear cells is adjustable. This arrangement gives tremendous flexibility for fine-tuning the relationship between the cerebellar inputs and outputs.|$|E

50|$|By scaling the {{resulting}} map, two <b>parallels</b> {{can be assigned}} unit scale, with scale decreasing between the two <b>parallels</b> and increasing outside them. This gives the map two standard <b>parallels.</b> In this way, deviation from unit scale can be minimized within a region of interest that lies largely between the two standard <b>parallels.</b> Unlike other conic projections, no true secant form of the projection exists because using a secant cone does not yield the same scale along both standard <b>parallels.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{opposite}} of convergence is divergent evolution, where related species evolve different traits. Convergent evolution {{is similar to}} but different from <b>parallel</b> evolution. <b>Parallel</b> evolution occurs when two independent but similar species evolve {{in the same direction}} and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, gliding frogs have evolved in <b>parallel</b> from multiple types of tree frog.|$|E

5|$|Walter (John Noble) has {{prepared}} himself to reveal to Peter (Joshua Jackson) the truththat {{he is from}} the <b>parallel</b> universewhen they are called to a case. Two teenagers were found dead, evidently killed by shapeshifter agents from the <b>parallel</b> universe. Exploring the nearby area, they find a third unformed shapeshifter which Walter takes to the lab to study. At the same time of the teenagers' death, they find a carrier signal in the local television. With biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic's help, they determine that the signal emanated from the <b>parallel</b> universe during a brief moment that the two universes were in sync, and that the next point of synchronization would occur the next afternoon. Recalling Thomas Jerome Newton's (Sebastian Roché) previous attempt to bring a building from the <b>parallel</b> universe into the prime, the Fringe team believes they must stop this next attempt.|$|E
5|$|When {{two species}} {{are similar in}} a {{particular}} character, evolution is defined as <b>parallel</b> if the ancestors were also similar, and convergent if they were not. Some scientists have argued {{that there is a}} continuum between <b>parallel</b> and convergent evolution, while others maintain that despite some overlap, there are still important distinctions between the two.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parallel</b> plate {{separators}} {{are similar}} to API separators but they include tilted <b>parallel</b> plate assemblies (also known as <b>parallel</b> packs). The <b>parallel</b> plates provide more surface for suspended oil droplets to coalesce into larger globules. Such separators still depend upon the specific gravity between the suspended oil and the water. However, the <b>parallel</b> plates enhance the degree of oil-water separation. The result is that a <b>parallel</b> plate separator requires significantly less space than a conventional API separator {{to achieve the same}} degree of separation.|$|E

25|$|On map {{projections}} {{there is}} no universal rule as to how meridians and <b>parallels</b> should appear. The examples below show the named <b>parallels</b> (as red lines) on the commonly used Mercator projection and the Transverse Mercator projection. On the former the <b>parallels</b> are horizontal and the meridians are vertical, whereas on the latter {{there is no}} exact relationship of <b>parallels</b> and meridians with horizontal and vertical: both are complicated curves.|$|R
50|$|A {{convenient}} {{source of}} the <b>parallels</b> is Thomas Keightley devotes his Chapter VII of his Tales and Popular Fictions (1834) boasting he has made the largest compilation of these <b>parallels,</b> though {{he was not the}} first to make note of the <b>parallels</b> in published form.|$|R

25|$|ALGOL 68 {{supports}} programming of <b>parallel</b> processing. Using the keyword par, a collateral clause {{is converted}} to a <b>parallel</b> clause, where the synchronisation of actions is controlled using semaphores. In A68G the <b>parallel</b> actions are mapped to threads when available on the hosting operating system. In A68S a different paradigm of <b>parallel</b> processing was implemented (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is {{further complicated by}} the traditional uses of the terms <b>parallel</b> and distributed algorithm that do not quite match the above definitions of <b>parallel</b> and distributed systems (see below for more detailed discussion). Nevertheless, {{as a rule of}} thumb, high-performance <b>parallel</b> computation in a shared-memory multiprocessor uses <b>parallel</b> algorithms while the coordination of a large-scale distributed system uses distributed algorithms.|$|E
50|$|While a {{projection}} with equally spaced <b>parallels</b> {{is possible for}} an ellipsoidal model, {{it would no longer}} be equidistant because the distance between <b>parallels</b> on an ellipsoid is not constant. More complex formulae can be used to create an equidistant map whose <b>parallels</b> reflect the true spacing.|$|R
