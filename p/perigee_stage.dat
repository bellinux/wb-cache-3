5000|$|When {{launched}} by the U.S. Space Shuttle a solid propellant <b>perigee</b> <b>stage</b> (motor and carrier) would {{be attached to the}} bottom of the spacecraft. This carrier was used to mount the satellite into a cradle in the Space Shuttle cargo bay. The satellite was ejected from the space shuttle [...] "Frisbee-style" [...] which imparted a stabilizing spin to the satellite. The satellite was allowed to drift a safe distance from the space shuttle before the perigee motor was fired. The perigee motor provided energy (velocity) to the satellite to raise the apogee of the satellite's orbit; it is named for the location in the orbit at which it is used. The perigee motor was jettisoned after it was used. The liquid fuel apogee engines of the Intelsat VI satellites were then used to boost the perigee of the satellite and provide orbit circularization through apogee burns.|$|E
50|$|The Long March 2E was {{the first}} in the Long March rocket family to {{introduce}} liquid rocket boosters, as well as a solid rocket <b>perigee</b> kick <b>stage,</b> to improve its GTO payload capacity to satisfy the domestic and international launch market in the 1990s. It was first launched in 1992.|$|R
40|$|Two {{deployable}} arms, named grabbers, {{were designed}} and manufactured to provide lateral {{stability of the}} <b>perigee</b> spinning <b>stage</b> which will be deployed from the Space Shuttle cargo bay. The spinning stage {{is supported by a}} spin table on a cradle at its base. The Italian Research Interim Stage (IRIS) is designed to carry satellites of intermediate mass up to 900 kg. The requirements are defined and the mechanism is described. Functional test results are presented...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe paper {{describes}} a new GEO platform design {{with the special}} features of modularity and integrated transfer propulsion. It {{is a candidate for}} the 3000 kg-class of communication satellites required for the next decade INTELSAT VII and multi-nation (TVBS). The technical results of a study performed for the German Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT) are presented regarding the GEO platform and its performance in terms of communication payload and mission lifetime. The reference system design has a total launch mass of 14. 3 Mg (metric tons) in LEO including 10. 9 Mg transfer propellants mass. The initial mass in CEO is 3. 4 Mg allowing for 400 to 700 kg communication equipment, depending on power level, eclipse capability requirements (batteries) and mission lifetime. The launch vehicle for this platform is the Space Shuttle, the associated launch cost would be only 20 Mio. Dollars (1980), without additional cost for any type of <b>perigee</b> or transfer <b>stage.</b> The platform propels itself from LEO (300 km) to the geosynchronous orbit with a 6 impulse transfer, provided by a 5 kN engine (1100 lbs thrust level). This launch mode - although not being the optimum from the performance standpoint - proves to be the most economic one, compared to other alternatives, by example Shuttle + Centaur, with some 52 Mio. Dollars (80) total launch cost...|$|R
