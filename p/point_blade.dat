50|$|The switch {{consists}} of the pair of linked tapering rails, known as points (switch rails or <b>point</b> <b>blades),</b> lying between the diverging outer rails (the stock rails). These points can be moved laterally into one of two positions to direct a train coming from the <b>point</b> <b>blades</b> toward the straight path or the diverging path. A train moving from the narrow end toward the <b>point</b> <b>blades</b> (i.e. it will be directed {{to one of the}} two paths depending on the position of the points) is said to be executing a facing-point movement.|$|R

50|$|The points (switch rails or <b>point</b> <b>blades)</b> are the movable rails which {{guide the}} wheels towards either the {{straight}} or the diverging track. They are tapered on most switches, but on stub switches they have square ends.|$|R
50|$|Both knives have clip <b>point</b> <b>blades</b> made of SAE 1095 {{spring steel}} with a {{hardness}} of 55 HRC and are phosphate-treated. Spring steel offers a high yield strength for good impact resistance and flexibility but low corrosion resistance.|$|R
5000|$|... (S3) A drop <b>point</b> <b>blade</b> has a convex {{curve of}} the back towards the point. It handles much like the clip-point, though with a {{stronger}} point typically less suitable for piercing. Swiss army pocket knives often have drop-points on their larger blades.|$|E
5000|$|The Soldier Knife model 1961 has a 93 mm long knurled alox {{handle with}} the Swiss crest, a drop <b>point</b> <b>blade,</b> a reamer, a blade {{combining}} bottle opener, screwdriver, and wire stripper, and a combined can-opener and small screwdriver. The knife was 12 mm thick and weighed 72 g ...|$|E
50|$|A plate switch {{incorporates}} the tapered points {{of a typical}} switch into a self-contained plate. Each <b>point</b> <b>blade</b> is moved separately by hand. Plate switches are only used for double-flanged wheels, with wheels running through the plates on their flanges, guided by {{the edges of the}} plate and the moveable blade.|$|E
60|$|The guard--he {{was but a}} young man--took {{the dagger}} from His Eminence's hand, {{and looked at it}} attentively. Those who were nearest to him noticed that he {{suddenly}} started, and that the hand which held the narrow <b>pointed</b> <b>blade</b> trembled visibly.|$|R

50|$|Accessories {{supplied}} with the rifle include a 387 mm long 6H3 bayonet featuring a 200 mm long spear <b>point</b> <b>blade.</b> The AK-47 bayonet is installed by slipping the 17.7 mm diameter muzzle {{ring around the}} muzzle and latching the handle down on the bayonet lug under the front sight base.|$|E
50|$|On April 18, 1963, {{just two}} years after their incorporation, the Buck board of {{directors}} voted to authorize {{development of a new}} folding utility and hunting knife. The new design featured a sturdy locking mechanism and a substantial clip <b>point</b> <b>blade</b> suitable for butchering and skinning large game. This would become the world-famous Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter.|$|E
50|$|The soldier Knife model 1951 had fiber scales, {{nickel-silver}} bolsters, liners, and divider, and a spear <b>point</b> <b>blade.</b> This was {{the first}} Swiss Armed Forces issue model where the tools were made of stainless steel. The screwdriver now had a scraper arc on one edge. The knife was 93 mm long, 13.5 mm thick and weighed 90 g.|$|E
50|$|One typical {{artefact}} of the industry, {{once considered}} diagnostic, {{is a small}} <b>pointed</b> <b>blade</b> with a straight blunt back, known as the Gravette point. These were used to hunt big game including bison, horse, reindeer and mammoth. Gravettians also used nets to hunt small game.|$|R

50|$|A full grand union {{junction}} {{consists of}} 88 frogs (where one rail crosses another rail), and 32 switchpoints (<b>point</b> <b>blades)</b> if single-point switches are not used. A tram or train crossing the junction will encounter four or twenty frogs within {{the space of}} crossing the junction.|$|R
50|$|The Soldier Knife model 1908 had a clip-point blade {{rather than}} the 1890s spear <b>point</b> <b>blade,</b> still with the fiber scales, carbon steel tools, {{nickel-silver}} bolster, liners, and divider. The knife was 100 mm long, 16.5 mm thick and weighed 125 g. The contract with the Swiss Army split production equally between the Victorinox and Wenger companies.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Waldorf Loveless (January 2, 1929 - September 2, 2010), a.k.a. Bob Loveless or RW Loveless, was an American knife maker who {{designed}} and popularized the hollowground drop <b>point</b> <b>blade</b> {{and the use}} of full tapered tangs and screw-type handle scale fasteners within the art of knifemaking. He is cited by other knifemakers and collectors {{as one of the most}} innovative custom knife makers in the world.|$|E
5000|$|... (S7) A spey <b>point</b> <b>blade</b> (once {{used for}} neutering livestock) has a single, sharp, {{straight}} edge that curves strongly upwards {{at the end}} to meet a short, dull, straight point from the dull back. With the curved end of the blade being closer to perpendicular to the blade's axis than other knives and lacking a point, making penetration unlikely, spey blades are common on Trapper style pocketknives for skinning fur-bearing animals.|$|E
50|$|French estoc or English tuck was {{a type of}} {{sword in}} use from the 14th to 17th centuries. It is {{characterized}} as having a cruciform hilt with a grip for two handed use and a straight, edgeless but sharply <b>pointed</b> <b>blade</b> of around 0.91 m to 1.32 m in length.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sticking}} knife usually {{consists of a}} double edge <b>pointed</b> <b>blade</b> approximately six inches long. Blades are traditionally made of high carbon steel (such as 1095). Handles are simple, consisting usually of two hardwood scales riveted through the full, flat blade tang. Sticking knives generally lack any kind of guard.|$|R
5000|$|The clip {{point is}} one of the three most common knife blade shapes used (the others being the drop point and the spear <b>point).</b> Clip <b>point</b> <b>blades</b> have the {{appearance}} of having the forward third of the blade [...] "clipped" [...] off. The clip itself can be straight or concave.|$|R
5000|$|The clip <b>point</b> <b>blade</b> design {{dates back}} to at least Macedonian times, where {{examples}} of knapped flint clip point knives from the Eneolytic period have been unearthed at the estruary of Drim. [...] Variants include the California clip, which uses a clip greatly extended in length, and the Turkish clip point with its extreme recurve. One of the most recognizable clip-point blades is used on the famous Bowie knife.|$|E
50|$|From 1923 to 1951, the Union Cutlery Co. of Olean, New York {{produced}} {{a series of}} lever-operated switchblades designed for the mid and {{upper end of the}} market, featuring celluloid, stag, or jigged bone handles, a bolster-mounted push-button, all featuring the company's KA-BAR trademark on the blade tang. The line included the KA-BAR Grizzly, KA-BAR Baby Grizzly, and KA-BAR Model 6110 Lever Release knives. The largest model was KA-BAR Grizzly, a folding hunter pattern with a broad bowie-type clip <b>point</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Soldier Knife model 1890 had a spear <b>point</b> <b>blade,</b> reamer, can-opener, {{screwdriver}} and grips {{made out}} of oak wood scales (handles) that were treated with rapeseed oil for greater toughness and water-repellency, which made them black in color. The wooden grips of the Modell 1890 tended to crack and chip so in 1901 these were changed to a hard reddish-brown fiber similar in appearance to wood. The knife was 100 mm long, 20.5 mm thick and weighed 144 g.|$|E
50|$|The type {{locality}} for stilbite-Na is Cape Pula, Pula, Cagliari Province, Sardinia, Italy. Small, lustrous, {{white or}} pink, <b>pointed</b> <b>blades</b> of stilbite-Na, and formless masses, up to 5 cm in diameter, {{have been found}} there, covering a thin crust of reddish heulandite in large fractures and cavities in the highly weathered volcanic andesite or rhyolite.|$|R
