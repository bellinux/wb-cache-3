Economists propose tradable permit systems as a solution, but they are difficult to implement {{due to the nature}} of non‐point sources. We present a pollution <b>offset</b> <b>system</b> for trading non‐point source water pollution permits. Conventional pollution <b>offset</b> <b>systems</b> suffer from thin markets and transaction costs. In this paper, we show how to overcome these problems with a centrally managed common‐pool market. We define permits as allowable nitrate loading to a groundwater aquifer. This trading system utilizes estimates of potential nitrate leaching from land uses, a set of transport coefficients generated from a simulation of nitrate transport in groundwater, an online trading system, and a linear program to clear the market. We illustrate the concept using a hypothetical case study...|$|R

40|$|In April 2005, Canada {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} new systems that could make the best use of market mechanisms, such as the Climate Fund, the Large Final Emitter System, and the Carbon <b>Offset</b> <b>System,</b> in order to achieve the reductions quota during the first commitment period (2008 - 2012). The Carbon <b>Offset</b> <b>System</b> has very high potential as a system able to push forward the forest sink policy, as it can help companies obtain credits for the GHG sink through forest sink activities recognized by the Kyoto Protocol (Paragraph 3 and 4, Clause 3). It also enables companies to trade GHG sink credits through the domestic emissions trade market. If the Carbon <b>Offset</b> <b>System,</b> which fully uses market mechanisms, is to be applied in Korea during the second commitment period (2013 - 2017) when Korea {{will have to deal with}} the obligations to reduce GHG emissions, it will be applied mostly to the expansion of the forest sink, through active forest management activities, such as afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation － given Korea has far fewer forest areas than Canada. In this case, it will be possible to increase the efficiency of the system by designing and operating it in a manner suitable for the conditions in Korea, including issuing domestic GHG sink credits to each sink developed through forest management, purchasing the credits, or providing additional subsidies. Forest owners might receive economic incentives through this, and it can also encourage new outside investments, such as forestry investments made by enterprises as part of their social contribution efforts...|$|R

The dampened <b>system</b> <b>offset</b> printing is the smooth printing system. Smooth printing is based on the principal of repelling of the water by the oil inside the ink and not to be mixed with. The printed and unprinted surfaces on the plate has a chemical characteristic. The process of printing occurs in the way that. The unprinted areas captures water and repell ink, the printed areas captures ink and repell water. The dry <b>offset</b> <b>system</b> is; the combination of the flexo and dampened <b>system</b> <b>offset</b> methods. In the method the relief part of the plate transfers the image to the smooth surfaced rubber printing cylinder and the image is transferred to the material by the cylinder. Water is not needed for humidification. So the plate is not wetted before printing. The pictures or positive dias are not printed by dry ofset method but, the hand dravings, very detailed desings and quite small texts could be printed to the range of six colors. In this study, an evaluation of the comparison of the process stages and reproduction results of the two techniques is conducted...|$|R

Because the lens is spherically symmetric, the antenna can be steered by moving the feed around the lens, without having to bodily rotate the whole antenna.

In contrast, if multiple feeds are used with a parabolic reflector, all must be within a small angle of the optical axis to avoid suffering coma (a form of de-focussing).

40|$|The Canadian {{greenhouse}} gas <b>offset</b> <b>system</b> was proposed and developed {{with the objective}} of assisting Canada in achieving its Kyoto target by means of low cost emission reduction. This study estimates the potential of agricultural soils in Canada to provide carbon credits. Carbon sequestration practices such as moderate till, no-till and perennial crop activities were considered in the analysis. Crops under different tillage regimes, hay and alfalfa were also included in the study. Simulation analysis was undertaken using the Canadian Regional Agricultural Model (CRAM) for carbon prices ranging from $ 5 to $ 100 /t of CO 2 e. Carbon credits generated {{as a result of the}} sequestration activities were estimated by endogenizing a carbon price for the sequestration activity into the CRAM model. The analysis was done regionally, provincially, and nationally. Two scenarios were investigated; one that included tillage practices and perennial crops (Policy All) and the other that only included tillage practices (Policy Till). Cropping pattern changes, carbon sequestration levels, carbon revenues, and adoption rates were estimated in the simulation. In addition, the role of transaction costs in the <b>offset</b> <b>system</b> was also examined. The results of the simulation indicated that crop shifts towards hay and alfalfa occurred in the Policy All scenario, while practice shifts towards moderate and no-till occurred in the Policy Till scenario. Simulation analysis indicated that carbon sequestration levels vary by province and region. Among the provinces, the Prairie provinces had the highest carbon sequestration levels ranging from 50 percent under the Policy Till scenario, while under the Policy All scenario it was close to 97 percent. Nationally at a medium price of $ 15 /t of CO 2 approximately 1. 08 Mt of CO 2 and 0. 11 Mt of CO 2 were sequestered under Policy All and Policy Till scenario.
