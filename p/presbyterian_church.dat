40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to suggest five steps for {{developing}} biblical pastoral leadership teams within South Korean <b>Presbyterian</b> <b>churches,</b> which are presently stagnating and declining under their non-biblical leadership. Growth of a church is directly dependent upon a healthy body of leaders who reflect sound biblical leadership, and the senior pastors of South Korean <b>Presbyterian</b> <b>churches</b> must intentionally conform all non-biblical leadership styles within their churches to biblical pastoral leadership. 	This project will attempt to provide the pastors of South Korean <b>Presbyterian</b> <b>churches</b> five steps for developing a biblical pastoral leadership team by identifying the relationship between church growth and pastoral leadership, investigating {{the present state of}} the leadership styles within South Korean <b>Presbyterian</b> <b>churches</b> through a survey of fifty pastors, and identifying elements of biblical pastoral leadership that are fundamental to developing a team of biblical pastoral leadership...|$|R

5|$|The 1903 {{revision}} of the Westminster Confession eventually led {{a large number of}} congregations from the Arminian–leaning Cumberland <b>Presbyterian</b> <b>Church</b> to reunite with the PCUSA in 1906. While overwhelmingly approved, the reunion caused controversy within the PCUSA due to concerns over doctrinal compatibility and racial segregation in the Cumberland <b>Presbyterian</b> <b>Church.</b> Warfield was a strong critic of the merger on doctrinal grounds. Northern Presbyterians, such as Francis James Grimké and Herrick Johnson, objected to the creation of racially segregated presbyteries in the South, a concession demanded by the Cumberland Presbyterians as the price for reunion. Despite these objections, the merger was overwhelmingly approved.|$|E
