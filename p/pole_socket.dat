50|$|New TRRRS {{standard}} for 3.5mm connectors {{was developed and}} recently approved by ITU-T. The new standard, called P.382 (former P.MMIC), outlines technical requirements and test methods for a 5 <b>pole</b> <b>socket</b> and plug configuration. Compared to legacy TRRS standard TRRRS provides one extra line {{that can be used}} for connecting a second microphone or external power to/from the audio accessory. P.382 requires compliant sockets and plugs to be backwards compatible with legacy TRRS and TRS connectors. Therefore, P.382 compliant TRRRS connectors should allow for seamless integration when used on new products.TRRRS connectors enable following audio applications: active noise cancelling, binaural recording and others, where dual analogue microphone lines can be directly connected to a host device.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plug and}} socket used in Class 1 {{applications}} in Argentina is defined by IRAM. The applicable standards are: IRAM 2073 [...] "Two poles plugs with earthing contact for domestic and similar purposes, rated 10 A and 20 A, 250 V a.c." [...] and IRAM 2071 [...] "Two <b>pole</b> <b>socket</b> - outlets with earthing contact for 10 A and 20 A, 250 V a.c, for fixed installations." [...] It is similar in appearance to the Australasian and Chinese plugs. It has an earthing pin and two flat current-carrying pins forming an upside down V-shape (120°). The flat blades for 10 A version measure 6.25 by 1.55 mm and 8.0 by 1.9 mm for de 20 A version, and are set at 30° to the vertical at a nominal pitch of 7.92 mm. The pin length is same as the Chinese version. The earthing pin lengths 21.4 mm for 10 A version (21.8 mm for 20 A version) [...] The poles plugs lengths 18.2 mm for 10 A version (17.8 mm for 20 A version). The most important difference from the Australian plug is that the Argentinian plug is wired with the line and neutral contacts reversed.|$|E
60|$|After going {{upward and}} onward for some time, they came at length to the {{entrance}} of one of the long galleries of sculpture. Here the torch bearers stopped and began to prepare their torches. They cut the long candles in two, so as to make pieces about eighteen inches long. Taking six or eight of these pieces, they placed them together like a bundle of sticks, and tied them, and then crowded the ends together into the socket upon the end of the <b>pole.</b> This <b>socket</b> was made large enough to receive them. They then lighted the wicks, and thus they had a large number of candles all burning together as one.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} {{necessary}} was to unload the sled, and, though the birches seldom grow to any size in a prairie bluff, {{some of the}} logs were heavy. She was gasping with the effort when she had flung {{a few of them}} down, after which she discovered that the rest were held up by one or two stout <b>poles</b> let into <b>sockets.</b> Try as she would, she could not get them out, and then she remembered that Hastings kept a whipsaw in a shed close by. She contrived to find it, and attacked the poles in breathless haste, working clumsily with mittened hands, until there was a crash and rattle as she sprang clear. Then she started the team, {{and the rest of the}} logs rolled off into the snow.|$|R
60|$|The {{entrance}} opened from a vast covered gallery, which formed one of {{the approaches}} to St. Peter's, {{between the end of}} the colonnade and the main front of the building. There were several Swiss sentinels on guard here. They were dressed in what seemed to Rollo a very fantastic garb. In a few minutes the men who were to accompany the party through the galleries appeared. One of them carried a great number of very long candles under his arm. Another had a long <b>pole</b> with a <b>socket</b> at the top of it, and a semicircular screen of tin on one side, to screen the light of the candles from the eyes of the visitors, and to throw it upon the statues. When all was ready, these torch bearers moved on, and were followed by the whole party up the great staircase which led to the galleries of the Vatican.|$|R
50|$|The Blake {{brothers}} were eventually told that {{in exchange for}} $5,000 to $10,000, Alva would help them recover {{the remains of the}} journalists. In 1992, the family received a couple of wooden boxes that reportedly held the remains of Blake and Davis. Soon after arrival, the Blake brothers brought the boxes to Owsley, who discovered organic material, four metal tent <b>poles,</b> a bone <b>socket,</b> burned bone fragments, and one tooth. For the most part, the bones were fully cremated, removing organic elements that would assist in the identification process. Unfortunately, only those of Griffith Davis were able to be identified, which would lead the Blake brothers back to Guatemala in search of the actual site of the murder and subsequent cremation base of the journalists. The Blake family contacted Alva and let him know that due to inconclusive identification of the remains, they would need to return to Guatemala, accompanied with expert anthropologists.|$|R
6000|$|Upon {{the end of}} the [...] "shank" [...] {{fits the}} head of the harpoon, known by the names swordfish-iron, lily-iron, and Indian dart. The form of this weapon has {{undergone}} much variation. The fundamental idea may very possibly have been derived from the Indian fish-dart, numerous specimens of which are in the National Museum, from various tribes of Indians of New England, British America, and the Pacific. However various the modifications may have been, the similarity of the different shapes is no less noteworthy from the fact that all are peculiarly American. In the enormous collection of fishery implements of all lands at the late exhibition at Berlin, nothing of the kind could be found. What is known to whalers as a toggle-harpoon is a modification of the lily-iron, but so greatly changed by the addition of a pivot by which the head of the harpoon is fastened to the shank that it can hardly be regarded as the same weapon. The lily-iron is, in principle, exactly what a whaleman would describe by the word [...] "toggle." [...] It consists of a two-pointed piece of metal, having in the center, at one side, a ring or socket the axis of which is parallel with the long diameter of the implement. In this is inserted {{the end of the}} pole-shank, and to it or near it is also attached the harpoon-line. When the iron has once been thrust point first through some solid substance, such as the side of a fish, and is released upon the other side by the withdrawal of the <b>pole</b> from the <b>socket,</b> it is free, and at once turns its long axis at right angle to the direction in which the harpoon-line is pulling, and this is absolutely prevented from withdrawal. The principle of the whale harpoon or toggle-iron is similar, except that the pole is not withdrawn, and the head, turning upon a pivot at its end, fastens the pole itself securely to the fish, the harpoon-line being attached to some part of the pole. The swordfish lily-iron head, as now ordinarily used, is about four inches in length, and consists of two lanceolate blades, each about {{an inch and a half}} long, connected by a central piece much thicker than they, in which, upon one side, and next to the flat side of the blade, is the socket for the insertion of the pole-shank. In this same central enlargement is forged an opening to which the harpoon-line is attached. The dart-head is usually made of steel; sometimes of iron, which is generally galvanized; sometimes of brass.|$|R
