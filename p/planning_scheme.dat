5|$|The 1987 {{approval}} of the redevelopment by the Perth City Council was controversial.

5|$|The manor of Ruislip {{became part}} of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District, though it {{remained}} under the ownership of King's College, Cambridge. A town-planning competition led to a design being chosen that envisaged the clearance of much of the woods and historic sites in Ruislip to make way for 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents, across the manor. A <b>planning</b> <b>scheme</b> adapted from the original was presented to the public in February 1913 and was approved by the Local Government Board in September 1914. The outbreak of the First World War halted all construction work, by which time only three new roads had been completed. It did not resume again until 1919.|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies of}} urban {{regeneration}} describe strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> {{based on the}} experiences of practitioners gleaned {{from a variety of}} projects in several cities of the world. Whilst this literature provides a general understanding of strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes,</b> none explores what is happening and what is planned to happen in the context of South Korea. Our research framework was designed to present formal strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> to support urban regeneration within regional contexts. This paper identifies urban regeneration <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> for Mixed-use development (MXD), based on a literature review of Korean refereed papers, and examines <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> via an expert survey. The literature survey includes 29 papers published by three major institutes in architecture and urban design in South Korea. In terms of strategic <b>planning,</b> the <b>schemes</b> have the potential to impact on MXD. Various urban development experts participated in the survey, and the data collected reflect consensus about strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> in regional contexts. The results generated 41 strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> and 12 strategic planning factors via Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). The results enable us to explore meaningful directions for the future. This paper provides an understanding of key <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> in urban contexts in South Korea as well as of strategic planning for the future MXD projects...|$|R

5|$|The Shires of Perth and Wanneroo {{combined}} to prepare Town <b>Planning</b> <b>Scheme</b> No.26 (Hamersley Development Scheme), and by early March 1968, the scheme, which included provisions for water supply, sewerage, drainage, road construction and undergrounding of power mains, {{was presented to}} both councils for consideration. A time limit of 3½ years for developers to construct homes on released land was built into the scheme {{in an effort to}} prevent land speculation, which the inter-departmental committee believed was a key factor in spiralling prices in Perth. By July, however, negotiations between the councils broke down, and the Shire of Perth (now City of Stirling) decided to administer its own part of the scheme independently. The scheme was divided into nine sections, with what is now the suburb of Hamersley being the first stage.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{district}} council worked with King's College to establish plots {{of land for}} development around Ruislip and Ruislip Manor. A town planning competition was held, won by A & J Soutar, town planners from Wandsworth, who sought to create a symmetrical design spreading across Ruislip parish. Many {{of the woods and}} historic sites including Manor Farm were to be demolished and cleared as part of the plan, making way for a projected total of 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents. Only the church in Ruislip, St. Martin's, would have been spared. An outline map was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A local board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911, which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full <b>planning</b> <b>scheme</b> to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914.|$|E
5|$|Manor Farm and Park Wood {{were nearly}} {{demolished}} {{in the early}} 1900s {{to make way for}} a new development planned in partnership with King's College and the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. A town planning competition was won by A & J Soutar from Wandsworth, who suggested a symmetrical design across the parish which would have seen a total of 7,642 new homes built. St. Martin's church would have been the only example of historical architecture left in Ruislip. An outline map of the new development proposal was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A Local Board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911 which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full <b>planning</b> <b>scheme</b> to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914. Three roads with residential housing, Manor Way, Windmill Way and Park Way were completed before the outbreak of the First World War when all construction work was halted. It was not resumed until 1919, though the plan was substantially scaled back as work slowed throughout the next decade.|$|E

40|$|In 1996, the Victorian Kennett Government {{embarked}} on an ambitious experiment on the State&# 039;s land use planning system. The government amended the Planning and Environment Act 1987 to introduce the Victoria Planning Provisions (VPP). These provisions introduced an unprecedented amount and type of standardisation into Victorian <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> and sought to remove a strong orientation towards local variation and influence. &# 039;A Failed Experiment&# 039; reports on a project that sought to evaluate {{the performance of the}} new format <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> against the objectives of the Victoria Planning Provisions. It also makes limited comparisons between the performance of the new format <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> and the <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> which existed between 1988 until their replacement by the new system. The authors conclude that the VPP based new format <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> have failed on the indicators used to justify their introduction by the Kennett government. The planning system is not in crisis, but {{on the basis of the}} information gathered in this project it is approaching crisis. The introduction of the reforms promoted in Better Decisions, Faster will lead to some of the short term pressure being reduced. However, it is likely that pressure will be increased by the greater demands on metropolitan councils during the implementation of Melbourne 2030...|$|R

At the time Tulkarm was divided into four main sections, with the bulk of commercial activity concentrated along the north-south and east-west roads. Meanwhile, urban sprawl continued to expand past the northern fringes of the town, which had previously been characterized by green spaces.|$|E

40|$|The {{kinematic}} and trajectory {{planning is}} presented for a 6 DOF end-effector whose design {{was based on}} the Stewart Platform mechanism. The end-effector was used as a testbed for studying robotic assembly of NASA hardware with passive compliance. Vector analysis was employed to derive a closed-form solution for the end-effector inverse kinematic transformation. A computationally efficient numerical solution was obtained for the end-effector forward kinematic transformation using Newton-Raphson method. Three trajectory <b>planning</b> <b>schemes,</b> two for fine motion and one for gross motion, were developed for the end-effector. Experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the trajectory <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> showed excellent tracking quality with minimal errors.

The Hamersley Development Scheme, however, was doomed almost before it started. Disagreements over issues such as undergrounding {{of power and the}} time limit clauses between the Town Planning Board and the Shire of Perth had caused delays in the scheme's approval. In July 1970, the Shire Planner reported that [...] "there is little point in proceeding with the Scheme, especially in view of the large areas already subdivided", and recommended the council agree [...] "that for all practical purposes, Town <b>Planning</b> <b>Scheme</b> No. 26. is defunct".
