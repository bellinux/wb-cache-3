On 19 February 1615 he was made master of the ordnance, and on 10 May of the same year one of the council for the province of Munster.

50|$|A city near Colenda {{lived by}} robbery {{because of its}} poverty. It was {{inhabited}} by mixed Celtiberian tribes who had been allies of Marcus Marius in a war against the Lusitianians and he settled them there five years earlier {{with the approval of}} the senate. Titus Didius wanted to destroy them and got the approval of senatorial commissioners. He told the city that he would allot the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> Colenda to them and to assemble for the <b>parcelling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>land.</b> He moved the Roman soldiers <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their camp and told the people to go in there because he wanted to put the men on a register and the women and children on another. When they got in he had them killed by the army. This is similar to the kind of treachery with which Servius Sulpicius Galba butchered many Lusitanians to end their rebellion of 155-150 BC (see Lusitanian War and Viriathic War section).|$|R
5000|$|The Republican Party gained also {{influence}} through the free-soil movement. According to his Marxist opinion against the <b>parceling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> government <b>lands</b> to small farmers, Weydemeyer denounced the Homestead Act agitation in 1854 as {{contrary to the}} interest of the workers and was in favor of large-scale agriculture. But in the 1860s, together with other German Republicans, he urged the party to campaign for [...] "immediate passage by Congress of a Homestead law by which the public <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> the Union may be secured for homesteads of the people, and secured from the greed of speculators." [...] Weydemeyer back of the free-soil movement and shift of position about that issue wasn't a stand for the free-soil movement as a social progress (as Hermann Kriege endorsement in this movement in 1845), but a question of tactic, backing the free-soil movement at that moment being a support for the antislavery cause, the main issue at the time in his point of view.|$|R

One of the challenges in developing a new tool for analysis of the urban phenomenon consists in the integration of these data into a coherent system, thanks to a Geographical Information System. This new tool allows, in particular, to trace the suburban sprawl of residential and private housing estates since 1950 in all its forms: this phenomenon is relatively little studied, but nevertheless has a large impact on the development of Lyon’s conurbation...|$|R
500|$|A {{document}} from 1200 AD mentions a walled garden {{owned by}} the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of St Peter, Westminster. A later document, dated between 1250 and 1283, refers to [...] "the garden of the Abbot and Convent of Westminster". By the 13th century this had become a [...] quadrangle of mixed orchard, meadow, pasture and arable land, lying between modern-day St Martin's Lane and Drury Lane, and Floral Street and Maiden Lane. The use of the name [...] "Covent"—an Anglo-French term for a religious community, equivalent to [...] "monastery" [...] or [...] "convent"—appears in a document in 1515, when the Abbey, which had been letting <b>out</b> <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> along {{the north side of}} the Strand for inns and market gardens, granted a lease of the walled garden, referring to it as [...] "a garden called Covent Garden". This is how it was recorded from then on.|$|R
50|$|Quataert argues {{production}} rose due to {{a number}} of factors. An increase in productivity resulted from irrigation projects, intensive agriculture and utilisation of modern agricultural tools increasing in use throughout the 19th century. By 1900, tens of thousands of plows, reapers and other agricultural technologies such as combines were found across the Balkan, Anatolian and Arab <b>lands.</b> However, most <b>of</b> the increases in production came from vast areas <b>of</b> <b>land</b> coming under further cultivation. Families began increasing the amount of time at work, bringing fallow land into use. Sharecropping increased utilising land that had been for animal pasturage. Along with state policy, millions of refugees brought vast tracts <b>of</b> untilled <b>land</b> into production. The empty central Anatolian basin and steppe zone in the Syrian provinces were instances where government agencies <b>parcelled</b> <b>out</b> smallholdings <b>of</b> <b>land</b> to refugees. This was a recurring pattern across the empire, small landholdings the norm. Foreign holdings remained unusual despite Ottoman political weakness - probably due to strong local and notable resistance and labour shortages. Issawi et al. have argued that division of labour was not possible, being based on religious grounds. Inalcik however demonstrates that division of labour was historically determined and open to change. Agricultural reform programs in the late 19th century saw the state founding agricultural schools, model farms, and education of a self-perpetuating bureaucracy of agrarian specialists focused on increasing agricultural exports. Between 1876 and 1908, the value of agricultural exports just from Anatolia rose by 45 per cent whilst tithe proceeds rose by 79 percent.|$|R
50|$|Located in the Copou neighborhood, {{which in}} the mid-18th century was sparsely {{populated}} and had no place of worship, the church was built in 1760 by hetman Vasile Roset and his wife Safta. It was located on a plot <b>of</b> <b>land</b> granted that year by Prince Ioan Teodor Callimachi. Completed quickly, it was blessed by the prince's brother, Metropolitan Gavriil Callimachi. Initially, Roset placed the church {{under the protection of}} the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. In 1767, he transferred it to the Metropolis of Proilavia. Within twenty years, the church {{was in a state of}} degradation, prompting the high vistiernic Lascarache Roset to try and reclaim the church founded by his parents. Thus, he obtained a decree in 1787 from Prince Alexander Ypsilantis, providing twenty lei per month in customs revenue for church maintenance. Successive princes issued orders maintaining or increasing the allowance: Constantine Ypsilantis (1799), Alexandros Soutzos (1801), Alexander Mourousis (1803), Michael Soutzos (1820). Aside from the princes' and donors' contributions, the church earned revenue by renting <b>out</b> <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in its yard or on its other properties, with the tenants required to pay an annual fee. Deceased parishioners were buried in the churchyard until 1871, when the city hall ordered a halt to church burials, their function supplanted by the new Eternitatea cemetery. Gheorghe Asachi was buried outside the church in 1869; a dozen members of his family share the grave.|$|R

40|$|The agrarian {{question}} {{was one of}} the main problems of the economy of the Second Republic of Poland (1918 - 1939). Witold Staniewicz - the minister of the agrarian reform - was the creator of the agrarian program which was based on the agrarian act of December 28 th 1925. According to this act the government should have realised the following tasks: an integration of the separate pieces <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>of</b> the same owner into a whole, an aggrandizement of the smallholdings, the state’s credits for the agriculture, a creation of the new farms with the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>parcelled</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the great property, a settlement action on the eastern borderlands of Poland, an arrangement of the melioration, and a regulation of the easements. In the years 1926 - 1930 a <b>parcelling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a great property, a liquidation of the servitudes, an integration <b>of</b> the <b>lands,</b> and the other works which influenced the agrarian structure of the country were completed quicker than before. They were realised in a moderate still consequent way. A good conjuncture in agriculture that had lasted since 1928 favoured the realisation of such a policy. Still in the following years, the diminution of sum spending on those purposes slopped that activity. Zadanie pt.
