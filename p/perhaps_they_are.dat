5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> relieved {{that they did not have}} to make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E
25|$|If {{enough people}} do not think like free-riders, the private and {{voluntary}} provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. More public-spirited individuals don't do this (they might even pick up existing litter) â€“ why? There could be several reasons. Perhaps they have lived nearby for years and derive pleasure from helping their community, or at least would feel ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> emotionally attached to the environment, or the park is a national treasure; littering it would offend their patriotism. To the extent that most people behave like this (for any reason), a public good is produced: everyone enjoys a clean park, without the government needing to spend tax money on maintenance crews.|$|E
500|$|In addition, the {{nationalistic sentiments}} that {{exacerbated}} the naval arms race {{gave way to}} slowing economies and negative public opinions which came to support investing inside the country instead. Commenting on this, the United States' Minister to Chile, Henry Prather Fletcher, wrote to Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan: [...] "Since the naval rivalry began in 1910, financial conditions, which were none too good then, have grown worse; and as time approaches for the final payment, feeling has been growing in these countries that <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> much more in need of money than of battleships." ...|$|E

2500|$|The team left Ann Arbor for Nashville {{at midday}} on Thursday, October 12, {{accompanied}} by Coach Yost and the team's trainers Archie Hahn and Billy Fallon. [...] Sam Greene, who {{became one of}} the leading sports writers in Detroit over the next 40 years, covered the trip. [...] He reported that, shortly after arriving on Friday morning, the team was taken by friends on an automobile trip to The Hermitage, the plantation that had been owned by Andrew Jackson. [...] In the afternoon, the team conducted [...] "a brief limbering drill" [...] at Vanderbilt's new field. [...] In his pre-game report, Green expressed concern that, despite assistant coach Sturzenegger's scouting report, the team was overconfident:"The Michigan boys are confident that they will win. [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a trifle too confident. [...] It can not be denied that the Wolverines are thinking more of the first conference game next Saturday with Ohio State than they are of the impending tussle with the southern squad. The feeling is too general among the players that this is more or less of a pre-season game." ...|$|E
2500|$|... g modes are {{standing}} internal gravity waves whose principal restoring force is negative buoyancy of vertically displaced material, {{hence the name}} [...] "g mode". They are of relatively low frequency (0-0.4 mHz). They are confined either to {{the interior of the}} sun below the convection zone (the inner 70 per cent by radius), or to the atmosphere. [...] Because they cannot propagate through convectively unstable regions (in which the temperature gradient exceeds the adiabatic lapse rate, buoyancy is positive and the force on a displaced element of fluid is not restoring), the former are practically unobservable at the surface. The g modes are said to be evanescent in the convection zone, and are thought to have residual velocity amplitudes of only millimeters per second at the photosphere, though <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more prominent as temperature perturbations. Since the 1980s, there have been several claims of g-mode detection, including one claimed in 2007 using the GOLF data. At the GONG2008 / SOHO XXI conference held in Boulder, the Phoebus group reported that it could not confirm these findings, putting an upper limit of [...] 3mm/s on g-mode amplitudes, right at the detection limit of the GOLF instrument. [...] The Phoebus group has recently published a review of the current state of g-mode knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|Imagine {{that the}} {{superposition}} {{of a state}} that can be mentally labeled as blue and another state that can be mentally labeled as red will then appear (in imagination, of course) as a purple state. Two photons are produced {{as the result of}} the same atomic event. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> produced by the excitation of a crystal that characteristically absorbs a photon of a certain frequency and emits two photons of half the original frequency. So the two photons come out [...] "purple." [...] If the experimenter now performs some experiment that will determine whether one of the photons is either blue or red, then that experiment changes the photon involved from one having a superposition of [...] "blue" [...] and [...] "red" [...] characteristics to a photon that has only one of those characteristics. The problem that Einstein had with such an imagined situation was that if one of these photons had been kept bouncing between mirrors in a laboratory on earth, and the other one had traveled halfway to the nearest star, when its twin was made to reveal itself as either blue or red, that meant that the distant photon now had to lose its [...] "purple" [...] status too. So whenever it might be investigated after its twin had been measured, it would necessarily show up in the opposite state to whatever its twin had revealed.|$|E
