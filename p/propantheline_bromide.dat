50|$|Prescription {{medications}} called anticholinergics, {{taken by}} mouth, are sometimes {{used in the}} treatment of both generalized and focal hyperhidrosis. Anticholinergics used for hyperhidrosis include <b>propantheline,</b> glycopyrronium <b>bromide</b> or glycopyrrolate, oxybutynin, methantheline, and benzatropine. Use of these drugs can be limited, however, by side-effects, including dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and visual disturbances such as mydriasis (dilation of the pupils) and cycloplegia. For people who find their hyperhidrosis is made worse by anxiety-provoking situations (public speaking, stage performances, special events such as weddings, etc.), taking an anticholinergic medicine before the event may be helpful.|$|R

40|$|Propantheline or 2 -Propanaminium, N-methyl-N-(1 -methylethyl) -N-[2 -[(9 H-xanthen- 9 -ylcarbonyl) oxy]ethyl]- bromide is a {{quaternary}} ammonium synthetic derivate with modulation activity on vagal tone. It {{is one of}} the most parasympatholytic active agent with peripheral activity similar to atropine. It reduces the hypersecretion and the ipermotility of the gastro-intestinal apparatus and it has spasmolitic properties. The presence of two known Propanteline bromide polymorphs is reported in literature 1, 2 : the stable form I and the metastable form II. Through multi-analytical approach used by our group in other pholimorphic studies, in the present communication we report the study and characterization of the studied two forms. For the first time micro-Raman spectroscopy and Hot-Stage Raman microscopy (HSRM) studies of Propantheline polymorphs are reported. Raman techniques were useful tools for distinguish and monitor the conversion of polymorphs cause of changing temperature. The spectroscopic reported data, together with those form previous reports, complete the <b>Propantheline</b> <b>bromide</b> polymorphs knowledge. DSC thermograms and X-Ray powder diffraction data, were also collected. Furthermore XRPD patterns of I and II forms were in agreement with Kountourellis data. Some attributions of significant IR and Raman bands were firstly reported. In summary, the IR spectra permitted to identify I and II polymorphs through their typical bands at 1729, 1250 - 1235, 1171 - 1157, 1038, 758 - 746, 713, 630 cm- 1 and 1727 - 1739, 1260, 1166, 1032, 753 - 744, 709 cm- 1, respectively. The polymorphs characterization through Raman spectroscopy permitted to identify specific bands for form I (1267 - 1255, 1222, 520, 417 - 402 - 380, 294, 255 cm- 1) and form II (in particular at 1229, 669, 537 - 530, 397, 295 - 282 and 185 cm- 1). According to L. Borka results 1, 6, in this study a conversion of II into I form was observed. The conversion occurred above 100 °C with a successive fusion of I form. A further heating caused a decomposition phenomenon. The used temperature program started form 35 ° until 200 °C with an heating rate of 2 °C/min. To confirm DSC results of form II, Hot-stage measurements were carried out with the same DSC temperature program (2 °C/min; 35 - 200 °C temperature range). By this technique, the same results recovered with DSC thermal curves were noticed: a conversion of II into I form was observed and the successively fusion phenomenon was noticed. At 35 °C until 80 °C, the micro-Raman spectra correspond to form II, while at 90 °C and at 160 °C the transformation into I and its melting event were occurred, respectively. Moreover, the thermodynamic and spectroscopic behaviour of ground form I was investigated. Propantheline form I was ground at different times (1, 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes) and FT-IR/ATR and DSC measurements were carried out. In addition, a certain amount of recrystallized <b>Propantheline</b> <b>bromide</b> (form I, II) was placed into a compressing machine to obtain <b>Propantheline</b> <b>bromide</b> tablets using different compression forces (2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 28 KN).

Glucagon was found to be most effective in relaxing the Ampulla. For the test to be successful impacted stones must be excluded by cholangiography, but free lying stones do not affect the test. In 7 of the 62 patients receiving glucagon flow was slow and the sphincter failed to relax.

40|$|The {{initiation}} and {{termination of}} feeding behavior {{are not fully}} understood. The stomach has been implicated as one source of signals regulating food intake. The sight and smell of food are potent stimuli to gastric acid secretion and contraction. The mouth, upper gastrointestinal tract and liver contain receptors regulating food intake; afferent information passes into the brain stem and into the brain areas. Lateral hypothalamic lesions abolish feeding, raise the body temperature and basal gastric acid secretion and produce gastric erosions. Vagotomy and administering <b>propantheline</b> <b>bromide</b> abolish the increased acid secretion after such lesions; they also alter the mucosal barrier permitting diffusion of protons into mucosal cells. Several of the neuropeptides via {{the central nervous system}} stimulate or inhibit gastric acid secretion through modulation of the autonomic nervous system. Most animal models of gastric erosions are associated with a reduced body temperature. Unknown is whether or not this association is the result of increased levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone—a potent stimulus to gastric acid secretion and erosion formation when injected intracisternally...|$|E
40|$|Recordings of {{transmural}} {{potential difference}} (PD) across the jejunum of conscious man in situ are characterised by spontaneous fluctuations {{of up to}} 10 mV. In 25 of 31 subjects (comprising seven normal controls and 24 patients under investigation for malabsorption, six of whom had coeliac disease) we observed a clear association between these fluctuations and changes in intraluminal pressure recorded at the same site. The most frequent PD changes were associated with type III pressure waves. These consisted predominantly of large waver (3 - 1 +/- 0 - 1 mV; mean +/- SEM, n = 317) which reached maximal amplitude approximately 45 seconds after the pressure peak and had a duration of 120 +/- 3 s, but also included less frequent spikes (0 - 5 +/- 0 - 1 mV; n = 110) concurrent with the pressure wave {{with a duration of}} 5 +/- 1 s. Although by recording at two sites in the jejunum 10 cm apart we were able to demonstrate that type III pressure waves appeared to be propagated aborally at a median rate of 60 cm per minute, the apparent rates of propagation of the corresponding PD waves were much more variable. The largest PD changes (7 - 8 +/- 0 - 4 mV; n = 19), lasting several minutes, were found in association with runs of type I waves (basic rhythm) superimposed on a type III wave. Both pressure and PD activities were suppressed by intramuscular <b>propantheline</b> <b>bromide.</b> Intraluminal pilocarpine caused a transient rise in PD not always accompanied by a change in pressure. Distention of the jejunum by rapid injection of a bolus of isotonic sodium chloride produced a delayed rise in the PD which could be prevented by prior administration of <b>propantheline</b> <b>bromide.</b> Experiments using Thirty-Vella loops of proximal jejunum in conscious dogs confirmed the effect of jejunal distension on the PD and also demonstrated that spontaneous retching is preceded by an increase in the PD. Consideration of these results in conjunction with data from other workers suggests the hypothesis that the larger spontaneous fluctuations in transmural PD in the jejunum of conscious man are caused by changes in electrogenic secretion associated with intestinal motility and mediated by cholinergic mechanisms. The possible association of increased secretory activity with motility may have functions of lubrication as well as diluting and mixing the chyme for easier digestion and absorption...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how uterine motility as measured by both electromyographic techniques (emg), and to a lesser extent by intra-uterine pressure changes (IUP), is influenced by steroid hormones, uterine stimulants and relaxants, infused intra-uterine fluids, natural breeding and the first 20 days of pregnancy. Two intact and two ovariectomised mares had uterine emg activity measured from 3 - 8 hours/day over a period of 1 - 5 months. Simultaneous IUP recordings, using an open tipped catheter, were periodically taken. One intact mare during anoestrus and both spayed mares were given exogenous courses of oestradiol and progesterone to simulate oestrous cycle activity. Oxytocin, cloprostenol, <b>propantheline</b> <b>bromide</b> and clenbuterol were administered to each mare during anoestrus, transition, oestrus, and dioestrus, where applicable. Quantities (60 - 1000 ml) of sterile double distilled water were infused intra-uterine into each mare at various cycle stages. One intact mare was bred on four occasions and followed through the first 20 days of her pregnancy. Mares in oestrus recorded synchronous short bursts (3 - 5 min) of high amplitude emg activity following a crescendo-decrescendo pattern. In dioestrus burst duration increased (15 - 25 min) and amplitude decreased with increasing plasma progesterone levels. Emg results during anoestrus and transition were intermediate. During early pregnancy emg characteristics varied depending on whether the conceptus was in the oviduct, migratory or fixed. It is proposed that in oestrus emg changes manifest as contractions, while in dioestrus as increased uterine tone. Oxytocin and cloprostenol caused uterine responses at all cycle stages with the most pronounced response during oestrus where drug administration was followed by prolonged emg activity (10 - 25 min) initially and then followed by short burst activity. The least response was seen during dioestrus. <b>Propantheline</b> <b>bromide</b> decreased emg activity especially in dioestrus and is an effective uterine relaxant; clenbuterol however caused minimal measurable change. Infused intra-uterine fluids resulted in a single spike pattern of emg activity which was generally asynchronous between electrode sites during the first infusion and depressed uterine activity following a subsequent second infusion. Natural service resulted in minimal emg changes similar to those seen after rectal palpation, ie a short term (5 - 10 min) burst of densely grouped action potentials. This response is so short it seems unlikely either endogenous oxytocin and/or prostaglandins would have any significant influence on sperm transport in the mare; it is suggested that the emg change seen at this time is more in the nature of a local response to vaginal stimulation by the penis of the stallion, and is similar to that seen during palpation per rectum. Electrode site emg variation was common, especially during dioestrus and early pregnancy. The emg activity recorded in early pregnancy is different to that found in the nonpregnant dioestrus mare and probably related to the position of the embryo; it is suggested that abnormal uterine motility could be a cause of early embryonic death in this species. During the oestrous cycle there was little correlation either statistically or visually between emg and IUP with or without drug treatment, but IUP increased with uterokinetic drugs and decreased with relaxants. IUP changes may not be a reliable method of measuring uterine activity in the mare. This is supported by the finding that there was no statistical difference in IUP parameters measured between cycle stages, whereas there were important emg variations. As the experimental mares experienced signs of intestinal discomfort after administration of the uterine stimulants, and <b>propantheline</b> <b>bromide</b> is a known intestinal relaxant, the author argues that IUP results recorded after drug treatment could be influenced by the effects of these substances on intestinal motility rather than solely the consequence of a direct uterine response...|$|E
40|$|Features {{suggestive of}} an {{isolated}} increase in vagal tone during electrophysiological study {{were found in}} 12 patients with recurrent near syncope or syncope. Results at neurological and cardiac evaluation were otherwise normal. The increased tone or heightened sensitivity to vagal tone was manifested by abnormal atrioventricular nodal refractoriness and conduction that were reversed with atropine. The patients underwent long term treatment with an anticholinergic agent (<b>propantheline</b> <b>bromide)</b> and 75 % improved. Before treatment they had experienced a median of seven episodes (range 3 - 28) of near syncope or syncope during 10. 5 months (range 1 - 60). During treatment these episodes decreased to a median of one (range 0 - 15) during 22. 5 months (range 3 - 67); six patients experienced no further symptoms. Three patients continued to have syncope while on treatment, and one of these required permanent cardiac pacing. No additional cause for syncope was identified in any patient. During electrophysiological assessment of patients with syncope, evidence may be obtained pointing {{to an increase in}} vagal tone.

40|$|Sick sinus {{syndrome}} is a clinical {{term used to}} describe the clinical signs of sinus node dysfunction. This paper describes the clinical data from nine West Highland white terriers, eight females and one male, in which a diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome was made. The most common clinical signs were episodic weakness and presyncope. Electrocardiographic findings included sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest with or without escape complexes, disturbances of atrioventricular conduction, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or some combination of these dysrhythmias. The main radiographic changes were mild right-sided cardiomegaly in five cases, and a slight increase in bronchial and interstitial markings in four, but {{there was no evidence of}} congestive heart failure in any of the dogs. Echocardiography revealed mild to moderate mitral endocardiosis in three cases with no other significant abnormalities.

40|$|Objectives: The {{variety of}} {{influences}} {{that contribute to}} the occurrence of dysphagia in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) provide the physician with many options to intervene in the pathophysiology of the disease process. The aims of the present analysis were to compare the relationships between the costs and effectiveness of competing therapeutic interventions in preventing dysphagia. Methods: Dysphagia was modelled as the focal point of multiple influences leading to its development. The costs associated with different forms of drug therapy were based on the average wholesale prices listed in the Red Book of 1998. Procedural costs were estimated from Medicare reimbursements. Different treatment options were assessed by their incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: Lifestyle modifications, treatment with prokinetic agents or antacids reduce the occurrence of dysphagia by 22, 21 or 25 %, respectively. Acid inhibition results in a 57 to 89 % reduction of dysphagia, depending on treatment with histamine- 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Oesophageal dilation results in a reduction ranging between 54 and 81 %. The incremental ratio of cost effectiveness associated with prokinetic agents or H 2 RAs is much higher than that of PPIs. Based on the concept of extended dominance, therefore, prokinetic drugs and H 2 RAs do not constitute cost-effective means to prevent dysphagia and should be excluded in favour of treatment with PPIs. Conclusions: An economic analysis of various treatment strategies {{to reduce the risk of}} GORD-related dysphagia indicates that PPIs are the most cost-effective means to prevent its occurrence.

40|$|The {{zebrafish}} is {{a valuable}} model for studying hair cell development, structure, genetics, and behavior. Zebrafish and other aquatic vertebrates have hair cells on their body surface organized into a sensory system called the lateral line. These hair cells are highly accessible and easily visualized using fluorescent dyes. Morphological and functional similarities to mammalian hair cells of the inner ear make the zebrafish a powerful preparation for studying hair cell toxicity. The ototoxic potential of drugs has historically been uncovered by anecdotal reports {{that have led to}} more formal investigation. Currently, no standard screen for ototoxicity exists in drug development. Thus, {{for the vast majority of}} Food and Drug Association (FDA) -approved drugs, the ototoxic potential remains unknown. In this study, we used 5 -day-old zebrafish larvae to screen a library of 1, 040 FDA-approved drugs and bioactives (NINDS Custom Collection II) for ototoxic effects in hair cells of the lateral line. Hair cell nuclei were selectively labeled using a fluorescent vital dye. For the initial screen, fish were exposed to drugs from the library at a 100 -μM concentration for 1  h in 96 -well tissue culture plates. Hair cell viability was assessed in vivo using fluorescence microscopy. One thousand forty drugs were rapidly screened for ototoxic effects. Seven known ototoxic drugs included in the library, including neomycin and cisplatin, were positively identified using these methods, as proof of concept. Fourteen compounds without previously known ototoxicity were discovered to be selectively toxic to hair cells. Dose–response curves for all 21 ototoxic compounds were determined by quantifying hair cell survival as a function of drug concentration. Dose–response relationships in the mammalian inner ear for two of the compounds without known ototoxicity, pentamidine isethionate and <b>propantheline</b> <b>bromide,</b> were then examined using in vitro preparations of the adult mouse utricle. Significant dose-dependent hair cell loss in the mouse utricle was demonstrated for both compounds.
