5|$|As a {{constitutional}} monarch, his education was {{followed closely by}} the National Assembly, which demanded from Itanhaém <b>progress</b> <b>reports</b> concerning his studies. During this time, Pedro II was kept unaware of events occurring outside the palace, including political matters. News which did intrude upon the emperor and his sisters concerned deaths within their family. In December 1834, they learned of the early and unanticipated death of their father. A few months later their grandfather Francis II, who had shown great interest in his grandchildren, died (June 1835). These losses drew the emperor and his sisters closer together and strengthened their sense of family, {{despite the absence of}} their parents.|$|E

5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} shows Deep Blue as a voice {{coming from}} a blue light, to whom Kisshu gives <b>progress</b> <b>reports,</b> and a shadowed version of his true form is seen when Quiche brings him some mew aqua in episode twenty-six. His death is changed in the anime to come {{at the hands of}} Mew Ichigo rather than Masaya, though Masaya aids her by taking over the body. To keep the true identity of Deep Blue a secret, his voice actor's name is shown only as a question mark until his identity is revealed in episode forty-nine; after which the credits are changed to list Megumi Ogata (who also voices Masaya and the Blue Knight). Deep Blue {{is one of the few}} characters whose name remains unchanged in the Mew Mew Power dub. The anime slightly modified his role from that of a savior for the aliens to a destructive force that wants to do nothing but destroy the Earth which causes the aliens to turn against him.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} colourisation {{was preceded by}} {{extensive}} research. The art departments visited museums and studied the literature for background on the typical colours of clothing worn at that time. Siddiqui studied the technology used for the colourisation of black-and-white Hollywood classics. The team also approached a number of experts for guidance and suggestions, including Dilip Kumar, production designer Nitin Chandrakant Desai, and a historian from the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. To undertake the colourisation, Siddiqui brought together a team of around 100 individuals, including computer engineers and software professionals, and organised a number of art departments. The entire project was co-ordinated by Deepesh Salgia, who partnered with companies including Iris Interactive and Rajtaru Studios to execute the colourisation. The task was controlled and supervised by the producers, who received daily updates and <b>progress</b> <b>reports.</b>|$|E
