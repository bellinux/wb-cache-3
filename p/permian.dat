5|$|Fossil Cicadomorpha first {{appeared}} in the Upper <b>Permian.</b> The superfamily Palaeontinoidea contains three families. The Upper <b>Permian</b> Dunstaniidae are found in Australia and South Africa, and also in younger rocks from China. The Upper Triassic Mesogereonidae are found in Australia and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{amphibians}} (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) {{are classified}} in Lissamphibia. Lissamphibians {{appear to have}} arisen in the <b>Permian.</b> Molecular clock estimates place the first lissamphibian in the Late Carboniferous, but {{the first member of}} Batrachia (frogs and salamanders, but not caecilians) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle <b>Permian</b> using the same technique.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Permian,</b> the dragonflies Odonata {{were the}} {{dominant}} aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata {{appeared in the}} <b>Permian</b> and all are amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, {{go back to the}} Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way. Their prototypes may have had the beginnings of many modern attributes even by late Carboniferous and it is possible that they even captured small vertebrates, for some species had a wing span of 71cm. The earliest beetle-like species during the <b>Permian</b> had pointed, leather like forewings with cells and pits. Hemiptera, or true bugs had appeared in the form of Arctiniscytina and Paraknightia having forewings with unusual venation, possibly diverging from Blattoptera.|$|E
5|$|Progression {{towards an}} erect limb posture, which would {{increase}} the animals' stamina by avoiding Carrier's constraint. But this process was slow and erratic: for example, all herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs); <b>Permian</b> carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late <b>Permian</b> ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern monotremes still have semisprawling limbs.|$|E
5|$|The Old Red Sandstone Continent {{became a}} part of the supercontinent Pangaea in the <b>Permian</b> (299–252 Ma), during which proto-Britain {{continued}} to drift northwards. Scotland's climate was arid at this time and some fossils of reptiles have been recovered. However, <b>Permian</b> sandstones are found in only a few places - principally in the south west, on the island of Arran, and on the Moray coast. Stone quarried from Hopeman in Moray has been used in the National Museum and Scottish Parliament buildings in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|The Palaeozoic era is {{represented}} in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds, namely the Carboniferous (including Coal Measures and limestone) and <b>Permian.</b>|$|E
5|$|The extinct {{families}} Arthrolycosidae, {{found in}} Carboniferous and <b>Permian</b> rocks, and Arthromygalidae, so far {{found only in}} Carboniferous rocks, have been classified {{as members of the}} Mesothelae.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} of Sawtooth National Forest have a varied geological history. The northern Sawtooth Mountains formed from the Eocene Sawtooth batholith, while south of Alturas Lake the Sawtooth, Smoky, and Soldier mountains formed from the Cretaceous granodiorite of the Idaho Batholith. Foothills of the Smoky Mountains {{are from the}} Pennsylvanian and <b>Permian</b> Dollarhide formations. The White Cloud Mountains are underlain by the gray granodiorite of the Idaho batholith, {{while some of the}} exposed rock is baked impure limestone from the <b>Permian</b> Grand Prize Formation.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{earliest}} {{members of the}} Mecoptera are the Nannochoristidae of Upper <b>Permian</b> age. Fossil Mecoptera become abundant and diverse during the Cretaceous, for example in China, where panorpids such as Jurassipanorpa, hangingflies (Bittacidae and Cimbrophlebiidae), Orthophlebiidae, and Cimbrophlebiidae have been found.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the <b>Permian</b> (299–252 {{million years}} ago) and Triassic periods, the Variscan orogeny {{resulted}} in the formation of several mountainous areas including Dartmoor in the south, Exmoor and the Quantocks, and the Mendips.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Palace's two Dicynodon {{models are}} based on {{incomplete}} <b>Permian</b> fossils found in South Africa, along with Owen's guess that they were similar to turtles. There {{is no evidence of}} any shelled Dicynodon, and recent more complete fossils show that they looked more like Hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} 75 million years, plants evolved {{a range of}} more complex organs – from roots to seeds. There was a gap of 50 to 100 million years between each organ evolving, and it being fed upon. Hole feeding and skeletonization are {{recorded}} in the early <b>Permian,</b> with surface fluid feeding evolving {{by the end of}} that period.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{new species}} of Dimetrodon called D. teutonis was {{described}} from the Lower <b>Permian</b> Bromacker locality at the Thuringian Forest of Germany, extending the geographic range of Dimetrodon outside North America for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, the Laura W. Bush Institute for Women's Health (LWBIWH) {{was founded}} at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. This {{institute}} aims to integrate research, education and community outreach in a multidisciplinary approach to women's health and has begun efforts {{to establish a}} multi-campus women's health institute in Amarillo, El Paso, Lubbock and the <b>Permian</b> Basin.|$|E
5|$|In later <b>Permian</b> time, the Toroweap Basin was {{invaded by}} the warm, shallow {{edge of the}} vast Panthalassa ocean in what local geologists call the Kaibab Sea. At that time, Utah and Wyoming were near the equator on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea.|$|E
5|$|In the Taunton area <b>Permian</b> (295–250 {{million years}} ago) red {{sandstones}} and breccia outcrop, while rocks of Triassic age (248–204 million years ago) underlie much of Somerset and form the solid geology to the Somerset Moors and Levels.|$|E
5|$|In the Taunton area <b>Permian</b> (299–252 {{million years}} ago) red {{sandstones}} and breccia outcrop, although rocks of Triassic age (252–201 million years ago) underlie much of Somerset and form the solid geology of the Somerset Moors and Levels. There are no glacial deposits.|$|E
5|$|Late Carboniferous and Early <b>Permian</b> insect orders {{include both}} extant groups, their stem groups, {{and a number}} of Paleozoic groups, now extinct. During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of , making them far larger than any living insect. This {{gigantism}} may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today. The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor. Most extinct orders of insects developed during the <b>Permian</b> period that began around 270 million years ago. Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the largest mass extinction {{in the history of the}} Earth, around 252 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Lawton lies {{in an area}} {{typical of}} the Great Plains, with prairie, few trees, and flat {{topography}} with gently rolling hills. The region {{north of the city}} consists of the Wichita Mountains, including Mount Scott and Mount Pinchot, the area's highest peaks. The area consists mostly of <b>Permian</b> Post Oak Conglomerate limestone on the northern sections of the city. In the south sections of the city, <b>Permian</b> Garber sandstone is commonly found with some Hennessey Group shale. Area creeks including East Cache Creek contain deposits of Quaternary alluvium. To the northwest, the Wichita Mountains consist primarily of Wichita Granite Group from the Cambrian era.|$|E
5|$|Middle Devonian basaltic {{volcanic}} {{rocks are}} found on western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. Correlation between the Hoy volcanics {{and the other}} two exposures has been proposed, but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain. Lamprophyre dykes of Late <b>Permian</b> age are found throughout Orkney.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{kicks off}} with Eric Taylor {{struggling}} as the East Dillon High coach. The team, field and conditions are a complete {{change from the}} privileged and sparkling conditions at West Dillon. East Dillon High resembles Odessa High from the source novel , <b>Permian</b> High's sister school {{and the home of}} the Odessa Bronchos, with whom they have an annual rivalry match which divides the town. The East Dillon Lions and Odessa Bronchos both wear red uniforms and are considered underdogs to the Panthers. Additionally, Odessa High and East Dillon are both underfunded and considered inferior compared to their rival school, and serve a predominately poor minority community. Additionally, the school district boundaries between East and West Dillon were intentionally drawn to ensure the majority of talented players would be zoned for West Dillon; the districts between <b>Permian</b> and Odessa High were drawn in a similar manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} <b>Permian</b> saw a major {{turnover}} in fauna during the Permian–Triassic extinction event: probably the most severe mass extinction event of the phanerozoic. There was a protracted loss of species, due to multiple extinction pulses. Many of the once large and diverse groups died out or were greatly reduced.|$|E
5|$|Yates and Warren {{also named}} Dvinosauria, a clade of small aquatic temnospondyls from the Carboniferous, <b>Permian,</b> and Triassic. They placed Dvinosauria within Limnarchia, but more recent studies {{disagree}} on their position. For example, a 2007 study places {{them even more}} basal than euskelians, while a 2008 study keeps them as basal limnarchians.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the <b>Permian.</b> Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding.|$|E
5|$|Before these discoveries, {{a theory}} existed that a Midcontinental seaway {{separated}} {{what is now}} Texas and Oklahoma from more western lands during the Early <b>Permian,</b> isolating Dimetrodon to a small region of North America while a smaller sphenacodontid called Sphenacodon dominated the western area. While this seaway probably did exist, the discovery of fossils outside Texas and Oklahoma show that its extent was limited {{and that it was}} not an effective barrier to the distribution of Dimetrodon.|$|E
5|$|Claims that {{termites}} emerged earlier {{have faced}} controversy. For example, F. M. Weesner {{indicated that the}} Mastotermitidae termites may {{go back to the}} Late <b>Permian,</b> 251 million years ago, and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the wings of Mastotermes of the Mastotermitidae, the most primitive living termite, have been discovered in the <b>Permian</b> layers in Kansas. It is even possible that the first termites emerged during the Carboniferous. Termites are thought to be the descendants of the genus Cryptocercus. The folded wings of the fossil wood roach Pycnoblattina, arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1aand 2a, resemble those seen in Mastotermes, the only living insect with the same pattern. Krishna et al., though, consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from the Isoptera. Termites were the first social insects to evolve a caste system, evolving more than 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Deposits in the United States {{constitute}} 62% {{of world}} resources; together, the United States, Russia and Brazil account for 86% of the world's resources {{in terms of}} shale-oil content. These figures remain tentative, with exploration or analysis of several deposits still outstanding. Professor Alan R. Carroll of University of Wisconsin–Madison regards the Upper <b>Permian</b> lacustrine oil-shale deposits of northwest China, absent from previous global oil shale assessments, as comparable in size to the Green River Formation.|$|E
5|$|During the Cambrian period, Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was {{partially}} in the Northern Hemisphere, and {{during this period}} large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas. By {{the start of the}} Devonian period (416Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. Glaciation began {{at the end of the}} Devonian period (360Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the <b>Permian</b> period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as Glossopteris, a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains. Towards the end of the <b>Permian</b> period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|During the Late <b>Permian,</b> {{increasing}} aridity and the {{diversification of}} reptiles contributed into {{a decline in}} terrestrial temnospondyls, but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish, including the large Melosaurus of Eastern Europe. Other temnospondyls, such as archegosaurids, developed long snouts and a close similarity to crocodiles, although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group. These temnospondyls included the largest known batrachomorph, the 9-m-long Prionosuchus of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Permian,</b> Triassic and Jurassic (300 to 150 Mya), further {{episodes of}} desertification, {{subsidence}} and uplift occurred and Wales was alternately inundated {{by the sea}} and raised above it. By the Cretaceous (140 to 70 Mya), Wales was permanently above sea level and in the Pleistocene (2.5 Mya to recent), it underwent several exceptionally cold periods, the ice ages. The mountains we see today largely assumed their present shape during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the <b>Permian</b> Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E
5|$|Euchambersia is a genus of therocephalian therapsid {{that lived}} during the Late <b>Permian,</b> {{approximately}} 255 million years ago, {{in what is}} now South Africa. The genus contains a single species, E. mirabilis, named by paleontologist Robert Broom in 1931 from a skull missing the lower jaws; a second skull, belonging to an immature individual, was later described. It {{is a member of the}} family Akidnognathidae, which historically has also been referred by as the synonymous Euchambersiidae (named after Euchambersia).|$|E
5|$|Heat {{generated}} from the Farallon Plate subducting below the North American Plate {{led to the creation}} of an island arc of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late Devonian and <b>Permian</b> periods. Later volcanism in the Jurassic intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Adriatic Basin, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of <b>Permian</b> volcanism in the area of Komiža on the island of Vis, in addition to the volcanic islands of Jabuka and Brusnik. Earthquakes are frequent in the area around the Adriatic Sea, although most are too faint to be felt; an earthquake doing significant damage happens every few decades, with major earthquakes every few centuries.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Permian</b> period, the Zion and Kolob {{area was}} a {{relatively}} flat basin near sea level on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from surrounding mountains added weight to the basin, keeping it at relatively the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned to rock) to form the Toroweap Formation, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south {{but not in the}} Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its basement rock.|$|E
5|$|Sir Roderick Murchison (1792–1871) {{was born}} in Ross and Cromarty and served under Wellesley in the Peninsular War. Knighted in 1846, his main {{achievements}} were the investigation of Silurian rocks published as The Silurian System in 1839 and of <b>Permian</b> deposits in Russia. The Murchison crater on the Moon and at least fifteen geographical locations on Earth are named after him.|$|E
