Between May 2004 and March 2006, these soldiers were convicted in courts-martial, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service. Two soldiers, Specialist Charles Graner and PFC Lynndie England, were sentenced to ten and three years in prison, respectively. Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted {{to the rank of}} colonel. Several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted. It is reported that most inmates were innocent of the crimes they were accused of and were simply detained due to them being in the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time.|$|E
25|$|The counterattack failed, as two battalions in {{the centre}} found the German {{shelling}} {{too heavy for}} them to attack, and Monro eventually ordered a halt. Wilson wanted to court martial the two acting battalion commanders for “funk”, after hearing the view {{of one of the}} actual COs (who had been acting in command of the brigade) that the attack had been feasible. Major Armytage, a staff officer from GHQ, visited the sector on 25 May and reported back that Brigadier-General Kellett (99th Brigade, but acting GOC of 2nd Division) was incompetent and “in complete ignorance of the situation”. Haig wrote to Monro (27 May) that Wilson should be asked to explain and that IV Corps, formerly “the most efficient in the army” “had much decreased in military value” and Wilson “had failed as a commander in the field”. Charteris also visited IV Corps HQ on 27 May, and reported back that officers there were “downhearted” and thought the Germans and French better fighters than the British – Wilson later claimed that the officers had been “pulling Charteris’ leg” as he talked of “sweeping victories” within two months. Wilson was almost “degummed” (sacked) but was saved by a strong report in his favour by Monro. The two acting battalion commanders were not court-martialled, but Kellett was never promoted to command a division. Jeffery argues that Wilson was, like many “unsuccessful” corps commanders, largely in the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time, and that Haig’s animosity for Wilson was a factor.|$|E

[...] He also added that it did not sell well in Japan after struggling against more commercially popular games, such as Donkey Kong Country, along with the launch of the PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. With the help of strong marketing from Nintendo, Super Metroid sold better in North America, and a year after its release, Nintendo placed it on their Player's Choice marketing label. By late 2003, the game had shipped 1.42 million copies worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Patient X" [...] the eighth most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show, citing, in particular the abuse of Dmitri. The article noted that [...] "If The X-Files has taught us anything, it’s that if a G-Man asks us if we know anything about anything and we foolishly say yes, our mouths and eyelids will be sewn shut {{and we will be}} brainwashed to kill on demand." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Patient X" [...] a B+, and wrote that the episode [...] "feels epic, in a way the mythology episodes do at their best". However, VanDerWerff noted that [...] "The problem with breaking the status quo on a TV series is that your audience is always going to know in the back of its head that the status quo isn’t really broken." [...] He reasoned that the audience never fully believed that [...] "Mulder could lose his belief in the all-consuming alien conspiracy" [...] or accept the idea that [...] "Scully could find herself dabbling with belief in [...]" [...] Despite these set-backs, however, he noted that [...] "Patient X" [...] was the episode where the series' mythology [...] "gets moving again, after chasing its own tail throughout much of season four and reaching a sort of climax in the opening episodes of season five." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two described the tone of [...] "Patient X" [...] as [...] "truly visceral", citing the faceless men incinerating people as well as the mutilation of the innocent Dmitri, who was [...] "at the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised the episode for [...] "shift the goalposts" [...] and allowing Mulder and Scully to switch roles as the believer and skeptic. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's premise and writing. [...] "'Patient X' is a rare episode in that it actually advances The X-Files mythology, with the news of a vaccine to combat the black oil".

30|$|Although {{not a true}} post-surgical complication, it is {{important}} to identify hardware misplacement and any deviations from the normal postoperative course. Implant malposition can result in spinal instability and postsurgical malalignment. Knowledge of the surgical approach (anterior, posterior, lateral, or caudal) is critical to interpretation of postoperative spines [13]. Transitional lumbosacral vertebral bodies can result in inaccurate identification of the pathologic level, necessitating correlation between radiological and surgical level labelling. Use of software spinal level labelling saved to picture archiving and communication system (PACS) images allows for correlation between the reported pathologic level and patients’ anatomy.

5000|$|One of Christiaan Huygens' {{contacts}} imagined how Athanasius Kircher {{would use}} the magic lantern: [...] "If he would know about {{the invention of the}} Lantern he would surely frighten the cardinals with specters." [...] Kircher would eventually learn about the existence of the magic lantern via Thomas Walgensten and introduced it as [...] "Lucerna Magica" [...] in the widespread 1671 second edition of his book Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae. Kircher claimed that Thomas Walgensten reworked his ideas from the previous edition of this book into a better lantern. Kircher described this improved lantern, but it was illustrated in a confusing manner: the pictures seem technically incorrect with both the projected image and the transparencies (H) shown upright (while the text states that they should be drawn in an inverted position), the hollow mirror is too high in one picture and absent in the other, and the lens (I) seems to be <b>placed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of <b>the</b> slide. Experiments with a construction as illustrated in Kircher's book proved that it could work as a point light-source projection system. The projected image in one of the illustrations shows a person in purgatory or hellfire and the other depicts Death with a scythe and an hourglass. According to legend Kircher secretly used <b>the</b> lantern <b>at</b> night to project the image of Death on windows of apostates to scare them back into church. Kircher did suggest in his book that an audience would be more astonished by the sudden appearance of images if the lantern would be hidden in a separate room, so the audience would be ignorant of the cause of their appearance.|$|R

30|$|Another {{interesting}} aspect in the Mahabharata is {{that without}} the Kurawa, the Pandawa {{would not be able}} to exist in this world. The tension and dynamism throughout the Mahabharata is based on the conflict between the Pandawa and the Kurawa. Both sides are needed to guarantee the stability and harmony of the entire cosmos. So unlike in the Ramayana, where one side is annihilated for the other side to be happy, the annihilation of the Kurawa and the creation of a peaceful world without the Kurawa cannot possibly be an appropriate correct goal. Precisely because of this, the stories of the Baratayuda war are full of tragedy and are regarded as potentially dangerous and explosive for society if they are performed in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time. 12 This is true not only for the deaths of figures on the Pandawa side, such as Abimanyu and Gatotkaca, but just as true for the characters from the Kurawa side such as Karna and Suyudana. In fact, when the war is over, Yudistira, the oldest of the Pandawa brothers, is not happy but instead feels sad. Although in the end Astina 13 has been won, much of the country has been destroyed. Furthermore, although the Baratayuda war has ended, Aswatama still succeeds in killing all the descendants of the Pandawa with the exception of Parikesit, and in so doing has snatched victory from the hands of the Pandawa.|$|R

2500|$|The {{television}} series {{differs from the}} film versions in one fundamental aspect: Nikita (Peta Wilson) is innocent. She is not a killer, nor a drug user, just a homeless young woman in the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time. Section One —an elite, top-secret counter-terrorism organization— sets Nikita up {{to be accused of}} murdering a police officer and {{sentenced to life in prison}} where she supposedly commits suicide and is brought into Section One. Because Nikita will be killed (or [...] "cancelled") if she fails to comply, she is forced to carry out the organization's ruthless methods of fighting terrorism, while attempting to keep her moral integrity intact. This personal struggle becomes the primary conflict of the series. A key scene in the two theatrical films involves Nikita's first assignment —to murder a VIP in a crowded restaurant. Although the Nikita of the {{television series}} eventually does become, by necessity, a ruthless killer, in the television version of this first mission she uses her ingenuity to avoid having to kill the VIP (whereas the film versions of the character complete the assignment).

2500|$|The {{longevity}} {{of the war}} has engendered a strong isolationism in the Ishgardian government which filters down into the attitude of her people. Ishgard withdrew from the first Eorzean Alliance and declined {{to participate in the}} second, being preoccupied with their own war effort. This isolationism also manifests itself in a fanatic persecution of [...] "heretics", i.e., anyone accused of consorting or sympathizing with dragons. In the lead-up to the events of the expansion, Nidhogg, who had been dormant for some time, bellows a great roar to rally the dragon horde to renew their assault on Ishgard.

40|$|The radar {{ray path}} and beam {{broadening}} equations {{are important for}} assimilation of radar data into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. They {{can be used to}} determine the physical location of each radar measurement and to properly map the atmospheric state variables from the model grid to the radar measurement space as part of the forward observation operators. Historically, different degrees of approximations have been made with these equations; however, no systematic evaluation of their impact exists, <b>at</b> least in <b>the</b> context of variational data assimilation. This study examines the effects of simplifying ray path and ray broadening calculations on the radar data assimilation in a 3 D variational data assimilation (3 DVAR) system. Several groups of Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) are performed to test the impact of these equations to radar data assimilation with an idealized tornadic thunderstorm case. This study shows that the errors caused by simplifications vary with the distance between the analyzed storm and the radar. For single time level wind analysis, as the surface range increases, the impact of beam broadening on analyzed wind field becomes evident and can cause relatively large error for distances beyond 150 km. The impact of the earth’s curvature is more significant, even for distances beyond 60 km, because it <b>places</b> <b>the</b> data <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> vertical location. <b>The</b> impact of refractive index gradient is also tested.

That frightened her, and I heard her gallop off across the field. I was on the point of dozing off again when a pair of pigeons settled on the window-sill and began to coo. It is a pretty sound when you are in the mood for it. I wrote a poem once--a simple thing, but instinct with longing--while sitting under a tree and listening to the cooing of a pigeon.

The place was all right. He had struck <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time, that was all. Eleven o'clock at night, when you can't see him, and naturally feel that you want to, is the proper time for an owl. Perched on the roof of a cow-shed in the early dawn he looks silly. He clung there, flapping his wings and screeching <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of his voice. What it was he wanted I am sure I don't know; and anyhow it didn't seem the way to get it. He came to this conclusion himself <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of twenty minutes, and shut himself up and went home. I thought I was going to have at last some peace, when a corncrake--a creature upon whom Nature has bestowed a song like to the tearing of calico-sheets mingled with the sharpening of saws--settled somewhere in the garden and set to work to praise its Maker according to its lights. I have a friend, a poet, who lives just off the Strand, and spends his evenings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Garrick Club. He writes occasional verse for the evening papers, and talks about the [...] "silent country, drowsy with the weight of languors." [...] One of these times I'll lure him down for a Saturday to Monday and let him find out what the country really is--let him hear it. He is becoming too much of a dreamer: it will do him good, wake him up a bit. The corncrake after awhile stopped quite suddenly with a jerk, and for quite five minutes there was silence.|$|R
