Wages in Mexico of those migrants who come back home after being abroad for some time will be crucial to learn something about the selection <b>of</b> <b>non-returning</b> migrants in terms of unobserved productivity. To test whether returning migrants' wages contain any useful information, I follow two steps.

Moreover, I test some implications of the model in the data. Second, I show that returning migrants' wages reflect their pre-emigration productivity and are not affected by possible human capital gains derived from the decision to emigrate. Taking into account all this evidence, I use returning migrants' wages in Mexico upon return to estimate the distribution of human capital <b>of</b> <b>non-returning</b> migrants had they not migrated. I show that emigrants come form the middle part of the distribution of human capital in the origin country.

Design/methodology/approach – The study uses a descriptive framework to establish the validity of several proposed models <b>of</b> <b>non-return.</b> The results are based on an internet survey of Turkish professionals conducted by the authors {{during the first half}} of 2002. A combination of internet search and referral sampling methods is used to collect the data. Correspondence analysis is used to examine the relationship between return intentions and various factors that may affect this intention. Findings – The results emphasize the importance <b>of</b> student <b>non-return</b> versus traditional brain and appear to complement the various theories <b>of</b> student <b>non-return.</b> Many Turkish professionals working abroad are non-returning post-graduate students rather than holders of higher degrees obtained in Turkey who subsequently moved.

The recent economic crises in Turkey have negatively affected return intentions. It is verified that return intentions are indeed linked closely with initial return plans, and that this relationship weakens with stay duration.

Mares served at a second cycle had lower odds not to return than mares served at the third or subsequent cycle (OR= 0. 84).
