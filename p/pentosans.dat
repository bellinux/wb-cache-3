50|$|While rye {{and wheat}} are genetically similar enough to interbreed (resulting in hybrids known as triticale), their biochemistries differ {{enough that they}} affect the {{breadmaking}} process. The key issue is differing amylases, the enzyme which breaks starch down into sugar. While wheat amylases are generally not heat-stable and thus do not affect stronger wheat gluten that gives wheat bread its structure, rye amylase remains active at substantially higher temperatures. Since rye gluten (secalin) is not particularly strong, rye dough structure is based on complex polysaccharides, including rye starch and <b>pentosans.</b> As a result, amylases in rye flour can break down dough structure, inhibiting it from rising.|$|E

40|$|Keywords: <b>pentosans,</b> gluten yield, gluten properties, {{glutenin}} macropolymerThe gluten protein polymeric network plays {{a pivotal}} role in determining the end-use quality of wheat in many food products. The properties of this polymeric network are strongly affected by wheat flour composition (protein, starch and <b>pentosans</b> etc.), ingredients (i. e. salt, fat), processing aids (i. e. enzymes) and process parameters (mixing time, mixing water, temperature). Although the content of <b>pentosans,</b> usually divided into water unextractable solids (WUS) and water extractable <b>pentosans</b> (WEP) in wheat flour is low (1 - 2 %w/w), these polymers {{play an important role in}} gluten formation and properties. Unravelling the underlying relationships and understanding the effect of <b>pentosans</b> on gluten network formation is, therefore, of extreme importance. The aim of this thesis is to clarify the mechanism of action of <b>pentosans</b> on gluten formation and properties. The study was greatly facilitated by the use of a miniaturized set-up for gluten-starch separation. This allowed us to systematically study the effect of <b>pentosans</b> on gluten formation and properties gluten.  The results show that both WUS and WEP affect gluten yield, composition and properties in a similar fashion. Pretreatment of WUS and WEP with xylanase did not remove the negative effect on gluten yield, but addition of xylanase or ferulic acid (FA) during gluten extraction did. Added <b>pentosans</b> hinder gluten agglomeration even if they are only present during the dough dilution phase. This is only partly related to a viscosity effect. FA related interactions are more important here. Both act on the ability of glutenin macropolymer (GMP) particles to form gluten, affecting both gluten yield and gluten rheological properties. We propose that <b>pentosans</b> interfere with gluten formation in both an indirect and a direct way. The indirect effect is related to water availability. The direct effect is related to an interaction between <b>pentosans</b> and gluten in which FA plays an important role. The interference of WUS or WEP with gluten formation caused an incomplete aggregation of gluten protein, which was reflected in a larger average GMP particle size and a smaller tendency of these particles to aggregate. If xylanase or FA were added, aggregation was more complete, which was reflected in a smaller average GMP particle size and a larger tendency of these particles to aggregate. Now, also smaller GMP particles were recovered. The same trend was found with three wheat cultivars of very different qualities. Based on our results, we propose a possible explanation for the effect of <b>pentosans</b> on gluten formation and properties. Both a physical effect and a chemical effect are involved. The physical effect is related to viscosity and likely also depletion attraction between protein particles. The chemical effect is related to FA and 'controls' the tendency of the particles to aggregate and hence also gluten yield. In our explanation <b>pentosans</b> do not so much affect the growth of these particles directly after mixing, but hinder the further agglomeration of especially smaller particles to end up in the gluten. The partial agglomeration of GMP particles will result in turn in GMP with a different GMP particle size distribution and hence in gluten with changed rheological properties...|$|E

40|$|In the gluten-starch {{separation}} process gluten is formed {{first as a}} result of breakdown of the gliadin-glutelin structures during mixing followed by their re-agglomeration. To date the effect of <b>pentosans</b> and enzymes have not been studied separately. A simple modification of TNO Glutomatic system enables <b>pentosans,</b> enzymes, and other materials to be added after the mixing step allowing the effect of these additives to be studied separately. Using this technique, we observed that re-aggregation of gluten proteins starts immediately after the first mixing step during the dough dilution phase. Xylanase addition prior to dough mixing can lead to 'overdose effects' but these were not observed when xylanase was added later during the re-agglomeration phase. We were able to distinguish between physical and chemical effects of <b>pentosans</b> on gluten formation. The effect of water-extractable <b>pentosans</b> is only partly related to its viscosity, a ferulic acid (FA) related reaction is more important. <b>Pentosans</b> affect the affect the agglomeration by increasing the size of the glutenin macropolymer particles. When the water-extractable pentosan effect is prevented by xylanase or FA addition, aggregation during dilution is more extensive and the glutenin macropolymer has a lower average particle size with a resulting difference in gluten rheology. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was designed to analyze the antinutritive compound(s) in rye that depress nutrient utilization; these {{were found to be}} mainly associated with the rye flour fraction. The bran fraction, however, more effectively depressed feed intake than the flour fraction. A starch-rich isolate, which contained most of the antinutritive activity from rye, as well as a protein-rich isolate devoid of activity, were prepared from the flour. Treating the starch-rich isolate of rye flour with. 1 N NaOH stabilized the antinutritive factor. Centrifugation of the NaOH isolate produced four fractions. The supernatant fraction contained considerable quantities of water-soluble and highly viscous <b>pentosans</b> and was the only fraction that significantly depressed nutrient utilization. Increasing additions of the water soluble fraction to a control diet resulted in nearly proportionate decreases in the retention of dry matter and fat.

In the MT- 4 assay dextran sulphate and <b>pentosan</b> polysulphate were more active against HIV- 2 ROD, suramin was more active against HIV- 1 RF, and ATA more active against HIV- 2 EHO. Heparin was less, but castanospermine was more, active against the two HIV- 2 strains. In the CEM assay dextran sulphate and suramin were equally active against all HIV strains, <b>pentosan</b> polysulphate was more active against both HIV- 2 strains, whereas heparin was less active against HIV- 2 ROD and ATA again was more active against HIV- 2 EHO. The compounds and soluble CD 4 (sCD 4) were also tested in the HIV-induced syncytium formation assay, where chronically infected HUT- 78 cells were mixed with uninfected MOLT- 4 or CEM cells. The inhibitory effect of suramin and ATA on syncytium formation was independent of the virus strain or cell type. For dextran sulphate and <b>pentosan</b> polysulphate, it was dependent on virus strain, and for heparin, castanospermine, and sCD 4, it was dependent on both the virus strain and cell type. status: publishe...|$|R
