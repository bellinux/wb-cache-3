40|$|As {{the media}} {{industry}} grapples {{with the issues}} of convergence in a new media environment, so to does the university sector struggle to prepare graduates for this evolving industry. While industry relies on a <b>physical</b> <b>restructure</b> of the newsroom, through the hub-and-spoke to encourage interdependency between mediums, universities must teach these convergence principles within a classroom environment.

50|$|A major {{incentive}} for <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring</b> arrived when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{made it easier}} for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to Mexico.

40|$|Urban {{growth is}} a process that imposes {{profound}} <b>physical</b> and socioeconomic <b>restructuring</b> on cities. Urban land expansion as an immediate physical manifestation of urban growth has been extensively studied using a variety of remote sensing methods. However, little research addresses the interactions between urban land expansion and corresponding activity changes, especially at local scales. We propose an innovative analytical framework that integrates Landsat and nighttime light data to capture the parcel-level relationships between urban land expansion and activity changes. The urban land data are acquired based on the classification of Landsat images, whereas the activity changes are approximated by the nighttime light data. Using the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) (local Moran’s I) approach, four types of local relationships between land expansion and activity changes are defined at the parcel level. The proposed analytical framework is applied in Guangzhou, China, as a case study. The results reveal the mismatched growth between urban land and activity intensity at the parcel level, where the increase in urban land area outpaces the increase of activity intensity. Such results are expected to provide a more comprehensive understanding of urban growth, and can be used to assist urban planning and related decision-making...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{important}} thing {{considered in the}} processing of fish mince meat based products is gel forming ability, which is affected by additives applied in the processing of the products. This research was aimed at studying the effect of TGase and salt addition on the physical and sensory properties of restructured product from Priacanthus macracanthus. Salt was added into minced meat at the concentration of 0, 1 and 2 %, TGase with the concentration of 0; 0. 3; 0. 6 and 1 %. The meat dough was then filled into plastic tubes and heated at 30 o C for an hour before being heated at 90 oC. The restructured meat was then evaluated its sensory properties texture profile (hardness, chewiness, gumminess, cohesiveness, springiness and breaking force, deformation/distance, gel strength), and its microscopic observation under the scanning electron microscope. The result showed that addition of salt as well as TGase gave {{significant effect on the}} sensory properties related to texture, appearance and brightness; and <b>physical</b> properties ofthe <b>restructured</b> products espescially gumminess and breaking force. Based on the sensory score, addition of 2 % salt was enough to produce gel which met with panelist preference, however based on the physical/texture properties addition of 2 % salt and 0. 3 % TGase was needed to increase the gel properties.

Design 15 bibliographic databases, and reference lists and citations of key papers, were searched for randomised controlled trials of home-based behavioural interventions reporting behavioural or health outcomes. Setting Participants' homes. Participants Community-dwelling adults aged ??? 65 ???years with frailty or at risk of frailty. Primary and secondary outcome measures Trials were coded for effects on thematically clustered behavioural, health and well-being outcomes. Intervention content was described using 96 behaviour change techniques, and 9 functions (eg, education, environmental restructuring). Results 19 eligible trials reported 22 interventions. Physical functioning was most commonly assessed (19 interventions). Behavioural outcomes were assessed for only 4 interventions. Effectiveness on most outcomes was limited, with at most 50 % of interventions showing potential positive effects on behaviour, and 42 % on physical functioning. 3 techniques (instruction on how to perform behaviour, adding objects to environment, <b>restructuring</b> <b>physical</b> environment) and 2 functions (education and enablement) were more commonly found in interventions showing potential than those showing no potential to improve physical function. Intervention content was not linked to effectiveness on other outcomes. Conclusions Interventions appeared to have greatest impact on physical function where they included behavioural instructions, environmental modification and practical social support. Yet, mechanisms of effects are unclear, because impact on behavioural outcomes has rarely been considered. Moreover, the robustness of our findings is also unclear, because interventions have been poorly reported. Greater engagement with behavioural science is needed when developing and evaluating home-based health interventions...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 129 - 130). The Underlying Problem The {{management team}} (hereafter {{referred to as}} „management‟) of a leading international oil company identified significant problems within the transport scheduling department operation, extending from concerns related to fragmented roles, the physical location of roles and management isolation, to fragmented department processes and procedures. The resulting poor communication further exacerbated the department‟s inability to provide an effective service to {{both internal and external}} customers. Based on this, management decided to act and embark on an extensive restructuring process in an attempt to improve overall service delivery and ensure department sustainability into the future. This action then paved the way for an extensive restructuring process focussing on changes based on role co-location changes. This process began with the appointment of a new scheduling manager to head up the department and to design and oversee the project plan for restructuring. It was obvious to management that, if action was not taken soon, the department would continue to degrade, thus forcing management to decentralise the transport scheduling function within the company that would result in the disbanding of the department. In Part 1 the description of the problem is defined, beginning with a detailed account of the scheduling department restructure, thereby clearly defining the case study as a research topic. The restructuring account describes inter-role communication, co-location changes through cluster team implementation and the communication changes that were made with customers. It outlines how quality assurance and technological advancements were introduced during the restructuring process in an attempt to improve service delivery, together with the improvement of quality of department outputs that define the level of service to customers. After defining the research topic, the problem situation that must be addressed through this study is delineated. The problem situation defined in this study addresses two main areas of concern. Firstly, whether it is possible to achieve an improvement in service delivery of a department through physical role co-location changes. Secondly, whether it is possible to effect such changes without disrupting the motivation and performance levels of the staff necessary to ensure department sustainability into the future. It is hypothesised that restructuring success and staff motivation and performance are inseparable in ensuring the future of the scheduling department, because they are unified enablers for sustainability. The disruption caused by the restructuring process could {{have a negative impact on}} staff motivation and performance levels, without which improved service outputs by the department would not necessarily be achieved. Therefore, focusing on both of these factors throughout this research process is very important in order to satisfactorily address the research question and concern that has been raised. The description of the department restructure as a case study for research thus highlights a „problem situation‟. A concern is raised that requires urgent research: If improvements in the service delivery of the department have not been realised through the <b>physical</b> role co-location <b>restructure,</b> and, if staff motivation and performance levels have not been maintained during the restructuring process, then the restructure project will have been a costly waste of time, threatening the future sustainability of the department. This concern, therefore, defines the research question that must be answered by this research process, namely that of the level of service improvement and the „recipe‟ for maintaining staff motivation and performance levels. The answer to this question will be achieved by determining both the level of success of the role co-location restructure against pre-defined service improvement indicators, and the management approach required to ensure sustained levels of staff motivation and performance through the restructuring change process of the scheduling department. In order to complete this investigation, the researcher embarks on a rigorous methodological research process that adopts the main stages of the action research cycle...|$|R

Despite the decline, over 3,000 maquiladoras still exist along the 2,000 mile-long United States - Mexico border, providing employment for approximately one million workers, and importing more than $51 billion in supplies into Mexico. Research indicates that maquiladoras' post-NAFTA growth is connected to changes in Mexican wages relative to those in Asia and in the United States, and to fluctuations in U.S. industrial production. As of 2006, maquiladoras still accounted for 45 percent of Mexico’s exports. [...] Maquiladoras, in general, are best represented among operations that are particularly assembly intensive.|$|E
50|$|Offshoring {{is defined}} as the {{movement}} of a business process done at a company in one country to the same or another company in another, different country. Almost always work is moved because of a lower cost of operations in the new location. More recently, offshoring drivers also include access to qualified personnel abroad, in particular in technical professions, and increasing speed to market. Offshoring is sometimes contrasted with outsourcing or offshore outsourcing. Outsourcing is the movement of internal business processes to an external organizational unit. Outsourcing refers to the process by which an organization gives part of its work to another firm / organization and makes it responsible for most of the applications as well as the design of the enterprise business process. This process is done under restrictions and strategies in order to establish consistency with the offshore outsourcing organizations. Many companies nowadays outsource various professional areas in the company such as e-mail services, payroll and call center. These jobs are being handled by other organizations that specialize in each sector allowing the offshoring company to focus more on other business concerns. However, subcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring or <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring,</b> but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolution}} of echolocation {{could be attributed}} to several theories. There are two proposed drives for the hypotheses of cetacean radiation, one biotic and the other abiotic in nature. The first, adaptive radiation, {{is the result of a}} rapid divergence into new adaptive zones. This results in diverse, ecologically different clades that are incomparable. Clade Neocete (crown cetacean) has been characterized by an evolution from archaeocetes and a dispersion across the worlds oceans, and even estuaries and rivers. These ecological opportunities were the result of abundant dietary resources with low competition for hunting. This hypothesis of lineage diversification, however, can be unconvincing due to a lack of support for rapid speciation early in cetacean history. A second, more abiotic drive is better supported. <b>Physical</b> <b>restructuring</b> of the oceans has played a role in echolocation radiation. This was a result of global climate change at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary; from a greenhouse to an icehouse world. Tectonic openings created the emergence of the Southern ocean with a free flowing Antarctic Circumpolar current. These events allowed for a selection regime characterized by the ability to locate and capture prey in turbid river waters, or allow odontocetes to invade and feed at depths below the photic zone. Further studies have found that echolocation below the photic zone could have been a predation adaptation to diel migrating cephalopods. Since its advent, there has been adaptive radiation especially in the family Delphinidae (dolphins) in which echolocation has become extremely derived.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{behavior}} of colloidal aggregates in fluid flow {{is one of the}} fundamental issues for the prediction and control of the dispersion state of colloidal suspension, which is widely encountered in several engineering fields. The structure of the aggregate has a significant role for both the microstructure and macroproperties of the dispersion. An aggregate may vary its structure by three aspects: aggregation with the other to form a larger one, breakup into several smaller pieces, and restructuring i. e. the particles composing aggregate changes their position relatively but still connect to the others. It has been found out that the restructuring not only changes structure of the aggregate itself, but also has a crucial impact on the aggregation and breakup. Therefore, the restructuring of aggregate contributes important role on the overall performance of the dispersion. Recent studies have suggested that in simple shear flow, a widely used model flow system, the aggregate is apt to have high fractal dimension, and {{the behavior}} of such aggregates is complicatedly diverse. Consequently, the restructuring behavior of aggregate having high fractal dimension in simple shear flow is important for either understanding the mechanism of restructuring, or developing highly accurate model predicting the properties of dispersion. In this study, the restructuring behavior of non-fractal aggregate in simple shear flow is investigated. Numerical simulation is conducted to examine the effect of aggregate structure and shear flow condition on the restructuring of aggregate, and the underlying mechanism. The aggregate is composed of a number of monosized, spherical, and hard primary particles. The attraction between particles is calculated by the retarded van der Waals potential. For a system of many particles in fluid medium, the hydrodynamic interaction is very important for a dynamical system, yet very complicated. Stokesian dynamics is a simulation technique which is capable of capturing the complex many-body hydrodynamic interaction. Therefore, Stokesian dynamics approach is employed in the study. The dissertation consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 presents the background and the statement of the study. The gap between the recent studies and this work is also given. Chapter 2 gives details of the numerical simulation, including the construction of the mathematical ormulation, the way it is applied to the study, verification of the method, and the simulation conditions of the study. In Chapter 3, the restructuring behavior of a non-fractal aggregate in simple shear flow is explored. The effect of initial coordination number and the intensity of shear flow on the restructuring of aggregate is investigated. The temporal change in internal structure of the non-fractal aggregate, in terms of coordination number, is examined. It shows that after subjected to shear flow, the aggregate rotates around the vorticity axis and deforms along the streamline. The deformation progresses with time: from spherical shape to ellipsoidal one; finally followed by recovering to almost spherical shape. Simultaneously, the coordination number of aggregate alters and reaches a stable value. The restructuring of aggregate originates from the superimposition of rotational and extensional component of simple shear flow. The aggregate restructures so that a stable structure corresponding to the applied shear flow is obtained. At the same fluid shear stress condition, despite of the significant difference in the initial packing properties, the stable structure of aggregate likely exist at quite compact state, and the stable structure reveals slight difference. The dependence of stable structure on shear flow condition shows similar manner for all aggregates. The stable aggregate in weaker flow is more dense than that in the stronger flow. However there is a limit for such compact structure. A kinetic model based on simultaneous formation and disintegration of links between primary particles is proposed. The model results seem suitable to explain the restructuring of non-fractal aggregate within the scope of the study. The kinetic model furthermore exhibits the dynamic characteristic of the aggregate when the aggregate obtains its stable state. Chapter 4 focuses on a systematic approach for predicting the restructuring of non-fractal aggregate and interprets the <b>physical</b> meaning of <b>restructuring.</b> At first, the transition among stable aggregates reveals to have some reversibility. Further analysis on the volume fraction of the aggregate obtained at the weak flow condition indicates that such aggregate expresses kind of inherent characteristic which is suitable to employ in the general relation of restructuring. By considering these inherit structure into a parameter representing the ability of primary particles to form connection with the others, defined as connection capability, a specific relation between the temporal change in connection capability and the tensile strength of aggregate, calculated by Rumpf’s theory, during the restructuring of aggregate is established. Regarding the stable structure of aggregate in simple shear flow, when the inherit structure of aggregate is taken into account, it shows that the prediction of stable structure and the progress toward stable structure are possible to obtain. In chapter 5, the criteria for restructuring of non-fractal aggregate are analyzed by determination of the strength of aggregate and the hydrodynamic stress acting on the aggregate by fluid. As for the condition of the non-fractal aggregate in this study, the effect of penetration of fluid flow on the restructuring of the aggregate is examined. It shows that the penetration of fluid flow on the aggregate is weekly dependent on porosity of the non-fractal aggregate in the study. Based on the contribution of structure of aggregate on the restructuring and the tensile strength of aggregate, criteria for restructuring of non-fractal aggregate are found out. Chapter 6 is the general conclusion of the dissertation...|$|R
40|$|Sufficient {{physical}} activity, a key {{prerequisite for}} health, {{is lacking in}} many teenagers. Limited knowledge, however, exists about who, when, why, and if New Zealand teenagers are getting their daily dose of health-related physical activity. At conception of this thesis, available information was predominantly survey-derived with no New Zealand data and few international studies that had assessed adolescent physical activity levels objectively. Data were collected from three projects. Convenience sampling was used across all projects to recruit students from low-decile high schools located in the Auckland region. For Project 1, 236 Year 9 to Year 13 students each wore a pedometer for five days (three weekdays and two weekend days) and reported their mode of transportation to and from school. To explore ethnic and sex-specific perceptions of physical activity among youth (i. e., barriers, benefits, potential physical activity enhancing strategies), Project 2 involved nine focus group discussions with 44 Year 9 and Year 10 students who identified as Māori or European. Project 3 was a large cross-sectional study of 3, 451 high school students (Years 9 - 13) from seven low-decile schools. Through this project the following self-reported data were collected: demographics, physical activity levels during four school-day physical activity opportunities (i. e., active travel, lunchtime physical activity, recess physical activity, after-school physical activity), sedentary behaviour (i. e., school-day television (TV) watching), level of perceived encouragement to be active, {{and the presence of}} home policies regarding TV use. Analyses revealed low physical activity participation and high TV use behaviours. Pedometer data showed that only 14. 5 % of participants achieved a conservative criterion of 10, 000 steps daily. Also, daily steps varied by age group (junior students: 11, 079 ± 330; senior students: 9, 422 ± 334), sex (males: 10, 849 ± 381; females: 9, 652 ± 289), time of week (weekday: 12, 259 ± 287; weekend day: 8, 241 ± 329), and transportation mode to/from school (walkers: 13, 308 ± 483; car transit users: 10, 986 ± 435). Low school-day physical activity levels emerged, especially during school hours (i. e., during recess and lunchtime). Based on dichotomised grouping (less active versus more active), the proportion of students in the ‘more active’ group during morning recess and lunchtime, after school, and as part of active travel to/from school were 26 %, 32. 4 %, 56. 3 %, 58. 1 % respectively. Only 11. 1 % of participants were in the ‘more active’ group across all four physical activity opportunities. The focus group data revealed primarily social benefits of physical activity (e. g., meeting new people, fun). Barriers were mainly environment-related and included lack of peer support, low accessibility to and availability of physical activity opportunities, alternative sedentary activities, structure of physical education classes (females only), and distance between home and school (in terms of active transportation). Potential strategies to increase physical activity reflected the articulated barriers and benefits (e. g., increase peer support, parents to turn off the TV, organised activities at school, <b>restructure</b> <b>physical</b> education classes to allow student involvement in the decision-making process of class content). No ethnic and few sex differences in perceptions were found. Focusing on the verbalised importance of social support from the focus groups, Project 3 data showed that the strength of association between perceived encouragement from different support sources (i. e., parents, older siblings/cousins, peers, school) and physical activity participation varied by the physical activity opportunity examined. In particular, multivariate logistical regression showed reduced odds of being in the ‘more active’ group was associated with low parental encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0. 47, 95 % CI: 0. 38 - 0. 58; Seniors, OR: 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 29 - 0. 60) and low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0. 61, 95 % CI: 0. 51 - 0. 74; Seniors, OR: 0. 49, 95 % CI: 0. 35 - 0. 69) for after-school physical activity, low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0. 39, 95 % CI: 0. 32 - 0. 48; Seniors, OR: 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 29 - 0. 57) for lunchtime activity, and low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0. 78, 95 % CI: 0. 66 - 0. 92) for active transportation (junior students only). No significant difference in physical activity was found between students who received high encouragement from two parents than students who reported high encouragement from their sole parent in a single parent family. Concentrating on the after-school period, Project 3 data were analysed to examined the relevance of the displacement hypothesis during this school-day period. The association between parental strategies (i. e., encouragement to be active and having TV limits) and youth after-school activity behaviours (i. e., hours spent viewing TV, physical activity participation) was also examined. Support for the displacement hypothesis emerged. In particular, compared to students who watched less than one hour of TV, those who watched greater than four hours of TV were half as likely to be in the more active group for after-school physical activity participation (adjusted OR: 0. 51; 95 % CI: 0. 40 - 0. 65). Comparing activity profile groups (i. e., based on combined TV use and after-school activity levels), compared to the participants in the ‘low TV/active’ group, participants in the other three activity groups (e. g., ‘high TV/low active’) were at least 1. 28 {{times more likely to have}} parents that executed only one parental strategy and up to 4. 77 times more likely to have parents that did not carry out either strategy. Substantive opportunities exist for youth to be active every day, and in different contexts and environments, yet a large proportion of young people are not maximising these opportunities to be active. If the health issue of inactivity is to be tackled in a comprehensive and efficient manner, a multi-strategy, multi-environment, coordinated approach among local authorities, government agencies, schools, families, and neighbourhoods is required to address the noted policy, physical, and social-related associates of an active lifestyle for youth. Future effort, whether in the form of strategy development, intervention work, or research, needs to be founded upon ecological theory, where both individual and a range of familial, social, and physical environmental factors (and there potential interactions) are considered. Lastly, equal research attention should be directed at improved physical activity levels, and just as importantly, reducing time youth spend in a sedentary state...|$|R

Non-farm land uses to the farmland must not be permitted. However, {{it is even more}} necessary to decide the compatibility of non-farm uses that are invited in villages. Non-farm uses (i.e., industries) should conform to the nature and capacity of the agricultural production system of that particular rural setting so that together the protection of arable land and the better management of non-farm land uses—the densification strategy as a whole can render the villages as the engines of growth and harmonize with the regional setting.|$|E
40|$|In the unrelenting wake of {{the global}} {{recession}} has intensified pressure on the public realm to mediate between different actors vying to assert political rights, economic claims and social expression. Multi-disciplinary frameworks for reading economic systems as integral to the design and lived experience of the public realm have shaped our conceptualisation {{of the financial crisis}} as a city design problem. The following images and narrative offer a socio-spatial and political analysis of the City of London as a 'business as usual' city in which private interests trump public good. Through a design-based proposal for policy intervention and <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring</b> that radically alters the City's socio-spatial realities, we re-imagine the City of London as a true public city for the 21 st century, where 'productivity' stems from the residential diversity, urban intensity and inclusive public spaces produced by significantly increasing the number of people living in the City...|$|E
40|$|Liquid crystal based biosensors detect <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring</b> {{of cells}} via {{changes in the}} {{birefringence}} property or orientation order of the liquid crystal molecules. The strain induced in the liquid crystal molecules is {{closely associated with the}} liquid crystalline phases and Poisson’s ratio of the liquid crystals. Cholesteryl ester liquid crystals (CELC) and CELC based lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) that were regarded as viscoelastic materials are subjected to time-dependent factors (a fluidic environment, incubation time, and temperature). The effects of these factors, qualitatively and quantitatively, were investigated by using cross-polarising microscopy and a uniaxial micro-tensile technique. More lyotropic phases were observed in the liquid crystals as the incubation time in cell culture media was increased. Poisson’s ratio of approximately 0. 58 and 0. 6 were determined for CELC and LLC, respectively, at room (25 oC) and incubation (37 oC) temperatures over a period of 3 days. </p...|$|E
40|$|Original title: Aandacht voor de wijk. One of the {{measures}} used {{to improve the quality}} of life in residential neighbourhoods and make them safer is to demolish existing homes and replace them with new ones. Sometimes the aim is to improve housing quality, but in other situations the explicit aim is to combat 'concentrations of disadvantage'. However, little is known about the social impact of this restructuring. This report looks at the effects of restructuring on the liveability and safety of residential neighbourhoods in 30 large cities in the Netherlands in the period 1995 - 2006. The study examines whether it is mainly individual residents who determine the liveability and safety of a neighbourhood or whether the neighbourhood as a social context is also relevant. In addition, neighbourhoods where substantial <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring</b> has taken place are compared with (corresponding) neighbourhoods where this has not happened: are there any differences in liveability and safety...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{analyze the}} {{reorganization}} {{of the health care}} practice of nurses as an innovative strategy for expansion of access in primary care. Method: qualitative and quantitative study, which interviewed 32 management and care nurses and collected documentary data from public reports of production of nursing consultations from 2010 to 2014, in a municipality in southern Brazil. Data processing for textual analysis was performed by IRAMUTEQ software; for simple descriptive statistical analysis, the program Excel 2013 was used. Results: in the innovative care practice class, associated with awareness of change, related to implementation of the FHS, its challenges and advantages, the following subclasses were identified: reorganization of schedules, nursing consultation, <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring</b> of BHUs, and shared consultation. Final considerations: the need to expand access to and valorization of care practice encourages the development of innovative strategies. The protagonism of care needs to be discussed in the various spaces so that each professional carry out the respective role with competence and efficacy...|$|E
40|$|In Western countries, {{it appears}} to have become ‘fashionable’ for {{politicians}} who are engaged in urban issues to argue for more social mix of the population at the neighbourhood level. It is assumed that a concentration of poverty reproduces a lack of social opportunities. Therefore, a more balanced population was aimed for, through social engineering and mixing the housing stock, that is by <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring.</b> Much criticism argues that these physical methods are too indirect for solving social problems {{and that there is a}} lack of empirical evidence for the claim that social mix would be good for people. Recent comprehensive studies have found nonlinear and significant effects of neighbourhood composition, but the effects were moderate, and other factors, such as the level of education, remain more important. This implies that politicians should be aware of the mix effects, but simultaneously be cautious about putting too much weight on mix strategies. Further study of the relation between neighbourhood composition characteristics and social outcomes is required...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Mega-event {{strategies}} {{and their impact}} on the development of host cities have drawn increasing interest as they have become part of wider city development strategies. However, many city leaders are challenged by a gigantic and complex task after the events: {{how to deal with the}} post-use of large event venues and facilities? How to use the events as a catalyst to facilitate urban development? Mega-event strategies may provide a stimulus for wider urban investments and change. They help to provide host cities an engine for economic growth, facilitating city revitalisation and even urban <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring,</b> enhancing city image, and transforming a city into a globally competitive city. Whereas every host city expects to experience some form of short- and long term impact, the so-called ‘legacy’, it is however difficult for most host city organisers to think beyond the Games in any systematic fashion due to the pressing nature and planning complexities involved. Therefore, although the post-Games period is by far the longest period that stretches for decades after the Games to affect a host city, it is “clearly the least-planne...|$|E
40|$|The global {{trend of}} ageing populations {{is present in}} Brazil. Brazilian society is going through an {{intensive}} process of transformation, where young adults are increasingly fewer, thus raising {{the question of who}} will take care of the elderly in the 21 st Century? There is an urgent need to establish care networks for the elderly, covering primary care, including care with housing (Healthy Housing), as well as to ensure access to secondary and tertiary levels of care, providing early diagnoses and rapid access to treatment. This article reports two Brazilian experiences: the restructuring of a shelter for elderly indigents, with 500 elderly residents in Rio de Janeiro, which involved a broad process of humanization, with strong <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring</b> of the buildings that dated from 1930; and the process of organizing the care referral line for the elderly within the Conceição Hospital Group, in Rio Grande do Sul State, which included a health care complex with diverse health units, encompassing all stages of care: from primary care to the most complex hospital treatment...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{phenomena}} of economic boom during the 1990 s {{have led to}} the <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring</b> within the old centre of Surabaya. The changes is inevitable, thus the real issue is how to find the elements of persistent, constraining development to some degree that could be applied to influence future development. The objective of the research is to understand the impact of intervention, and to find the typo-morphological framework in the European and the Chinese quarters, from 1787 to 2005 for future development. A synchronic and a diachronic method is applied to understand the old town centre historical development, and the relationship between building type and urban fabric. The result shows three different degrees of persistent. The town plan of the Chinese and the European districts show a notable persistence. However the land utilization is less persistent especially in the European district such as the first and the second city wall were replaced by roads, and the first and the second fort were replaced by open space and residential uses. Finally, the buildings fabric shows a drastic change such as most of the nineteenth century Indische buildings have been replaced by the 1920 s modern buildings...|$|E
40|$|Neighbourhoods in The Netherlands differ {{strongly}} in social compositions {{and in the}} socio-economic perspectives of their residents. Increasing fears for diminishing social cohesion stimulated policy makers to focus on bettering perspectives for residents in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Neighbourhood intervention strategies in The Netherlands often concentrate on stimulating social and socio-economic mix, by <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring</b> of the neighbourhood. Social mix is assumed {{to have a positive}} effect on the upward social mobility of residents because it leads to positive role models in the neighbourhood and creates social bridges. We studied the effects of neighbourhood characteristics - indicators for social level and for social mix - on the income development of its residents between 1999 and 2005. We used an integral dataset, register-based and covering the entire Dutch population: the Social Statistical Database of Statistics Netherlands. Multilevel regression analyses showed a small, significant effect of a number of neighbourhood characteristics: income mix, mean income level and, surprisingly, ethnic mix, were positively related to the income development of residents aged 25 to 49. However, neighbourhood effects were very modest compared to the large influence of individual characteristics. Policymakers in Western Europe and North America involved in urban redevelopment programmes should be aware of that.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, urban {{restructuring}} programs have been implemented in many Western European cities with the main goal of combating a variety of socioeconomic problems in deprived neighborhoods. The main instrument of restructuring has been housing diversification and tenure mixing. The demolition of low-quality (social) housing {{and the construction of}} owner-occupied or private-rented dwellings was expected to change the population composition of deprived neighbourhoods through the in-migration of middle and high income households. Many studies have been critical with regard to the success of such policies in actually upgrading neighborhoods. Using data from the 31 largest Dutch cities for the 1999 to 2013 period, this study contributes to the literature by investigating the effects of large-scale demolition and new construction on neighborhood income developments on a low spatial scale. We use propensity score matching to isolate the direct effects of policy by comparing restructured neighborhoods to a set of control neighborhoods with low demolition rates, but with similar socioeconomic characteristics. The results indicate that large-scale demolition leads to socioeconomic upgrading of deprived neighborhoods through the in-migration of middle and high income households. We find no evidence of spillover effects to nearby neighborhoods, suggesting that <b>physical</b> <b>restructuring</b> only has very local effects. Urban Renewal and Housin...|$|E
