25|$|Many inventors {{lived in}} Salem. Moses Farmer {{was the first}} to light his home by {{electricity}} and sold his lightbulb to Thomas Edison. Edison also used his arc lighting in his demonstrations. Farmer provided Tesla with his lightbulbs for Westinghouse after Edison refused to sell them his to light the Columbian Exposition World Fair of 1893. Farmer would die at the fair. Charles Grafton Page made an electromagnet that could lift 1,000 pounds, electric train, an early telegraph, and worked in the US patent office. He was a precursor to what would befall Tesla for his laboratory had burned down during the Civil War and the section of the Smithsonian which housed his magnet also burned at a later date. Joseph Dixon the inventor of high temperature graphite crucibles, the Single Reflex Lens, and the Dixon-Ticonderoga #2 pencil lived in Salem. Packard Electric were making electric cars in the nineteenth century up to the 1914 fire which destroyed their factory. Alexander Graham Bell invented the phone in Salem and held the first public demonstration at the Salem Lyceum Hall. Also Nicola Tesla would create a power plant for Pequot Mills. He was in the area after Mark Twain introduced him to John Hammond Sr.. Tesla would give his son, John Hammond Jr. the patents for remote control which Hammond used to develop guided missiles and boats for the military during WWII. Tesla would conduct tests on ESP at Hammond Castle using a Faraday Cage to prove ESP did not transmit through electromagnetic waves, for a psychic received a message from a woman in the cage a few miles away. It was John Hammond Sr. who helped destroy Tesla's <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>free</b> wireless electricity since he just invested heavily in a copper mine that was going to create electrical lines for transmission. Also Elihu Thomson had his Thomson-Houston Electric Company in the bordering town of Lynn and lived in the other border town Swampscott. This company will be merged with Edison Electric Company to make General Electric. Many of these Salem inventors' inventions are still displayed in the Smithsonian in the electricity display room.|$|E

That same year he was appointed United States Postmaster General by President Benjamin Harrison; he was accused by the newspapers of the day of buying the post. Wanamaker was credited by his friends with introducing the first commemorative stamp and many efficiencies to the Postal Service. He was the first to make <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>free</b> rural postal service in the United States, although the plan was not implemented until 1896.|$|E
5000|$|In late April, after Chávez {{announced}} that Venezuela {{would leave the}} Andean Community unless Colombia, Ecuador and Peru abandoned their <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Agreements with the United States, Alan García criticized him, arguing that this was equivalent to blackmail, {{and that it was}} very hypocritical, considering the amounts of oil exports from Venezuela to the US. Chávez responded by calling García [...] "corrupt" [...] and a [...] "thief", and the new candidate of Peru's rich and of the US, following Flores' defeat. He also endorsed Humala again and threatened to withdraw his ambassador to Peru if García won. After accusations by García and the Peruvian government of interference in the election by the Venezuelan president, Toledo and García were called [...] "caimans from the same well" [...] and the former was labelled as US President Bush's [...] "puppet" [...] and [...] "office boy" [...] by Chávez. This led to the mutual withdrawal of ambassadors. http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/peru/archives/2006_04_28.php Interestingly, García had been the notable exception to criticism of Humala's January meeting with Chávez, in an apparent move to avoid confrontation with the latter, who could be a leftist ally in the region during his potential presidency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Tree-based path {{planners}} {{have been shown}} to be well suited to solve various high dimensional motion planning problems. Here we present a variant of the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) path planning algorithm that is able to explore narrow passages or difficult areas more effectively. We show that both workspace obstacle information and C-space information can be used when deciding which direction to grow. The method includes many ways to grow the tree, some taking into account the obstacles in the environment. This planner works best in difficult areas when <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>free</b> flying rigid or articulated robots. Indeed, whereas the standard RRT can face difficulties planning in a narrow passage, the tree based planner presented here works best in these areas. I...|$|R
500|$|During the 1928 {{legislative}} session, {{it became}} clear that the bipartisan support shown for Sampson had been one of political convenience rather than true conviction. Among the minor accomplishments of the session were the creation of the Kentucky Progress Commission (the forerunner of the State Department of Commerce) and the adoption of [...] "My Old Kentucky Home" [...] as the state song. The Democratic General Assembly sanctioned Sampson's <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>free</b> textbooks, but did not fund it. Proposals to ban parimutuel betting and the teaching of evolution in the state's schools were both defeated. Kentucky historian James C. Klotter called the 1928 legislative session [...] "almost a 'do-nothing' session". Following the session, a grand jury indicted Sampson for accepting gifts from the textbook companies, but the indictment was eventually dismissed.|$|R
