40|$|Reducing {{the wind}} loading of {{photovoltaic}} structures {{is crucial for}} their structural stability. In this study, two solar panel arrayed sets were numerically tested for load reduction purposes. All panel surface areas of the arrayed set {{are exposed to the}} wind similarly. The first set was comprised of conventional panels. The second one was fitted with square holes located right at the gravity center of each panel. Wind flow analysis on standalone arrayed set of panels at fixed inclination was carried out to calculate the wind loads at various flow velocities and directions. The <b>panels</b> which included <b>holes</b> reduced the velocity in the downwind flow region and extended the low velocity flow region when compared to the nonhole panels. The loading reduction, in the arrayed set of <b>panels</b> with <b>holes</b> ranged from 0. 8 % to 12. 53 %. The maximum load reduction occurred at 6. 0 [*]m/s upwind velocity and 120. 0 ° approach angle. At 30. 00 approach angle, wind load increased but marginally. Current research work findings suggest that the <b>panel</b> <b>holes</b> greatly affect the flow pattern and subsequently the wind load reduction. The computational analysis indicates {{that it is possible to}} considerably reduce the wind loading using <b>panels</b> with <b>holes...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An Equivalent Radius Model (ERM) for the {{prediction}} of compressive strength reduction in laminates with molded-in holes is presented. This model replaces a molded-in <b>hole</b> <b>panel</b> by an equivalent drilled <b>hole</b> <b>panel</b> with the same notched strength. As a result, the ERM relies on an accurate stress failure criterion for drilled <b>hole</b> <b>panels.</b> The experimental results obtained from woven carbon fiber/epoxy laminates with molded-in and drilled holes indicate that the proposed model satisfactorily simulates the observed strength behavior. It is believed that {{the simplicity of the}} present model coupled with its accuracy and generality makes it of practical value to the design engineers. 1...|$|R

50|$|For a while, {{perforated}} metal <b>panels</b> with <b>holes</b> in the 1 - 10 mm range {{have been}} used as a cage for sound-absorbing glass-fiber bats where large holes let the sound waves reach into the absorbent fiber. Another use has been the creation of narrowband Helmholtz absorbers which can be tuned by hole size and the dimensions of the hole distance and air gap behind the panel. However, when the hole dimensions are in the region of 0.05 - 0.5 mm, the narrow absorption peaks become much wider, making the additional fiber absorber more or less unnecessary, while still maintaining a very high absorption factor. By varying geometrical and material parameters, the acoustical performance can be tailored to meet a multitude of specifications in various applications.|$|R
