5000|$|Prior to electricity, various {{systems have}} been used for {{transmission}} of power across large distances. Chief among them were telodynamic (cable in motion), pneumatic (pressurized air), and hydraulic (pressurized fluid) transmission. [...] Cable cars were the most frequent example of telodynamic transmission, whose lines could extend for several miles for a single section. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>transmission</b> was used for city power transmission systems in Paris, Birmingham, Rixdorf, Offenbach, Dresden and Buenos Aires {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Cities in the 19th century also used hydraulic transmission using high pressure water mains to deliver power to factory motors. London's system delivered 7000 hp ( [...] 5 megawatts) over a 180 mi network of pipes carrying water at 800 psi. These systems were replaced by cheaper and more versatile electrical systems, but by the end of the 19th century, city planners and financiers were well aware of the benefits, economics, and process of establishing power transmission systems.|$|E

Many kinds of analysis about hydraulic and pneumatic model have been put forward.

However, the traditional pneumatic-hydraulic transmission is energy dissipation because the air expansion energy existing in the compressed air is wasted. From then on, very little study on any type of sustainable vehicle driven by pneumatic-hydraulic transmission has been reported [14, 15], especially that using air expansion energy.|$|R

40|$|Grip force sensors {{compatible}} with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) are used in human motor control and decision-making research, providing objective and sensitive behavioral outcome measures. Commercial sensors are expensive, cover limited force ranges, rely on <b>pneumatic</b> force <b>transmission</b> that cannot detect fast force changes, or are electrically active, which {{increases the risk of}} electromagnetic interference. We present the design and evaluation of a low-cost, 3 D-printed, inherently MRI-compatible grip force sensor based on a commercial intensity-based fiber-optic sensor. A compliant monobloc structure with flexible hinges transduces grip force to a linear displacement captured by the fiber-optic sensor. The structure can easily be adapted for different force ranges by changing the hinge thickness. A prototype designed for forces up to 800 [*]N was manufactured and showed a highly linear behavior (nonlinearity of 2. 37 %) and an accuracy of 1. 57 % in a range between zero and 500 [*]N. It can be printed and assembled within one day and for less than $ 300. Accurate performance was confirmed, both inside and outside a 3 [*]T MRI scanner within a pilot study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is simplifying and downsizing of pneumatic system consisting of many pneumatic actuators. For this purpose a new method of multiplex <b>pneumatic</b> <b>transmission</b> for multi-pneumatic servo system is proposed. The pneumatic valve for this system has a simple structure consisting of two vibrators supported by springs. The working principle of the valve is based on vibrator resonance caused by multiplex pneumatic vibration in air supply line and this makes the valve work as an ON/OFF valve without electric wire or independent pneumatic tubes. Valve control needs superimposed only an air supply tube for its independent control, making this pneumatic system suitable for the system having many degrees of freedom. Two prototype valves have been developed to confirm the basic function and adapted to the pneumatic system consisting of two pneumatic cylinders. The prototype valve has been designed based on the result of a dynamic simulation and it was confirmed by basic experiments. In the experiment, the independent control for two pneumatic cylinders with prototype valves has been successfully realized...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of a nonintrusive high angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing (HI-FADS) system was verified for quasi-steady flight conditions up to 55 deg {{angle of attack}} during the F- 18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) Program. The system is a matrix of nine pressure ports arranged in annular rings on the aircraft nose. The complete airdata set is estimated using nonlinear regression. Satisfactory frequency response was verified to the system Nyquist frequency (12. 5 Hz). The effects of acoustical distortions within the individual pressure sensors of the nonintrusive pressure matrix on overall system performance are addressed. To quantify these effects, a frequency-response model describing the dynamics of acoustical distortion is developed and simple design criteria are derived. The model adjusts measured HI-FADS pressure data for the acoustical distortion and quantifies the effects of internal sensor geometries on system performance. Analysis results indicate that sensor frequency response characteristics very greatly with altitude, thus {{it is difficult to}} select satisfactory sensor geometry for all altitudes. The solution used presample filtering to eliminate resonance effects, and short pneumatic tubing sections to reduce lag effects. Without presample signal conditioning the system designer must use the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>transmission</b> line to attenuate the resonances and accept the resulting altitude variability...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigates a novel {{method for}} energy saving in a point-to-point actuation of a pneumatic system. The method predicts the system's actuation using the Gas Law and the actuator model, and commits air supply cut-off {{at the time}} when the energy in the actuator is sufficient to complete the actuation task. Experimental implementation is compared with simulation. The effect of the method is compared with conventional no cut-off and end-stroke cut-off actuations. Lumped and finite difference methods are used for transmission line and system actuation modelling. The transmission line, actuator and control valves are modelled and integrated for the system actuation simulation and comparisons between simulation and measured data are performed. Pressure oscillation in the transmission line exists and is captured by stimulating the air dynamics using a new transmission line experimental method. The friction model of the pneumatic actuator is determined by experiment and applied to the energy saving control system as well as the computer modelling algorithm. The determination of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>transmission</b> line bulk modulus is performed through experiment due to the confidentiality of Young's modulus value needed for its calculation. Significant effect has been achieved in implementation and it is found that cut off at end-stroke and cut-off using model prediction can reduce the amount of air potential energy wasted in conventional actuation by up to 43. 5 % and 80. 2 % respectively. However the actuation time of predicted cut-off increases by up to 25 %...|$|E

40|$|Low energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the main detractors of fluid power technology. To ensure the availability and sustainability of energy sources, fluid power technology needs to meet high energy-efficiency and cost standards. This study aims to design, simulate and test a control algorithm that attenuates the detrimental effects of air compressibility on the performance and efficiency of a <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder. The <b>transmission</b> of power over long distances makes it more difficult for fluid power technology to meet energy-efficiency and cost requirements. Transmitting power over long distances represents a challenge particularly for pneumatics due to the compressibility of air. The compressibility of air transmitted through lengthy tubing decreases the performance and efficiency of pneumatic actuators, mainly affecting their time response and velocity. The system under analysis was composed of a pneumatic cylinder, two proportional control valves, and connective tubing. The dynamics of the individual components were characterized through experimentation. Nonlinear and linear models for the system were validated through the comparison of simulated and experimental data. The models predicted the system behavior more accurately at 2. 5 Hz, when friction effects became negligible, as compared to 1. 0 and 0. 5 Hz. A controller was designed using pole/zero cancellation, a control strategy able to mask undesirable dynamics of the system being controlled. Pole/zero cancellation had superior performance in the attenuation of air compressibility effects in comparison to proportional and proportional-derivative (PD) control. System performance and efficiency were assessed in terms of the variation of the length of tubing connecting the pneumatic cylinder and the control valves. Pole/zero cancellation enabled the cylinder to achieve similar levels of performance for long (3. 0 m) tubing as with short (0. 55 m) tubing. With a 1. 0 -Hz sinusoidal input and equal control gains, pole/zero cancellation reduced the tracking error by approximately 30 % and 23 % in comparison to proportional and PD control, respectively. In terms of efficiency, with the system tracking a 2. 5 -Hz sinusoidal command, and using equal control gains, pole/zero cancellation increased the cylinder efficiency by approximately 36 % and 54 % in comparison to proportional and PD control, respectively. In general, pole/zero cancellation increased the system performance and efficiency in comparison to the other control schemes applied...|$|R
