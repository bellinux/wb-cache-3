5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens {{about global warming}} via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given {{more than a thousand}} times. The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his <b>presentation</b> <b>at</b> a town-hall meeting on global warming, which coincided with the opening of The Day After Tomorrow.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of a {{controversial}} speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow Clicker for a <b>presentation</b> <b>at</b> a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.|$|E
