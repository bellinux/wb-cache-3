In 1833, the Government of India Act passed by the British Parliament created a local government for the whole of India made up of the Governor-General and his Counsellors. They were collectively known as the Governor-General of India in Council and had sole power to pass laws for the Straits Settlements. However, India's slow response to problems in the Settlements such as the ineffective court system and the lack of Straits representation in the Indian legislative council prompted merchants and other prominent <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for the Settlements to be governed directly by the Colonial Office in the United Kingdom. Finally, on 1 April 1867 the Straits Settlements were separated from the Government of India and became a Crown colony.|$|E

As of January 29, 2011, none of the cases in Venezuela proved fatal, but two patients were hospitalized. Since the victims had quickly sought help, the outbreak was detected and contained.|$|E

In 1990, Manson met a woman at a McDonald's {{restaurant}} in Fort Lauderdale who invited him to spend a weekend with her in New York City.

Manson spent the remainder of his stay in New York at the clubbers' hotel room, where he stumbled on public-access television cable television channels, which were [...] "a completely new phenomenon" [...] to him. Manson [...] "spent hours flipping through the station, watching Pat Robertson preach about society's evils and then ask <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him with their credit card number," [...] while [...] "on the other channel, a guy was greasing up his cock with Vaseline and asking <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> and give him their credit card number." [...] This inspired Manson to grab the hotel notepad and begin penning the song's lyrics. Manson explains in his autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell that [...] "I had written other songs I thought were good, but [...] "Cake and Sodomy" [...] {{was more than just a}} good song. As an anthem for the hypocritical America slobbering on the tit of Christianity, it was a blueprint for our future message." ...|$|E

Additionally, the banner urged <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Congress and voice opposition to the FISA Improvements Act, which the ACLU called [...] "a dream come true for the NSA" [...] that would [...] "codify the NSA's unconstitutional call-records program and allow bulk collection of location data from mobile phone users." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both {{throughout}} Bonin's {{trials and}} in the years prior to his execution, much speculation was given {{as to whether the}} root cause of Bonin's crimes lay in his abusive, dysfunctional upbringing. Opponents and advocates of the death penalty alike were in agreement Bonin had endured extensive physical and sexual abuse in his childhood, but much scorn was given to the claims from Bonin's attorneys and supporters that the murders had been a direct manifestation of the abuse he had endured as a child and adolescent, and an attempt to purge his frustration and anger onto his victims. In one article published in the San Francisco Chronicle three days prior to Bonin's execution, an editor named Robert Morse opined: [...] "Bonin was abused as a child. The abuse seems to have been bad, but not nearly as gruesome as the abuse he dealt out. [...] world is filled with articulate people who can write and paint and were abused as children; very few of them become serial killers. The crime rate among the mentally ill is lower than among so-called 'normal' <b>people.</b> <b>To</b> <b>call</b> Bonin's evil a psychiatric disorder, as the defense has, or an illness, is to slander the mentally ill." ...|$|E
