40|$|Is a high black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> for US dollars {{associated}} with rising or falling income inequality within a nation? This paper empirically examines this issue within {{a cross section}} of countries and finds that the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> is strongly {{associated with}} rising income inequality as measured by changes in the Gini coefficient. Others have used the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> as a proxy to measure protectionist policies so a possible implication is that protectionist policies further skew the distribution of income within a country. However, other measures of protectionist policies are not associated with changes in income inequality. Instead, other factors which might drive the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> such as interest rate differentials appear to be more relevant in explaining why the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> is positively related with increases in income inequality. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{is made to}} provide an {{understanding}} of the black <b>market</b> <b>premium.</b> To this end the operation of the parallel or black market for US dollars in Greece during the recent float is investigated. A series of tests is employed in order to examine the role of changes in agents' expectations about the official exchange rate in determining the black <b>market</b> <b>premium.</b> To test the impact of anticipated and unanticipated shocks to the official exchange rate on the black <b>market</b> <b>premium,</b> the two-step procedure recommended by Barro (1977) and modified by Hoffman et al. (1994) is employed. The main finding of this analysis is that expectations of devaluation cause movements in the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> for Greece and this result suggest that portfolio balance models may be appropriate for understanding the behaviour of the black <b>market</b> <b>premium</b> in Greece. ...|$|R
