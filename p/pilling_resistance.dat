40|$|Textile {{processing}} is {{a growing}} industry that traditionally has used a lot of water, energy and harsh chemicals. Due to the ever-growing costs for water and energy world wide investigations are carried out to substitute conventional chemical textile processes by environmentfriendly and economically attractive bioprocesses using enzymes. Conventional chemical processes are generally severe and fibre damage may occur. However, enzymes are characterized by their ability to operate under mild conditions {{and as a result}} processes can be carried out without further damaging the fibers. Enzymes are also readily biodegradable and therefore potentially harmless and environmentally friendly. This work represents a review of various properties of enzymes and applications of biopolishing enzymes in textiles. Biopolish treatment is imparted to any fiber or fabric to improve its smoothness and shine on the fabric’s surface by removing fiber-yarn ends projecting from it. Biopolishing enzymes used in biopolishing, offers a number of benefits such as improvement in <b>pill</b> <b>resistance</b> (a <b>pill,</b> colloquially known as a bobble, is a small ball of fibres that forms on a piece of cloth), superior colour brightness, softness and cooler feel...|$|R

40|$|Use of oral {{contraceptives}} induce changes in haemostatic parameters: changes {{occur in the}} procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic systems. The increased risk of venous thromboembolism with use of third, as compared with second generation {{oral contraceptives}}, found in epidemiological studies, has stimulated new research in haemostatic changes induced by both generations of oral contraceptives. A randomized crossover study showed that use of the third generation pill caused a greater increase of factor VII and prothrombin and a more pronounced decrease of factor V than the second generation <b>pill.</b> Acquired <b>resistance</b> to activated protein C (APC) was induced more strongly by preparations of the third than by those of the second generation.

40|$|Fabric pilling is {{a serious}} problem for the apparel industry, causing an {{unsightly}} appearance and premature wear. Woolen products are particularly prone to pilling. Recently, a process for production of woolen nonwoven apparel fabrics has been commercialized in Australia, and may lead to new markets for Australian wool. However, the success of such nonwoven fabrics will partly rely on their propensity to pill. A key element in the control of fabric pilling is the evaluation of <b>resistance</b> to <b>pilling</b> by testing. <b>Resistance</b> to <b>pilling</b> is normally tested in the laboratory by processes that simulate accelerated wear, followed by a manual assessment of the degree of pilling by an expert based on a visual comparison of the sample to a set of test images.

30|$|Some common {{problems}} of textile dyeing industries include uneven or faulty dyeing and formation of color patches on the fabric surface during dyeing and downstream processing of textiles materials. Such {{problems in the}} finished quality of fabric are generally tackled through a chemical stripping process which is a common practice in dyeing industries for the deep shade batches. However, reactive dyes cannot be stripped satisfactorily from cellulosic materials due {{to the formation of}} co-valent bonds between dye and fiber. This research was undertaken using 2.5 % and 5 % bi-hetero reactive dyes on pretreated cotton fabric and dye stripping was carried out in alkali reductive stripping process. The aim of the work was to investigate the effects of dye stripping on the quality of cotton fabric. Strength loss, weight loss, <b>pilling</b> <b>resistance</b> and absorbency of stripped fabric were calculated. Though with the increase of concentration of stripping chemicals and temperature, stripping percentages were improved; processing damage to the fabric such as losses in strength, weight and <b>pilling</b> <b>resistance</b> ratings was found. In contrast, increased fabric absorbency was found due to stripping. This is explained that during stripping, alkaline solution as an intracrystalline swelling agent is effective in loosening the crystalline region of cotton in addition to the amorphous region. Stripping agent can also attack such crystalline region. As a result, cotton fiber can release maximum number of hydroxyl groups which previously formed covalent bonds. This is the reason behind the stripped fabric having more water absorbency.|$|E
30|$|Again, {{the removal}} of surface fibers or fibrils and an {{increase}} in the <b>pilling</b> <b>resistance</b> value are directly related to an increase in weight loss, which should not exceed 3 – 5  % (Rau et al. 2008). In addition, for knitted fabric, a weight loss of about 1 – 2  % is reported to be enough to release a remarkable reduction in pilling tendency (Saravanan et al. 2009). On the other hand, commercially, a strength loss of 10  % is considered acceptable due to biopolishing (Choudhury 2006). High enzyme loads and long treatment times may lead to severe fiber damage and strength loss (Andreaus et al. 2104).|$|E
30|$|So, the PK-treated samples {{numbering}} from 13 to 17 {{and sample}} no. 11 showed the best pilling performance. This pilling performance clearly {{indicated that the}} acid enzyme significantly improved the <b>pilling</b> <b>resistance</b> of the treated fabric samples. In fact, PK cellulase showed more activity at 1 and 1.5  % than using 0.5  %. Due to high biopolishing effect, all surface hairy fibers were removed properly. Therefore, when friction was applied on the treated fabric during the pilling test, the tendency of pill formation was significantly lower and majority caused a rating of 5, i.e., no change at the surface. A good depilling effect was also found due to mechanical agitation which accelerated the cellulase action.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the issue}} {{related to the}} influence of finishing on fabrics, made of yarn of different raw material, by research of mechanical and end-use properties. The issue is relevant to textile companies that manufacture fabrics from various natural fibres and its blends. During the manufacturing process, it has been noticed that finishing has a negative effect on end-use properties, such as abrasion resistance and pilling. Moreover, finishing has an impact on mechanical properties of fibres, such as breaking force and elongation at break. Therefore, this work analyses the abovementioned mechanical (breaking force and elongation at break) properties of yarn and fabrics made of it and end-use (abrasion resistance and pilling) properties of grey fabrics and finished fabrics. It has been determined that the strength and tension rates of used yarn have an impact on fabrics and its breaking force and elongation at break. The fabric finishing affects the properties of the mentioned fabrics, i. e. breaking force decreases after finishing, while the elongation at break increases. During finishing, fabrics undergo various chemical and mechanical impacts which might decrease the quality of fabrics. On the other hand, fabrics become denser, its threads crimp, and thus fabrics become more tensile. Finishing affects end-use fabric properties as well (resistance to abrasion and pilling). These properties of fabrics worsen. Dependencies are described by linear equations. During the abrasion resistance analysis, almost all of the dependencies were strong. Abrasion resistance of grey fabrics was higher than those after finishing. <b>Pilling</b> <b>resistance</b> of grey fabrics is also better than of fabrics after finishing. <b>Pilling</b> <b>resistance</b> dependencies on the number of abrasion cycles were mostly of medium strength.

40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiations}} can act {{in different}} ways on the functionalization of textiles, through pre- or posttreatments, in order to modify their behavior in dyeing and finishing processes.

The proposed spinning method separates the false twisting process into twisting and untwisting processes which are combined in one step in the low torque spinning method.
