40|$|The rate of {{multiplication}} of PVM in {{the mouse}} lung is relatively constant, averaging 7. 9 -fold per day with but slight variations, {{irrespective of the}} amount of virus inoculated. Similarly, the rate of increase in the amount of pneumonia is relatively constant, averaging 4. 7 -fold per day, even though the quantity of virus inoculated is varied over a wide range. It follows that viral multiplication proceeds 1. 7 times more rapidly than does extension of the <b>pathological</b> <b>lesion,</b> both reaching limiting maximal values in periods which are predictable from the amount of virus inoculated. From the concentration of virus determined {{at any time during the}} incremental period, the amount of pneumonia present earlier or later in the incremental period can be computed with considerable precision. The results support the postulate that the extent of the <b>pathological</b> <b>lesion</b> is dependent upon the degree of viral multiplication...|$|E
30|$|This {{study found}} no {{association}} between groups of radiological morphology and underlying cause or {{location of the}} <b>pathological</b> <b>lesion.</b> Though no such association was observed, {{it is likely that}} the clearly different appearances of hydrocephalus on axial sections of the lateral ventricles have underlying patophysiological causes.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundElectrical {{stimulation}} of the intact (unsectioned) cervical vagus in rabbits frequently provokes ventricular tachyarrhythmias that are often accompanied by mitral regurgitation. Unique <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> often arise on the mitral valve, papillary muscles, and mitral annulus (mitral complex), the latter two of which become swollen and stiffened. These lesions are reversible in nature. Previous studies have essentially ignored the basal portion except for the mitral annulus. Therefore, the present study examined <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> on the left ventricular basal portion in rabbits. MethodsThe intact right vagal nerves of 20 anesthetized rabbits were repeatedly electrically stimulated under electrocardiographic monitoring. Colloidal carbon (lml) was injected intravenously immediately {{after the end of}} the stimulation and all animals were killed 1 week later. <b>Pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> were identified as carbon deposits visible at gross examination. ResultsVentricular bigeminy was induced after vagal stimulation in 15 (75 %) of the 20 rabbits. <b>Pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> were evident on the basal portion in 16 (80 %) and on the mitral valve and papillary muscles of 15 (75 %) of the 20 rabbits. Ventricular bigeminy was closely associated with the development of the <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions,</b> which were rarely observed on the ventricular apex. ConclusionCardiomyopathic lesions involving the basal portion and mitral complex were frequently induced in rabbits by vagal stimulation. These lesions bear a close similarity in distribution and reversibility to inverted Takotsubo cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractH 9 N 2 avian {{influenza}} virus circulates widely in poultry {{and has been}} responsible for sporadic human infections in several regions. Few studies have been conducted on the pathogenicity of H 9 N 2 AIV isolates that have different genomic features. We compared the pathology induced by a novel reassortant H 9 N 2 virus and two currently circulating H 9 N 2 viruses that have different genomic features in ferrets. The results showed that the three viruses can induce infections with various amounts of viral shedding in ferrets. The novel H 9 N 2 induced respiratory infection, but no <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> were observed in lung tissues. The other two viruses induced mild to intermediate <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> in lung tissues, although the clinical signs presented mildly in ferrets.

40|$|Thirty {{images with}} added {{simulated}} <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> at two different dose levels (100 % and 10 % dose) were evaluated with the free-response forced error experiment by nine experienced radiologists. The simulated <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> {{present in the}} images were classified according to four different parameters: the position within the lumbar spine, possibility to perform a symmetrical (left-right) comparison, the lesion contrast, and {{the complexity of the}} surrounding background where the lesion was situated. The detectability of each lesion was calculated as the fraction of radiologists who successfully detected the lesion before a false positive error was made. The influence of each of the four parameters on lesion detectability was investigated. The results of the study show that the influence of lesion contrast is the most important factor for detectability. Since the dose level had a limited effect on detectability, large dose savings can be made without reducing the detectability of <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> in lumbar spine radiography...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> {{induced by}} multiwalled carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWCNTs) in bronchi and alveoli of mice were studied by intratracheal instillation and inhalation. In instillation groups, the dose was 0. 05 mg MWCNTs/mouse. Similar size clumps of MWCNTs were distributed in bronchi and alveoli. The clumps led to inflammation to the lining wall of bronchi and severe destruction to alveolar netted structure around them. In the inhalation groups, the mice {{were exposed to}} aerosolized MWCNTs with mean concentration of 32. 61 mg/m 3, the intralung deposition dose were roughly 0. 07, 0. 14, and 0. 21 mg in the 8 -day group, 16 -day group, and 24 -day group, respectively. Most of aggregations of MWCNTs in the alveoli were smaller than that in bronchi. The aggregations induced proliferation and thickening of al-veolar walls. With the exception of these moderate <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions,</b> the general alveolar structure was still remained. The preliminary study demonstrated a difference in lung <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> induced by instilled MWCNTs and inhaled ones, which {{may be due to}} the different size and distribution of aggrega...|$|R

40|$|Objective A {{prominent}} stress {{reaction in}} the pelvis of women with endometriosis {{and the role of}} human heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) in inflammation and the growth of endometriosis has been recently demonstrated. We report here expression of HSP 70 in tissues derived from GnRH agonist (GnRHa) -untreated and -treated women with adenomyosis and uterine myoma. Study design This is a case-controlled biological study. Biopsy specimens were collected from <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> and eutopic endometria/autologous myometria of 30 women with adenomyosis, 35 women with uterine myoma and 15 control women during laparoscopy, laparotomy and hysteroscopy. Fourteen women with adenomyosis and 20 women with uterine myoma were treated with GnRHa for a variable period of 3 – 6 months before surgery. The immunoexpressions of HSP 70 and CD 68 -positive Mϕ in endometria, lesions/myometria were examined by immunohistochemistry. The immunoreactivity of HSP 70 in tissues was analyzed by quantitative-histogram (Q-H) scores. Results Comparing to control women, HSP 70 immunoexpression was significantly higher in endometria/myometria and <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> of women with adenomyosis and myoma. A significant positive correlation between Q-H scores of HSP 70 and CD 68 -positive Mϕ numbers was found in the endometria derived from women with adenomyosis (r = 0. 388). Treatment with GnRHa significantly decreased Q-H scores of HSP 70 in <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> and endometria/myometria of women with adenomyosis and uterine myoma comparing to similar tissues derived from GnRHa-untreated women. Conclusion A variable amount of tissue stress reaction occurred in endometria and <b>pathological</b> <b>lesions</b> of women adenomyosis and uterine myoma that can be effectively suppressed after GnRHa treatment...|$|R
