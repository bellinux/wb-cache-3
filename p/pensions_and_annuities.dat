50|$|The smaller houses {{identified}} for suppression were then visited during 1536 by a further set of local commissions, {{one for each}} county, charged with creating an inventory of assets and valuables, and empowered to obtain prompt co-operation from monastic superiors by the allocation to them of pensions and cash gratuities. It was envisaged that some houses might offer immediate surrender, but in practice few did; consequently a two-stage procedure was applied, the commissions reporting back to Cromwell for a {{decision as to whether}} to proceed with dissolution. In a number of instances these commissioners supported the continuation of a house where they found no serious current cause for concern; arguments that Cromwell, as vicegerent, appears often to have accepted. Around 80 houses were exempted, mostly offering a substantial fine. Where dissolution was determined on, a second visit would effect the arrangements for closure of the house, disposal of its assets and endowments and provisions {{for the future of the}} members of the house; otherwise the second visit would collect the agreed fine. In general, the suppression commissioners were less inclined to serious faults in monastic observance within the smaller houses than the visiting commissioners had been, although this may have been coloured by an awareness that monks and nuns with a bad reputation would be more difficult to place elsewhere. The 1536 Act established that, whatever the claims of founders or patrons, the property of the dissolved smaller houses reverted to the Crown; and Cromwell established a new government agency, the Court of Augmentations, to manage it. However, although the property rights of lay founders and patrons were legally extinguished; the incomes of lay holders of monastic offices, <b>pensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>annuities</b> were generally preserved; as were the rights of tenants of monastic lands. Ordinary monks and nuns were given the choice of secularisation (with a cash gratuity but no pension), or of transfer to a continuing larger house of the same order. The majority of those then remaining chose to continue in the religious life; in some areas, the premises of a suppressed religious house was recycled into a new foundation to accommodate them, and in general, rehousing those seeking a transfer proved much more difficult and time-consuming than appears to have been anticipated. Two houses, Norton Priory in Cheshire, and Hexham Abbey in Northumberland, attempted to resist the commissioners by force; actions which Henry interpreted as treason, resulting in his writing personally to demand the summary brutal punishment of those responsible. The prior and canons of Norton were imprisoned for several months, and were fortunate to escape with their lives; the monks of Hexham, who made the further mistake of becoming involved in the Pilgrimage of Grace, were executed.|$|E

Pension incomes will however be taxed at a relatively low rate and, in addition, the delay in tax payment (investment returns of pension funds are exempt from taxation) provides an interest advantage. Our calculations for the year 2000 show that current taxation on a cash-flow basis means on balance a major loss to the Treasury (compared to the benchmark).

40|$|The {{shift in}} age {{structure}} associated with aging populations has {{a profound impact}} on a broad range of economic, political and social conditions (United Nations, 2002). Specifically, increasing longevity can result in growing demands for retirement funds and rising risks for lack of money earmarked for retirement years. Longevity risk, the risk of outliving retirement savings, is a real concern for retirees. In general, social security, employer-provided <b>pensions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>annuities</b> purchased from personal savings are sources of income that can help retirees to manage their longevity risk (Society of Actuaries, 2006) because the benefits extend until death.

Evidence from longitudinal data on <b>pension</b> <b>and</b> <b>annuity</b> incomes of retirees suggests that pension COLAs are less important in the 1980 s than in the 1970 s, but that through 1987 they continued to cover about half of {{cost of living}} increases. Data from a longitudinal sample of <b>pension</b> benefit formulae <b>and</b> COLA provisions collected by the Wyatt Company for the fifty largest industrial companies indicate that if the 1968 - 78 decade persisted, cost of living adjustments would increase basic pension benefits for retirees by a half; while if the inflation experience were that of the 1978 - 88 period, pension COLAs would raise the present value of pensions by only fourteen percent. Simulation analysis allows an examination of the effects of pension COLA provisions on the key incentives emphasized in the pension literature, incentives affecting the retirement, turnover <b>and</b> shirking decisions. <b>Pension</b> COLAs are found to have very small effects on these incentives. Finally a simulation analysis demonstrates that when the contribution side of COLAs is taken into account, pension COLAs do not necessarily dampen the variation among generations in real incomes realized under alternative inflation shocks. ...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty about {{length of}} life, {{longevity}} risk, {{is a growing}} financial problem for <b>pension</b> funds <b>and</b> <b>annuity</b> providers. Unfortunately, {{there is a lack}} of financial instruments to hedge against this longevity risk, thereby complicating risk management by <b>pension</b> funds <b>and</b> hindering the expansion of the annuity market. Consequently, this paper examines the role of government in promoting a private market solution for longevity hedging financial products. Governments could in principle improve the market for annuities by issuing longevity-indexed bonds and by producing a longevity index.

However, governments could take other steps such as producing a reliable longevity index. ...|$|R
40|$|Longevity risk {{transfer}} via the capital markets {{is now a}} reality. <b>Pension</b> plans <b>and</b> <b>annuity</b> providers can hedge longevity risk with capital markets instruments, reflecting {{the emergence of a}} new market that is poised to take off. The key players in this market are hedgers (<b>pension</b> plans <b>and</b> <b>annuity</b> providers), intermediaries (investment banks and broker-dealers) and end investors (ILS funds, hedge funds, endowments, etc.). We argue that the development of liquidity in this market depends on the acceptance of longevity indices and the development of standardized instruments to transfer this risk. Until now, hedgers of longevity risk have almost exclusively approached the subject from the perspective of indemnification (100 percent {{risk transfer}}). We propose an alternative approach based on a risk management paradigm that does not require 100 percent risk transfer and is consistent with the way in which other pension-related risks are managed. To this end we present a framework for longevity hedging cantered on standardized indexbased hedges. This framework uses a building-block approach in which standardized hedge building blocks are combined to provide a longevity hedge tailored to the specific demographics, benefit structure and mortality table of any pension plan. The effectiveness of this hedge is maximized by careful calibration of the mix of building blocks and then verified in hedge effectiveness tests. We also discuss customized longevity hedges that will be preferred by some hedgers, who are unconcerned by the lower liquidity and onerous requirements for data disclosure associated with these hedges, and are prepared to pay the additional premium above the cost of a standardized hedge. ...|$|R
