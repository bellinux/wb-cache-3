40|$|The era {{of media}} {{convergence}} brings new challenges for traditional media. Print magazines don't {{want to lose}} their readers, who are moving towards on-line media. The readership of print media is decreasing. Through internet, people gained access to information and therefore they <b>push</b> <b>media</b> to publish news as soon as possible. The emphasis on speed and effectivity is in conflict with presenting only information that have been doublechecked. This thesis is focused on analysing new Czech magazine Reportér, that was launched in year 2014. The magazine presents slow-journalism trend and offers timeless reading. It's the first magazine with this concept on Czech market. Every month it brings readers reportages from business, culture or society. Reportér magazine has also an on-line version. It includes all issues of the magazine that have ever been published, as well, as special stories that are only on-line. For this thesis, a research have been provided. Its goal was {{to find out whether}} are people interested in subscribing for digital archive of some print media and what is their attitude towards new media.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze {{competition}} between two ideological media outlets that want to influence their viewers so as to boot the number of votes for their preferred political party. We consider two ways of influencing viewers, which correspond to two prominent theories borrowed from the literature on Sociology: the “Reinforcement Approach” and the “Attitudinal Orientations Approach”. Our findings show that the aim of influencing viewers generally <b>pushes</b> <b>media</b> outlets to differentiate their opinions, and that the extend of this differentiation deeply depends on the viewers’ behavior. More precisely, we observe that if the viewers channel hop, media outlets end up differentiating their opinions more than if the viewers receive all their information from just one media.

40|$|Traditionally, a {{large number}} of {{dedicated}} media servers have been deployed to serve a large population of viewers for a single streaming event. However, maintaining media servers is not only costly but also usually requires over-provisioning due to the difficulty of predicting the peak size of an audience. Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) streaming is a new approach to overcome these difficulties inherent in server-based streaming. We have developed the Stanford Peer-to-Peer Multicast (SPPM) protocol for live multicast streaming. SPPM constructs multiple multicast trees to <b>push</b> <b>media</b> streams to the population of peers, thereby achieving low end-to-end transmission delay. The degradation of video quality due to peer churn and packet loss in the network is reduced by video-aware packet scheduling and retransmission. In this paper, we present lessons we acquired from the deployment of a commercial variant of SPPM for a large-scale streaming event which attracted more than 33, 000 viewers. We collected server logs and analyzed user statistics as well as the system performance. The results show that our system can achieve low end-to-end delay of only a few seconds with an average packet loss ratio of around 1 %. We also found that improving peer-to-peer connectivity can substantially enhance the aggregate uplink capacity of P 2 P systems.

Multiple eMBMS service areas allow for {{efficient spectrum utilization}} {{in the context of}} mobile Content-Delivery-Networks (CDNs) as well as for delivering broadcast and <b>push</b> <b>media</b> over modern broadband networks. This paper intends to highlight novel service architectures for efficient content delivery. Content caching is a widely used technique in the networking industry that brings content closer to end-users improving, thus, servive performance and latency. Next generation wireless networks use edge located cache as well as core located cache in order to reduce traffic between the gateway and the internet and make the response of mobile network faster. This is referred to as hierarchical/distributed caching. Dimensioning of individual scenario-based traffic models for health care, museum virtual tours and interactive educational use cases {{in the context of the}} LiveCity European Research Project is attempted in this work. ON/OFF source models featuring state dependent active and inactive periods are used in order to describe multi-threaded resource transmissions. A group of chain ON/OFF models holds the parameters of the basic services and defines cache requirements. An architecture that associates distributed cache deployed at eMBMS Gateways per service area is proposed in order to reduce backhaul traffic. A simple algorithm that determines the optimal cache size in a mixture of chain ON/OFF modeled services is presented...|$|E
40|$|An {{informed}} citizenry {{is essential}} to the effective functioning of democracy. In most modern liberal democracies, citizens have traditionally looked to the media as the primary source of information about socio-political matters. In our increasingly mediated world, it is critical that audiences be able to effectively and accurately use the media to meet their information needs. Media literacy, the ability to access, understand, evaluate and create media content is therefore a vital skill for a healthy democracy. The past three decades have seen the rapid expansion of the information environment, particularly through Internet technologies. It is obvious that media usage patterns have changed dramatically as a result. Blogs and websites are now popular sources of news and information, and are for some sections of the population likely to be the first, and possibly only, information source accessed when information is required. What are the implications for media literacy in such a diverse and changing information environment? The Alexandria Manifesto stresses the link between libraries, a well informed citizenry and effective governance, so how do these changes impact on libraries? This paper considers the role libraries can play in developing media literate communities, and explores the ways in which traditional media literacy training may be expanded to better equip citizens for new media technologies. Drawing on original empirical research, this paper highlights a key shortcoming of existing media literacy approaches: that of overlooking the importance of needs identification as an initial step in media selection. Self-awareness of one’s actual information need is not automatic, as can be witnessed daily at reference desks in libraries the world over. Citizens very often do not know what it is that they need when it comes to information. Without this knowledge, selecting the most appropriate information source from the vast range available becomes an uncertain, possibly even random, enterprise. Incorporating reference interview-type training into media literacy education, whereby the individual will develop the skills to interrogate themselves regarding their underlying information needs, will enhance media literacy approaches. This increased focus on the needs of the individual will also <b>push</b> <b>media</b> literacy education into a more constructivist methodology. The paper also stresses the importance of media literacy training for adults. Media literacy education received in school or even university cannot be expected to retain its relevance over time in our rapidly evolving information environment. Further, constructivist teaching approaches highlight the importance of context to the learning process, thus it may be more effective to offer media literacy education relating to news media use to adults, whilst school-based approaches focus on types of media more relevant to young people, such as entertainment media. Librarians are ideally placed to offer such community-based media literacy education for adults. They already understand, through their training and practice of the reference interview, how to identify underlying information needs. Further, libraries are placed within community contexts, where the everyday practice of media literacy occurs. The Alexandria Manifesto stresses the link between libraries, a well informed citizenry and effective governance. It is clear that libraries {{have a role to play}} in fostering media literacy within their communities...|$|E
