5|$|Human {{rights in}} Madagascar are {{protected}} {{under the constitution}} and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for <b>public</b> <b>assembly</b> has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations. Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.|$|E
5|$|The Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules {{made under}} the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act require a permit for any <b>public</b> <b>assembly</b> or {{procession}} {{of five or}} more persons in any public place. The rationale given for this law is that {{a large group of}} people who gather for a peaceful purpose can turn violent. In the 1950s and 1960s there were several violent riots in Singapore, the last incident being the 1964 race riots in which 36 people were killed. Although there have only been a few minor protests since then, the authorities continue to take a tough stance against unlicensed outdoor protests. On 31 December 2000, 15 members of Falun Gong consisting of 13 foreigners and two Singaporeans were arrested at MacRitchie Park for holding an illegal assembly.|$|E

25|$|Execution {{seems to}} have been rare and carried out only as a last resort. If a murderer was unable/unwilling to pay éraic and was handed to his victim's family, they might kill him if they wished should nobody {{intervene}} by paying the éraic. Habitual or particularly serious offenders might be expelled from the kin-group and its territory. Such people became outlaws (with no protection from the law) and anyone who sheltered him became liable for his crimes. If he still haunted the territory and continued his crimes there, he was proclaimed in a <b>public</b> <b>assembly</b> and after this anyone might lawfully kill him.|$|E

The Buddhists had evaded a ban on <b>public</b> <b>assembly</b> by hiring four buses and filling up and pulling the blinds down. They drove around the city before the convoy stopped at the designated time and the monks disembarked. This {{was the first time that}} an open protest had been held in Saigon against Diệm in his eight years of rule. They unfurled banners and sat down for four hours before disbanding and returning to the pagodas to begin a nationwide 48-hour hunger strike organised by the Buddhist patriarch Thich Tinh Khiet.|$|E
25|$|Louis I (1249/50 – 1302) was the Baron of Vaud. At {{the time}} of his birth he was a younger son of a younger son of the House of Savoy, but through a series of deaths and his own {{effective}} military service, he succeeded in creating a semi-independent principality in the pays de Vaud by 1286. He travelled widely in the highest circles of European nobility (the royal courts of London, Paris and Naples), obtained the right to mint coins from the Holy Roman Emperor, and convoked the first <b>public</b> <b>assembly</b> in the Piedmont to include members of the non-noble classes. When he died, his barony was inherited by his son.|$|E

The Žiadosti slovenského národa were publicly declared in Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš, with Ján Francisci-Rimavský as the reader. In it, the Slovaks demanded autonomy within Hungary, proportional representation in the Hungarian Assembly, {{the creation of a}} Slovak Diet to administer their own region, for Slovak to become the official language, and for educational institutions at all levels to use Slovak. They also called for universal suffrage and democratic rights – e.g., freedom of the press and <b>public</b> <b>assembly.</b> They requested that peasants be released from serfdom, and that their lands be returned to them. But on 12 May 1848, the Hungarian government issued a warrant for the leaders of the Slovak movement: Štúr, Hurban, and Hodža. The persecuted Štúr arrived in Prague on 31 May 1848. On 2 June 1848, he participated in the Slavic Congress there.|$|E
25|$|The English {{saw that}} if the revolt prospered it would inevitably attract disaffected {{supporters}} of the deposed King Richard, rumours of whose survival were widely circulating. They {{were concerned about the}} potential for disaffection in Cheshire and were increasingly worried about the news from North Wales. Hotspur complained that he was not receiving sufficient support from the King and that the repressive policy of Henry was only encouraging revolt. He argued that negotiation and compromise could persuade Owain to end his revolt. In fact, as early as 1401, Hotspur may have been in secret negotiations with Owain and other leaders of the revolt to attempt to negotiate a settlement. The core Lancastrian supporters would have none of this. They struck back with anti-Welsh legislation designed to establish English dominance in Wales. The laws included prohibiting any Welshman from buying land in England, from holding any senior public office in Wales, from bearing arms, from holding any castle or defending any house, no Welsh child was to be educated or apprenticed to any trade, no Englishman could be convicted in any suit brought by a Welshman, Welshmen were to be severely penalised when marrying an Englishwoman, any Englishman marrying a Welshwoman was disenfranchised and all <b>public</b> <b>assembly</b> was forbidden. These laws sent a message to any of those who were wavering that the English viewed all the Welsh with equal suspicion. Many Welshmen who had tried to further their careers in English service now felt pushed into the rebellion as the middle ground between Owain and Henry disappeared.|$|E
500|$|The theatre is {{situated}} on King Street, {{a few yards}} from the Floating Harbour. Since 1972, the public entrance has been through the Coopers' Hall, the earliest surviving building on the site. The Coopers' Hall was built in 1744 for the Coopers' Company, the guild of coopers in Bristol, by architect William Halfpenny. It has a [...] "debased Palladian" [...] façade with four Corinthian columns. It only remained {{in the hands of the}} Coopers until 1785, subsequently becoming a <b>public</b> <b>assembly</b> room, a wine warehouse, a Baptist chapel and eventually a fruit and vegetable warehouse.|$|E

500|$|The defence {{produced}} {{a witness who}} claimed to have seen McKay fall and strike his head on some stones several hours before the fight, and the Glasgow Free Press began a rumour that McKay had been drugged by [...] "a sleeping draught" [...] introduced into his water bottle. That the fight was illegal, as was the <b>public</b> <b>assembly</b> of spectators {{does not seem to have}} been considered in court. This benign neglect is surprising because as recently as 1825, in the case of Rex v. Billingham, Savage and Skinner, it had been deemed that anyone even attending a fight was guilty of an offence.|$|E
500|$|In 1883, a {{group of}} about 500 Chicagoans, led by General Philip Sheridan, banded {{together}} to create the Washington Park Jockey Club. [...] Selecting a location at 61st and Cottage Grove, the Club opened and operated the Washington Park Race Track, valued at $150,000, the following year, claiming it to be [...] "the Midwest's preeminent track." [...] The track was part of the long tradition of constructing special facilities for sporting events and <b>public</b> <b>assembly</b> in the Chicago parks. At that time it was fashionable for the social elite to maintain close ties to equestrian sports. [...] Some owned Thoroughbreds and thus were members of the Washington Park Jockey Club. The track's clubhouse, which was completed in 1896, was designed by Solon Spencer Beman, and C. B. McDonald built a short nine-hole club members' golf course in the infield of the track.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} has [...] of floor space, rises to 98stories, and houses 486luxury residential condominiums.

The building includes, from the ground up, retail space, a parking garage, a hotel, and condominiums. The 3rd through 12th floors house lobbies, retail space, and the parking garage; the 14th floor and its mezzanine hosts a health club and spa. The 17th floor through the 27th-floor mezzanine contain hotel condominiums and executive lounges. The 28th through 85th floors have residential condominiums, and the 86th through 89th floors have penthouses. A [...] riverfront park and riverwalk, along a [...] space in the area adjacent to the building to the east, was opened {{in the first half}} of 2010.

500|$|Upon {{being elected}} mayor, Ravalomanana {{prioritized}} sanitation, security and public {{administration in the}} capital city. Provided a budget of approximately 11 million US dollars to manage Antananarivo, Ravalomanana took initiative to secure additional funds. He established a bank account for public and business contributions to city improvement projects, raising over $700,000 in six months. He obtained funds from international donors to establish garbage collection and disposal systems, restore dilapidated infrastructure such as roads and marketplaces and replant public gardens. He received regular guidance and council from Kurt Schmoke, recently Mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, {{with whom he had}} developed a friendship through his biannual business trips to the United States as CEO of Tiko. To improve sanitation conditions in the city, he constructed public latrines in densely populated or highly frequented areas. During his tenure, construction in the capital increased sharply, with twelve new supermarkets constructed in two years. Ravalomanana launched an initiative to install or repair street lights throughout the city to improve nighttime safety. He increased the number of police officers on the streets, leading to a drop in crime. His relationship with President Ratsiraka remained good through his early tenure as mayor, although his decision on 28 June 2001 to eliminate [...] "red zones" [...] – areas of the city where <b>public</b> <b>assembly</b> and protests were prohibited – provoked Ratsiraka's strong disapproval.|$|E
500|$|In 1888 Lansbury {{agreed to}} act as {{election}} agent for Jane Cobden, who was contesting the first elections for the newly formed London County Council [...] (LCC) as Liberal candidate for the Bow and Bromley division. [...] Cobden, an early supporter of women's suffrage, was the fourth child of the Victorian radical statesman Richard Cobden. [...] The Society for Promoting Women as County Councillors (SPWCC), a new women's rights group, had proposed Cobden as the [...] candidate for Bow and Bromley and Margaret Sandhurst [...] for Brixton. [...] Lansbury counselled Cobden in the issues of greatest concern to the East End electorate: housing for the poor, ending of sweated labour, rights of <b>public</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{and control of the}} police. Specific questions of women's rights were largely avoided during the campaign. [...] On 19 January 1889 both women were elected; these triumphs were, however, short-lived. Sandhurst's [...] qualification to serve as a county councillor was successfully challenged in the courts by her Conservative Party opponents on the grounds of her sex, and her subsequent appeal was dismissed. Cobden was not immediately challenged, but in April 1891, after a [...] series of legal actions, [...] she was effectively neutered as a councillor by being prevented from voting on pain of severe financial penalties. [...] Lansbury urged her, during the hearings, [...] to [...] "go to prison and let the Council back you up by refusing to declare your seat vacant". Cobden did not follow this path. A Bill introduced in the House of Commons in May 1891 permitting women to serve as county councillors found little support among [...] MPs of any party; women were not granted this right until 1907.|$|E
