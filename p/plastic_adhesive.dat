The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the effect of different preoperative skin preparation before cardiac surgery. In study I, 10 healthy volunteers were compared in time to recolonization of the skin and bacterial growth with or without <b>plastic</b> <b>adhesive</b> drape. Bacterial samples were taken as paired samples on both side of the sternum. Plastic drape on disinfected skin seems to hasten recolonization compared with bare skin. In study II, 135 cardiac surgery patients were comparing <b>plastic</b> <b>adhesive</b> drape versus bare skin on the chest regarding intra-operative bacterial growth. <b>Plastic</b> <b>adhesive</b> drape did not reduce the bacterial recolonization or wound contamination, P. acnes colonizes males more often than females and P. acnes is not affected by disinfection with 0. 5 % chlorhexidine in ethanol. Study III, compared the leg harvesting site with or without microbal skin sealant in 135 CABG patients regarding intraoperative bacterial growth and postoperative wound infection. Almost no bacterial growth was found during surgery regardless of the use of microbial skin sealant and bare skin. A high incidence of postoperative wound infections (16. 8 %) in 2 month follow up was present and SSI was largely caused by S. aureus, i. e. other bacterial species than observed intraoperative. Study IV, a descriptive study using phenotypic and genotypic methods investigate susceptibility to chlorhexidine among S. epidermidis indicating that S. epidermidis isolates following preoperative skin disinfection are sensitive tochlorhexidine...|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} a prospective randomized controlled double-blind trial at a regional referral centre for the Eastern Cape area, (Livingstone Hospital) {{to determine whether}} the use of <b>plastic</b> <b>adhesive</b> drapes intraoperatively would prevent Post Caesarean Section Wound Infection. A total of 620 patients undergoing Caesarean section (CS) were enrolled for randomization in the trial. Fifteen patients were excluded, while 305 received drapes (test group) and 300 did not (control group). Two patients in the control group were subsequently excluded. The primary outcome measure was the presence of Post Caesarean Wound Infection. A secondary outcome measure was the number of days in hospital post operation. The study and control groups were comparable at entry. Results show that 34 patients in the test group (N= 305) developed wound sepsis (11. 1 %) compared with 30 in the control group (N= 298) (10. 1 %) (difference not significant; Fisher's exact test 0. 6933). Average days spent in hospital postoperatively were similar for both test (infected cases: mean 10. 56 SD 3. 84; non-infected cases: mean 5. 21 SD 1. 3) and control groups (infected cases: mean 10. 18 SD 3. 81; non-infected cases: mean 5. 2 SD 0. 93) (NS).

40|$|The {{confinement}} {{of concrete}} columns using fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) jackets or wraps {{is a popular}} structural retrofitting technique. More recently, the benefits of FRP confinement of concrete-filled steel tubes have also been explored by researchers. Failure of such FRP-confined concrete-filled steel tubes is usually governed by the rupture of the FRP jacket in the hoop direction. However, the observed FRP hoop strain at failure (i. e. the hoop rupture strain) is typically lower than the ultimate tensile strain from a flat coupon test. Many factors may contribute to this phenomenon, {{one of which is}} the geometrical discontinuities at both the starting and finishing ends of the wrapping process commonly used to form an FRP jacket. This paper examines the effect of these geometrical discontinuities on the hoop rupture strain of FRP jackets in FRP-confined concrete-filled circular steel tubes. Detailed finite element (FE) analyses conducted using both linear elastic and elastic-perfectly <b>plastic</b> <b>adhesive</b> constitutive models are presented. Comparison between the FE predictions and available test results shows that the hoop rupture strains of FRP jackets predicted by FE analysis using an elastic-perfectly <b>plastic</b> <b>adhesive</b> model are in reasonable agreement with the test results. The influence of parameters such as the FRP thickness, FRP orthotropy, FRP elastic modulus, adhesive yield strength, adhesive thickness, and column size are examined.

Moreover, a linear shear stress variation in the adherend thickness is included in the formulation. Secondly, a numerical procedure is then presented to introduce into both models an elasto-plastic adhesive material behavior, while keeping the previous linear elastic formulation. Finally, assuming an elastic perfectly <b>plastic</b> <b>adhesive</b> material behavior, the results produced by simplified models are compared with the results predicted by FE using 1 Dbar, plane stress, and three-dimensional (3 D) models.

When wet, cloth drapes showed profuse bacterial penetration. Dry cloth showed less bacterial penetration as compared to wet cloth.

40|$|The {{umbilical}} cord (UC) represents {{an important source}} of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). These human UC-derived MSC (UC-MSC) have already been isolated using a protocol based on the migratory and <b>plastic</b> <b>adhesive</b> properties of MSC (UC-MSC-Mig). The UC-MSC-Mig isolation method, however, is difficult to standardize. Therefore, we developed an enzymatic isolation protocol (UC-MSC-Enz) to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages. First, we investigated the UC-MSC-Enz for their MSC properties. We found that UC-MSC-Enz express the MSC markers CD 73, CD 90 and CD 105 and are able to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondroblasts fulfilling the MSC criteria of the International Society for Cellular Therapy. Previously we found that UC-MSC-Mig are unique among MSCs due to their significant expression of several hepatic (progenitor) markers. Therefore, we also investigated the expression of hepatic transcription factors and other hepatic markers in UC-MSC-Enz at both the mRNA and protein level. We found that the expression of hepatic transcription factors (GATA 4, GATA 6, SOX 9 and SOX 17) and hepatic markers (AFP, DPP 4, CX 43, DKK 1, DSG 2, KRT 18 and KRT 19) in UC-MSC-Enz was not significantly different from those of UC-MSC-Mig. Consequently, this optimized enzyme-based method represents a fast, robust and standardized way to isolate UC-MSC for a broad range of applications.
