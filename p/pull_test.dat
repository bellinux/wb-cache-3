The number of extracted hairs is counted and examined under a microscope. Normally, fewer than three hairs per area should come out with each pull. If more than ten hairs are obtained, the <b>pull</b> <b>test</b> is considered positive.|$|E

50|$|The {{pull-off}} test, {{also called}} stud <b>pull</b> <b>test</b> is a near-to-surface method {{in which an}} adhesive connection is made between a stud and the carrier (or object to be tested) by using a glue, possibly an epoxy or polyester resin, that is stronger than the bond {{that needs to be}} tested. The force required to pull the stud from the surface, together with the carrier, is measured. Simple mechanical hand-operated loading equipment has been developed for this purpose. When higher accuracy is required, tests can be performed with more advanced equipment called a bond tester. A bond tester provides more control and possibly automation. Applying the glue automatically and curing with UV light is the next step in automation.|$|E
50|$|The Bindomatic {{technology}} {{is based upon}} several patents. These patents relate both {{to the production of}} supplies and innovations used in the machines to secure a perfect end result. The {{technology is}} based upon a hot melt book binding adhesive designed to have characteristics that optimizes each part of the process from production of the supplies and finally binding the document. The adhesive also allows for re-heating so that the document can be edited by adding or removing pages. The strength of the binding is secured by the process parameters like time and temperature and is during development of these parameters tested through pull and flex testing, see pictures! The <b>pull</b> <b>test</b> has limits set up by various organizations but normally 7.2N/cm is a value regarded as giving very good binding strength. For the Bindomatic system using regular copy paper the strength is 11N/cm and for non-coated color copy paper the strength is around 9N/cm. In general the hot melt binding is not recommended for coated, heavy-weight paper and the Bindomatic system is in that respect not different from other hot melt systems.|$|E

5000|$|Control-line flying is {{generally}} quite safe when all prescribed safety measures are followed. The airplane is constrained {{to fly in}} a circle, which {{is generally}} marked. A pilots' circle is also provided, {{so as long as}} the pilot stays in the pilot's circle and everyone else is outside the outer circle, the flying model can hit no one. In most competition categories, a [...] "safety thong" [...] connecting the control handle to the pilot's wrist is also required, so if the pilot inadvertently releases the handle, the airplane cannot fly outside the circle (and, frequently crashes, safely for others if not the airplane, when control is lost). The lines, handle, and control system are subjected to a [...] "pull test" [...] before flight to ensure that they are in good shape with some significant margin. For example, the <b>pull</b> <b>test</b> is around 40 lb for a 4 lb Stunt model (a 10G load), and the in-flight pull is around 10 lb. This provides a 2x margin of safety even if one line should fail. One failed line immediately moves the elevator to the extreme of its movement, which almost always results in a crash, safely in the circle. Other categories of model are tested in a similar way, with the loads set to correspond to the expected speeds with a safety margin around a factor of 4.|$|E
