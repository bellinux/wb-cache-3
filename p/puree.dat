It may be served hot or cold, and several recipes exist.|$|E
5|$|Substitutes, {{such as the}} wheat-based rice substitute, ptitim, were introduced, and {{versatile}} vegetables such as eggplant were used as alternatives to meat. Additional flavor and nutrition was provided from inexpensive canned tomato paste and <b>puree,</b> hummus, tahina, and mayonnaise in tubes. Meat was scarce, {{and it was not}} until the late 1950s that herds of beef cattle were introduced into the agricultural economy.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the possibility for development of vegetable <b>purees</b> and drinks by lactic acid fermentation. It was found that by the direct lactic acid fermentation of Lb. plantarum strain 226 / 1 the vitamin composition of vegetable <b>purees</b> is preserved and the biological value is increased. Drinks, prepared from fermented vegetable <b>purees</b> were remarkable with the pleasant lactic acid taste, the sucrose-acid composition was stable and balanced and they can be used both in the rational and in the dietary nutrition...|$|R

5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a <b>purée,</b> which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The <b>purée</b> {{can be used to make}} blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of Rødgrød, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E
5|$|Apples are an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and {{they can also be}} dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a <b>puree</b> known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|E

40|$|Tomato pomade, {{consisting}} of peels and seeds, represents 3 - 4 % of fresh fruit weight. If {{it remains a}} waste, it gives rise to disposal problems and aggravate environmental pollution. Our aim was to evaluate the potential of dried peels powder as thickening ingredient in commercial tomato <b>purées.</b> Dried peels were ground in fine and rough sizes and physic-chemically characterized. Samples of creamy and rustic <b>purées</b> with tomato fine and rough dried peels powders at different percentages (0. 5 - 5. 0 %) were prepared and tested for rheological properties and organoleptic characteristics (colour and flavour). The addiction of 3. 0 % of fine and 1. 0 % of rough dried peels powder to rustic <b>purees,</b> and 2. 0 % of fine dried peels powder to creamy <b>purees</b> resulted as the best combination to reduce the impact of industrial evaporation. The proposed approach could transform a waste in a value-added product to be reused, even in the producer’s supply chain itself...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{conventional}} industrial processing steps on global phytochemical composition of broccoli, tomato and carrot <b>purees</b> were investigated {{by using a}} range of complementary targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches including LC–PDA for vitamins, 1 H NMR for polar metabolites, accurate mass LC–QTOF MS for semi-polar metabolites, LC–MRM for oxylipins, and headspace GC–MS for volatile compounds. An initial exploratory experiment indicated that the order of blending and thermal treatments had the highest impact on the phytochemicals in the <b>purees.</b> This blending-heating order effect was investigated in more depth by performing alternate blending-heating sequences in triplicate on the same batches of broccoli, tomato and carrot. For each vegetable and particularly in broccoli, {{a large proportion of}} the metabolites detected in the <b>purees</b> was significantly influenced by the blending-heating order, amongst which were potential health-related phytochemicals and flavour compounds like vitamins C and E, carotenoids, flavonoids, glucosinolates and oxylipins. Our metabolomics data indicates that during processing the activity of a series of endogenous plant enzymes, such as lipoxygenases, peroxidases and glycosidases, including myrosinase in broccoli, is key to the final metabolite composition and related quality of the <b>purees...</b>|$|R

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this work}} are {{to better understand the}} effect of the structural parameters on the sensory perception of apple <b>puree's</b> texture. For this reason, a grinding-separation procedure was established in order to vary pulp content and particle size. The validation of the procedure was made by comparing laboratory samples and commercial products. It was observed that a third parameter, serum viscosity, should be included to complete the strategy; it was therefore modified by the addition of pectin. Thus two experimental designs were constructed, the first one for the effect of the pulp content and the particle size on the sensory properties, and the second one for the effect of thickening of the continuous phase and the admixing of <b>purees</b> with different particle sizes. A sensory descriptive profile was conducted: the most important attributes to describe the texture of apple <b>purees</b> were consistency and graininess. The thickening of the continuous phase led to an increase of the consistency perception and to a decrease of the graininess perception. Pulp content, particle size and serum viscosity are key structural parameters to master the texture of apple <b>purees...</b>|$|R
50|$|The boiled root {{has about}} the same uses as boiled potatoes, {{including}} side dishes, <b>purées,</b> dumplings and gnocchi, pastries, creamy soup garnished with chopped cilantro and croutons, etc., with the advantage of its flavor and (depending on the variety) its intense color. In the Andes region, it is made into fried chips, biscuits, and coarse flour. Because it is highly digestible (due to {{the small size of}} its starch grains), <b>purées</b> and soups made from it are considered excellent for babies and children.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{large number}} of <b>purees</b> of fruits and {{vegetables}} are produced commercially; some are usually consumed directly, while others are used as intermediate products and ingredients. The fruit <b>purees</b> studied were realized with peach, apple and pear. Immediately after the production (t 0) and after the storage period (tn) the pH, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid content and Bostwick consistency of samples were evaluated. Furthermore after the storage period (tn) the moisture content, the water activity and the colour parameters were also determined. Rheological properties were evaluated by using a controlled stress–strain rheometer and a cone and plate geometry sensor. The viscosity (η) against shear rate were evaluated to study the rheological behaviour of all fruit <b>purees.</b> In this study the flow curves were also evaluated and fitted according to the rheological model of Casson. The experimental measurements showed that the viscosity variation against the shear rate of fruit <b>purees</b> is exponential and therefore they are non-Newtonian fluids. The Casson model was found to fit adequately (R 2 ≥ 0. 84) over the entire shear-rate range. Moreover significant and interesting correlations between Bostwick consistency and some rheological parameters were found. Unfortunately a scanty production's standardization over the years was observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} compares {{the impact of}} thermal and high {{pressure}} high temperature(HPHT) processing on volatile profile (via a non-targeted headspace fingerprinting) and structural and nutritional quality parameter (via targeted approaches) of orange and yellow carrot <b>purees.</b> The effect of oil enrichment was also considered. Since oil enrichment affects compounds volatility, the effect of oil was not studied when comparing the volatile fraction. For the targeted part, as yellow carrot <b>purees</b> were shown to contain a very low amount of carotenoids, focus was given to orange carrot <b>purees.</b> The results of the non-targeted approach demonstrated HPHT processing exerts a distinct effect on the volatile fractions compared to thermal processing. In addition, different colored carrot varieties are characterized by distinct headspace fingerprints. From a structural point of view, limited or no difference could be observed between orange carrot <b>purees</b> treated with HPHT or HT processes, both for samples without and with oil. From nutritional point of view, only in samples with oil, significant isomerisation of all-trans-β-carotene occurred due to both processing. Overall, {{for this type of}} product and for the selected conditions, HPHT processing seems to have a different impact on the volatile profile but rather similar impact on the structural and nutritional attributes compared to thermal processing...|$|R
