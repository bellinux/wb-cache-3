40|$|Starting in December 2009, small {{companies}} classified as non-accelerated filers must obtain an internal <b>control</b> <b>audit</b> {{to comply with}} Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This study estimates {{the cost of the}} internal <b>control</b> <b>audit</b> for new accelerated filers in 2006 and 2007 and assesses whether the new internal <b>control</b> <b>auditing</b> standard, Auditing Standard No. 5, has reduced Section 404 -related audit costs. The study finds that the median cost of the internal <b>control</b> <b>audit</b> as a percentage of total audit fees is 42 % for new accelerated filers in 2006 and 37 % in 2007. This suggests that Section 404 -related audit costs have fallen modestly since Auditing Standard No. 5 was adopted, although the change is not statistically significant. The 2007 results provide a reasonable estimate of what non-accelerated filers will have to pay when they comply in 2009...|$|R

The FISCAM, which is consistent with NIST and other criteria, is organized to facilitate effective and efficient IS <b>control</b> <b>audits.</b> Specifically, the methodology in the FISCAM incorporates the following: (1) A top-down, risk-based approach that considers materiality and significance in determining effective and efficient audit procedures; (2) Evaluation of entitywide controls and their effect on audit risk; (3) Evaluation of general controls and their pervasive impact on business process application controls; (4) Evaluation of security management at all levels (entitywide, system, and business process application levels); (5) A control hierarchy (control categories, critical elements, and control activities) to assist in evaluating the significance of identified IS control weaknesses; (6) Groupings of control categories consistent with the nature of the risk; and (7) Experience gained in GAO's performance and review of IS <b>control</b> <b>audits,</b> including field testing the concepts in this revised FISCAM. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{investigate}} the stock market's reaction to events {{related to the}} Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's (PCAOB) development and enactment of Auditing Standard No. 5 (AS 5). The change from Auditing Standard No. 2 (AS 2) to AS 5 was debated in the business press at length. The PCAOB stated {{that the goal of}} AS 5 was to reduce the prohibitive costs of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 - Section 404 and AS 2 (Krishnan et al. 2008) while maintaining the effectiveness of the internal <b>control</b> <b>audits</b> required by those policies. However, there was concern that internal <b>control</b> <b>audit</b> quality would decrease under AS 5. My study examines how investors perceived this change by considering stock market reaction around 10 event dates related to PCAOB and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) actions with regard to the development and enactment of AS 5. I find evidence that the market's reaction to key AS 5 events was significantly negative, which is consistent with investors perceiving AS 5 as a significant decrease in internal <b>control</b> <b>audit</b> quality. I also study these investor reactions cross-sectionally to further examine the two potential effects of AS 5 (decrease in compliance costs and decrease in internal <b>control</b> <b>audit</b> quality) and how they relate to firm characteristics (size, complexity, litigation risk, and fraud risk). I find evidence consistent with my main finding: investors' perceived increase in information risk under AS 5 is apparent when considering firm characteristics. Finally, I consider ex-post financial reporting quality under AS 5 and find no significant change in financial reporting quality compared to under AS 2. This study contributes to accounting research by being the first to study the stock market's perception of this significant policy change archivally and the first to consider the effectiveness of AS 5 with regard to financial reporting quality...|$|R

Only when faced with a good internal information environment can such directors acquire enough information to provide advice and monitor managers, and only under these conditions can increasing their proportion on the board effectively reduce agency problems, such as driving managers to disclose information to investors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Challenges exist {{regarding}} TB {{infection control}} and TB in hospital-based healthcare workers in South Africa. However, few studies report on TB in non-hospital based healthcare workers such as primary or community healthcare workers. Our objectives were {{to investigate the}} implementation of TB infection control measures at primary healthcare facilities, the smear positive TB incidence rate amongst primary healthcare workers and the association between TB infection control measures and all types of TB in healthcare workers. METHODS: One hundred and thirty three primary healthcare facilities were visited in five provinces of South Africa in 2009. At each facility, a TB infection <b>control</b> <b>audit</b> and facility questionnaire were completed. The number of healthcare workers who had had TB {{during the past three}} years was obtained. RESULTS: The standardised incidence ratio of smear positive TB in primary healthcare workers indicated an incidence rate of more than double that of the general population. In a univariable logistic regression, the infection <b>control</b> <b>audit</b> score was significantly associated with reported cases of TB in healthcare workers (OR= 1. 04, 95 %CI 1. 01 - 1. 08, p= 0. 02) as was the number of staff (OR= 3. 78, 95 %CI 1. 77 - 8. 08). In the multivariable analysis, the number of staff remained significantly associated with TB in healthcare workers (OR= 3. 33, 95 %CI 1. 37 - 8. 08). CONCLUSION: The high rate of TB in healthcare workers suggests a substantial nosocomial transmission risk, but the infection <b>control</b> <b>audit</b> tool which was used did not perform adequately as a measure of this risk. Infection control measures should be monitored by validated tools developed and tested locally. Different strategies, such as routine surveillance systems, could be used to evaluate the burden of TB in healthcare workers in order to calculate TB incidence, monitor trends and implement interventions to decrease occupational TB...|$|R
