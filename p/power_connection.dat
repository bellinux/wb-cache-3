5|$|In {{addition}} to the features in common with HDMI (such as HDCP encrypted uncompressed high-definition video and eight-channel surround sound), MHL also adds the provision of power charging for the mobile device while in use, and also enables the TV remote to control it. Although support for these additional features requires connection to an MHL-enabled HDMI port, power charging can also be provided when using active MHL to HDMI adapters (connected to standard HDMI ports), provided there is a separate <b>power</b> <b>connection</b> to the adapter.|$|E

However, carrying the charger along with the vehicle ensures that power will be available anywhere a <b>power</b> <b>connection</b> can be found.|$|E

25|$|In late October 1967, Scorpion started {{refresher}} training and weapons system acceptance tests, {{and was given}} a new commanding officer, Francis Slattery. Following type training out of Norfolk, Virginia, she got underway on 15 February 1968 for a Mediterranean Sea deployment. She operated with the 6th Fleet into May and then headed west for home. Scorpion suffered several mechanical malfunctions, including a chronic problem with Freon leakage from refrigeration systems. An electrical fire occurred in an escape trunk when a water leak shorted out a shore <b>power</b> <b>connection.</b> (However, major steam and leakage problems are not uncommon on U.S. Navy or Royal Navy submarine deployments, even in the 21st Century.) There {{is no evidence that}} the Scorpions speed was restricted in May 1968, although it was conservatively observing a depth limitation of 500 feet, due to the incomplete implementation of planned post-Thresher safety checks and modifications.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors are {{constructed}} with two metal foils (current collectors), each coated with an electrode material such as activated carbon, which {{serve as the}} <b>power</b> <b>connection</b> between the electrode material and the external terminals of the capacitor. Specifically to the electrode material {{is a very large}} surface area. In this example the activated carbon is electrochemically etched, so that the surface of the material is about a factor 100,000 larger than the smooth surface. The electrodes are kept apart by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) used as an insulator to protect the electrodes against short circuits. This construction is subsequently rolled or folded into a cylindrical or rectangular shape and can be stacked in an aluminum can or an adaptable rectangular housing. Then the cell is impregnated with a liquid or viscous electrolyte of organic or aqueous type. The electrolyte, an ionic conductor, enters the pores of the electrodes and serves as the conductive connection between the electrodes across the separator. Finally the housing is hermetically sealed to ensure stable behavior over the specified lifetime.|$|E

The Mac can instantaneously wake from sleep mode if power to the RAM has not been lost.

2500|$|On 18 October 1961, Thresher, {{in company}} with the {{diesel-electric}} submarine , headed south on a 3-week test and training cruise to San Juan, Puerto Rico, arriving 2 November. Following customary procedure while in port, her reactor was shut down. Since no shore <b>power</b> <b>connection</b> was available in San Juan, the ship's backup diesel generator was used to carry the [...] "hotel" [...] electrical loads. Several hours later, the backup generator broke down and the electrical load {{was transferred to the}} ship's battery; however, most of the battery power was needed to keep vital systems operating and to restart the reactor, so lighting and air-conditioning were shut down. Without air-conditioning, temperature and humidity in the submarine rose, reaching [...] after about ten hours. (Four men received Navy Commendation Medals for their work that night, attempting to repair the diesel generator under the extreme conditions of heat and humidity.) Eventually, it became apparent that repair of the generator would not be complete before the battery was depleted, so restart of the reactor was attempted, but by that time, there was not enough charge remaining in the battery, and it ran down before restart of the reactor could be accomplished. The captain, returning to the ship from a shore function, arrived just after the battery ran down. Since Cavalla was moored alongside, cables, borrowed from another ship in the harbor, were connected between Thresher and Cavalla, which started her diesels, providing power that enabled Thresher to restart her reactor.|$|E
