5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with <b>permits</b> <b>surrendered</b> including any <b>permits</b> traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of cap-and-trade programs regulating carbon emissions assumed that …rms must <b>surrender</b> <b>permits</b> as they pollute. If so, then {{the price of}} permits may remain constant over measurable intervals if the government injects additional permits at a ceiling price or may even collapse if more permits are injected through an auction. However, no cap-and-trade program actually requires continual compliance. The three federal bills and California’s AB- 32, for example, instead require that …rms <b>surrender</b> <b>permits</b> only periodically to cover their cumulative emissions since the last compliance period. Anticipated injections of additional permits during the compliance period should have di¤erent e¤ects than under continual compliance. We develop a methodology for analyzing the e¤ects of such permit injections. Using it, we explain why sales provisions of one federal bill might generate a speculative attack in the permit market and while provisions of AB- 32 may undermine {{the very existence of}} an equilibrium...|$|R

50|$|Numerius Fabius Ambustus was {{an ancient}} Roman {{commander}} {{who was the}} son of Marcus Fabius Ambustus, and brother to Caeso and Quintus. In 406 BC, he and his forces captured the Volscian city of Anxur (modern Terracina) by securing the high ground above the town, from which they were able to launch attacks against its walls. When the town's defenders attempted to respond to these harassing attacks, the remainder of Numerius' forces used escalade to scale the walls and enter the town. After the victory, his forces began to torture the inhabitants of the city in retaliation for the Volscian massacre of the Roman garrison at Verruga in which the Roman prisoners had been horribly tortured. Numerius eventually showed mercy, and around 2500 Volscians were <b>permitted</b> to <b>surrender</b> with their lives.|$|R

30|$|The general {{principle}} of emission trading is giving a limit, also called ‘cap’ {{on the overall}} amount of GHG emissions [5]. Initial permits under this cap are allocated to firms. One permit gives a right to emit one unit of GHG emissions. At {{the end of a}} certain period, emission producers have to <b>surrender</b> <b>permits</b> in equivalent to their accurate emissions. Entities subject to emission trading are allowed to exchange permits via carbon markets with a certain price as needed. The price of permits is theoretically decided by the demand and supply in the market but also aligned to government regulation.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, the {{application}} {{was made to}} the Chancery Division in Ireland. In 1920, two proclamations were announced, one by Viscount French, the Lord Lieutenant, putting certain areas including County Cork under martial law and the second by the British Commander-in-Chief in Ireland Sir Nevil Macready requiring all civilians who did not hold a <b>permit</b> to <b>surrender</b> all arms, ammunition and explosives by 27 December of that year. Failure to comply meant that any unauthorised person found in possession of arms, ammunition or explosives, would become liable to trial by Military Court and on conviction the sentence was death. General Sir E.P. Strickland was appointed by the Commander-in-Chief Macready to be military governor of the martial law area. It was his duty to establish and organise the Military Courts. In April 1921, 42 individuals, including Clifford and OSullivan, were arrested near Mitchelstown. On 3 May 1921, 42 civilians were tried by a military court {{on a charge of}} being in possession of arms and ammunition. They were sentenced to death [...] "subject to confirmation".|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} concerns tax {{and environmental}} policy issues central to recent policy-making debates. Chapter I is written with Kozo Kiyota and concerns {{the design of}} international tax systems. In 2009, Japan introduced a foreign dividend exemption that exempts from home taxation dividends remitted by Japanese-owned foreign affiliates to their parent firms. This paper examines the effect of dividend exemption on profit repatriations by Japanese multinationals. We find the heterogeneous responses of Japanese multinationals to dividend exemption. Foreign affiliates with a large stock of retained earnings increased dividend payments more than other affiliates with the enactment of dividend exemption in 2009. However, the increase in dividend payments {{was not associated with}} foreign corporate tax rates. Chapter II is motivated by corporate tax reforms of OECD countries that tend to include both statutory tax rate reductions and base broadening (tax-cut-cum-base-broadening reforms). Analyzing an international tax competition model over tax rates and bases, I show that when the profitability of outward foreign direct investment increases relative to the domestic rent of a firm in the home country, the country undertakes a tax-cut-cum-base-broadening reform. I also show that if the domestic rent is large relative to the amount of income shifting by multinational firms at the symmetric equilibrium, larger countries set higher statutory tax rates and a narrower tax bases. Chapter III is written with Stephen Salant. Previous analyses of cap-and-trade programs regulating carbon emissions assumed that firms must <b>surrender</b> <b>permits</b> as they pollute. If so, then the price of permits may remain constant over measurable intervals if the government injects additional permits at a ceiling price or may even collapse if more permits are injected through an auction. However, no cap-and-trade program actually requires continual compliance. The three federal bills and California's AB- 32, for example, instead require that firms <b>surrender</b> <b>permits</b> only periodically to cover their cumulative emissions since the last compliance period. We develop a methodology for analyzing the effects of such permit injections and show that anticipated injections of additional permits during the compliance period should have different effects than under continual compliance...|$|R
40|$|Price collars have {{frequently}} been advocated {{to restrict the}} price of emissions per-mits. Consequently, collars were incorporated in the three bills languishing in Congress {{as well as in}} Californias AB- 32; Europeans are now considering price collars for EU ETS. In advocating collars, most analysts have assumed (1) collars will be implemented by government purchases and sales from bu¤erstocks, just like bands on foreign ex-change rates or commodity prices; and (2) 8 ̆ 5 rms must <b>surrender</b> <b>permits</b> whenever they pollute. In fact, however, no actual emissions trading scheme has conformed to these assumptions. In the current paper, we maintain the second assumption (contin-ual compliance) and show that while a price collar supported by a su ¢ ciently large bu¤erstock can restrict permit prices, a price collar supported instead by auctions with reserve prices cannot. In a companion paper (Hasegawa and Salant, 2012), we show that neither method works once account is taken of delayed compliance...|$|R
60|$|The impudence of it left Cahusac speechless. But {{among the}} English buccaneers {{in the square}} there were many who savoured the audacious humour of the trapped dictating terms to the trappers. Laughter broke from them. It spread into a roar of acclamation; for bluff is a weapon dear to every adventurer. Presently, when they {{understood}} it, even Cahusac's French followers were carried off their feet by that wave of jocular enthusiasm, until in his truculent obstinacy Cahusac remained the only dissentient. He withdrew in mortification. Nor was he to be mollified until the following day brought him his revenge. This came {{in the shape of}} a messenger from Don Miguel with a letter in which the Spanish Admiral solemnly vowed to God that, since the pirates had refused his magnanimous offer to <b>permit</b> them to <b>surrender</b> with the honours of war, he would now await them at the mouth of the lake there to destroy them on their coming forth. He added that should they delay their departure, he would so soon as he was reenforced by a fifth ship, the Santo Nino, on its way to join him from La Guayra, himself come inside to seek them at Maracaybo.|$|R

500|$|Warwick {{arrived at}} Le Havre in late October 1562. He was sceptical {{from the start}} as to the chances to hold Le Havre, writing: [...] "I fear [...] are too much abused in the good opinion {{you have in the}} {{strength}} of this town". Elizabeth soon made it clear that she did not wish his army to engage in any active support for the Huguenot side, the purpose of the English contribution remaining somewhat obscure. In March 1563 the warring French agreed to a peace, while Elizabeth decided to hold on to Le Havre until Calais was returned to the English, as had been agreed with the Huguenot party. The reconciled French, however, turned jointly against the English garrison. Le Havre's fortifications would have needed major expansion and repair to withstand a prolonged siege. Still, Dudley tried his best until the town's walls were crumbling under French bombardment and the Queen <b>permitted</b> him to <b>surrender</b> honourably in July 1563 on account of the plague that was decimating his troops. Ambrose Dudley himself {{had been shot in the}} leg when parleying with the French and returned to England seriously ill. He wrote to his brother that he was happy [...] "rather to end my life upon the breach than in any sickness. ... Farewell my dear and loving brother, a thousand times." [...] Robert Dudley went to welcome him at Portsmouth despite the plague and much to Elizabeth's annoyance.|$|R
40|$|With federal {{policies}} to curb {{greenhouse gas emissions}} in the U. S. stagnating, California has taken action on its own. We estimate the impact of California’s cap-and-trade program on the leakage of emissions to other regions using a calibrated general equilibrium model. Sub-national policies can lead to high leakage rates as state economies are generally closely connected to other economies, including integration of electricity markets. Measures that will prevent leakage from California’s cap-and-trade program include requiring <b>permits</b> to be <b>surrendered</b> for emissions embodied in imported electricity and legislation banning “resource shuffling”. Under a cap-and-trade policy without measures to reduce leakage, the price of emission permits is $ 12 per ton of CO 2 and emissions in other regions increase by 46 % of the reduction in emissions in California. When imported electricity {{is included in the}} program and resource shuffling is banned, the carbon price is $ 65, there is negative leakage to regions exporting electricity to California, positive leakage to other regions and the overall leakage rate is 2 %. We conclude that although there is potential for large increases in emissions elsewhere due to California’s cap-and-trade policy, enforcement of requirements for imported electricity will be effective at curtailing leakage.
