Two sepa-rate pairs of coils have been utilized for inductive power and for-ward data transmission, plus a pair of miniature antennas for back telemetry. One major challenge, however, is to minimize the inter-ference among these carriers especially on the implantable side, where size and power are highly limited.

40|$|When {{using the}} {{conventional}} two-coil inductive link for the simultaneous wireless power and data transmissions in implantable biomedical sensor devices, the strong power carrier could overwhelm the uplink data signal and even saturate the external uplink receiver. To address this problem, we propose a new magnetic-balanced inductive link for our implantable glaucoma treatment device. In this inductive link, an extra coil is specially added for the uplink receiving. The strong power carrier interference is minimized to approach zero by balanced canceling {{of the magnetic}} field of the external <b>power</b> <b>coil.</b> The implant coil is shared by the wireless power harvesting and the uplink data transmitting. Two carriers (i. e., 2 -MHz power carrier and 500 -kHz uplink carrier) are used for the wireless power transmission and the uplink data transmission separately. In the experiments, the prototype of this link achieves as high as 65. 72 dB improvement of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) compared with the conventional two-coil inductive link. Benefiting from the significant improvement of SIR, the implant transmitter costs only 0. 2 mW of power carrying 50 kbps of binary phase shift keying data and gets a bit error rate of 1 × 10 − 7, even though the coupling coefficient is as low as 0. 005. At the same time, 5 mW is delivered to the load with maximum power transfer efficiency of 58. 8 %.

40|$|Abstract — When a {{breakdown}} of the thermally insulating vacuum occurs in an energized high <b>power</b> <b>coil</b> system (e. g. a leakage of the He-cooling system or to the surrounding air) the coils warm up and have to be discharged fast to avoid destruction. Due to the coil inductance and the necessary discharge time, a high voltage is produced in the coil and the feeder system. Therefore an unspecified pressure coincides with the occurrence of a high voltage at the coil and feeder system. It is well known that under these conditions arcing can occur at a magnet when it is not perfectly insulated even for voltages < 1 kV (Paschen-effect). The gas dependent breakdown voltage minimum occurs typically in the range of some 100 V at a pressure value that depends from geometry and temperature. For lower and higher pressures the breakdown voltage is increasing. For a high power magnet system an insulation is necessary that can withstand high voltage in the 10 kV range although any possible pressure is applied to the system. Usually a pressure independent solid insulation is used to solve this requirement. In order to test the reliability of this electrical insulation under all pressure conditions, a so-called Paschen test has to be performed. This Paschen test is a high voltage test with pressures varying between good vacuum and ambient pressure. In this paper examples for insulation failures on large coils found with Paschen testing are given. In a series of experiments with samples that have been prepared with intended insulation faults the necessity of Paschen testing is demonstrated to identify insulation problems that are not visible under good vacuum or ambient pressure. Therefore, a Paschen-test is also a useful high voltage diagnostic tool to localize insulation faults in solid insulated magnets...|$|E

Robust {{and reliable}} telemetry units with an implantable transmitter and data acquisition software are necessary to insure long-term measurements. It was the goal of this study to update the current implantable telemetry system. Updates included using a new tablet computer for increased rates of data acquisition and encasing transmitters in a new waterproof casing. Software was developed using Labview on a Windows based Acer Iconia Tab. The Labview program allowed the user to save data to a measurement file and view the data in real time. The increased processing power of the tablet resulted in an increase in data collection rates from 29 Hz to 87 Hz. Interfacing the tablet computer with the telemetry system required the use of a RS- 232 protocol to USB adapter. The newly developed tablet computer system was also used for load measurement collection during the most recent in vivo study. In order to insure transmitter function in vivo it was necessary to characterize the factors affecting transmission in vivo and develop transmitter and <b>power</b> <b>coil</b> designs that operated reliably. In the past implantable transmitters were noted to operate properly during bench top testing, but often failed after being placed in vivo. The two factors studied that limited power transfer to the transmitters were immersion in an aqueous environment and exposure to elevated temperatures.

Additionally, a temperature increase to 40 °C decreased power transfer by 6. 2 % (p-value = 0. 017) when compared to power transfer in room temperature air. A solution that restored transmitter function required encasing transmitters in a new waterproof casing.

Thus, there is strong motivation to improve the energy efficiency of implantable electrical stimulators. In this thesis, I present two examples of low-power tissue stimulators. The first type is a wireless, low-power neural stimulation system for use in freely behaving animals. The system consists of an external transmitter and a miniature, implantable wireless receiver-and-stimulator utilizing a custom integrated chip built in a standard 0. 5 ptm CMOS process. Low power design permits 12 days of continuous experimentation from a 5 mAh battery, extended by an automatic sleep mode that reduces standby power consumption by 2. 5 x. To test this device, bipolar stimulating electrodes were implanted into the songbird motor nucleus HVC of zebra finches. Single-neuron recordings revealed that wireless {{stimulation of}} HVC led to a strong increase of spiking activity in its downstream target, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). When this device was used to deliver biphasic pulses of current randomly during singing, singing activity was prematurely terminated in all birds tested. The second stimulator I present is a novel, energy-efficient electrode stimulator with feedback current regulation. This stimulator uses inductive storage and recycling of energy based on a dynamic power supply to drive an electrode in an adiabatic fashion such that energy consumption is minimized. Since there are no explicit current sources or current limiters, wasteful energy dissipation across such elements is naturally avoided. The stimulator also utilizes a shunt current-sensor to monitor and regulate the current through the electrode via feedback, thus enabling flexible and safe stimulation. The dynamic power supply allows efficient transfer of energy both {{to and from the}} electrode, and is based on a DC-DC converter topology that is used in a bidirectional fashion. In an exemplary electrode implementation, I show how the stimulator combines the efficiency of voltage control and the safety and accuracy of current control in a single low-power integrated-circuit built in a standard 0. 35 pm CMOS process. I also perform a theoretical analysis of the energy efficiency that is in accord with experimental measurements. In its current proof-of-concept implementation, this stimulator achieves a 2 x- 3 x reduction in energy consumption as compared to a conventional current-source-based stimulator operating from a fixed power supply. by Scott Kenneth Arfin.

40|$|An {{electron}} {{cyclotron resonance}} ion source working at a microwave frequency of 2. 45 GHz has been developed in order to generate an intense current of singly charged metal ions. It is loaded with metal vapor by an integrated cylindrical sputter magnetron, which was especially designed for this purpose. The MECRIS (Magnetron Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source) merges ECR ion source technology with sputter magnetron technology in a unique manner representing a new metal ion source concept. By using an Al sputter target, {{the efficiency of the}} MECRIS was demonstrated successfully for the example of Al+ ion production. The extractable ion current was measured by a newly developed high-current Faraday cup. On the basis of numerical modeling, the total magnetic field was set {{in a way that the}} permanent magnets of the magnetron and the coils of the ECR source are forming a minimum-B-structure, providing an effective electron trap by the magnetic mirror principle. Simultaneously, optimal electron heating is achieved by a closed ECR-surface at resonant magnetic flux density of 87. 5 mT. Electron temperature increases towards the center of the source to a maximum of about 11 eV and was measured by a double Langmuir probe. Due to the heated electron population, efficient electron impact ionization of the Al atoms is accomplished. Al atoms are injected with a rate of more than 1 E 18 Al-atoms/s resulting in a maximum Al atom density of 2 E 10 1 /cm³. The MECRIS produces mainly singly charged ions of the sputtered material (Al+) and the process gas (Ar+). The Al+ ion extraction current is elevated by one order of magnitude to a maximum of 135 μA by increasing the process parameters sputter magnetron power, microwave <b>power,</b> <b>coil</b> current, and acceleration voltage. Related to the extraction area of about 0. 5 cm², the highest possible Al+ ion current density is 270 μA/cm². A corresponding process parameter dependency was found for the plasma density showing a peak value of about 6 E 11 1 /cm³, which was deduced from probe measurements. The ratio of the extracted Al+ ion current to the Ar+ ion current can be enhanced from 0. 3 to a maximum of 2 by optimization of the process parameters. This was confirmed by probe investigations of the appropriate ion density ratio. In conclusion, the ECR-surface needs to be located in the area of the highest Al atom density in the target plane in order to improve the extraction current and Al+/Ar+ ratio. The MECRIS plasma produces an Al+ ion current, which is up to 140 % higher compared to that of the sole sputter magnetron plasma (without microwave injection). As revealed by probe measurements, this effect is due to the higher plasma density and electron temperature of the MECRIS plasma, leading to a difference of one order of magnitude and 7 eV, respectively. Additionally, the MECRIS plasma has been characterized by optical emission spectroscopy and simulated by a global and a two-dimensional model. Retrieved process parameter dependencies of plasma density, electron temperature, Al+ ion density, and Ar+ ion density coincide with probe findings. Although a discrepancy of the absolute values of partly up to two orders of magnitude is evident. Potentially, the Al+ ion current can be enhanced to the mA-region by optimizing the ion extraction system for minimal idle electrode currents and by rising sputter magnetron power as well as acceleration voltage above the actual limits of 10 kW and 30 kV, respectively...|$|E
