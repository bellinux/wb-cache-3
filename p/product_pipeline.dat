30|$|Approximately, 17.95  million {{barrels of}} oil {{products}} are imported and exported everyday around the world (BP 2014), {{most of which are}} transported to different cities by <b>pipelines.</b> As oil <b>product</b> <b>pipelines</b> are developing at an incredible pace, the topological structure and operation of oil <b>product</b> <b>pipelines</b> are becoming more complex than ever, adding difficulty in making schedules. The main issues concerned are how to make a more rational batch-scheduling plan and how to meet the consumption demand of each region along the pipeline in a safe and economic way. The oil <b>products</b> <b>pipeline</b> has features such as multiple oil products, ever-changing working conditions, and synchronism between the injection plan of the pipeline’s initial station and the offloading plan of the offloading stations along the pipeline. Milidiú and dos Santos Liporace (2003) proved that the scheduling plan of oil batches is a non-deterministic polynomial complete (NPC) issue if the batch sequence constraint is considered. Presently, batch-dispatchers use manual or semi-automatic methods to create the batch-scheduling plan for most of the supply-based pipelines. In other words, there exists no mature algorithm that can automatically make the scheduling plan that meets with the demands of actual operation.|$|R
