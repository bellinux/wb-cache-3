The key findings of the report include: • Over the next decade to 2017, Australia is on track to post average annual labour productivity growth in the broad order of 1. 67 per cent. That is somewhat higher than recent poor performances but well below the levels recorded in the 1990 s. The productivity estimate incorporates a continuation of strong capital investment. • Expansion of the workforce is decelerating as participation stabilises and hours of work retreat. Compared to labour hours growing by 1. 77 per cent over the past five years, the 10 -year annual outlook is for growth around 1. 25 per cent. • When combined, these labour productivity and labour supply <b>growth</b> estimates put <b>GDP</b> <b>growth</b> at around 2. 9 per cent. This is a further deterioration from the level of the 1990 s. • In contrast to some predictions that Australia has already reached the point where unemployment cannot fall further without triggering inflationary pressures, our analysis is more circumspect and we find that there is further scope to test our ability to reduce unemployment and underemployment before we see wage pressures fueling inflation.

30|$|The {{paper by}} Alberola et al. (2014) deals {{precisely}} with {{the estimation of}} potential GDP when external imbalances are present. Specifically these authors argue that standards estimates of <b>potential</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>growth</b> rely exclusively on inflation as an indicator. Indeed prior to 2001 {{there was a strong}} positive correlation between growth and inflation, but not afterwards. It is for this reasons that estimates of potential growth were pushed upwards and perhaps led many foreign investors to keep directing funds to countries such as Spain. Alberola et al. (2014) first distinguish between standard measures of <b>potential</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>growth</b> and sustainable GDP growth, which is the maximum rate of growth that can be obtained without widening of imbalances such as current account imbalances. Building on this distinction they propose a new methodology to estimate sustainable growth rates, one that incorporates external imbalances as indicators as well as public and private imbalances. As it is intuitive, they find that sustainable growth rates during the years leading up to the crisis were below estimates of <b>potential</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>growth,</b> whereas the opposite is true during the crisis.

The main estimates rely on a structural approach where output of the whole economy is described by a Cobb-Douglas function and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is estimated allowing for possible breaks in the deterministic trend. The results confirm that over the considered period the <b>potential</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>growth</b> has been faster in the United States than in other studied countries, reflecting a combination of higher labour contribution and faster TFP growth.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between absolute energy consumption and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for 113 countries over the period 1971 – 2004. Energy has been scarcely explored in the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) debate and is taken as the indicator of overall environmental pressure. The following aspects of this work are rather innovative. Firstly, in order to closely adhere to the EKC narratives, the indicator of environmental pressure energy) is taken in absolute terms rather than per capita. Secondly, we look for consistency both between different econometric techniques (parametric and semi-parametric) and across different analytical levels (world, time series/cross-countries, and single countries). Finally, the dataset is large and not limited to developed countries. In our opinion, the estimates cannot support an energy-EKC hypothesis. For {{the world as a}} single unit, the relationship is positive monotone, with a lower (though still positive) elasticity after 1989. A glance at single country level does not reveal evidence of EKC. Cross-country analysis is slightly more open to interpretation; in any case, however, it shows that the <b>potential</b> benefits of <b>GDP</b> <b>growth</b> on natural environment, if any, did not show up in the considered time span...|$|R
