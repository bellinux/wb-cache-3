The Superintendent of the celebrated Mannheim Theatre, the greatly powerful Imperial Baron von Dalberg, with whom Schiller, since the bringing out of his Robbers, had stood in lively correspondence, drew back when Schiller himself was here; and kept the Poet at a distance as a political Fugitive; leaving him to shift as he could. In vain had Schiller explained to him, in manly open words, his economic straits, and begged from him a loan of 300 gulden' (30l.) 'to pay therewith a <b>pressing</b> <b>debt</b> in Stuttgart, and drag himself along, {{and try to get}} started in the world. Dalberg returned the Fiesco, Schiller's new republican Tragedy, which had been sent him, with the declaration that he could advance no money on the Fiesco in its present form; the Piece must first be remodelled to suit the stage. During this remodelling, which the otherwise so passionately vivid and hopeful Poet began without murmur, he lived entirely on the journey-money that had been saved up by the faithful Streicher, who would on no account leave him.' ...|$|E

60|$|The Queen did {{not wear}} the jewels at the feast {{for which she}} had wanted them. Strange to say, she never wore them at all, to the {{surprise}} of the vendors and of the Cardinal. The necklace was, in fact, hastily cut to pieces with a blunt heavy knife, in Jeanne's house; her husband crossed to England, and sold many stones, and bartered more for all sorts of trinkets, to Grey, of New Bond Street, and Jeffreys, of Piccadilly. Villette had already been arrested with his pockets full of diamonds, but the luck of the House of Valois, and the astuteness of Jeanne, procured his release. So the diamonds were, in part, 'dumped down' in England; many were kept by the La Mottes; and Jeanne paid some <b>pressing</b> <b>debts</b> in diamonds.|$|R

Elizabeth Grant described her thus: His bride was young, and good, and rich, but neither clever nor handsome. She made him very happy and paid his most <b>pressing</b> <b>debts,</b> that is her father did, old Mr Brodie of the Burn, brother to Brodie of Brodie.... He made a really large fortune; he gave with his daughter, his only child, £100,000 down, and left her more than another at his death. Really to her husband her large fortune was the least part of her value; she possessed upright principles, good sense, and she turned out a first-rate woman of business.

'I may with just reason consider myself to have been the cause of his death,' the blow was really dealt at Don John. He expressed the most touching anxiety for the wife and children of Escovedo, who died poor, because (unlike Perez) 'he had clean hands.' He besought Philip, by the love of our Lord, 'to use every possible diligence to know whence the blow came and to punish it with the rigour which it deserves.' He himself will pay the most <b>pressing</b> <b>debts</b> of the dead. (From Beaumont, April 20, 1578.) ...|$|R
25|$|A {{few months}} after their return from the Mapleson tour, de Beauplan {{conceived}} the idea of forming his own French opera troupe with Ambre as its star soprano. They assembled a complete opera company consisting of 169 people—singers, actors, supernumeraries, a chorus, orchestra, corps de ballet, seamstresses, hairdressers, and stagehands—and set off for America in October 1880. The tour began with a successful repertory season in New Orleans. However, with severe rainstorms and flooding and competition from Sarah Bernhardt's theatre troupe who were also performing there, the box office receipts declined considerably by February 1981. After leaving New Orleans, the troupe toured to Cincinnati, Chicago, and Philadelphia, but the box office receipts in those cities did not even cover their expenses. By {{the time they had}} reached New York in May 1881, the five main singers refused to perform unless they were paid their back wages. The company collapsed. Ambre pawned some of her jewels to pay the most <b>pressing</b> <b>debts</b> and departed for France accompanied by the troupe's leading tenor, Gabriel Tournié. The hapless de Beauplan was left behind to sort out the repatriation of the company's remaining members.|$|R
60|$|The interview, and {{whatever}} came of it, remained a secret {{with the two}} men. When Mr. Carr accepted the hospitality of the old cabin again, it was understood that he had sacrificed the new house and its furniture {{to some of the}} more <b>pressing</b> <b>debts</b> of the mine, and the act went far to restore his waning popularity. But a more genuine feeling of relief was experienced by Devil's Ford when it was rumored that Fairfax Munroe had asked for the hand of Jessie Carr, and that some promise contingent upon the equitable adjustment of the affairs of the mine had been given by Mr. Carr. To the superstitious mind of Devil's Ford and its few remaining locators, this new partnership seemed to promise that unity of interest and stability of fortune that Devil's Ford had lacked. But nothing could be done until the rainy season had fairly set in; until the long-looked-for element that was to magically separate the gold from the dross in those dull mounds of dust and gravel had come of its own free will, and in its own appointed channels, independent of the feeble auxiliaries that had hopelessly riven the rocks on the hillside, or hung incomplete and unfinished in lofty scaffoldings above the settlement.|$|R
6000|$|Among the {{circumstances}} of this visit vaguely called to mind by this fair lady in after years, was that Goldsmith read to her and her sister {{the first part of}} a novel which he had in hand. It was doubtless the manuscript mentioned {{at the beginning of this}} chapter, on which he had obtained an advance of money from Newbery to stave off some <b>pressing</b> <b>debts,</b> and to provide funds for this very visit. It never was finished. The bookseller, when he came afterward to examine the manuscript, objected to it as a mere narrative version of the Good-Natured Man. Goldsmith, too easily put out of conceit of his writings, threw it aside, forgetting that this was the very Newbery who kept his Vicar of Wakefield by him nearly two years through doubts of its success. The loss of the manuscript is deeply to be regretted; it doubtless would have been properly wrought up before given to the press, and might have given us new scenes in life and traits of character, while it could not fail to bear traces of his delightful style. What a pity he had not been guided by the opinions of his fair listeners at Barton, instead of that of the astute Mr. Newbery! ...|$|R
60|$|Hardship {{and fatigue}} had no attractions for him, {{but he had}} grown tired of the monotony of his life at the Grange, and as {{qualified}} surveyors were not plentiful in the wilds, the authorities had been glad to obtain the services of an engineer officer. Though he was only an assistant, the pay was good, and he had thought it wise to place himself out of his creditors' reach. Unfortunately, {{some of the more}} persistent had learned where he had gone, and the letter contained a curt demand for the settlement of an account. Gerald could not pay it, but the newspaper brought a ray of hope. He had speculated with part of the money his father had once given him to pay his debts, and the mining shares he bought had turned out worthless. Now, however, they were unexpectedly going up; it seemed that the company had at last tapped a vein of promising ore. If he could hold out, {{he might be able to}} liquidate his most <b>pressing</b> <b>debts.</b> But this creditor's demand was peremptory and he could not see how he was to gain time. He wished the men whose harsh voices reached him from the store would stop talking. They were rough choppers, of whose society he had grown very tired; and the taciturn surveyor was not a much better companion.|$|R
50|$|In April 1897 he {{received}} word that his favorite daughter Aline had died tragically from pneumonia. This {{was also the}} month he learned he had to vacate his house because its land had been sold. He took out a bank loan to build a much more extravagant wooden house with beautiful views of the mountains and sea. But he overextended himself in so doing, {{and by the end}} of the year faced the real prospect of his bank foreclosing on him. Failing health and <b>pressing</b> <b>debts</b> brought him to the brink of despair. At the end of the year he completed his monumental Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?, which he regarded as his masterpiece and final artistic testament (in a letter to Monfreid he explained that he tried to kill himself after finishing it). The painting was exhibited at Vollard's gallery in November the following year, along with eight thematically related paintings he had completed by July. This was his first major exhibition in Paris since his Durand-Ruel show in 1893 and it was a decided success, critics praising his new serenity. Where do we come from?, however, received mixed reviews and Vollard had difficulty selling it. He eventually sold it in 1901 for 2,500 francs (about $10,000 in year 2000 US dollars) to , of which Vollard's commission was perhaps as much as 500 francs.|$|R
50|$|In {{its first}} decade, the {{congregation}} {{was plagued by}} severe financial difficulties. Due to increases in building costs, {{the first of the}} European fundraising efforts took place in 1857 when a trustee of the congregation, G. van der Smissen, went to Germany and collected an amount sufficient to cover the most <b>pressing</b> building <b>debts.</b> As the financial situation had not improved by 1860, his daughter, Elizabeth van der Smissen, undertook a trip to Europe to raise funds. Using testimonials provided by clergy of other denominations in Toronto, specifically Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, and Congregationalist, Miss van der Smissen traveled to Germany, France, Switzerland, England and Scotland raised sufficient funds to retire the congregation's debt. A record of these testimonials and of all funds collected remains in the congregation's archives to date.|$|R
50|$|In Barrow v The Master, an {{important}} case in South African succession law, the testator had convinced {{his son to}} leave his job and take over the management and farming operations on the farm “Longridge” from him. To assist him, the testator bought another farm “Meldene” for his son (the son paid {{a small portion of}} this) to live on while managing Longridge. Because the son was finding it inconvenient and difficult to manage the farming operations on Longridge while living at Meldene the testator decided to sell 'Longridge' for a net price of £10,000 and undertook to give his son the sum of £262 which he calculated would be the amount of the selling agent's commission. The farm was sold and another smaller farm called “Patchwood” was purchased. In his will the testator had bequeathed Longridge to his two sons in equal shares. Thus when the testator died, his son claimed for his half share in the farm Patchwood. The claim to Patchwood is founded on a promise by the testator during his lifetime to donate to his son a farm to the value of at least £5,000. Alternatively, the son claimed that the bequest of a half-share of Longridge had not been adeemed. On the first argument, the court held that the testator had settled his promise by purchasing the farm Meldene for his son. Furthermore, the court held that the purchase of Patchwood was effected to replace the facilities for farming that his son would lose by the sale of Longridge, not that the farm was actually for him. On the second argument, the court rejected the contention that the testator felt obliged to sell the farm because his son was finding it difficult to manage it and it was thus not voluntary. The court held that involuntary alienations only arise out of necessity such as <b>pressing</b> <b>debts.</b> Thus the alienation was voluntary and the bequest had adeemed.|$|R
50|$|In 1875, Smith and Forscutt {{attempted}} {{to sell the}} Kirtland Temple {{to the city of}} Kirtland in order to pay several <b>pressing</b> personal <b>debts.</b> However, the sale did not proceed because there were doubts surrounding Smith and Forscutt's ownership, since their title was based on a quitclaim deed. Smith pressed the RLDS Presiding Bishop, Israel A. Rogers, to issue a quit claim deed so that he could proceed with the sale; Rogers, instead, demanded the same of Smith on behalf of the Church. Smith insisted that if he were to issue a quit claim deed, it would only open up the church to lawsuits based on the provenance of the Huntley deed, and insisted that the only sensible remedy was for the church to bypass the line of ownership through Huntley and sue to reclaim its ownership as the successor to the original church.|$|R
60|$|Such a scene {{must have}} been one of deepest {{interest}} and high-wrought passion. A powerful king, conspicuous for a goodness which had heretofore made him meek, and now lofty in his admonitions, with alternate entreaty and reproof, besought his friend to attend to his real interests, resolutely to avoid those fascinations which in fact were fast deserting him, and to spend his great powers on a worthy field, in which he, his sovereign, would be his prop, his stay, and his pioneer. My father felt this kindness; for a moment ambitious dreams floated before him; and he thought that it would be well to exchange his present pursuits for nobler duties. With sincerity and fervour he gave the required promise: as a pledge of continued favour, he received from his royal master a sum of money to defray <b>pressing</b> <b>debts,</b> and enable him to enter under good auspices his new career. That very night, while yet full of gratitude and good resolves, this whole sum, and its amount doubled, was lost at the gaming-table. In his desire to repair his first losses, my father risked double stakes, and thus incurred a debt of honour he was wholly unable to pay. Ashamed to apply again to the king, he turned his back upon London, its false delights and clinging miseries; and, with poverty for his sole companion, buried himself in solitude among the hills and lakes of Cumberland. His wit, his bon mots, the record of his personal attractions, fascinating manners, and social talents, were long remembered and repeated from mouth to mouth. Ask where now was this favourite of fashion, this companion of the noble, this excelling beam, which gilt with alien splendour the assemblies of the courtly and the gay--you heard that he was under a cloud, a lost man; not one thought it belonged to him to repay pleasure by real services, or that his long reign of brilliant wit deserved a pension on retiring. The king lamented his absence; he loved to repeat his sayings, relate the adventures they had had together, and exalt his talents--but here ended his reminiscence.|$|R
60|$|But {{it is the}} {{immediate}} want of funds, and not the prospective debt of the country, which is now doing the damage. In this opinion Mr. Chase will probably agree with me; but readers {{on this side of}} the water will receive what I say with a smile. Such a state of affairs is certainly one that has not uncommonly been reached by financiers; it has also often been experienced by gentlemen in the management of their private affairs. It has been common in Ireland, and in London has created the wealth of the pawnbrokers. In the States at the present time the government is very much in this condition. The prospective wealth of the country is almost unbounded, but there is great difficulty in persuading any pawnbroker to advance money on the pledge. In February last Mr. Chase was driven to obtain the sanction of the legislature for paying the national creditors by bills drawn at twelve months' date, and bearing 6 per cent. interest. It is the old story of the tailor who calls with his little account, and draws on his insolvent debtor at ninety days. If the insolvent debtor be not utterly gone as regards solvency he will take up the bill when due, even though he may not be able to pay a simple debt. But, then, if he be utterly insolvent, he can do neither the one nor the other! The Secretary of the Treasury, when he asked for permission to accept these bills--or to issue these certificates, as he calls them--acknowledged to <b>pressing</b> <b>debts</b> of over five millions sterling which he could not pay; and to further debts of eight millions which he could not pay, but which he termed floating; debts, if I understand him, which were not as yet quite pressing. Now I imagine that to be a lamentable condition for any Chancellor of an Exchequer--especially as a confession is at the same time made that no advantageous borrowing is to be done under the existing circumstances. When a Chancellor of the Exchequer confesses that he cannot borrow on advantageous terms, the terms within his reach must be very bad indeed. This position is indeed a sad one, and at any rate justifies me in stating that {{the immediate}} want of funds is severely felt.|$|R
60|$|Beaton lit {{his pipe}} {{when he found}} himself in his room, and sat down before the dull fire in his grate to think. It struck him there was a dull fire in his heart a great deal like it; and he worked out a fanciful analogy with the coals, still alive, and the ashes {{creeping}} over them, and the dead clay and cinders. He felt sick of himself, sick of his life and of all his works. He was angry with Fulkerson for having got him into that art department of his, for having bought him up; and he was bitter at fate because he had been obliged to use the money to pay some <b>pressing</b> <b>debts,</b> and {{had not been able to}} return the check his father had sent him. He pitied his poor old father; he ached with compassion for him; and he set his teeth and snarled with contempt through them for his own baseness. This was the kind of world it was; but he washed his hands of it. The fault was in human nature, and he reflected with pride that he had at least not invented human nature; he had not sunk so low as that yet. The notion amused him; he thought he might get a Satanic epigram out of it some way. But in the mean time that girl, that wild animal, she kept visibly, tangibly before him; if he put out his hand he might touch hers, he might pass his arm round her waist. In Paris, in a set he knew there, what an effect she would be with that look of hers, and that beauty, all out of drawing! They would recognize the flame quality in her. He imagined a joke about her being a fiery spirit, or nymph, naiad, whatever, from one of her native gas-wells. He began to sketch on a bit of paper from the table at his elbow vague lines that veiled and revealed a level, dismal landscape, and a vast flame against an empty sky, and a shape out of the flame that took on a likeness and floated detached from it. The sketch ran up the left side of the sheet and stretched across it. Beaton laughed out. Pretty good to let Fulkerson have that for the cover of his first number! In black and red it would be effective; it would catch the eye from the news-stands. He made a motion to throw it on the fire, but held it back and slid it into the table-drawer, and smoked on. He saw the dummy with the other sketch in the open drawer which he had brought away from Fulkerson's in the morning and slipped in there, and he took it out and looked at it. He made some criticisms in line with his pencil on it, correcting the drawing here and there, and then he respected it a little more, though he still smiled at the feminine quality--a young lady quality.|$|R
