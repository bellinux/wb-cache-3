25|$|There is a {{trade off}} between the high volume and {{throughput}} that continuous presses can manage versus {{the overall quality}} of the press juice compared to the potentially more delicate means of some batch presses. However, there are noticeable difference in the composition of the pressed juice from continuous presses that are taken {{from the beginning of the}} press (the 1st <b>press</b> <b>section)</b> with the least amount of pressure and movement versus the fractions that come further down the path. Often winemakers will have separate press pans under each section that they will keep apart and vinify separately.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the defeat}} in France and the retreat to Great Britain, Maxwell (using the name [...] "Ivan du Maurier" [...] ) {{took part in}} the protest against the {{leadership}} of the Czechoslovak Army, and with 500 other soldiers, he was transferred to the Royal Pioneer Corps, and later to the North Staffordshire Regiment in 1943. He was then involved in action across Europe, from the Normandy beaches to Berlin, and achieved the rank of sergeant. He gained a commission in 1945, and was promoted captain. In January 1945, he received the Military Cross from Field Marshal Montgomery. Attached to the British Foreign Office, he served in Berlin during the next two years in the <b>press</b> <b>section.</b> Maxwell naturalised as a British subject on 19 June 1946 and legally changed his name by deed poll from Ludvick Hoch to Ian Robert Maxwell on 30 June 1948.|$|E
2500|$|The Romanian Society for Friendship {{with the}} Soviet Union (ARLUS), which offered a good {{reception}} to Soviet occupation forces, counted N. D. and Dina Cocea among its earliest members (although {{they were probably}} not among its founders); in December 1944, father and daughter were co-opted on the ARLUS Leadership Committee. The ARLUS <b>Press</b> <b>Section,</b> headed by Teodorescu-Braniște, had Cocea {{as one of its}} first vice presidents, serving alongside Ion Pas. Around 1946, Cocea approached Arghezi with a PCR offer to become a paid communist writer. According to his own classified report for the party, he was unable to persuade his former friend to join him in this cause. Cocea's various efforts still earned praise from official poet Mihai Beniuc, who included his colleague among the writers most active in disseminating communist principles after August 1944. According to Tănase, Cocea [...] "offered himself to the Soviet occupier, with the same amoralism and cynicism that have been following him through life." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} how Swedes writing in English construct number concord with collective nouns. This was done by studying three primary corpora: the Swedish English Newspaper Corpus (SWENC) and the <b>press</b> <b>sections</b> of Frown (American English) and F-LOB (British English). The findings were compared with the results in the Blogs in English by Swedes Corpus (BESC), Frown (American English) and F-LOB (British English). The SWENC contains texts from three online newspapers and one corporate newsletter in English, {{all of which are}} written by Swedes. The BESC contains texts from Swedes blogging in English. Frown and F-LOB contain texts from fifteen text genres in the 1990 s. The results in the SWENC are discussed and compared with the <b>press</b> <b>sections</b> of F-LOB and Frown. The results are also compared with the BESC, Frown and F-LOB in order to see whether there is regional and stylistic variation. The results show that Swedes prefer singular verbal concord with collective nouns even though plural forms occur which seem to be closer to F-LOB Press (BrE) than Frown Press (AmE). In contrast, the SWENC differs from the <b>press</b> <b>sections</b> of Frown and F-LOB in constructing pronominal number. This difference could be influenced by Swedish usage which allows both singular and plural pronominal number with collective nouns. The study also shows that plural forms of political parties that seem to constitute collective units show variation in Sweden whereas such nouns take only plural concord in both American and British English...|$|R
