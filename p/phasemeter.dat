40|$|The LISA <b>phasemeter</b> is {{required}} to measure the phase of an electrical signal with an error less than 3 (micro) cycles/pHz over times scales from 1 to 1000 seconds.

40|$|A digital {{averaging}} <b>phasemeter</b> {{has been}} built for measuring {{the difference between the}} phases of the unknown and reference heterodyne signals in a heterodyne laser interferometer. This <b>phasemeter</b> performs well enough to enable interferometric measurements of distance with accuracy of the order of 100 pm and with the ability to track distance as it changes at a speed of as much as 50 cm/s. This <b>phasemeter</b> is unique in that it is a single, integral system capable of performing three major functions that, heretofore, have been performed by separate systems: (1) measurement of the fractional-cycle phase difference, (2) counting of multiple cycles of phase change, and (3) averaging of phase measurements over multiple cycles for improved resolution. This <b>phasemeter</b> also offers the advantage of making repeated measurements at a high rate: the phase is measured on every heterodyne cycle. Thus, for example, in measuring the relative phase of two signals having a heterodyne frequency of 10 kHz, the <b>phasemeter</b> would accumulate 10, 000 measurements per second. At this high measurement rate, an accurate average phase determination can be made more quickly than is possible at a lower rate...|$|E

40|$|The first direct {{detection}} of gravitational waves is greatly anticipated by scientists {{since it would}} lead to a whole new observational spectrum, beyond electromagnetic radiation and highly energetic particles. ESA and NASA are currently planning a space-based gravitational wave detector named LISA, or Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, but key technologies are yet to be developed before such ambitious mission can be realized. In this respect, the Laboratory for Enabling Technologies (LET) at EADS Astrium has been engaged with the development of state-of-the-art enabling technologies for LISA, including the development of an ultra-precise <b>phasemeter.</b> The LISA metrology concept requires the {{detection of}} picometer distance variations in the frequency range from 0. 1 mHz to 0. 1 Hz and with sensitivity of 12 pm/√Hz. Therefore, the <b>phasemeter</b> is required to perform with microradian precision (few μcycles/√Hz). The goal of this work was the development of a FPGA-based digital <b>phasemeter</b> as a technology demonstrator for LISA. As a result, a prototype for the LISA <b>phasemeter</b> was developed which can support up to eight parallel channels. Therefore, it allows for the measurement of phase differences between a pair of quadrant photodiodes, which can be useful for differential wavefront sensing. In addition, an analog compensation scheme for phase noise corrections was investigated. This investigation resulted in the design and fabrication of a pilot tone board for ADC jitter calibration. Finally, it was also demonstrated that, under certain conditions, the <b>phasemeter</b> can operate within the stipulated LISA requirements. Validerat; 20110124 (anonymous...|$|E
40|$|A {{document}} discusses {{a component}} of a laser metrology system designed to measure displacements {{along the line of}} sight with precision on the order of a tenth the diameter of an atom. This component, the <b>phasemeter,</b> measures the relative phase of two electrical signals and transfers that information to a computer. Because the metrology system measures the differences between two optical paths, the <b>phasemeter</b> has two inputs, called measure and reference. The reference signal is nominally a perfect square wave with a 50 - percent duty cycle (though only rising edges are used). As the metrology system detects motion, the difference between the reference and measure signal phases is proportional to the displacement of the motion. The <b>phasemeter,</b> therefore, counts the elapsed time between rising edges in the two signals, and converts the time into an estimate of phase delay. The hardware consists of a circuit board that plugs into a COTS (commercial, off-the- shelf) Spartan-III FPGA (field-programmable gate array) evaluation board. It has two BNC inputs, (reference and measure), a CMOS logic chip to buffer the inputs, and an Ethernet jack for transmitting reduced-data to a PC. Two extra BNC connectors can be attached for future expandability, such as external synchronization. Each <b>phasemeter</b> handles one metrology channel. A bank of six phasemeters (and two zero-crossing detector cards) with an Ethernet switch can monitor the rigid body motion of an object. This device is smaller and cheaper than existing zero-crossing phasemeters. Also, because it uses Ethernet for communication with a computer, instead of a VME bridge, {{it is much easier to}} use.

40|$|Firmware for {{implementing}} a digital <b>phasemeter</b> within a {{field-programmable gate array}} (FPGA) has been devised. In the original application of this firmware, the phase that one seeks to measure {{is the difference between}} the phases of two nominally-equal-frequency heterodyne signals generated by two interferometers. In that application, zero-crossing detectors convert the heterodyne signals to trains of rectangular pulses, the two pulse trains are fed to a fringe counter (the major part of the <b>phasemeter)</b> controlled by a clock signal having a frequency greater than the heterodyne frequency, and the fringe counter computes a time-averaged estimate of the difference between the phases of the two pulse trains. The firmware also does the following: Causes the FPGA to compute the frequencies of the input signals; Causes the FPGA to implement an Ethernet (or equivalent) transmitter for readout of phase and frequency values; and Provides data for use in diagnosis of communication failures.

40|$|Figure 1 shows a {{simplified}} block diagram of an improved optoelectronic system for locking {{the phase of}} one laser to that of another laser with an adjustable offset frequency specified by the user. In comparison with prior systems, this system exhibits higher performance (including higher stability) and {{is much easier to}} use. The system is based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and operates almost entirely digitally; hence, it is easily adaptable to many different systems. The system achieves phase stability of less than a microcycle. It was developed to satisfy the phase-stability requirement for a planned spaceborne gravitational-wave-detecting heterodyne laser interferometer (LISA). The system has potential terrestrial utility in communications, lidar, and other applications. The present system includes a fast <b>phasemeter</b> that is a companion to the microcycle-accurate one described in High-Accuracy, High-Dynamic-Range Phase-Measurement System (NPO- 41927), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 31, No. 6 (June 2007), page 22. In the present system (as in the previously reported one), beams from the two lasers (here denoted the master and slave lasers) interfere on a photodiode. The heterodyne photodiode output is digitized and fed to the fast <b>phasemeter,</b> which produces suitably conditioned, low-latency analog control signals which lock the phase of the slave laser to that of the master laser. These control signals are used to drive a thermal and a piezoelectric transducer that adjust the frequency and phase of the slave-laser output. The output of the photodiode is a heterodyne signal at the difference between the frequencies of the two lasers. (The difference is currently required to be less than 20 MHz due to the Nyquist limit of the current sampling rate. We foresee few problems in doubling this limit using current equipment.) Within the <b>phasemeter,</b> the photodiode-output signal is digitized to 15 bits at a sampling frequency of 40 MHz by use of the same analog-to-digital converter (ADC) as that of the previously reported <b>phasemeter.</b> The ADC output is passed to the FPGA, wherein the signal is demodulated using a digitally generated oscillator signal at the offset locking frequency specified by the user. The demodulated signal is low-pass filtered, decimated to a sample rate of 1 MHz, then filtered again. The decimated and filtered signal is converted to an analog output by a 1 MHz, 16 -bit digital-to-analog converters. After a simple low-pass filter, these analog signals drive the thermal and piezoelectric transducers of the laser...|$|E

40|$|LISA Pathfinder is a {{technology}} demonstration mission for the space-based gravitational wave observatory, LISA. It {{demonstrated that the}} performance requirements for the interferometric measurement of two test masses in free fall can be met. An {{important part of the}} data analysis is to identify the limiting noise sources. [1] This measurement is performed with heterodyne interferometry. The performance of this optical metrology system (OMS) at high frequencies is limited by sensing noise. One such noise source is Relative Intensity Noise (RIN). RIN is a property of the laser, and the photodiode current generated by the interferometer signal contains frequency dependant RIN. From this electric signal the <b>phasemeter</b> calculates the phase change and laser power, and the coupling of RIN into the measurement signal depends on the noise frequency. RIN at DC, at the heterodyne frequency and at two times the heterodyne frequency couples into the phase. Another important noise at high frequencies is path length noise. To reduce the impact this noise is suppressed with a control loop. Path length noise not suppressed will couple directly into the length measurement. The subtraction techniques of both noise sources depend on the phase difference between the reference signal and the measurement signal, and thus on the test mass position. During normal operations we position the test mass at the interferometric zero, which is optimal for noise subtraction purposes. This paper will show results from an in-flight experiment where the test mass position was changed to make the position dependant noise visible...|$|E

The {{first part of this}} work describes viable layout solutions of a heterodyne interferometer employed for intra-satellite range metrology and the major noise contributions which degrade the overall accuracy of the instrument. Together with the optical layout of the instrument, novel design concepts of the instrumenta s subsystems are also analyzed and tested. Precisely, a <b>phasemeter</b> designed to autonomously acquire and track a heterodyne signal with low signal-to-noise ratio in a frequency band that spans from 1 MHz to 25 MHz is presented. Particular attention is also dedicated to the mathematical modeling of the steering mirror dynamics and to the enhancement of its pointing performance by means of feedforward control. In the second part of this work, solutions for autonomously acquiring a laser signal buried in noise are analyzed and put in relation with the boundary constraints of the acquisition problem. The acquisition algorithms presented and the robustness of their design is verified mainly using numerical simulations. Experimental tests have also been performed for validating the simulation hypothesis and verifying their compliancy to a realistic mission scenario. The last part of this work describes a calibration algorithm which has been developed for minimizing, during data post-processing, the noise due to the tilt-to-piston coupling which represents one of the highest contributors to the overall measurement noise...|$|E
40|$|The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) {{is a joint}} ESA-NASA {{project to}} design, build and operate a space-based {{gravitational}} wave detector based on a laser interferometer. LISA relies on several technologies that are either new to spaceflight or must perform at levels not previously demonstrated in a spaceflight environment. The ESA-led LISA Pathfinder mission is the main effort to demonstrate LISA technology. NASA also supports complementary ground-based technology development and risk reduction activities. This presentation will report the status of NASA work on micronewton thrusters, the telescope, the optical pointing subsystem and mission formulation. More details {{on some of these}} topics will be given in posters. Other talks and posters will describe NASA-supported work on the laser subsystem, the <b>phasemeter,</b> and aspects of the interferometry. Two flight-qualified clusters of four colloid micronewton thrusters, each capable of thrust Levels between 5 and 30 microNewton with a resolution less than 0. l microNewton and a thrust noise less than 0. 1 microNewton/vHz (0. 001 to 4 Hz), have been integrated onto the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft. The complementary ground-based development focuses on lifetime demonstration. Laboratory verification of failure models and accelerated life tests are just getting started. LISA needs a 40 cm diameter, afocal telescope for beam expansion/reduction that maintains an optical pathlength stability of approximately 1 pm/vHz in an extremely stable thermal environment. A mechanical prototype of a silicon carbide primary-secondary structure has been fabricated for stability testing. Two optical assemblies must point at different distant spacecraft with nanoradian accuracy over approximately 1 degree annual variation in the angle between the distant spacecraft. A candidate piezo-inchworm actuator is being tested in a suitable testbed. In addition to technology development, NASA has carried out several studies in support of the mission formulation. The results of systems engineering work on flight software, avionics and reliability will be summarized...|$|E
