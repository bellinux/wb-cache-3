5000|$|A {{person-to-person call}} is an operator-assisted call {{in which the}} calling party {{requests}} {{to speak to a}} specific party and not simply to anyone who answers. The caller is not charged for the call unless the requested party can be reached. This method was popular when telephone calls were relatively expensive. The alternative, in which the calling party agrees to talk to whoever answers the telephone, is known as station-to-station. Since the introduction of direct dial telephone service and the subsequent drop in the price of long distance telephone calls, <b>person-to-person</b> <b>service</b> has virtually disappeared.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Today {{electronic}} messaging services are indispensable {{to individuals and}} organizations. If a message contains sensitive information, the integrity and confidentiality of the contents created by individual users should be maintained in an effective manner. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new mechanisms to support the requirement. In this paper {{we focus on the}} message protection in the organization-to-organization service, while many other researchers have worked on the <b>person-to-person</b> <b>service.</b> Our approaches can provide effective integrity verification, tracking mechanisms, and confidentiality at the user-level in a scalable manner with fine granularity. Furthermore, we use a set of session keys for each message to provide more secure communications, maintaining scalable key management by employing a key hierarchy. We describe the mechanisms of our approaches and show their feasibility by describing a prototype system that we developed. I...|$|E
40|$|Hello Everyone, Once again, our {{section is}} {{co-sponsoring}} {{a number of}} very interesting programs. Many thanks to Halyna Liszczynskyj. These programs underscore the reality that the <b>person-to-person</b> <b>service</b> we provide is needed, regardless of how many virtual resources and services we offer. The next few years look very promising for cancer research and treatment. It is exciting to read about the investigation of anti-inflammatory drugs for their antineoplastic potential. Increasing knowledge of the natural molecule called TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) and its use with ingredients found in foods such as red wine and turmeric is intriguing. Motivation for more research in cancer epidemiology and prevention will probably include the recent reiteration that plastic containers release dioxins into your food when it is heated in microwave ovens, and the increased attention to the use of estrogens in beef and poultry to speed their growth (Pollan, 2002) ...|$|E
40|$|My {{thesis is}} a Japanese {{traditional}} Inn, called Ryokan. The {{is open to}} anyone seeking refuge from the rapid pace of urban life, including local residents and tourists, yet is limited to adults {{in order to keep}} quietness within. It is similar to a Bed & Breakfast in terms of <b>person-to-person</b> <b>service,</b> yet its emphasis is on the idea of reactivating human senses by offering an intimate experience with the surrounding nature through materials. The intention of my thesis is to explore an experience in Ryokan architect~re. The thesis introduces Ryokan architecture as a typology. Incorporating ritualistic Japanese inn traditions, the architecture is designed with a sense of order, which encourages guests to settle their state of mind. The inn investigates the notion of 'continuity of moments (in time) ' through a manipulation of light and water as well as through materiality, which is to lure forgotten human senses. Communal bathing experience within the inn enhances stimulation to human sanity. Beacon Hill in Boston is selected as the site for the Ryokan. The site's existing condition is a 6000 sq ft-vacant-lot. Although it is just one block-in from the very active and busy intersection of Charles and Beacon Street, the site offers quietness and tranquility. Given that I sensed the stark contrast between the very busy streets and the solitude of this site, I felt that there was an intriguing quality. by Keiko Sugeta. Thesis (M. Arch.)

50|$|Promotions {{can be held}} in {{physical}} environments at special events such as concerts, festivals, trade shows, and in the field, such as in grocery or department stores. Interactions in the field allow immediate purchases. The purchase of a product can be incentive with discounts (i.e., coupons), free items, or a contest. This method is used to increase the sales of a given product. Interactions between the brand and the customer are performed by a brand ambassador or promotional model who represents the product {{in physical}} environments. Brand ambassadors or promotional models are hired by a marketing company, {{which in turn is}} booked by the brand to represent the product or <b>service.</b> <b>Person-to-person</b> interaction, as opposed to media-to-person involvement, establishes connections that add another dimension to promotion.

More than 120 universities compete with teams of four to five students. Central’s 2014 Bateman team had five team members and two alternates. The competition requires students to research, plan, implement, and evaluate a strategic public relations campaign in their community based on a topic given by National PRSSA. This year, Fiserv Inc., a leading provider of financial services and technology solutions, was the corporate sponsor and challenged each team to increase awareness and usage of Fiserv’s <b>person-to-person</b> digital payment <b>service,</b> Popmoney. CWU students applied in May 2013 {{to participate in the}} competition and in August 2013 conducted primary research regarding previous campaigns last summer. PRSSA National announced the campaign topic in August 2013. From September through December, the team worked cohesively on further research, planning and the campaign development, which could not be executed until February 1, 2014. The CWU campaign, GiddyUpPayUp, peaked with a 5 K run, with proceeds donated to the CWU Foundation for a PR scholarship. All of the events for the campaign were powered by Popmoney, including registration for the 5 k event.

40|$|M-PESA (a {{mobile banking}} service in Kenya) was {{introduced}} to offer a <b>person-to-person</b> money transfer <b>service.</b> Its extensive adoption and appropriation for purposes other than person-to-person transfers has influenced the technology providers (Safaricom) to widen their services beyond their original intentions. M-PESA provides {{a wide range of}} financial services including services for people who were previously unbanked. Users of M-PESA can now pay different utilities, those without credit cards can purchase products online, others can repay loans to microfinance institutions, pay insurance premiums, withdraw money from ATMs, use it as Point of Sale Payment and open savings accounts. This research examines the existence of “bi-directional” influences between technology and society by taking M-PESA business users as a case. It specifically investigates how M-PESA as a technology has influenced the business environment in Kenya and how the design of M-PESA has in turn been influenced by its adoption. The research adopts the Adaptive Structuration Theory as the theoretical framework and interpretive case study research as a methodological approach. Interviews with different stakeholders in the industry were used to collect data. Data was analyzed using Diachronic Analysis. The results of the research show that there is a “bi-directional” influence between technology and people as they affect each other over time. Mobile technologies shape the way businesses operate, allowing them to provide new services and improve existing ones. At the same time, usage and adoption trends affect the design of mobile technologies. Over time, technology is adapted to accommodate the new needs of businesses and other needs in the wider community. This research shows that the impact of technology depends not only on its functionality but also on its use and appropriation in society. Dissertation (MCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.
