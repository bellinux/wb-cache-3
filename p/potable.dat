5|$|Drinking water quality. According to {{a survey}} of the Superintendencia de Servicios Públicos Domiciliarios (SSPD) or Superintendency for Residential Public Services in 2004, 72% of the users had water of <b>potable</b> quality. In some cases, the water supply system’s {{pressure}} is not adequate, increasing the risk of bacterial contamination.|$|E
5|$|Much of the river's {{catchment}} area consists of cleared farmland with run-off captured in private dams to sustain farming over Adelaide's dry summer. Combined with the river's use for <b>potable</b> water this has greatly reduced the overall flow {{especially in the}} lower river.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative sewage {{treatment}} processes rely on microorganisms to oxidise organic constituents. Anaerobic microorganisms reduce sludge solids producing methane gas and a sterile mineralised residue. In <b>potable</b> water treatment, one method, the slow sand filter, employs a complex gelatinous layer {{composed of a}} wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.|$|E
5|$|Right {{to health}} is {{inclusive}} right extending {{not only to}} timely and appropriate health care {{but also to the}} underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and <b>potable</b> water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{commercial}} traffic ceasing in 1907, the infrastructure was maintained in good order, and the canal {{was used for}} the transport of <b>potable</b> water from 1962. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for Somerset County Council to start the restoration of the canal as a leisure facility, which was completed in 1994, when the canal was reopened throughout. Bridgwater Docks have been restored as a marina, but there is no navigable connection to the River Parrett, as the canal still transports drinking water for the people of Bridgwater.|$|E
5|$|Electricity in {{the island}} is {{supplied}} by a 0.326 MW diesel power plant of the Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO). However, electricity service is only available in early morning, from 4:00 to 6:00a.m. and at night, from 5:00 to 11:00p.m., due to limited fuel supplies. As for water supply, <b>potable</b> water for drinking and washing comes from water pumps, artesian wells, springs, and rainwater collection tanks in individual homes. The island has access to cellular phone and Internet service through Smart and Globe. Terrestrial and cable television service are also available.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{is a very}} {{important}} resource in the Sava River basin, generally used for public water supply of <b>potable</b> water, as a source of water for industrial use, but also as the mainstay of aquatic ecosystems. There are 41 identified significant groundwater bodies in the Sava River basin of basin-wide importance, ranging in area size from , as well as numerous minor ground water bodies. Even though most of them are transboundary waters, eleven are considered to be largely located in Slovenia, fourteen in Croatia, seven in Bosnia-Herzegovina, five in Serbia and four in Montenegro.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS rate in Nigeria is {{much lower}} {{compared}} to the other African nations such as Kenya or South Africa whose prevalence (percentage) rates are in the double digits. , the HIV prevalence rate among adults ages 15–49 was just 3.1 percent. , life expectancy in Nigeria is 52.62 years on average according to CIA, and just over half the population have access to <b>potable</b> water and appropriate sanitation; , the infant mortality is 8.4 deaths per 1000 live births.|$|E
5|$|Hamersley's soil is an {{infertile}} yellow-brown sand {{composed of}} fine to coarse quartz grains, with Tamala Limestone beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, {{it is almost}} certainly the leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by eolian processes in the late Pleistocene period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are Paleozoic rocks of the Perth Basin. The sand contains an unconfined aquifer with large supplies of low-salinity <b>potable</b> groundwater which is recharged by rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the protest, the JNA {{increased}} combat readiness of its garrison in Split and elsewhere in Dalmatia and withdrew a part of artillery and personnel from Split to its bases located away from the coast. Furthermore, the Military-Maritime District of the JNA ordered its garrisons to stock up <b>potable</b> water and prepare power generators for use if the supply of electricity were cut. The JNA evacuated itself from Split by 4 January 1992, pursuant to agreements ending the Battle of the Barracks.|$|E
5|$|On August 23 the Haitian {{government}} sent food, sachets of <b>potable</b> water, mattresses, and medicines to {{the town}} of Bainet in the Sud-Est department. On August 24 the Pan American Development Foundation sent food to all people living in temporary shelters and Venezuela delivered 11 tonnes of emergency food to Sud-Est in 500 family bags. Hurricane assistance was then compounded by the country's standard humanitarian assistance programs and became indistinct from the country's continued poverty crisis.|$|E
5|$|Storms of Category2 {{intensity}} often damage {{roofing material}} (sometimes exposing the roof) and inflict damage upon poorly constructed doors and windows. Poorly constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped. Mobile homes, whether anchored or not, are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed, and many manufactured homes also suffer structural damage. Small craft in unprotected anchorages may break their moorings. Extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of <b>potable</b> water are likely, possibly lasting many days.|$|E
5|$|The 21st, about 960 strong, {{boarded the}} steamer Northerner on January 6, 1862. The fleet {{transporting}} Burnside's North Carolina Expedition encountered harsh weather {{off the coast}} of Cape Hatteras. Prolonged poor weather and the shallowness of Hatteras Inlet resulted in weeks of delay as the fleet struggled to enter Pamlico Sound. Finally, just as most of the vessels began to run low on <b>potable</b> water, the fleet entered the sound and made for Roanoke Island on February 5, 1862.|$|E
5|$|The Kalimpong municipality, {{which was}} {{established}} in 1945, {{is in charge of}} the infrastructure of the town such as <b>potable</b> water and roads. The municipal area is divided into twenty-three wards. Kalimpong municipality is constructing additional water storage tanks to meet the requirement of <b>potable</b> water, and it needs an increase of water supply from the 'Neora Khola Water Supply Scheme' for this purpose. Often, landslides occurring in monsoon season cause havoc to the roads in and around Kalimpong. The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited (WBSEDCL) that provides electricity here, needs to resolve issues like voltage fluctuations, unstable electrical supply and faulty electrical meters etc. faced by people of Kalimpong. Renewable Energy Development Agency of the state has plans to promote usage of solar street lights in Kalimpong and proposed an energy park here to sell renewable energy gadgets. The Public Works Department is responsible for the road connecting the town to the National Highway–NH-31A. The Kalimpong municipality has a total of 10 health care units, with a total of 433 bed capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Kolkata Municipal Corporation {{supplies}} {{the city with}} <b>potable</b> water that is sourced from the Hooghly River; {{most of it is}} treated and purified at the Palta pumping station located in North24 Parganas district. Roughly 95% of the 4,000tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in Dhapa, which is east of the town. To promote the recycling of garbage and sewer water, agriculture in encouraged on the dumping grounds. Parts of the city lack proper sewerage, leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal.|$|E
5|$|The Somerset River Authority was {{established}} in the 1960s, and later became part of Wessex Water. Tidal models were used to explore the effects of any improvements to the river, and the likelihood of adverse consequences, i.e. flooding and subsequent silting. Engineering works were undertaken at the Parrett, King's Sedgemoor Drain, and River Brue systems, to try to ensure that the agricultural land benefited from a <b>potable</b> water supply in the groundwaters from the Quantock Hills to the coastline.|$|E
5|$|The {{rainwater}} which {{falls on}} Poh Ern Shih is collected from surface run-offs and rain gutters {{and used to}} irrigate the temple grounds, {{as well as to}} generate electricity used for charging the batteries of in-house motorised wheelchairs. The electricity is produced by water from the highest floor of the temple passing through hydroelectric-generators. A purification system is also being installed, so that the collected rainwater can be filtered and made <b>potable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under colonial rule, {{tanks were}} {{the only source of}} water in Mumbai, with many localities having been named after them. The MCGM {{supplies}} <b>potable</b> water to the city from six lakes, most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes. The Tansa lake supplies water to the western suburbs and parts of the island city along the Western Railway. The water is filtered at Bhandup, which is Asia's largest water filtration plant. India's first underground water tunnel was completed in Mumbai to supply water to the Bhandup filtration plant.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Colombia has been improved {{in many ways}} over the past decades. Between 1990 and 2010, access to improved sanitation increased from 67% to 82%, but access to improved water source's increased only slightly from 89% to 94%. In particular, coverage in rural areas lags behind. Furthermore, despite improvements, the quality of water and sanitation services remains inadequate. For example, only 73% of those receiving public services receive water of <b>potable</b> quality and in 2006 only 25% of the wastewater generated in the country underwent any kind of treatment.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Srimanthudu, police {{officers}} and district level officers adopted 523 and 606 panchayats, respectively, in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, which Deccan Herald called a feat that India's prime minister Narendra Modi Saansad Adarsh Gram scheme had failed to do. Actors, bureaucrats, and politicians also announced plans to develop the backward villages. Mahesh adopted his father Krishna native village Burripalem, a minor panchayat in Tenali, and announced a plan to address basic {{needs of the community}} such as <b>potable</b> drinking water and better roads and drainage systems. After discussing with Telangana's then Rural Development minister K. T. Rama Rao, Mahesh decided to adopt Siddhapuram, a village in Mahabubnagar district. After the film's release, many of Mahesh's fans began using eco-friendly modes of transportation.|$|E
5|$|Before {{independence}} of India, monsoon or groundwater {{were the main}} sources of irrigation. The main source of water now is Balsamand branch of Western Yamuna Canal. Municipal Corporation of Hisar supplies <b>potable</b> water to the city. The city first got electricity in 1936. Power is distributed by Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) provides landline and broadband services. Cell phone coverage is extensive, and the main service providers are Vodafone Essar, Airtel, MTNL, Reliance Communications, Idea Cellular and Tata Indicom. The planning {{of the city is}} done by Haryana Urban Development Authority.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} <b>potable</b> water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's heavy damage, {{homeless}} residents {{resided in}} temporary camps. Later, the Indian government set up 742relief centers housing 177,000people, utilizing schools and office buildings. However, residents did not stay {{for extended periods}} of time in the shelters, as rebuilding began within three days of the storm's landfall. Many of the displaced people returned to their homes after the storm receded. Workers restored water service and distributed <b>potable</b> water to those in need. Workers used cranes to remove trees from highways. Roads and communication links were quickly restored, as was the power supply. Later, damaged houses were reconstructed with tiled roofs while destroyed houses were rebuilt on concrete slabs, both to withstand stronger winds.|$|E
5|$|In Mier, the {{spillway}} of the Las Blancas Dam was overtopped, {{causing a}} river bridge {{to be destroyed}} and electric power to be lost, as well. In Río Bravo, 50families were evacuated as seven collective farms became hard to reach by road; approximately 90% of the residences in the farms were affected by the storm. In Altamira, 200families were evacuated as well, and relocated to seven shelters. Also, in the municipalities of Burgos, Cruillas, and Méndez there was flooding in collective farms and family dwellings. Overall, the municipalities of Mier, Reynosa, Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, Matamoros, San Fernando, San Carlos, Burgos, Cruillas, Méndez, Soto la Marina, Mante and Altamira were affected in the state, losing <b>potable</b> water and electricity.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to <b>potable</b> use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E
5|$|Over 80% of Chad's {{population}} {{relies on}} subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. The crops grown and {{the locations of}} herds {{are determined by the}} local climate. In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of sorghum and millet. In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered oases support only some dates and legumes. Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to <b>potable</b> water and only 2% to basic sanitation.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company were {{a company}} {{responsible}} for providing <b>potable</b> water to the inhabitants of Cambridge and the surrounding areas. In 1976, they purchased a borehole outside Sawston to deal with rising demand. In 1980, a European Directive was issued requiring nations of the European Community to establish standards {{on the presence of}} perchloroethene (PCE) in water, which the United Kingdom did in 1982. It was found that the Sawston borehole was contaminated with PCE that had originated in a tannery owned by Eastern Counties Leather. Prior to 1980, there was no knowledge that PCE should be avoided or that it could cause harm, but the Cambridge Water Company brought a case against Eastern Counties Leather anyway.|$|E
5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} killing of 133African slaves by {{the crew of}} the British slave ship Zong in the days following 29November 1781. The Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, owned the ship and sailed her in the Atlantic slave trade. As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives of the slaves as cargo. When the ship ran low on <b>potable</b> water following navigational mistakes, the crew threw slaves overboard into the sea to drown, partly in order to ensure the survival {{of the rest of the}} ship's passengers, and in part to cash in on the insurance on the slaves, thus not losing money on the slaves who would have died from the lack of drinking water.|$|E
5|$|The most {{decorated}} Australian Naval unit of World War One, however {{was not a}} ship at all, but the Royal Australian Navy Bridging Train, a land-based unit composed {{mostly of}} reservists which landed at Suvla Bay with the British IX Corps and was responsible for receiving, storing and distributing the supplies, including <b>potable</b> water, of the British troops at Suvla. Due to their position working the piers and landings at Suvla, the Train was the last Australian unit to depart the Gallipoli Peninsula. After Gallipoli, the Train {{was sent to the}} Middle East, where they made a second amphibious landing at the Battle of Magdhaba, before returning to Australia and being disbanded after a series of miscommunications during May 1917.|$|E
5|$|Their efforts {{resulted}} in a scheme where grain crops grown in the RSK-held part of Sector West were milled in the Croatian-controlled areas, and the supply of <b>potable</b> water to Pakrac was exchanged for electricity supplied from Croatia to the southern portion of Sector West. Fischer also obtained approval for the limited return of refugees from local authorities. The scheme involved up to 2,500 refugees who {{would be allowed to}} rebuild their homes, funded by the Austrian government. The funds, in the amount of 1.3million dollars, were obtained through Michael Platzer, Special Assistant to the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Vienna.|$|E
5|$|Trondheim {{is later}} {{attacked}} by a Norwegian pirate whaler named Olafsson, who has not aged despite being on the ship {{for the past two}} days. Mulder, Scully, and Trondheim eventually begin to age unnaturally. Scully develops a theory that the Ardent is sailing near a metallic object beneath the ocean, and that it has caused free radicals to rapidly oxidize their bodies and age them. When Mulder notices that the ship's sewage pipe is the only one not corroded through, the agents realize that something from the ocean contaminated the Ardents <b>potable</b> water and led to the aging; Olafsson's men remained unaffected due to their consumption of recycled water from the sewage system. Desperate to survive, Trondheim kills Olafsson after he reveals the secret, and sets out to keep the water for himself.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Dean dropped heavy {{rainfall}} across Puerto Rico, peaking at 12.7inches (322mm) in Salinas. Winds were generally light across the island. The passage of Dean resulted in widespread flooding in {{eastern and southern}} Puerto Rico, collapsing two bridges and one road. Several highways were under water, and one car was swept away by the floodwaters. The four inside the vehicle were later rescued and unharmed. Throughout the island, about 1,320houses were flooded, and two houses experienced collapsed roofs. The rains left various towns without power or water. By the night after the storm passed the island, more than 16,000 were without power, while almost 70,000 lacked <b>potable</b> water. Over 130people were evacuated from low-lying areas to hurricane shelters.|$|E
5|$|Water {{services}} used to {{be provided}} by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, which served 30% of the city with most other sewage being directly dumped into storm drains, septic tanks, or open canals. MWSS was privatized in 1997, which split the water concession into {{the east and west}} zones. The Maynilad Water Services took over the west zone of which Manila is a part. It now provides the supply and delivery of <b>potable</b> water and sewerage system in Manila, but it does not provide service to the southeastern part of the city which belongs to the east zone that is served by Manila Water. Electric services are provided by Meralco, the sole electric power distributor in Metro Manila.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, <b>potable</b> water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E
5|$|Free basic water. Inspired by the Human Right to Water, two {{important}} cities in Colombia make a basic {{amount of water}} (Minimo Vital de Agua <b>Potable)</b> available to their poorest residents free of charge. In 2009, Medellin made 2.5 cubic meters of water per month and per person - or 10 cubic meters {{for a family of}} four - available for free to all urban residents in class 1. The city wants to reach 45,000 households and has budgeted 25 billion Pesos (USD 14 million) to finance free basic water and associated awareness campaigns. In February 2012 Bogota also introduced 6 cubic meters of free basic water per household for households in classes 1 and 2, covering more than 1.5 million households or 39% of all households. The annual cost is estimated at 60 billion Pesos (USD 33 million).|$|E
