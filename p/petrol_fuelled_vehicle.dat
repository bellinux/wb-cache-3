40|$|Many {{pollutants}} are {{of importance}} for assessing the adverse impact of the air pollution, e. g. NO 2, CO, lead, VOCs and particulate matter. In addition to monitoring of traditional pollutants, measurements of benzene, toluene and xylenes {{have been carried out}} in central Copenhagen since 1994. A method to determine emissions from the actual car fleet under realistic driving conditions has been developed. The method is based on air quality measurements, traffic counts and inverse application of street air quality models. Using this method average emission factors of CO, NOx and benzene for the fleet of <b>petrol</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> was estimated for the period 1994 - 1999. The trends were related to the measures taken to reduce the emissions from vehicles, i. e. percentage of catalyst cars and fuel composition. Determination of emissions of ultrafine particles will be based on the same method. The mass of ultrafine particles is small, which means that it is not possible or at least difficult to determine the mass and the chemical composition with a high time resolution. Therefore, measurements of number size distribution of ultrafine particles were carried out by a Differential Mobility Analyser (DMA). The preliminary measurements were carried out in tw...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Compressed {{natural gas}} (CNG) {{is the most}} {{successful}} and widely used alternative fuel for vehicles in the market today. <b>Petrol</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> are fitted with natural gas vehicle (NGV) conversion kit to enable bi-fuel operation between CNG and petrol. This experimental approach {{is focused on the}} fuel consumption, exhaust emission and fuel cost between natural gas and petrol operations. The specially constructed test rig comprises of the bi-fuel fuel system employed in the 1500 cc 12 valves carburettor engine NGV taxis. The inherent fuel consumption and corresponding exhaust emission are acquired at different engine revolution per minute (rpm) during petrol and CNG operation separately. The engine rpm operating without load is varied from idle to more than 5000 rpm to acquire the fuel consumption and exhaust emission profile. These two acquired data are then used to calculate the engine’s air fuel ratio. All three parameters acquired are used to conduct comparisons between petrol and natural gas operation. It is seen that the bi-fuel system operates with air fuel ratio ranging from 19 to 16. 3 for petrol operation and ranges from 40 to 18. 7 for natural gas operations. The emission during CNG operation clearly shows significant decrease in hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) over the use of petrol. In terms of cost, the use of CNG provides savings exceeding 50 % through all engine rpm compared to petrol non-loaded operations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we report the first direct {{measurements}} of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) in the UK using a vehicle emission remote sensing technique. Measurements of NO, NO 2 and ammonia (NH 3) from almost 70, 000 vehicles were made spanning vehicle model years from 1985 to 2012. These measurements were carefully matched with detailed vehicle information data {{to understand the}} emission characteristics {{of a wide range}} of vehicles in a detailed way. Overall it is found that only <b>petrol</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> have shown an appreciable reduction in total NOx emissions over the past 15 – 20 years. Emissions of NOx from diesel vehicles, including those with after-treatment systems designed to reduce emissions of NOx, have not reduced over the same period of time. It is also evident that the vehicle manufacturer has a strong influence on emissions of NO 2 for Euro 4 / 5 diesel cars and urban buses. Smaller-engined Euro 4 / 5 diesel cars are also shown to emit less NO 2 than larger-engined vehicles. It is shown that NOx emissions from urban buses fitted with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are comparable to those using Exhaust Gas Recirculation for Euro V vehicles, while reductions in NOx of about 30 % are observed for Euro IV and EEV vehicles. However, the emissions of NO 2 vary widely dependent on the bus technology used. Almost all the NOx emission from Euro IV buses with SCR is in the form of NO, whereas EEV vehicles (Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle) emit about 30 % of the NOx as NO 2. We find similarly low amounts of NO 2 from trucks (3. 5 – 12 t and > 12 t). Finally, we show that NH 3 emissions are most important for older generation catalyst-equipped petrol vehicles and SCR-equipped buses. The NH 3 emissions from petrol cars have decreased by over a factor of three from the vehicles manufactured in the late 1990 s compared with those manufactured in 2012. Tables of emission factors are presented for NOx, NO 2 and NH 3 together with uncertainties to assist the development of new emission inventories...|$|R
40|$|Diesel engines {{represent}} a significant {{fraction of the}} light duty vehicle fleet in the UK and Europe. Their emission characteristics differ vastly from <b>Petrol</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> and the lean burn characteristics of diesel engines that make them so desirable for fuel consumption also lead to many problems relating to the emissions of pollutants. The presence of excess oxygen from the lean burn in the exhaust plume compared to traditional petrol engines operating at stoichiometric air-fuel mix levels means that the reduction reactions used in Three-Way Catalysts (TWCs), so successful at removing {{the vast majority of}} pollutants from petrol engines, are comparatively ineffective for Oxidised Nitrogen (collectively NOX) compound removal in lean burn engines. Diesel engines also emit a complex particulate matter component in their exhaust plumes containing a volatile organic fraction as well as solid organic material, often with one adsorbed onto the other. All of these factors mean that control systems for diesel emissions are far more complicated than for petrol (Johnson, 2006). The short-term health impacts of exposure to air pollution are significant, with research consistently showing the negative impacts of exposure. Vehicle emissions are also cited as a significant contributor to air pollution (WHO, 2005). Exposure to species contained in diesel emissions such as NO 2, particulate matter, Benzene and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons are of special concern and therefore effective control systems are required. A NOX Storage and Removal (NSR) catalyst aims to store the NOX as a nitrate under lean burn conditions and periodically remove it under rich burn conditions managed by the engine control unit (Matsumoto, Ikeda, Suzuki, Ogai, & Miyoshi, 2000). During lean burn periods the NO is oxidized over a Platinum catalyst to create NO 2. The resultant NO 2 is captured by forming compounds containing Barium, for example BaO is often used alongside Pt. During the short rich burning periods of operation, the NOx is released from the Barium and reacts with hydrocarbons to produce N 2, H 2 O and CO 2 (Olsson & Fridell, 2002). Furthermore, an Oxidation catalyst (DOC) is used to remove CO and HC in the exhaust. The reactions in the DOC also remove the volatile organic fractions adsorbed onto the solid organic soot compounds (Walker, 2004). Adsorption of molecules onto the catalyst occurs during periods of lean burn engine operation and the molecules are removed during short periods of rich burn operation, regenerating the catalyst and allowing it to work at full efficiency again. The rich burn process is typically controlled by the engine control unit (Lapuerta, Hernandez, & Oliva, 2014). Catalysts in Diesel vehicles suffer from a lack of self-heating, means that even if a catalyst reaches light-off temperature it may later cool to a point that it is no longer effective at removing pollution from the exhaust gas (Herreros, Gill, Lefort, Tsolakis, Millington, & Moss, 2014). The number and contribution of these cold start and cold operation emission sources is not currently fully understood...|$|R

One of the main sources of the pollutants is emissions from motor vehicles, which is originated from incomplete fuel combustion; either diesel or gasoline.

While the problem is more intense in the developed countries, in which the transportation sector is responsible for approximately twenty five to {{forty percent of the}} overall greenhouse emissions, the developing world is following suit. Recent trends indicate an increasing demand for automobiles, in these countries, with potentially dire environmental consequences for the planet. Meeting the growing demand for personal mobility and transport of goods in a sustainable way represents a wide range of interrelated technological and public policy challenges. A number of strategies for fulfilling sustainability targets impose improvements in vehicle technology and fuels. Alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> offer hope for drastic reductions in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. One the most important challenges regarding alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> is devising strategies that will lead to the success of these vehicles in the market. In this respect, an important dimension is to understand household preferences regarding certain vehicle characteristics, fuel availability and policies affecting a vehicle’s end price. Since alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> are not widely available, researchers resort to innovative approaches for assessing their demand. One such method is known as stated choices. The method uses experimental design to create sets of hypothetical vehicle options using a number of vehicle attributes. This paper describes a framework for assessing the demand for alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> and its application to the Census Metropolitan Area of Hamilton, Canada. Data collection is conducted using contemporary internet-based surveying techniques and respondents are recruited via e-mail. The overall procedure involves two stages.

A second stage in the survey employs the stated choices experiment where respondents choose the vehicle they would most likely buy from a hypothetical set of vehicles that use gasoline, a mix of fuels (hybrid) or an alternative fuel. Results from this study will contribute to scenario building with the purpose of examining the implications of policies, regarding the potential contribution of alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> to emission reduction objectives and the sustainability of the transportation system...|$|R

Acetaldehyde emissions were estimated to increase by 233 % for a full implementation of bioethanol (E 85 -vehicles) compared to the baseline (petrol/diesel vehicles), whereas CO 2, NOx and exhaust particle emissions from traffic were estimated to decrease by 19 %, 50 % and 90 %, respectively.

The NDPF elements were arranged in line with 1 cm spacing inside an enclosed casing. The NDPF showed potential as DPF to curb soot emissions. Pressure drop for the NDPF was in the range of 89 % - 93 % at every given flow rate during pressure drop test. Effective soot reduction was in the range of 60 % - 70 %. As predicted, trapped soot were accumulated mostly at the front and middle of NDPF. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive xray (EDX) analysis confirmed the trapping ability of carbon elements in the range of 19 % - 70 % for each filter. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) was slightly affected when NDPF was installed in the exhaust system and resulted to drops in engine efficiency in the range of 2 % - 26 %. Nevertheless, further reinforcement steps for the NDPF are needed to prolong its filtering capacity...|$|R
30|$|To {{widen the}} {{acceptance}} of AFVs, these studies suggest that policymakers should act on the environmental concerns by issuing educational campaigns to raise awareness about the features and benefits of AFVs [31, 32, 65]. In this respect, consumers seem to react more to emission information (eco-labelling) at the vehicle level than at the class level [60]. In addition, tax incentives (e.g., surcharge of dirtier fuels, differentiation of vehicle taxes based on fuel economy or CO 2 emissions), subsidies or private privileges (e.g., free parking) should make these vehicles more financially competitive as compared to conventionally <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> [32, 65]. Finally, {{the availability of a}} refuelling or recharging network could be ensured by the deployment of public charging stations, which is likely to be facilitated by the involvement and cooperation between all major stakeholders [31].|$|R
