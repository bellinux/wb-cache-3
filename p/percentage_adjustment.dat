The adjustment automatically takes effect unless (1) Congress statutorily prohibits the adjustment; (2) Congress statutorily revises the adjustment; or (3) the annual base pay adjustment of General Schedule (GS) federal employees is established at a rate less than the scheduled increase for Members, in which case the <b>percentage</b> <b>adjustment</b> for Member pay is automatically lowered to match the <b>percentage</b> <b>adjustment</b> in GS base pay. In the past, Member pay has been frozen statutorily in two ways: (1) directly, through legislation that freezes salaries for Members but not other federal employees, and (2) indirectly, through broader pay freeze legislation that covers Members and other specified categories of federal employees. Under the formula, Members may not receive an annual pay adjustment greater than 5 %. This adjustment formula was established by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. An analysis was performed between a WSR- 88 D's precipitation estimation capability and a rain gauge network. The WSR- 88 D is located in League City, TX, and the rain gauge network is in Harris County, TX. Relevant data were collected for nine different case events. These events were classified into one of three weather system classifications. The classifications were based on two criteria, synoptic conditions and the storms radar signature. Radar data were collected from five levels above the surface. These levels included 1. 0 1. 5 @ 2. 0 @ 2. 5 km, and 3. 0 km. Radar precipitation estimates were calculated at each 1. 4 2 level using Z = 30 ORand Z = 25 OR". The precipitation amounts, as measured by both the gauges and the radar,were used to calculate corresponding differences between the amounts. Two percentage adjustments for each Z-R relationship were calculated to account for these differences. The first <b>percentage</b> <b>adjustment</b> was a constant weighted mean <b>percentage</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and the second a linear <b>percentage</b> <b>adjustment.</b> In general, for all nine cases, the 30 OR 1. 4 was an underestimate of rainfall, and the 25 OR" 2 was an overestimate of rainfall. The 30 OR 1. 4 had an optimum estimation accuracy for the lower precipitation amounts, whereas the 25 OR 1, 2 had an optimum accuracy for the higher precipitation amounts. The organized convection class was well supported by the data as a unique identifiable classification, and the most accurate radar estimates were derived using Z = 30 OR 1. 4 linear percentage adjustments. The unorganized convection class and the stratiform with isolated convection class were strongly classified only after being combined into one class. For this combined class, the Z = 25 OR 1. 2 linear percentage adjustments produced optimum radar estimates of precipitation...|$|E

40|$|Long term axial {{shortening}} {{in a tall}} concrete structure is a second-order effect that is of some impediment to the serviceability, and in some cases, structural integrity of the building. The research here involves analysis of {{axial shortening}} elements that interact through framing action. In many tall concrete buildings framing is inherent as columns, beams and floors are quite often connected with rigid connections. The mechanics of differential axial shortening and framing action due to rigid connections causes load sharing between vertical elements that fundamentally affects the degree of both absolute and differential axial shortening. Evaluation of axial shortening by analysis of a structural system consisting of discrete elements over-predicts the level of axial shortening when framing is present. A methodology to calculate axial shortening, accounting for load sharing of axial loads for tall concrete buildings, is developed. The application of this methodology {{to the construction of}} a tall concrete building allowing for the building cycle is presented. A program is written that incorporates both the methodology and its application to a tall building, using the ACT concrete creep and shrinkage models. Correlation of the program is made against an existing previously tested program that does not allow for framing action. A comparison is made between the two sets of data for an actual 85 storey building. From this it is concluded that; i) Framing action reduces the differential axial shortening between two elements ii) The core generally experiences less change to axial shortening than columns iii) The effect of framing cannot be estimated by a relative <b>percentage</b> <b>adjustment</b> applied uniformly to each storey...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: This {{study is}} {{highlighted}} on a restoration scheme proposed against failure in working {{line at the}} drop region for Fiber-To-The Home (FTTH) with a Passive Optical Network (PON). Whereas PON {{is a system that}} brings optical fiber cable and signals all or most of {{the way to the end}} user. In this study we highlighted the issue on survivability scheme against failure which is focused scattered residence architectures. Approach: Two types of restoration scheme are proposed by means of linear protection (tree) and migrate protection (ring). Our proposed scheme is inexpensive and applicable to any residence architecture (ordered placement and scattered placement). The advantage of this scheme is the failure at fiber line can be recovered until two levels to make sure the optic signals flow continuously. FTTH based network design is simulated by using OptiSystem 7. 0 in order to investigate the power output and BER performance at each node in the tree and ring protection scheme in scattered placement to prove the system feasibility. Results: The simulation analysis for output power in a linear protection path produced almost the same output power for all optical nodes regardless of the position and situation of the node. In linear protection, signal is split by optical splitter and did not having loss of power at each node. Thus the <b>percentage</b> <b>adjustment</b> on the coupling is obtained where; the average output power measured at the receiver is at - 28. 4206 dBm. While the signal for ring path is optimized by adjusting the loss ratio (n%) and transmit it (1 -n%) in the optical coupler. Also found that; an average output power is - 23 dBm only. A simulation of distance accessibility is increased with the increasing of sensitivity that used for the linear path and ring path. Conclusion: This study suggests the migration of tree to ring topology to enable the signal flow continuously in the case of failure occurs specifically in random or scattered placement topology. Our proposal is the first reported up to this time in which the upstream signal flows in anticlockwise in ring topology when the restoration scheme activated...|$|E

One and three water-stress preconditioning cycles were imposed by withholding water, and the subsequent adjustment in solute potential upon relief of the stress and complete rehydration was monitored with thermocouple psychrometers. Both leaves and roots exhibited a substantial adjustment in Ïˆs in response to water stress with the former exhibiting the larger absolute adjustment. The osmotic adjustment of leaves was 0. 41 megapascal compared to 0. 19 megapascal in the roots. The roots, however, exhibited much larger <b>percentage</b> osmotic <b>adjustments</b> of 46 and 63 % in the one and three stress cycles, respectively, compared to 22 and 40 % in the leaves in similar stress cycles. The osmotically adjusted condition of leaves and roots decreased after relief of the single cycle stress to about half the initial value within 3 days, and to the well-watered control level within 6 days.

MethodsWe adjusted BRFSS mammography use data for age by using 2000 census estimates and for misclassification by using the following formula: (estimated prevalence âˆ’ 1 + specificity) / (sensitivity + specificity âˆ’ 1). We used values {{reported in the literature}} for the formula (sensitivity = 0. 97 for both black and white women, specificity = 0. 49 and 0. 62, respectively, for black and white women). ResultsAfter adjustment for misclassification, the percentage of women aged 40 years or older in 1995 who reported receiving a mammogram during the previous 2 years was 54 % among white women and 41 % among black women, compared with 70 % among both white and black women after adjustment for age only.

Indeed, {{there is a wide}} concern to the fact that an inefficient water management system may become one of the major drawbacks for a human-centered sustainable development process. The assessment of reservoir water quality is constrained due to geographic considerations, the number of parameters to be considered and the huge financial resources needed to get such data. Under these circumstances, the modeling of water qual- ity in reservoirs is essential in the resolution of environmental problems and has lately been asserting itself as a relevant tool for a sustainable and harmonious progress of the populations. The analysis and development of forecast models, based on Artificial Intelligence-based tools and the new methodologies for problem solv- ing, has proven to be an alternative, having in mind a pro-active behavior that may contribute decisively to diagnose, preserve, and rehabilitate the reservoirs. In particular, this work describes the training, validation and application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Decision Trees (DTs) to forecast the water quality of the Odivelas reservoir, in Portugal, over a period of 10 years.

The analysis examines the impact of SP on disaggregated labor market decisions, taking into account that program coverage depends not only on the individual's employment status, but also on that of other household members. The identification strategy relies on the variation in SP's rollout across municipalities and time, with the difference-in-difference estimation controlling for household fixed effects. The paper finds that SP lowers formality by 0. 4 - 0. 7 <b>percentage</b> points, with <b>adjustments</b> largely occurring within a few years of the program's introduction. Rather than encouraging exit from the formal sector, SP is associated with a 3. 1 percentage point reduction (a 20 percent decline) in the inflow of workers into formality.

We examined how birth weight was related to adult body size, body composition and grip strength. Design/subjects:Cross-sectional study on 928 men and 1075 women born in 1934 - 1944, with measurements at birth recorded. Measurements:Height, weight, waist and hip circumference and isometric grip strength were measured. Lean and fat body mass were estimated by bioelectrical impedance with an eight-polar tactile electrode system. Results:A 1 kg increase in birth weight corresponded in men to a 4. 1 kg (95 % CI: 3. 1, 5. 1) and in women to a 2. 9 kg (2. 1, 3. 6) increase in adult lean mass. This association remained significant after adjustment for age, adult body size, physical activity, smoking status, social class and maternal size. Grip strength was positively related to birth weight through its association with lean mass. The positive association of birth weight with adult BMI was explained by its association with lean mass. Low birth weight was related to higher body fat <b>percentage</b> only after <b>adjustment</b> for adult BMI. Abdominal obesity was not predicted by low birth weight.

40|$|Abstract n. Âº 82 The {{water quality}} {{at ground zero}} in a given region largely depends on the nature {{and the extent of}} the industrial, {{agricultural}} and other anthropogenic activities in the catchments. Undeniably, ensuring an efficient water management system is a major goal in contemporary societies, taking into account its importance to the living organisms health and the need to safeguard and to promote its sustainable use. However, the assessment of the data quality of a dam`s water is being done through analytical methods, which may be not a good way of such an accomplishment, due to the distances to be covered, the number of parameters to be considered and the financial resources that will be spent. Under these circumstances, the modelling of water quality in reservoirs is essential in the resolution of environmental problems, and has lately been asserting itself as a relevant tool for a sustainable and harmonious progress of the populations. This work describes the training, validation and application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Decision Trees (DTs) to forecast the water quality of the Odivelas reservoir, in the south region of Portugal, over a period of 10 (ten) years. Two different strategies were followed to build predictive models for water quality. One of them used chemical parameters data (strategy A) while the other one used hydrometric and meteorological data (strategy B). In terms of the former strategy, the input variables of the ANN model are Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Oxidability and Total Suspended Solids (TSS), while for the DTs one the inputs is, in addition to those used by ANNs, the Water Conductivity and the Temperature. The performance of the models, evaluated according to the coincidence matrix, created by matching the predicted and actual values, are very similar for both models; the <b>percentage</b> of <b>adjustments</b> relative to the number of presented cases is 98, 8 % for the training set and 97, 4 % for the testing one. Following the strategy B, the input variables of the ANN model are humidity, wind speed, air temperature, precipitation, radiation, volume of water stored in reservoir and the pH, while for the DT model the inputs are pH, wind speed, precipitation, humidity and air temperature. The performance of the models, evaluated in terms of the coincidence matrix, are 91, 1 % for the training set and 91, 7 % for the testing one for the ANN model and 89, 3 % and 88, 0 % for the DT model...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that visual {{perception}} of the take-off board and the subsequent regulation of the approach run occur 4 - 5 strides prior to take-off. Contrast in visual perception {{is determined by the}} difference in colour and occurs when a surface of one colour induces its antagonist colour in an adjoining surface. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if colour contrast between the track surface and the board affects the stride regulation pattern at the long jump approach run. Four long jumpers performed long jumps in two different occasions: 6 from a runway track coloured blue, with a white take-off board and 6 from a modified yellow board. The runway was marked and the approach runs were recorded with a panning camera. Toe- board distance (TBD) for each support phase in every run-up and the <b>percentage</b> distribution of <b>adjustment</b> of the regulated strides was calculated. With the white take-off board, the average TBD variability reached its peak value (21. 74 cm) on the 5 th stride from the board and at a distance of 9. 77 m from take-off point. With the yellow take-off board the average TBD variability culminated (24. 80 cm) on the 7 th stride from the board and at a distance of 13. 40 m from take-off point. With the white board, 80 % of the adjustment was distributed during the last two strides as opposed to 61 % with the yellow board. When a take-off board of a colour complementary to the runwayâ€™s blue track surface is used, athletes initiated their regulation 2 strides earlier. This may be attributed to an enhanced visual perception of the approaching target allowing a more uniform distribution of adjustments during the last two strides of the approach...|$|R
