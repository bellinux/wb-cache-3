40|$|Abstract: Present {{days the}} firms {{have to face}} the {{increasing}} competition, difficult economic conditions and an increasing need for major investments. In these circumstances, even the well managed and highly profitable businesses have limited options for financing growth or strengthening their equity resources. In these conditions, alternative forms of financing such as mezzanine finance {{are becoming more and more}} a supplement to the traditional forms of corporate financing. Mezzanine is a type of financing that combines elements of debt and equity financing, a hybrid construct that makes use of various longstanding instruments. The most important mezzanine financing instruments include: subordinated loans, participating loans, <b>profit</b> <b>participation</b> <b>rights,</b> convertible bonds and bonds with warrants. A common feature of the various instruments is that they can be structured flexibly in many different forms in order to provide solutions for the specific financing requirements of private and listed companies.

40|$|We study {{managerial}} compensation {{schemes for}} situations, where the current management {{knows more about}} the company's expected profitability than the new employee. When a manager is offered a contract with only a low fixed salary but a high <b>profit</b> <b>participation,</b> he is afraid that the company's profit outlook may be quite bad. Employers are aware of this. In equilibrium high profit employers offer their new managers high fixed salaries and low <b>profit</b> <b>participations.</b> They thereby credibly signal to their new managers, that they are high profit types. Low profit firms {{on the other hand}} will offer contracts with high <b>profit</b> <b>participations</b> and low fixed wages.

40|$|The European Courts have {{maintained}} a restrictive approach to <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> in EU administrative procedures. The {{right to be}} heard is primarily recognised to addressees of unfavourable administrative decisions or, at any rate, to those directly and individually concerned by them. As such, its scope is limited to procedures leading up to the adoption of individual decisions. In this book chapter, it is argued that the limits set by the European Courts, in particular the principled exclusion of <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> from rulemaking procedures, lead to a mismatch between the powers exerted by the EU administration and the procedural guarantees that are recognised to the persons affected. Furthermore, these limits are unjustifiable {{in the light of the}} rationales of <b>participation</b> <b>rights,</b> as these have been interpreted by the European Courts. In contrast to the Courts’ stance, the author puts forward criteria that may lead to the recognition of <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> in a way that better suits the requirements of the rule of law and a paradigm of EU administrative law that is respectful of the rights and legally protected interests of the citizens. In addition, the restrictive legal approach to <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> contrasts with the increased resort to participation in EU governance. This book chapter also highlights the contrast between the scope and meaning of more political forms of participation, on the one hand, and <b>participation</b> <b>rights,</b> on the other, and argues that a broader recognition of <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> contributes to bridging the distance between the configuration of participation in the political realm, on the one hand, and in the legal realm, on the other...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{conventional}} wisdom that markets should allocate the rights for performing decisional tasks to those players who might be best suited to perform the task. We embed the decisional tasks in a stylised setting of a game, motivated by Littlewood (1953) Red Hat Puzzle, where the optimal choices in the game require players to employ logical and epistemological reasoning. We present a treatment where players are permitted to trade their <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> to the game. The payoffs are furthermore calibrated such that those players who know the optimal choices in the game should value the <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> strictly more than those who do not. However, aggregated performances in this treatment were found to be significantly lower than the control treatments where players were not permitted to trade their <b>participation</b> <b>rights,</b> providing little support for {{the conventional wisdom}}. We show that this finding could be attributed to price “bubbles” in the markets for <b>participations</b> <b>rights.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Provides a {{detailed}} analysis of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance case law on the right to be heard in adjudicatory and rulemaking procedures, including a critical discussion of seminal cases * Presents a critical overview of participation in EU governance, from the early years of integration to the EU post-Lisbon * Develops a powerful legal argument for the extension of <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> in EU law, to offer better protection to those affected by European regulation * Offers a legal insight into matters usually studied by political scientists, contrasting the perspective of the courts on participation with the broader perspective of the political process The limited scope of participation in the making of EU law remains a continued source of controversy, featuring prominently in recent institutional and political developments that have been shaping the EU's constitutional framework - most intensely in the follow up of the Commission's White Paper on Governance. Yet little {{attention has been paid to}} <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> as a means of ensuring the procedural protection of persons affected by EU regulation in its diverse forms. This is a dimension of the rule of law that has been largely ignored by EU legislative and judicial bodies. Not only the legislator, but also the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance tend to adhere to excessively formal conceptions of <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> that are premised on the right to be heard in individual procedures, as well as to a restrictive view regarding the relationships between the citizens and the administration. This book shows why, in the face of new regulatory developments, these conceptions are currently inadequate to ensure the legal protection of rights and interests affected by EU regulation. Combining a conceptual analysis with thorough empirical scrutiny, this book assesses the scope of <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> in EU law against their rationales and underlying legal values. It makes a case for the extension of <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> to new situations and new types of procedures, in particular those that would generally fall within the category of rulemaking. It brings distinct normative insights into a crucial theme of EU administrative law, and makes a topical and timely contribution to the increasingly notable theme of public participation in EU regulation. 1 : Introduction 2 : Unravelling participation: a rights-based approach 3 : <b>Participation</b> beyond procedural <b>rights</b> 4 : EU administrative action, procedural guarantees and participation 5 : <b>Participation</b> <b>rights</b> in EU administrative rulemaking 6 : The 'Lamfalussy process': consultation and <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> 7 : <b>Participation</b> <b>rights</b> in food law 8 : <b>Participation</b> <b>rights</b> in state aid 9 : ConclusionsPublished version of EUI PhD thesis, 200...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{concentrates}} {{on the topic of}} legal position of a child and his or her <b>participation</b> <b>rights.</b> It is drawn as a comparative study and focuses on comparing the legislation concerning <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> of the child in the Russian Federation and the Czech Republic. The main goal of the thesis is to find identical or similar elements in the legislation regarding the child's legal position and his/her <b>participation</b> <b>rights.</b> Adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 was followed by a changed approach of its member states towards the legal position of the child. States enlisted provisions into their legislation that held a child not only as a passive holder of rights but an active subject that is able to exercise those rights after fulfilling legal conditions. The important aspect on which the thesis also focuses is assessing whether the <b>participation</b> <b>rights</b> of a child are really being applied in practice or they are up to the present day rather a theoretical construction. The thesis is divided into an introduction, four main chapters, which are further divided into subsections, and a conclusion. The first chapter deals with fundamental terms, which are crucial in relation to the legal position of a child and his/her <b>participation</b> <b>rights.</b> Firstly, a definition of "a child" is [...] ...|$|R
