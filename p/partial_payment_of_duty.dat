The availability of FFPs was assessed by surveying individuals with questions such as “Are you entitled to receive to paid leave?” and “Are you entitled to receive childcare expenses?” Respondents were asked to answer ‘yes’ if they can apply to a certain family-friendly program and ‘no’ if they cannot, or the respondent answered “I don’t know”. The responses were dummy coded into 0 [*]=[*]no and 1 [*]=[*]yes.|$|R
50|$|All goods {{deposited}} in a warehouse, without <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> {{on the first}} importation, upon being entered for home consumption, are chargeable with existing duties on like goods under any customs acts in force {{at the time of}} passing such entry (section 19). The act also prescribes various rules for the unshipping, landing, examination, warehousing and custody of goods, and the penalties on breach. The system of warehousing has proved of great advantage both to importers and purchasers, as the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> is deferred until the goods are required, while the title deeds, or warrants, are transferable by endorsement.|$|R

50|$|It {{is common}} for the {{installment}} <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> the purchase price {{to be similar to}} mortgage payments in amount and effect. The amount is often determined according to a mortgage amortization schedule. In effect, each installment <b>payment</b> is <b>partial</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> the purchase price and <b>partial</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> interest on the unpaid purchase price. This is similar to mortgage payments which are part repayment of the principal amount of the mortgage loan and part interest. As the buyer pays more toward the principal of the loan over time, his(her) equity (equitable title or equitable interest) in the property increases. For example, if a buyer pays a $2000 down payment and borrows $8000 for a $10000 parcel of land, and pays off in installments another $4000 of this loan (not including interest), the buyer has $6000 of equity in the land (which is 60% of the equitable title), but the seller holds legal title to the land as recorded in documentation (deeds) in a government recorder's office until the loan is completely paid off. However, if the buyer defaults on installment payments, the land contract may consider the failure to timely pay installments a breach of contract and the land equity may revert to the seller, depending on the land contract provisions.|$|R
