50|$|Addresses in {{the city}} limits of Des <b>Plaines</b> have their own {{numbering}} system. Areas in unincorporated Maine Township have Des <b>Plaines</b> postal addresses that follow the Chicago numbering system. Devon Avenue in Des <b>Plaines</b> is 3200 South, while it is 6400 North in Chicago. Golf Road runs through a large unincorporated area as 9600 North with a Des <b>Plaines</b> mailing address but is 0 North/South when entering the Des <b>Plaines</b> city limits. As sections become incorporated, they take on the city numbering system. For instance in 2003, land at 9661 West Golf Road, Des <b>Plaines,</b> became 2323 East Golf Road, Des <b>Plaines,</b> when it was formally incorporated into the city limits. The largest unincorporated areas are in the O'Hare area and east of the Tri-State Tollway.|$|R

5|$|The current {{whereabouts}} of the holotype beak are unknown. It may be specimen UMZC 575, a rostrum {{that was sent}} from Milne-Edwards to the English zoologist Alfred Newton after 1880, which matches the drawing and description in Milne-Edwards' paper, but this cannot be confirmed. In 1893 the ornithologists Edward Newton (brother of Alfred) and Hans Gadow described more fossils of the Rodrigues parrot, including a skull and limb bones. Remains of the species are scarce, and subfossils have been discovered in caves on the <b>Plaine</b> Corail and in Caverne Tortue.|$|E
5|$|E. Newton {{noted that}} he had {{expected}} the male would be adorned with a red patch on the wing, but {{that the absence of}} this indicated it was immature. He still found it more beautiful than the female. These two specimens are the only preserved individuals of the species. The mandible and sternum were extracted from the female specimen, and subfossil remains have since been found in the <b>Plaine</b> Corail caverns on Rodrigues. The genus Palaeornis was later declared a junior synonym of Psittacula, and all species within the former were transferred to the latter. The genus name Psittacula is derived from the Latin words Psittacus, which means parrot, and -ula, which is a diminutive suffix.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of April 6, 2002, a grease fire {{broke out in the}} Hardee's {{restaurant}} at the Belle <b>Plaine</b> service plaza. Exacerbated by heavy winds, the fire destroyed the building, which also contained a travel information center. Four fire departments responded to the scene. The assistant fire chief and fire chief of the Wellington Fire Department gave conflicting statements on whether the unavailability of the Wellington water tower, which had been emptied while it was being repainted, had hampered efforts to extinguish the blaze. The fire burned for three hours, with hot spots still smoldering the following day. No injuries were reported. The fire caused $2 million in damages. The service plaza was rebuilt, with a reopening celebration occurring on July 24, 2003.|$|E

25|$|The Rigole de la <b>plaine</b> carries {{water from}} the Sor tapped from an offtake at Pont Crouzet for {{irrigation}} before emptying into the Canal du Midi. In addition individual samples are collected from the water on the area between Revel and the seuil de Naurouze. In 1980 the Lac de la Ganguise was built near Castelnaudary providing a water reserve of 22 million m3. In 2005 the dam was raised to reach a capacity of 44 million cubic metres. Near the old basin of Naurouze the Naurouze pumping station helps to regulate {{the water in the}} Canal du Midi and the lake. An underground pipe, the gallery of Mandore, provides the Naurouze with additional {{water from the}} Rigole de la <b>plaine</b> to Lake Ganguise. Conversely, during the dry season, Lake Ganguise can supply the Canal du Midi if the water supply of the Rigole de la <b>plaine</b> is not enough.|$|E

50|$|At some point, Alton {{successor}} Illinois Central Gulf Railroad (ICG) {{sold the}} line between <b>Plaines</b> and Pequot to the Santa Fe for continued use as a second main track.

Ownership is now split among CM&W successor Union Pacific Railroad (from Joliet {{part of the way}} to <b>Plaines,</b> as the <b>Plaines</b> Industrial Lead), ICG successor Illinois Central Railroad (the rest of the way to <b>Plaines,</b> also known as the <b>Plaines</b> Industrial Lead), and Santa Fe successor BNSF Railway (<b>Plaines</b> to Pequot, as one track of the Chillicothe Subdivision), and the Union Pacific again (from Pequot to Mazonia, as the Pequot Subdivision).

25|$|America officially {{entered the}} Vietnam War {{as a result}} of the Gulf of Tonkin {{incident}} on 4 August 1964. There was a prompt escalation of RLAF activities and losses as a result. Ambassador Unger pressured the RLAF to strike communist forces on the <b>Plaine</b> des Jarres and the Ho Chi Minh trail by presenting the Royalist government with a list of targets that he wanted the RLAF to hit. Losses escalated. A T-28 was shot down by Vietnamese 37mm anti-aircraft guns on 14 August. On 18 August 1964, Lieutenant Colonel Viripong, commander of the RTAF's 223rd Squadron, went down in an RLAF T-28 on the <b>Plaine</b> des Jarres while on an unauthorized mission, while another T-28 was lost in North Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Some 6,500 Royal Lao Army {{troops out}} of its 30,000 {{personnel}} were surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces. Because Laos was a nation with a nearly nonexistent road network, the RLAF's first mission was aerial resupply of these besieged troops. The French air crews operated the transports while Laotians were being trained. The first aggressive action by the new air force was the aerial movement of Royalist troops to the <b>Plaine</b> de Jarres in early 1955. These Royalist ground troops on the <b>Plaine</b> de Jarres {{became part of the}} air bridge resupply effort. In late 1955, 22 Lao students departed to France and Morocco for aviation training. One of these cadets was Thao Ma, an ex-paratrooper who later rose to command the Royal Lao Air Force.|$|E
