50|$|Larvae {{continue}} this central place foraging behavior until {{they leave the}} tree as prepupates to solitarily excavate a <b>pupation</b> <b>chamber</b> in the soil, where they pupate.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} instars {{and the length}} of the life cycle are not known, but in captivity, some larvae lived for over two years without feeding. Some larvae reared by M. K. Thayer moulted twice before pupating. The cocoon was {{surrounded}} by a silken net connecting {{the two sides of the}} narrow <b>pupation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The beetle emerged after about six weeks.|$|E
50|$|The eggs hatch {{after about}} two weeks and the first instar larvae search out Colorado potato beetle larvae that are about to pupate. They may follow an odour trail {{left behind by the}} {{burrowing}} larvae and they need to reach the <b>pupation</b> <b>chamber</b> before it is sealed. They sink their mandibles into the integument of their hosts and start feeding, killing the host in the process. After moulting they cease feeding and soon metamorphose into the pupal stage. Adult ground beetles emerge about three weeks after the eggs were hatched.|$|E
50|$|When {{they have}} {{completed}} their development, the larvae tunnel {{away from each}} other individually and create <b>pupation</b> <b>chambers</b> in which they pupate. When the adult insects emerge, they drill their way to the surface and disperse. In Florida, breeding takes place at any time of year, and there may be three overlapping generations. The beetle can act as a vector for the blue stain fungus, carrying it from one tree to another. A European predatory beetle, Rhizophagus grandis, that normally preys on the related great spruce bark beetle, has been found experimentally to be attracted to the frass produced by the black turpentine beetle larvae. Biological control using this predator is being investigated, with a batch of beetles imported from Belgium being released in Louisiana in 1988.|$|R
50|$|Adult Hylobius transversovittatus beetles {{emerge in}} the spring from the soil or leaf litter {{where they have been}} overwintering. They feed on the leaves of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and are mostly nocturnal. Their {{presence}} is evidenced by the ragged edges to leaves caused by their chewing. They are most active from June to August and may live for several years. The females lay about 200 eggs over a period of two to three months with each being deposited singly near the roots of purple loosestrife or occasionally on the stem. On hatching, the soil-laid larvae feed on root hairs before burrowing their way into the root where they feed on tissue within the woody rootstock. Stem-laid larvae tunnel into the stem and work their way down to the root. Larval development may be interrupted by periods of flooding and resume when the water level falls. The larvae undergo two moults over a period of one to two years before forming <b>pupation</b> <b>chambers</b> in {{the upper part of the}} root. They then moult again and become pupae. When metamorphosis is complete, the adult beetles chew their way out, usually emerging between July and October. The weevils can overwinter in any of their life stages, as eggs, larvae, pupae or adults.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Ageratina ixiocladon. They induce galls {{near the}} apex of the stem of their host plant, near the nodes. The galls are globose or {{slightly}} elongate and about 6 mm wide and 7-18 mm long. Most of the frass is ejected outside of the gall <b>chamber.</b> <b>Pupation</b> takes place within or outside the gall chamber.|$|R
5000|$|Eggs {{are placed}} on diet cubes or host plants. The eggs hatch and develop at {{different}} speeds depending on temperature. The larvae are moved to fresh diet or leaves as their food spoils or is consumed. When they start to [...] "wander", {{they are about to}} pupate, so are placed in a <b>pupation</b> <b>chamber.</b> Pupation chambers are holes drilled into a wood board. The Manduca larvae are sealed in the chamber using a stopper and allowed to pupate. After pupation, the pupae are placed in a breeding or colony chamber to eclose. Providing a cup of sugar water and a tobacco (or related) plant will allow mated females to oviposit fertile eggs, which can then be reared.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Dichanthelium dichotomum. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. They mine a small basal leaf in the spring, eating out almost the entire {{substance}} of the leaf. Just before pupation, it enters one of the lower stem leaves, in which it makes a small inconspicuous mine, scarcely larger than the larva, but broadening at its anterior end towards {{the tip of the}} leaf, slightly inflated, and showing us a convexity on the upper surface of the leaf. Within this cavity, which is silk-lined, pupation takes place. Beyond the <b>pupation</b> <b>chamber,</b> the mines extends a short distance forwards, but is scarcely visible except at its end, where the epidermis is almost eaten through, permitting the emergence of the imago. Adults fly in June and July in the North, early April to June farther South.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Persea {{americana}} and Persea borbonia. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine has {{the form of a}} long, slender, serpentine gallery, with a relatively broad, dark brownish, median frass trail, almost always located on the upper (adaxial) side of the leaf. The egg is deposited on the upper leaf surface away from the midrib. Mines begin {{on one side of the}} blade, but after much of one side is consumed, cross over near the leaf apex to the other side. The median frass line is unusually broad for a species of Phyllocnistis, resembling more that of the Chilean genus Prophyllocnistis. Pupation occurs in the lamina, away from the leaf edge in a circular nidus, similar to that fashioned by Prophyllocnistis. The serpentine portion of the mine begins as a narrow tract of about 0.3 mm wide and gradually enlarges before the <b>pupation</b> <b>chamber</b> to a width of about 2-2.5 mm. The median frass line is one fourth of the mine width in the early instars and gradually broadens to more than half the mine width.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Pseudotsuga menziesii. They {{mine the}} twigs and tips of their host plant. The larvae enter the twigs at a node mining in a spiral pattern around the new wood, or {{directly}} into the wood. They continue feeding until late fall when they move {{to the base of}} the twig and construct a pupal <b>chamber.</b> <b>Pupation</b> takes place around the end of January.|$|R
50|$|The beetle reproduces in {{the inner}} bark layer of the tree. The female bores an egg gallery up to 13 centimeters in length along {{the surface of the}} wood, often {{parallel}} to the grain. The male clears the debris from the chamber. After mating, the female lays up to 100 eggs in the gallery, each in its own nook. The larvae usually develop over 8 to 10 weeks, but sometimes take well over a year to reach maturity, depending on temperature. As they grow, the egg gallery is obliterated and they develop together in a common <b>chamber.</b> <b>Pupation</b> lasts up to two weeks.|$|R
40|$|Dasineura gannoni Kolesik sp. nov. is {{the first}} gall midge species known to feed on plants from the Hakea-Grevillea generic alliance. D. [*]gannoni induces galls on swamp-loving Hakea microcarpa R. Br. and H. [*]nodosa R. Br., {{flowering}} plant shrubs naturally occurring in south-east mainland Australia and Tasmania. The gall is a conspicuous red-coloured, multi-chambered, leaf swelling containing one, occasionally two, red larvae in each <b>chamber.</b> <b>Pupation</b> {{takes place in the}} soil. The new species was originally identified on H. [*]microcarpa near Thredbo River in New South Wales. Later examination of herbarium vouchers found presence of galls of the new species on further specimens of H. [*]microcarpa and another swamp-loving species H. [*]nodosa. The geographical range of the new species extends over much of the combined distribution area of the two host plants on mainland Australia from far south-east Queensland through east New South Wales to Victoria and south-east South Australia.

The last three host plants are recorded {{for the first}} time. The endophitic oviposition occurs in the veins of the ventral surface of the young leaves. The larvae, leaf miners, eat the parenchyma and the adults make small holes in the leaves.

40|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{moisture}} on the pupation {{behavior of a}} willow flea beetle, Attica subplicata, were studied with two laboratory experiments. To test the effect of soil moisture {{on the number of}} larvae pupating and pupal survival, we set up pupation chambers filled with sand with three different soil moistures: dry, moist, and wet. The number of larvae pupating was much greater in the moist sand and wet sand treatments than in the dry sand treatment. Pupal survival, as measured by the proportion of adults successfully emerging, was greater in the moist treatment than in the wet or dry treatments. Thus, overall pupation success (number of adults successfully emerging) was greater in the moist treatment than in the wet treatment and greater in the wet treatment than in the dry treatment. To examine the effect of soil moisture on choice of pupation site, we provided the larvae with a choice of two soil moistures in each <b>pupation</b> <b>chamber.</b> More larvae chose wet over dry conditions and more chose moist over dry conditions, but larvae did not discriminate between moist and wet conditions. The improved pupation in areas with higher soil moisture is consistent with the field distribution pattern of greater beetle densities on dunes with greater soil moisture...|$|E
50|$|There is one {{generation}} every year. Females lay masses of 25-200 eggs {{at the base}} of shoots, often near the ground. Females mainly prefer chokecherry. Eggs overwinter and first instar larvae hatch in May. Adults can be found from early July to mid-September. Unlike many tortricids, the larvae are social, and feeding occurs in silken nests on terminals of the host plants. The webs are made around the terminal shoots of the host, sometimes enveloping entire plants. Pupation occurs inside individual cells inside the shelter. Adults are not very active during the day and can be found resting on foliage. At night, the adults are known to be attracted to lights.A typical nest may contain 30-200 larvae and reach up to 30 inches in diameter. The nest is expanded when the colony needs additional food and feeding always occurs under the protection of the nest. Early stages skeletonize leaves while later stages consume entire leaves. <b>Pupation</b> occurs in <b>chambers</b> constructed in the nest from frass and silk. Before emerging, the pupae will force their way to the outer surface of the silk nest where the adult moth ecloses.|$|R
40|$|Metamorphosis {{provides}} a unique condition {{for studying the}} role of gravity in development. Formation of new organs in a previously existing organism requires a highly active period of turnover of amino acids and proteins, and {{of changes in the}} endocrine profile. Furthermore, metamorphosis offers the advantage of studying a self-contained biological system. The tobacco hornworm {{provides a}} suitable species to study the effect of altered gravitational environment on invertebrate development. This species {{has been one of the}} most thoroughly investigated organisms in a variety of aspects of insect biology. M. sexta pharate adults can provide significant amounts of material with which to work, thus facilitating the study of metabolic aspects of adult development. During wandering, the period immediately following cessation of larval feeding, the larva burrows into the soil to form a <b>pupation</b> <b>chamber.</b> Despite burrowing down 25 to 30 cm, the insects reorient themselves to a slightly head-up (10 +/- 1 degree) position. Since light and temperature are not factors in this process, the larvae must sense the gravity vector. In our ground-based studies we had assessed whether developing adults might be sensitive to their gravitational environment by orienting pupae in a vertical head-up position within 24 to 48 h after pupal ecdysis. Our ground-based findings formed the foundation for determining which parameters would be evaluated in developing Manduca following spaceflight. Measurements were to include: (1) extent of development by all of the insects, (2) analysis of hemolymph obtained from half of the insects postflight for ecdysteroid, amino acid, urea, ammonia and trehalose concentrations, (3) further development of the other half of the insects to adult (moths), (4) analysis of the flight muscle protein content of the adults. Based on the first flight attempt in July, 1995, we modified the BRIC hardware to accommodate the insects. Our studies after BRIC- 04 showed that sealing the top and bottom lids of the canisters with an 0 -ring and with vacuum grease caused the insects to stop developing because of accumulation of carbon dioxide. Even though removing both the O-rings and vacuum grease permitted normal development, there was still some increase in carbon dioxide levels. Consequently, the canisters were vented and the vents covered with gas permeable membrane...|$|E
40|$|Toxoneuron nigriceps is a koinobiont larval endo{{parasitoid}} of {{the tobacco}} budworm, Heliothis virescens. No koinobiont parasitoid (which develop in active, growing hosts) has been reared completely in vitro. However, T. nigriceps has been partially reared in vitro, from egg stage through 2 nd larval instar and from 2 nd to 3 rd larval instar. Despite reaching its final larval instar, T. nigriceps failed to develop past the larval stage. In the following study, two aspects of T. nigriceps development, post-egression tissue feeding and cocoon formation through pupation, were examined to determine why T. nigriceps failed to develop in vitro beyond the larval stage and how in vitro rearing might be improved to rear T. nigriceps to adulthood. The importance of post-egression feeding {{and the possibility of}} developing an artificial post-egression diet were examined by manipulating the post-egression feeding behavior of T. nigriceps. The tissues of pre- and post-tissue feeding T. nigriceps larvae were analyzed to investigate the macronutritional benefit of post-egression feeding. A preliminary artificial post-egression diet was tested, and the putative quality of T. nigriceps reared to adulthood using this diet was examined. The formation of subterranean pupation chambers by healthy and parasitized H. virescens larvae was examined to investigate potential behavioral manipulation by T. nigriceps during this process. Finally, the potential use of artificial pupation chambers by T. nigriceps was investigated. Post-egression feeding was determined to be a vital part of T. nigriceps development, contributing to both parasitoid size and survival to adulthood. A preliminary artificial post-egression diet was developed, which facilitated rearing of T. nigriceps from 3 rd larval instar to adulthood. The dimensions and burial depth of chambers formed by parasitized H. virescens were significantly different from those of chambers formed by healthy H. virescens, suggesting that T. nigriceps manipulated host behavior during excavation. Toxoneuron nigriceps was able to use a number of common laboratory items as substitute pupation chambers during cocoon formation, and the merits of several artificial chambers were discussed. With provision of an adequate post-egression and artificial <b>pupation</b> <b>chamber,</b> in vitro rearing of T. nigriceps from the larval stage to adulthood may be possible...|$|E
40|$|Insect trace fossils from Canary Islands {{have been}} known and {{discussed}} since {{the beginnings of the}} last century. The most common and widespread morphologies have been tentatively referred to the ichnogenera Celliforma, Palmiraichnus or Rebuffoichnus and attributed to bees, coleopterans, and locusts until now. Herein they are included in a new single ichnospecies: Rebuffoichnus guanche isp. nov., which can be distinguished from other ichnospecies by the presence of an antechamber. R. guanche are considered herein as coleopteran (Curculionidae or Scarabaeidae) pupation chambers. This is supported by themostly horizontal orientation in soils, ellipsoid shape, dispersion of sizes, and particularly the internal surface of the wall chamber that is completely smoothed, even in both extremes. In addition, it is supported by the finding of one adult weevil in a similar trace fossil and palaeoenvironment of Australia. All these characters argue against their assignation neither, to egg pods of a locust species nor to bee cells, the latter also contradicted by the lack of spiral closure. The wall of R. guanche shows the same petrological features of those of the palaeosol in which specimens are found. In those specimens found in aeolian deposits, the wall is composed of sand grains similar to those found in the dunes or sand sheets. The diversity of microfabrics found in calcretes is higher and depends on the calcrete hostrock and the degree of development of the calcretes. In poorly developed calcretes the trace fossils reflect very well the calcrete hostrock, whereas in more developed ones they usually show peloidal/ooidal or laminar microfabrics. These similarities indicate that, in contrast to some previous reports, insects utilised as building material that of the surrounding soil, as expectable for a coleopteran <b>pupation</b> <b>chamber.</b> Lower numbers of R. guanche are recorded in calcretes from the western Canary Islands, where no aeolian deposits are present, in contrast to the high densities in the aeolian deposits of the eastern Islands. Coleopterans would first colonise thin soils with calcretes developed on basaltic or sedimentary rocks in young islands and later colonise dunes as they appear when the islands aged. The widespread presence of calcretes, aeolian deposits, and trace fossils in the easternmost and older Canary Islands is driven by both the geological evolution of the Islands and climatic conditions. Both the calcretes and pupation chambers formed during the relatively wetter periods within otherwise prevailing arid to semiarid conditions...|$|E
