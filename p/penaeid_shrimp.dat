5|$|The yellow-orange {{pigments}} of the smalleye hammerhead seem to {{have been}} acquired from the <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimp</b> Xiphopenaeus kroyeri, the main food of juvenile sharks, and from sea catfish and their eggs, the main food of adults. The golden color may serve to conceal it from predators such as larger sharks. This species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Females bear litters of five to 19 pups every year following a gestation period of 10 months. Reproductive seasonality, litter size, and size at maturity vary between geographical regions. Because of its abundance, the smalleye hammerhead is an economically important bycatch of artisanal gillnet fisheries throughout its range and is used as food. In recent years, overfishing has caused marked declines in its numbers off Trinidad, northern Brazil, and probably elsewhere. Coupled with its low reproductive rate, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature to list it under vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{aggressive}} nature of M. rosenbergii and the hierarchy between males, stocking densities are {{much lower than}} in <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimp</b> farms. Intensive farming is not possible due to the increased level of cannibalism, so all farms are either stocked semi-intensively (4 to 20 postlarvae per square metre) or, in extensive farms, at even lower densities (1 to 4/m²). The management of the growout ponds {{must take into account}} the growth characteristics of M. rosenbergii: the presence of blue-claw males inhibits the growth of small males, and delays the metamorphosis of OC males into BCs. Some farms fish off the largest prawns from the pond using seines to ensure a healthy composition of the pond's population, designed to optimize the yield, even if they employ batch harvesting. The heterogeneous individual growth of M. rosenbergii makes growth control necessary even if a pond is stocked newly, starting from scratch: some animals will grow faster than others and become dominant BCs, stunting the growth of other individuals.|$|E

500|$|Encountered singly or in [...] "social" [...] groups, {{the common}} {{stingray}} appears to segregate by sex {{to some degree}} and may be more active at night, tending to bury itself in sediment during daytime. It feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bottom-dwelling organisms, including crustaceans, cephalopods, bivalves, polychaete worms, and small bony fishes. It is reportedly does great damage to cultured shellfish beds. One study in the Gulf of İskenderun off Turkey found that crustaceans comprised some 99% of its diet, with fish prey becoming increasingly important with age. Another study off the coast of Tarsus, Turkey, found the most important dietary component to be the <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimp</b> Metapenaeus stebbingi, followed by the pistol shrimp Alpheus glaber and the swimming crab Charybdis longicollis; cephalopods were relatively important for males, while fishes were important for females. Common stingrays have been observed closely following each other in the presence of food, possibly to take advantage of other individuals' foraging success.|$|E
500|$|Young smalleye hammerheads under [...] {{long feed}} {{predominantly}} on <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> mostly Xiphopenaeus kroyeri. Larger sharks feed mainly on bony fishes, especially ariid sea catfish and their eggs. The shrimp {{and the surface}} mucus layer and eggs of the catfish contain carotenoid pigments {{that appear to be}} the source of the sharks' golden color; [...] whether the pigments in the catfish also ultimately come from the shrimp is uncertain. Another shark species in the region, the yellow smooth-hound (Mustelus higmani), also feeds on shrimp and has a yellowish color, albeit not nearly as bright. This species has also been known to consume swimming crabs, squid, grunts, and newborn scalloped hammerheads. The smalleye hammerhead may fall prey to larger sharks such as the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), while smaller individuals may also be taken by bony fishes. Its coloration may provide camouflage. A known parasite of this species is the hexabothriid monogenean Erpocotyle schmitti; it may also serve as a host to common copepod ectoparasites such as Echthrogaleus coleoptratus, Pandarus satyrus, and P. cranchii.|$|E

Several non-penaeid shrimps were also found to be severely infected during experimental challenges. Many crustaceans like crabs (Scylla spp., Portunus spp.), spiny lobsters (Panulirus spp.), crayfish (Astacus spp., Cherax spp.) and freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium spp.) are reported to be infected with variable severities depending on the life stage of the host and presence of external stressors (temperature, salinity, bacterial diseases, pollutants).|$|R

In the 1940s, while working at the Museum for Comparative Zoology, Pérez Farfante worked with Henry Bryant Bigelow on his research about lancelets.

50|$|The chronic {{phase is}} first seen {{six days after}} {{infection}} and persist for at least 12 months under experimental conditions. This phase is characterized histologically {{by the absence of}} acute lesions and the presence of LOS of successive morphologies. These LOSs are positive by ISH for TSV. A low prevalence of ectopic spheroids can also be observed in some cases. LOSs are not by themselves characteristic of TSV infection and can be found in other viral diseases of shrimp such as lymphoid organ vacuolization virus (LOVV), lymphoid parvo-like virus (LPV), lymphoid organ virus (LOV), rhabdovirus of <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimp</b> (RPS) and yellowhead virus (YHV). Diagnosis of the disease during the chronic phase is problematic, as shrimp do not display any outward signs of the disease and do not show mortality from the infection. Survivors may become carriers for life. Shrimp with chronic TSV infection are not as vigorous as uninfected shrimp, as demonstrated by their inability to tolerate a salinity drop as well as uninfected shrimp. A 2011 study by Laxminath Tumburu looked at the relationship between an environmental stressor (pesticide Endosulfan) and Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and their interactions on the susceptibility and molting of marine <b>penaeid</b> <b>shrimp</b> L. vannamei and found the interference of endosulfan-associated stress led to increasingly higher susceptibility at postmolt stage during the acute phase of the TSV disease cycle.|$|E

The larvae, which are {{transparent}} and laterally compressed, are dispersed inshore and enter embayments, where they reside 2-3 yr before moving offshore. The juveniles are euryhaline, or tolerant {{to a wide range of}} salinity, so these embayments may be low-salinity estuaries or hyper-saline lagoons. Subadults move into the lower reaches of the embayments, eventually leaving in association with maturation for offshore, marine habitats.
