5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA <b>provirus</b> is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a <b>provirus</b> {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E
25|$|AZT is a {{thymidine}} analogue. AZT {{works by}} selectively inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase, the enzyme {{that the virus}} uses to make a DNA copy of its RNA. Reverse transcription is necessary for production of HIV's double-stranded DNA, which would be subsequently integrated into the genetic material of the infected cell (where it is called a <b>provirus).</b>|$|E
40|$|Polytropic {{murine leukemia}} viruses (MLVs) are {{generated}} by recombination of ecotropic MLVs {{with members of}} a family of endogenous <b>proviruses</b> in mice. Previous studies have indicated that polytropic MLV isolates comprise two mutually exclusive antigenic subclasses, each of which is reactive with one of two monoclonal antibodies termed MAb 516 and Hy 7. A major determinant of the epitopes distinguishing the subclasses mapped to a single amino acid difference in the SU protein. Furthermore, distinctly different populations of the polytropic MLV subclasses are generated upon inoculation of different ecotropic MLVs. Here we have characterized the majority of endogenous polytropic MLV-related <b>proviruses</b> of NFS/N mice. Most of the <b>proviruses</b> contain intact sequences encoding the receptor-binding region of the SU protein and could be distinguished by sequence heterogeneity within that region. We found that the endogenous <b>proviruses</b> comprise two major groups that encode the major determinant for Hy 7 or MAb 516 reactivity. The Hy 7 -reactive <b>proviruses</b> correspond to previously identified polytropic <b>proviruses,</b> while the 516 -reactive <b>proviruses</b> comprise the modified polytropic <b>proviruses</b> as well as a third group of polytropic MLV-related <b>proviruses</b> that exhibit distinct structural features. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the latter <b>proviruses</b> reflect features of phylogenetic intermediates linking xenotropic MLVs to the polytropic and modified polytropic <b>proviruses.</b> These studies elucidate the relationships of the antigenic subclasses of polytropic MLVs to their endogenous counterparts, identify a new group of endogenous <b>proviruses,</b> and identify distinguishing characteristics of the <b>proviruses</b> that should facilitate a more precise description of their expression in mice and their participation in recombination to generate recombinant viruses...|$|R

By successive recloning of these HTLV-I-infected clones, and by Southern blot {{analysis of their}} HTLV-I <b>proviruses,</b> we concluded the following. The copy number of extrachromosomal <b>proviruses</b> fluctuated, and this fluctuation was probably dependent on the epigenetic conditions in the host cell, HL 60.

40|$|Xenotransplantation may {{bridge the}} {{widening}} {{gap between the}} shortage of donor organs and {{the increasing number of}} patients waiting for transplantation. However, a major safety issue is the potential cross-species transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV). This problem could be resolved if it is possible to produce pigs that do not contain replication-competent copies of this virus. In order to determine the feasibility of this, we have determined the number of potentially replication-competent full-length PERV <b>proviruses</b> and obtained data on their integration sites within the porcine genome. We have screened genomic DNA libraries from a Large White pig for potentially intact <b>proviruses.</b> We identified six unique PERV B <b>proviruses</b> that were apparently intact in all three genes, while the majority of isolated <b>proviruses</b> were defective in one or more genes. No intact PERV A <b>proviruses</b> were found in this pig, despite the identification of multiple defective A <b>proviruses.</b> Genotyping of 30 unrelated pigs for these unique <b>proviruses</b> showed a heterogeneous distribution. Two <b>proviruses</b> were uncommon, present in 7 of 30 and 3 of 30 pigs, while three were each present in 24 of 30 pigs, and one was present in 30 of 30 animals examined. Our data indicate that few PERV <b>proviruses</b> in Large White pigs are capable of productive infection and suggest that many could be removed by selective breeding. Further studies are required to determine if all potentially functional <b>proviruses</b> could be removed by breeding or whether gene knockout techniques will be required to remove the residuum...|$|R
25|$|Lentiviruses are a {{subclass}} of Retroviruses. They {{are sometimes}} used as vectors for gene therapy {{thanks to their}} ability to integrate into the genome of non-dividing cells, which is the unique feature of Lentiviruses as other Retroviruses can infect only dividing cells. The viral genome in the form of RNA is reverse-transcribed when the virus enters the cell to produce DNA, which is then inserted into the genome at a random position (recent findings actually suggest that the insertion of viral DNA is not random but directed to specific active genes and related to genome organisation) by the viral integrase enzyme. The vector, now called a <b>provirus,</b> remains in the genome and is passed on to the progeny of the cell when it divides. The site of integration is unpredictable, which can pose a problem. The <b>provirus</b> can disturb the function of cellular genes and lead to activation of oncogenes promoting the development of cancer, which raises concerns for possible applications of lentiviruses in gene therapy. However, studies have shown that lentivirus vectors have a lower tendency to integrate in places that potentially cause cancer than gamma-retroviral vectors. More specifically, one study found that lentiviral vectors did not cause either an increase in tumor incidence or an earlier onset of tumors in a mouse strain with a much higher incidence of tumors. Moreover, clinical trials that utilized lentiviral vectors to deliver gene therapy for the treatment of HIV experienced no increase in mutagenic or oncologic events.|$|E
500|$|Release – Viruses can be {{released}} from the host cell by lysis, a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present: This is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses. Some viruses undergo a lysogenic cycle where the viral genome is incorporated by genetic recombination into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a [...] "provirus" [...] or, {{in the case of}} bacteriophages a [...] "prophage". Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. However, at some point, the <b>provirus</b> or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells. Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by budding. During this process the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane.|$|E

A high degree of polymorphism was observed. Overall, the strains showed between 17 % (A/J and HRS/J) and 65 % (C 57 BL/ 6 J and C 57 L/J) shared <b>proviruses,</b> and only four <b>proviruses</b> were present in all eight strains. The similarity among the strains {{is due in part to}} the few <b>proviruses</b> present in all of the strains but also represents the independent assortment of a limited set of <b>proviruses.</b> These oligonucleotides provide a basis for determining the stability, distribution, and mutagenic potential of nonecotropic <b>proviruses</b> within the mouse genome...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAntiretroviral therapy {{fails to}} cure HIV- 1 {{infection}} because latent <b>proviruses</b> persist in resting CD 4 + T cells. T cell activation reverses latency, but < 1 % of <b>proviruses</b> are induced to release infectious virus after maximum in vitro activation. The noninduced <b>proviruses</b> are generally considered defective {{but have not}} been characterized. Analysis of 213 noninduced proviral clones from treated patients showed 88. 3 % with identifiable defects but 11. 7 % with intact genomes and normal long terminal repeat (LTR) function. Using direct sequencing and genome synthesis, we reconstructed full-length intact noninduced proviral clones and demonstrated growth kinetics comparable to reconstructed induced <b>proviruses</b> from the same patients. Noninduced <b>proviruses</b> have unmethylated promoters and are integrated into active transcription units. Thus, it cannot be excluded that they may become activated in vivo.

50|$|A <b>provirus</b> {{does not}} {{directly}} make new DNA copies of itself while integrated into a host genome in this way. Instead, it is passively replicated along with the host genome and {{passed on to the}} original cell's offspring; all descendants of the infected cell will also bear proviruses in their genomes. This is known as lysogenic viral reproduction. Integration can result in a latent infection or a productive infection. In a productive infection, the <b>provirus</b> is transcribed into messenger RNA which directly produces new virus, which in turn will infect other cells via the lytic cycle. A latent infection results when the <b>provirus</b> is transcriptionally silent rather than active.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} two experimental {{situations to}} assess the role of endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) DNA in the genesis of mammary carcinomas. (i) GR mice carry in their germ line one or more <b>proviruses</b> indistinguishable by limited restriction mapping from the <b>proviruses</b> introduced into cells by experimental infection with the highly tumorigenic virus isolated from GR mouse milk, MMTV(GR). Most tumors arising in GR mice contain one or more <b>proviruses</b> at various sites in tumor DNA {{in addition to those}} present endogenously. Detection of these new <b>proviruses</b> is possible {{as a consequence of the}} clonal or quasiclonal character of the tumors. (ii) C 3 H/He mice carry three units of endogenous viral DNA, none of which resembles the DNA of the commonly encountered strains of milk-borne MMTV. Nevertheless, MMTV-associated tumors arise late in life when these animals are removed from the influence of milk-borne virus; the responsible agent, MMTV(C 3 Hf), can also produce tumors in BALB/c mice. We found that tumors arising in both C 3 Hf/He mice and BALB/c mice infected with MMTV(C 3 Hf) were clonal or quasiclonal and contained one or more new copies of proviral DNA at various sites in the host genome. These new <b>proviruses</b> were readily distinguished from the <b>proviruses</b> of the common milk-borne virus strains and closely resembled unit II of endogenous MMTV DNA (Cohen et al., J. Virol., 32 : 483 - 496). Thus, in both experimental systems, we found evidence for new <b>proviruses</b> in mammary tumors, despite the preexistence of similar or identical <b>proviruses</b> in the germ line. The results suggest that the repositioning of MMTV <b>proviruses</b> may be required for the full expression of the oncogenic potential of endogenous MMTV DNA...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe human {{endogenous}} retrovirus family HERV-K(HML- 2) encodes the so-called Rec protein that displays functional similarities to the HIVREV protein. The number of <b>proviruses</b> producing Rec protein was hitherto unknown. We therefore analyzed the human genome sequence data and determined seven HERV-K(HML- 2) <b>proviruses</b> potentially capable of producing Rec both on the mRNA and the protein level. We analyzed Rec mRNA expression in the Tera- 1 cell line and in synovial tissue, and in the expressed sequence tag (EST) database. Diagnostic nucleotides assigned transcriptionally active and Rec-encoding <b>proviruses</b> to human chromosomes 6, 7, 11, and 12. Differently spliced mRNAs were also identified. The various active <b>proviruses</b> encode almost identical Rec proteins. Our study contributes {{to the understanding of}} the biology of HERV-K(HML- 2) Rec protein. Our study further demonstrates that minor sequence differences among <b>proviruses</b> allow assigning HERV transcripts to particular proviral loci. Extended studies will eventually yield a more complete image of HERV transcription, regulation, and biological significance in diverse human tissues...|$|R
40|$|We used a {{two-dimensional}} Southern blotting procedure {{to analyze the}} tissue-specific methylation patterns of the five endogenous mouse mammary tumor viruses in the GR/A mouse strain.

40|$|Latent HIV <b>proviruses</b> are silenced as {{the result}} of deacetylation and {{methylation}} of histones located at the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) leads to the reemergence of HIV- 1 from latency, but the contribution of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) to maintaining HIV latency remains uncertain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using latently infected Jurkat T-cell lines demonstrated that the HKMT enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH 2) was present at high levels at the LTR of silenced HIV <b>proviruses</b> and was rapidly displaced following proviral reactivation. Knockdown of EZH 2, a key component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2) silencing machinery, and the enzyme which is required for trimethyl histone lysine 27 (H 3 K 27 me 3) synthesis induced up to 40 % of the latent HIV <b>proviruses.</b> In contrast, there was less than 5 % induction of latent <b>proviruses</b> following knockdown of SUV 39 H 1, which is required for H 3 K 9 me 3 synthesis. Knockdown of EZH 2 also sensitized latent <b>proviruses</b> to external stimuli, such as T-cell receptor stimulation, and slowed the reversion of reactivated <b>proviruses</b> to latency. Similarly, cell populations that responded poorly to external stimuli carried HIV <b>proviruses</b> that were enriched in H 3 K 27 me 3 and relatively depleted in H 3 K 9 me 3. Treating latently infected cells with the HKMT inhibitor 3 -deazaneplanocin A, which targets EZH 2, led to the reactivation of silenced <b>proviruses,</b> whereas chaetocin and BIX 01294 showed only minimal reactivation activities. These findings suggest that PRC 2 -mediated silencing is an important feature of HIV latency and that inhibitors of histone methylation may play a useful role in induction strategies designed to eradicate latent HIV pools...|$|R

40|$|Virtually all of {{our present}} {{understanding}} of endogenous murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) is based on studies with inbred mice. To develop {{a better understanding of}} the interaction between endogenous retroviruses and their hosts, we have carried out a systematic investigation of endogenous nonecotropic MLVs in wild mice. Species studied included four major subspecies of Mus musculus (M. m. castaneus, M. m. musculus, M. m. molossinus, and M. m. domesticus) as well as four common inbred laboratory strains (AKR/J, HRS/J, C 3 H/HeJ, and C 57 BL/ 6 J). We determined the detailed distribution of nonecotropic <b>proviruses</b> in the mice by using both env- and long terminal repeat (LTR) -derived oligonucleotide probes specific for the three different groups of endogenous MLVs. The analysis indicated that <b>proviruses</b> that react with all of the specific probes are present in most wild mouse DNAs tested, in numbers varying from 1 or 2 to more than 50. Although in common inbred laboratory strains the linkage of group-specific sequences in env and the LTR of the <b>proviruses</b> is strict, <b>proviruses</b> which combine env and the LTR sequences from different groups were commonly observed in the wild-mouse subspecies.

40|$|Integrating vectors {{can lead}} to the dysregulation of nearby {{chromosomal}} genes, with important consequences for clinical trials and cellular engineering.

We previously used integrating foamy virus (FV) vectors expressing OCT 4, SOX 2, MYC, and KLF 4 to reprogram osteogenesis imperfecta mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Here we have studied the effects of 10 FV vector <b>proviruses</b> on neighboring gene expression in four iPSC lines and their corresponding iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs). Gene expression profiles in these iPSC lines showed that none of the 38 genes within 300 kb up- or downstream of integrated <b>proviruses</b> had a significant difference in mRNA levels, including 5 genes with <b>proviruses</b> in their transcription units. In the iMSCs derived from these iPSCs, the same type of analysis showed a single dysregulated transcript out of 46 genes found near <b>proviruses.</b> This frequency of dysregulation was similar to that of genes lacking nearby <b>proviruses,</b> so it may have been due to interclonal variation and/or measurement inaccuracies. While the number of integration sites examined in this paper is limited, our results suggest that integrated FV <b>proviruses</b> do not impact the expression of chromosomal genes in pluripotent human stem cells or their differentiated derivatives.
