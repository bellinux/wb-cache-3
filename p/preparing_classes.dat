Instead of <b>preparing</b> <b>classes</b> of ques-tions beforehand, the method retrieves already asked ques-tion examples similar to a submitted question from a set of Q&A pairs. Then, instead of preparing clue expressions for the writing style of answers according to each ques-tion class beforehand, it dynamically extracts clue expres-sions from the answer examples corresponding to the re-trieved question examples. This clue expression informa-tion is combined with topical content information from the question to extract appropriate answer candidates. The experimental results showed that the clue expres-sions obtained from the set of examples improved the ac-curacy of answer candidate extraction. 1...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} understanding a text and the contribution of methodological apparatus in the reader book to comprehension of a text being read in junior classes of elementary school. By using the technique of content analysis from methodological apparatuses in eight reader books for the fourth grade of elementary school, approved for usage in 2014 / 2015 academic year, and surveying 350 teachers in 33 elementary schools and 11 administrative districts in the Republic of Serbia we examined: (a) {{to what extent the}} Serbian language text book contents enable junior students to understand a literary text; (b) to what extent teachers accept the suggestions offered in the textbook for preparing literature teaching. The results show {{that a large number of}} suggestions relate to reading comprehension, but some of categories of understanding are unevenly distributed in the methodological apparatus. On the other hand, the majority of teachers use the methodological apparatus given in a textbook for <b>preparing</b> <b>classes,</b> not only the textbook he or she selected for teaching but also other textbooks for the same grade...|$|E

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that stronger degrees of ambivalence attenuate the attitude-behavior correspondence. We also tested the hypothesis that the weaker attitude-behavior correspondence at higher levels of ambivalence {{may be due to the}} lower temporal stability of highly ambivalent attitudes. To ensure that these hypotheses be adequately tested, both studies had a prospective design. After assessing their attitudes toward certain behaviors and ambivalence, participants recorded how often they performed these behaviors during the subsequent 14 -day period. The investigated behaviors included everyday behaviors such as consuming fast food, <b>preparing</b> <b>classes,</b> and watching entertaining programs on TV. To assess attitudinal stability, attitudes were measured again after the 14 -day period. As the results show, the expected moderating effect of experienced ambivalence on the attitude-behavior correspondence was obtained, however, only for a minority of the investigated behaviors. As predicted, experienced ambivalence was related to decreased attitudinal stability in each of these cases. A meta-analytic summary of the two studies revealed that, across different behaviors, a weak but reliable moderating effect of ambivalence on attitude stability and the correspondence between attitudes and behaviors exists...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{confidence}} freshman engineering students have in being {{successful in the}} first study year and which study-related behaviour {{they believe to be}} important to this end. Additionally, this paper studies which feedback these students would like to receive and compares it with the experiences of second-year students regarding feedback. To this end, two questionnaires were administered: one with freshman engineering students to measure their expectations regarding study success and expected feedback and one with second-year engineering students to evaluate their first year feedback experience. The results show that starting first-year engineering students are confident regarding their study success. This confidence is however higher than the observed first-year students success. Not surprisingly, first-year students have good intentions and believe that most academic activities are important for student success. When second-year students look back on their first year, their beliefs in the importance of these activities have strongly decreased, especially regarding the importance of <b>preparing</b> <b>classes</b> and following communication through email and the virtual learning environment. First-year students expect feedback regarding their academic performance and engagement. They expect that this feedback primarily focuses on the impact on their future study pathway rather than on comparison to peer students.

40|$|Studies {{about native}} and {{non-native}} language teachers {{have found that}} these two groups are perceived as {{different from each other}} in language abilities and teaching styles. However, most of the existing research has investigated the perspective of teachers or students separately and has rarely triangulated their opinions. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to contribute to the body of literature related to the native and non-native teacher dichotomy by triangulating perceptions from native and non-native teacher samples and a student sample. Particularly, this study set out to examine the problem in the context of the English language teaching and learning system in Vietnam. This study involved three participant groups: 30 native English teachers (NETs), 30 Vietnamese teachers (VETs), and 30 Vietnamese EFL students in Vietnam. The instrument included two versions of an online Likert scale survey, one for the students and the other for the teachers (both NETs and VETs). The questions covered 4 areas of teaching efficacy: teaching language skills, teaching language aspects, teaching methodology, and assessment. The data were analyzed through statistical analyses, including Cronbach alpha, two MANOVAs, and 16 dependent t-tests. The results of this study revealed that NETs, VETs, and students did not differ significantly in how they perceived the teaching efficacy of NETs and VETs. Instead, they had similar judgments which overall were in the upper part of the scale, showing rather positive perceptions of the teaching efficacy of both NETs and VETs. NETs were favored in teaching pronunciation; teaching culture; teaching speaking; involving students; balancing lecture, pair work, and group work; organizing classes; measuring students 2 ̆ 7 progress; and grading. VETs were found more effective in teaching grammar and giving feedback.

Dok su kod analize udžbenika formirane odgovarajuće evidencijske liste, za potrebe postupka anketnog istraživanja konstruirani su upitnici različiti za učenike i učitelje. Veličina uzorka bila je 429 učenika i učenica od 5. do 8. razreda te 215 učitelja glazbene kulture. U istraživanju stavova učenika uzete su varijable: dob, spol i samoprocijenjena glazbena darovitost. Rezultati pokazuju da se učenice češće od učenika samoprocjenjuju glazbeno darovitima, više se bave glazbom izvan obvezne nastave, više rabe računalo za potrebe nastave glazbe i više žele upoznati glazbene računalne programe. Dok udžbenik za nastavu glazbe rijetko rabe, gotovo polovica učenika smatra potrebnom uporabu računala u nastavi glazbe na što nema utjecaja ni dob, ni spol, ni samoprocijenjena glazbena darovitost. Prema rezultatima druge ankete, od svih nastavnih medija učitelji najčešće koriste glazbalo i udžbenik uglavnom kao pjesmaricu. Većina smatra potrebnom poduku iz glazbenih računalnih programa, iako se učitelji s kraćim radnim iskustvom procjenjuju informatički pismenijima. Većina ih poznaje barem neki glazbeni računalni program, upotrebljava {{internet}} za potrebe pripreme nastave, a gotovo svi smatraju da uporaba računala poboljšava kvalitetu nastave glazbe. Učitelji procjenjuju da bi računalo bilo najkorisnije tijekom slušanja glazbe, zatim za obradu muzikoloških sadržaja i glazbeno stvaralaštvo. Analiza udžbenika pokazala je da jedino muzikološki sadržaji zadovoljavaju osnovna udžbenička obilježja, osobito mogućnost samostalnoga korištenja. Udžbenički sadržaj koji se bavi ostalim područjima nastave glazbe namijenjen je učitelju ili služi kao pjesmarica. Didaktički oblikovan multimedijski udžbenik za nastavu glazbe mogao bi riješiti probleme tradicionalnoga udžbenika poput davanja povratne informacije učeniku, dok bi zadatci koji zahtijevaju razrednu raspravu trebali biti dio učiteljskoga multimedijskoga priručnika. Multimedijski udžbenik mogao bi biti podijeljen na osnovni obvezni, ali i neobvezni za samostalno učenje glazbe te za izvannastavne glazbene aktivnosti. Music education {{consists of}} 6 teaching fieds: music literacy, singing, playing musical instruments, listening to music, composing music and musicology contents. All aforementioned fields are different by nature - they differ {{in levels of}} expected teaching outcomes {{on the part of}} the curriculum and educators, but also in the interest of each individual student which is then reflected on the use of the teaching media. Introductory section tackles the question of textbooks and their characteristics, position of music in the society, using computers for educational purposes with special potential for individualized learning and changing of digital contents and the need for multimedia textbooks in accordance with social environments and paradigmes of modern education. The second section examines the question of teaching media in music teaching. A description of teaching fields is followed by an overview of basic features and types of textbooks, teaching media and terms such as original music reality, teaching aids and methods, teaching technology, multimedia and multimedia textbooks. After that, the paper compares the possibilities, functionality and advantages and disadvantages of traditional and multimedia textbooks in music teaching. The main goal of the research is to examine the learners' and the teachers' attitudes about applying teaching media in music teaching and to analyse music textbooks from grade 1 to 8 of elementary school. Special questionnaires were composed for the purpose of this research: Questionnaire on the use of teaching media for students and Questionnaire on the use of teaching media for teachers. For the purpose of textbook analysis specific record charts have been made. The research has been conducted on the sample of 429 male and female students attending grades 5 through 8 of 3 elementary schools from the County of KrapinaZagorje and the County of Zagreb and 215 music teachers from all over Croatia. Three variables have been used for the purpose of researching the students' attitude towards the use of teaching media in music teaching: age, sex and self-estimated talent for music. The results show that female students are more prone to assess themselves as talented for music, play music as extracurricular acitivities more often, use computers in music education more often and show more interest for learning music computer programmes than male students. While a textbook for music teaching is being used only rarely, almost half of the students find the use of computer in music education necessary. Age, sex or self-assessed music talent made here no difference. As far as the teachers' attitude is concerned, the most frequently used teaching media, except for the musical instruments, is the textbook, and it is used mainly as a song-book. On the other hand, most teachers expressed the need for extra instructions for the use of music computer programmes. Those with shorter work experience assessed themselves as having better computer litracy, whereby most of them are able to use at least one music computer programme, use the Internet for <b>preparing</b> <b>classes</b> and almost all find that the use of computers improves the quality of music education. Teachers find that the computer would be most useful in the fields of listening to music, analysing musicology contents and music production. Analysis of the existing music textbooks showed that only the musicology contents meet the basic textbook criteria, especially the criterium of indepentent using. Textbook material dealing with other fields of music teaching is teacher-oriented and meant for the teacher or serves barely as a song-book. The final part of the paper deals with organizing a multimedia textbook for music teaching which could solve many problems the traditional music textbook faced, such as providing feedback for the student. Tasks which require class discussion, such as expressing opinion should, however, be part of the teacher's multimedia handbook. A basic compulsory multimedia textbook would be meant for the student, as well as an optional multimedia textbook for independent study of music and a multimedia textbook for extracurricular music activities. The basic compulsory multimedia textbook would include the fields of singing, musicology contents and listening to music. Finally, the most relevant fact is that the each multimedia content is didactically shaped...|$|E

The current study sought to evaluate {{the effects of the}} use of high-speed and low-speed handpieces by dental students during their pre-clinical training. MethodsTwenty-one undergraduate dental students at the College of Dentistry of Taibah University participated in this study. Each student was asked to <b>prepare</b> <b>class</b> I cavities using high-speed air turbine and low-speed/high-torque handpieces. The time required for cavity preparation was recorded by the authors. The prepared cavities were evaluated for quality and skill using a six-point scale. The data were statistically analysed with paired t and Mann–Whitney tests. ResultsThere {{was no significant difference in}} cavity preparation time between the low-speed and high-speed handpieces (538. 29 and 483. 76  s, respectively). The evaluations of the cavities revealed no difference in the quality of preparations between the low- and high-speed handpieces. Additionally, no significant difference in the surface roughness of the preparations was observed.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of an Er:YAG laser (2960 nm) to <b>prepare</b> <b>class</b> V cavities as compared with rotary instruments. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six freshly extracted human molars were selected and randomly distributed in two groups. Non standardized class V cavities were prepared using (group 1) a diamond bur for enamel, plus a tungsten bur for dentin with water irrigation and (group 2) an Er:YAG laser (output parameters, enamel: 1000 mJ, 12 Hz, dentin: 500 mJ, 20 Hz) with a continuous flow of water. Results: The SEM examination revealed characteristic micro-irregularities of the lased samples as compared with the conventional prepared cavities: group 1, the walls of the cavities were slightly curved and a smear layer plus muds covered peripheric walls as well as the depth of the cavity; rare dentinal tubules were opened; linear and circular surface irregularities were observed on the dentin; and group 2, the walls of the cavities were irregular, jagged; photo-ablation creates a real cleavage of hydroxyapatite prisms with respect to the enamel prism pathway; an homogeneous dentin with opened dentinal tubules covered the depth of the cavities; intertubular dentin is selectively more ablated than Er-YAG the peritubular dentin. Conclusions: Jagged outline as well as opened dentinal tubules are the main characteristics of the Er-YAG <b>prepared</b> <b>class</b> V cavities. Further investigations (ulstrastructural, histochemical properties of the lased dentin, resistance to traction of bonded resins) should be conducted.
