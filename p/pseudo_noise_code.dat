40|$|The Internet threat {{monitoring}} (ITM) {{systems have been}} deployed to detect widespread attacks on the Internet in recent years. However, the effectiveness of ITM systems critically depends on the confidentiality of the location of their monitors. If adversaries learn the monitor locations of an ITM system, they can bypass the monitors {{and focus on the}} uncovered IP address space without being detected. In this paper, we study a new class of attacks, the invisible LOCalization (iLOC) attack. The iLOC attack can accurately and invisibly localize monitors of ITM systems. In the iLOC attack, the attacker launches low-rate port-scan traffic, encoded with a selected <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> <b>code</b> (PN-code), to targeted networks. While the secret PN-code is invisible to others, the attacker can accurately determine the existence of monitors in the targeted networks based on whether the PN-code is embedded in the report data queried from the data center of the ITM system. We formally analyze the impact of various parameters on attack effectiveness. We implement the iLOC attack and conduct the performance evaluation on a real-world ITM system to demonstrate the possibility of such attacks. We also conduct extensive simulations on the iLOC attack using real-world traces. Our data show that the iLOC attack can accurately identify monitors while being invisible to ITM systems.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe objective {{of this research is}} to develop a Markovian model {{in the form of a}} discrete-time queueing network to assess the performance of random access code division multiple access networks (CDMA). An approximation method called equilibrium point analysis (EPA) has been used to solve the model. The CDMA protocol IS an important application of spread spectrum communications that allows simultaneous transmission of multiple users to occupy a wideband channel with small interference. This is done by assigning each user a unique <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> <b>code</b> sequence. These codes have low cross-correlation between each pair of sequences. Both slotted direct sequence CDMA (DS) and frequency hopping CDMA (FH) are considered with an emphasis on DS-CDMA systems. The EPA method has previously been used to evaluate the performance of other random access systems such as the ALOHA protocol, but has not previously been used in the context of a CDMA protocol. Throughput and mean packet delay of random access CDMA networks are evaluated, since these two measures are usually used in the study of the performance assessment of mUltiple access protocols. The analytical results of the random access model are validated against a discrete-event simulation which is run for large number of slots. The study then proceeds by using the model to examine the effect on performance of introducing error correcting codes to the DS-CDMA systems. Optimum error correcting codes that give the best performances in terms of the throughput and the delay are determined. The perfonnance of random access CDMA systems applied to radio channels, as in packet radio networks, is then studied, and the effect of multipath fading on the perfonnance is evaluated. Finally, the perfonnance of DS-CDMA with different user classes (non-identical users case) is investigated. An extended equilibrium point analysis (EEPA) method has been used to solve the Markovian model in this situation. This extended model is used to assess the effects on perfonnance of the unequal powers due to varying distances of the users to an intended receiver or to a base station (near-far problem) ...|$|E

The PN code acquisition performance of single-carrier and MC DS-CDMA systems is analyzed and compared when communicating over Nakagami- fading channels under the hypothesis of multiple synchronous states (1 cells) in the uncertainty region of the PN code. In the context of MC DS-CDMA, the code acquisition performance is evaluated, when the correlator outputs of the subcarriers associated with the same phase of the local PN code replica are noncoherently combined by using equal gain combining (EGC) or selection combining (SC) schemes. The performance comparison of the above mentioned schemes shows that the code acquisition performance of the MC DS-CDMA scheme, especially when using the EGC scheme, is more robust, than that of single-carrier DS-CDMA schemes communicating over the multipath Nakagami- fading channels encountered.
