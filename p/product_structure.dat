Results from {{a survey}} of 225 alliances show that modular <b>product</b> <b>structures</b> within alliances affect alliance firms' competitive performance. Product innovation performance, assessed as both speed to market and radical innovations and contingent on the employed innovation strategy, partially mediates this effect. Modular <b>product</b> <b>structures</b> exert curvilinear effects on product innovation performance and linear effects on competitive performance. Although the interaction of modular <b>product</b> <b>structures</b> with an innovation strategy increases product innovation performance, this contingency also reduces {{the positive effect of}} the innovation strategy on competitive performance...|$|R

40|$|Equivalence {{relations}} on {{the edge}} set of a hypergraph that satisfy the "grid property" (a certain restrictive condition on diagonal-free grids {{that can be seen}} as a generalization of the more familiar "square property" on graphs) play a crucial role in the theory of Cartesian hypergraph products. In particular, every convex relation with the grid property induces a factorization w. r. t. the Cartesian product. In the class of graphs, even non-convex relations with the square property provide rich structural information on local isomorphisms, local <b>product</b> <b>structures,</b> and <b>product</b> <b>structures</b> of quotient graphs. Here, we examine the grid property in its own right. Vertex partitions derived from these equivalence classes of the edges give rise to equivalence relations on the vertex set. This in turn determines quotient graphs that have non-trivial <b>product</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a {{class of}} common-component allocation rules, termed no-holdback (NHB) rules, in continuous-review assemble-to-order (ATO) systems with positive lead times. The inventory of each component is replenished following an independent base-stock policy. In contrast to the usually assumed first-come-first-served (FCFS) component allocation rule in the literature, a NHB rule allocates a component to a product demand only if it will yield immediate fulfillment of that demand. We identify metrics as well as cost and <b>product</b> <b>structures</b> under which NHB rules outperform all other component allocation rules. For systems with certain <b>product</b> <b>structures,</b> we obtain key performance expressions and compare them to those under FCFS. For general <b>product</b> <b>structures,</b> we present performance bounds and approximations. Finally, we discuss the applicability of these results to more general ATO systems. ...|$|R
