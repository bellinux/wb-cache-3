40|$|We present {{here the}} first {{volcanic}} gas compositional time-series taken {{prior to a}} <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> of Villarrica volcano (Chile). Our gas plume observations were obtained using a fully autonomous Multi-component Gas Analyser System (Multi-GAS) in the 3 month-long phase of escalating volcanic activity that culminated into the 3 March 2015 paroxysm, the largest since 1985. Our results demonstrate a temporal evolution of volcanic plume composition, from low CO$_ 2 $/SO$_ 2 $ ratios (0. 65 - 2. 7) during November 2014 -January 2015 to CO$_ 2 $/SO$_ 2 $ ratios up to ≈ 9 then after. The H$_ 2 $O/CO$_ 2 $ ratio simultaneously declined to < 38 in the same temporal interval. We use results of volatile saturation models to demonstrate that this evolution toward CO$_ 2 $-enriched gas was likely caused by unusual supply of deeply sourced gas bubbles. We propose that separate ascent of over-pressured gas bubbles, originating from at least 20 - 35 MPa pressures, was the driver for activity escalation toward the 3 March climax.

The average duration of these <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions</b> is approximately 1 to 2  h (Ganci et al. 2012), with lava fountains up to 800 to 1, 000  m high (Calvari et al. 2011) erupting approximately 1 [*]×[*] 106  m 3 of pyroclastics and about twice as much lava (Calvari et al. 2011; Ganci et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|We have {{simulated}} {{the dynamics}} of convection, mixing and ascent of two basaltic magmas differing in their volatile and crystal content, giving rise to a gravitationally unstable configuration along a dyke or fissure. Numerical simulations are performed by a recently developed code which describes the transient 2 D dynamics of multicomponent fluids from the incompressible to the compressible regime, and the initial and boundary conditions are inspired to the <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> which occurred at Stromboli in 2003 (D’Auria et al. 2006). Multicomponent (H 2 O þ CO 2) saturation is accounted for by modelling the non-ideal equilibrium between the gas phase and the melt. The numerical results show {{the formation of a}} rising bulge of light magma, and the sink of discrete batches of dense magma towards deep fissure regions. Such dynamics are associated with a complex evolution of the pressure field, which shows variations occurring over a wide spectrum of frequencies. A first order analysis of the propagation of such pressure disturbances through the country rocks shows that the pre-eruptive fissure dynamics are able to produce mm-size, mainly radial deformation of the volcano, and a detectable seismic signal with spectral peaks at periods of about 50 s...|$|E
40|$|The Chichontepec volcano is a Plio-Pleistocene {{composite}} volcano {{that erupted}} lavas ranging from high-alumina basalts to dacites. It experienced a caldera-forming <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> {{during the early}} Pleistocene. Pre-caldera lavas are mildly tholeiitic and they evolved mainly by low pressure crystal fractionation, notwithstanding {{the fact that most}} mafic lavas (low-MgO high-alumina basalts) retain traces of polybaric evolution. Conversely, post-caldera lavas, which are mainly pyroxene andesites, are clearly calc-alkaline, having evolved by open-system crystal fractionation. Sr-Nd isotopic data and trace elements characteristics indicate that the same mantle source was involved in the petrogenesis of these series. Modelling the AFC process showed that it did not play any role in the petrogenesis of these rocks; a crystal fractionation model is considered to be more relevant. A slight variation in the fractionating assemblage could have caused the transition from an early mildly tholeiitic trend to a late calc-alkaline one. Mineralogical evidence, mass-balance calculations and elemental chemistry support this hypothesis, assuming that the greater amount of pyroxene on the liquidus is at the expense of plagioclase; this would have prevented the trend in iron enrichment.

40|$|On 11 August 2008 a <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> {{occurred}} at Santa Barbara mud volcano (MV), located close to Caltanissetta, {{one of the}} most densely populated cities of Sicily (Italy). An associated minor event took place on August 2009. Both the events caused severe damage to civil infrastructures located within a range of about 2 km from the eruptive vent. Geomorphological, geochemical, and seismological investigations were carried out for framing the events in the appropriate geodynamic context. Geomorphological surveys recognized, in the immediate surrounding of the main emission point, two different families of processes and landforms: (i) ground deformations and (ii) changes in morphology and number of the fluid emitting vents. These processes were associated to a wider network of fractures, seemingly generated by the shock wave produced by the gas blast that {{occurred at}} the main paroxysm. Geochemical characterization allowed an estimation of the source of the fluids, or at least their last standing, at about 3 km depth. Finally, the close time relationships observed between anomalous increments of seismic activity and the two main paroxysmal events accounted for a possible common trigger for both the phenomena, even with different timing due to the very different initial conditions and characteristics of the two processes, i. e. seismogenesis and gas overloading...|$|E
40|$|Since January 2011, Mt. Etna volcano {{has been}} {{affected}} by more than forty <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions</b> at the summit (New South East Crater; NSEC). On {{the basis of their}} very variable duration, seven eruptions have been selected among the twenty-five of 2011 – 2012 in order to decipher potential differences in their triggering mechanism. Paroxysms have been investigated through a multidisciplinary approach that integrates data from volcanic tremor and petrology (textures and micro-analysis on plagioclase crystals). Our results lead to the conclusion that close relationships exist between the duration of the eruptions and the temporal evolution of the volcanic tremor amplitude, especially during the Strombolian phase preceding the paroxysmal activity. In this regard, we distinguished: 1) paroxysms preceded by long-lasting initial Strombolian phases, characterized by low rate of volcanic tremor amplitude increase; and 2) eruptions preceded by short initial Strombolian phases, showing high rate of volcanic tremor amplitude increase. Based on the pattern of volcanic tremor amplitude increase, the former mainly showed a ramp-shaped morphology, while the latter a bell-shaped trend. Location of the volcanic tremor centroid during the quiescent intervals between the <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions</b> has highlighted the presence of a magmatic volume at 1 – 2 km a. s. l. beneath the North East Crater (NEC). During the syn-eruptive Strombolian and lava fountaining phases, the centroid of volcanic tremor migrates below the NSEC. This leads to the consideration that the magma batch residing beneath NEC {{played an important role in}} the volcanic activity at NSEC during the considered period. Also the textures and compositional zoning (anorthite and iron variations) in selected plagioclase crystals of the analyzed lavas suggest relations between duration of the paroxysms and dynamics of pre-eruptive magmatic processes at depth. Particularly, two mechanisms have been accounted for triggering of eruptions at the NSEC on the basis of the concordant or discordant behavior of anorthite and iron in plagioclase coupled with disequilibrium textures at the rim. Concordant anorthite and iron increases in plagioclase crystals with sieve-textured rims indicate recharge by more mafic, gas-rich magma. This textural-compositional behavior has been related to long-lasting eruptions, whose volcanic tremor amplitude evolution produced ramp-shaped increase of the volcanic tremor amplitude before the paroxysmal phase. On the contrary, crystalswith sieve-textures at the rim, characterized by increasing iron at rather constant or decreasing anorthite, suggest the prominent role of gas injections into the residing system. In this instance, the compositional behavior has been linked with short-lasting eruptions, whose volcanic tremor amplitude evolution led to a sudden increase of the seismic amplitude before the climax of the eruption. Thus, our work put forward the idea that the evolution and duration of the Strombolian phase preceding the <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions</b> of 2011 – 2012 at Mt. Etna are strongly controlled by the eruption triggering mechanism, which can be either gas burst or gas-rich magma recharge...|$|R
30|$|Sumatra is {{well known}} for its unusually high number of large caldera systems. <b>Paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions</b> from these systems have {{produced}} enormous rhyolitic tephra deposits that blanket large portions of the Sumatran Fault. These outflow sheets include the Young Toba Tuff in north Sumatra (Chesner et al. 1991), the Maninjau Tuff in central Sumatra (Alloway 2004) and the Ranau Tuff in south Sumatra (Hochstein and Sudarman 1993; Westerveld 1952). Rapid emplacement of huge volumes of tephra causes immediate obfuscation of pre-emplacement landscapes. The new river drainages rapidly evolve from early disconnected streams into dendritic networks via deep incision of the thick, non-welded tuffs. These networks of rivers, in several locations, cross the active trace of the Sumatran Fault Zone, producing systematic right-lateral offsets of nearly isochronous river canyons. The average fault slip rate since eruption is simply determined by dividing the average offset by the eruption age (Bradley et al. 2017; Sieh and Natawidjaja 2000).|$|R
40|$|International audienceStromboli volcano (Italy) is {{characterized}} by a permanent mild explosive activity disrupted by major and <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions.</b> These strong eruptions could be triggered by phreato-magmatic processes.

These measurements include electrical resistivity, induced polarization, self-potential, temper-ature and CO 2 ground concentration. These methods are used in order to delineate the crater boundaries, which act as preferential ﬂuid ﬂow pathways for the upﬂow of hydrothermal ﬂuids. The absence of fumarolic activity in the Fossa area and the ground temperature close to 100 ◦C at a depth of 30 cm indicate that the hydrothermal ﬂuids condense close to the ground surface.

40|$|On the 28 December 2014, {{a violent}} and short <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> {{occurred}} at the South East Crater (SEC) of Mount Etna {{that led to the}} formation of huge niches on the SW and NE flanks of the SEC edifice from which a volume of ~ 3 [*]×[*] 106 [*]m 3 of lava was erupted. Two basaltic lava flows discharged at a rate of ~ 370 [*]m 3 /s, reaching a maximum distance of ~ 5 [*]km. The seismicity during the event was scarce and the eruption was not preceded by any notable ground deformation, which instead was dramatic during and immediately after the event. The SO 2 flux associated with the eruption was relatively low and even decreased few days before. Observations suggest that the paroxysm was not related to the ascent of volatile-rich fresh magma from a deep reservoir (dyke intrusion), but instead to a collapse of a portion of SEC, similar to what happens on exogenous andesitic domes. The sudden and fast discharge eventually triggered a depressurization in the shallow volcano plumbing system that drew up fresh magma from depth. Integration of data and observations has allowed to formulate a novel interpretation of mechanism leading volcanic activity at Mt. Etna and on basaltic volcanoes worldwide...|$|E
40|$|On April 5, 2003, one of {{the largest}} eruptions in the last decades was {{observed}} at Stromboli volcano, Italy. The eruption occurred in a period of increased volcanic activity, following a first explosion in December 2002, which interrupted the typical moderate “Strombolian” behaviour. We present an exhaustive analysis of the available broadband seismic data and relate them to the observed eruption phases. Prominent features of the seismic signals include an ultra long period signal starting a few tens of seconds prior to the explosive eruption as well as a strong energetic signal a few seconds after the onset of the eruption. Both signals are not exactly synchronized with the other geophysical observations. We present a detailed study of those signals using spectral and particle motion techniques. We estimate eruption parameters and seismic source characteristics by different inversion approaches. Results clearly indicate that the <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> was triggered by a shallow slow thrust-faulting dislocation event with a moment magnitude of Mw= 3. 0 and possibly associated with a crack that formed previously by dike extrusion.

40|$|The <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> of Santorini (ca. 3500 BP), {{referred}} to as the Late Bronze Age (LBA) eruption, probably generated multiple tsunami; their occurrence and impacts being cited frequently in scientific papers and articles. This paper examines what is known about any LBA tsunami, noting possible mechanisms of generation and identifying sedimentological traces. Firstly, the eruption sequence is outlined providing the context in which tsunami genesis may have occurred. Secondly, the arguments forwarded for the tsunami and a summary of the evidence is given. Thirdly, results of a new geological investigation for LBA tsunami deposits at 41 coastal sites from Crete and Kos are presented. The data are used to test the hypothesis that the LBA eruption generated an east Mediterranean-wide tsunami. It will be seen that no terrestrial geological evidence is identified. The paper re-examines the original arguments presented for LBA tsunami, challenging them because their founding assumptions are flawed. Together, the new data and the re-analysis of the original tsunami hypothesis indicate that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that any significant far-field tsunami propagated throughout the entire east Mediterranean as frequently purported. Some terrestrial evidence exists to suggest localised near-field tsunami inundation. There is good submarine evidence however, to suggest that a tsunami was focused to the W and WSW. The results have important implications for understanding the volcano-related tsunami hazard within the region and elsewhere. 26 page(s...|$|E

40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} approach based on image analysis of seismic signals, thermodynamics and mass balance {{has been here}} adopted to find quantitative relations between magma degassing at depth and the transition from Strombolian activity to lava fountaining {{for a set of}} <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions</b> occurred at Mt. Etna volcano in March-April 2013. The image processing of the seismogram allows handling of a huge quantity of data, providing a tool for the simple extraction of numerical values. We propose a model based on the consideration that gas outbursts are a vehicle of the transfer of energy tracked by seismic signals during the uprising of magma. Thus, the simple assumption of a relation of proportionality between the energy of the seismic signal and the mass of exsolved gas allows us to interpret transitions of the eruptive style as due to the amount of undegassed magma recharging the feeding system. Changes of this recharge rate in the range of 1 : 20 control the evolution of the eruptive process, and are evidence for the limited area section of the feeding conduit. Being this transition process observed in volcanic regions worldwide, the model can be successfully applied to other basaltic volcanoes. Furthermore, the image analysis technique may be applied to other contexts in which the interpretation of seismograms is necessary...|$|R

A multiparametric approach, consisting of analyzing infrasonic, seismic, and video camera recordings, was carried out to follow its evolution. Volcanological and geophysical observations identified three eruptive phases. In the first phase, infrasonic and seismic characteristics reflected the highly explosive nature of the activity. Waveform characterization of infrasound events confirmed {{the activity of the}} several explosive vents at the summit of Southeast Crater (SEC). During the second phase, results highlighted the decoupling between seismic and infrasonic sources, which was due to the decrease in explosive activity and the reactivation of effusive vents located south of Bocca Nuova and on the saddle between Bocca Nuova and SEC. The third phase was the most intense and was characterized by various volcanic phenomena (pyroclastic flows, jets of dark ash, and white steam). The very high radiated infrasonic energy, together with infrasound event features, led us to infer a gas enrichment of the shallow magma column, preceding by a few minutes and likely related to the pyroclastic flows in the SEC area. After the eruption at SEC, variations in infrasound events related to the activity of Northeast Crater (NEC) were found.

Our data relate to both porphyritic scoria and lava originating in the uppermost parts of the feeding system, plus crystal-poor pumice produced by <b>paroxysmal</b> explosive <b>eruption</b> of deep-seated, fast ascending, magma. The geochemical variations recorded by Stromboli’s products allow us to identify changes in magma dynamics affecting the entire plumbing system. Deep-seated magmas vary in composition between two end-members having different key ratios in strongly incompatible trace elements and Sr isotopes. These features may be ascribed to mantle source processes (fluid/melt enrichment, variable degrees of melting) and occasional contamination by deep, mafic, cumulates. Temporal trends reveal three phases during which magmas with distinct geochemical signatures were erupted. The first phase occurred between the third and fourteenth centuries AD and was characterised by the eruption of evolved magmas sharing geochemical and Sr isotopic compositions {{similar to those of}} earlier periods of activity (< 12 ka—Neostromboli and San Bartolo). The second phase, which began in the sixteenth century and lasted until {{the first half of the}} twentieth century, produced more primitive, less radiogenic, magmas with the lowest Ba/La and Rb/Th ratios of our dataset. The last phase is ongoing and is marked by a magma having the lowest Sr isotopic composition and highest Rb/Th ratio of the dataset.

We conclude that compositional variations within the shallow magma system of a persistently active volcano provide only a biassed signal of ongoing geochemical changes induced by deep magma refilling. We argue that source changes can only be identified by interpreting the geochemistry of pumice, because it reliably represents magma transferred directly from deep portions of the plumbing system to the surface...|$|R

In this paper, a description of the ash monitoring system as occurred during the August-December 2006 summit eruption at the Southeast Crater (SEC) is shown. This eruption was characterized by lava flow effusions and vigorous Strombolian activity. Eighteen paroxysmal episodes occurred up to the end of November, forming weak ash plumes accompanied by moderate tephra fallout over Etna’s slopes. During these events, we applied a multidisciplinary approach to promptly monitor the paroxysmal activity and the associated tephra fallout, through analysis from seismic tremor and observation from live-cameras, sampling operations, mapping and analysis of the deposit. During the most significant episodes, we carried out textural and grain-size analysis on tephra samples and evaluated the whole grain-size deposit and the erupted volume, while numerical simulations of tephra dispersal allowed better understanding eruptive dynamics. An example of this methodology is applied to the 16 November episode, during which seismic tremor furnished important constraints on the chronology. This <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> produced light fallout on the north-east sector of the volcano for about ten hours and a number of debris-avalanches over the slopes of the SEC cone. The erupted deposit was composed for the most part of lithic components and characterized by a whole grain-size distribution centered on 2. 2 , while its total mass was evaluated 7 x 106 kg. On the whole, such integrated studies help to obtain information on magma fragmentation and eruptive mechanisms, to characterize the explosive styles shown by Etna and finally, to better approach the monitoring of imminent eruptions...|$|E
40|$|Pyroclastic density {{currents}} (PDC) related to <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{have caused a}} large number of casualties in the recent history of Stromboli. We combine here a critical review of historical chronicles with detailed stratigraphic,textural, and petrographic analyses of PDC deposits emplaced at Stromboli over the last century to unravel the origin of currents, their flow mechanism and the depositional dynamics. We focus on the 1930 PDC as they are well described in historical accounts and because the 1930 eruption stands as the most voluminous and destructive paroxysm of the last 13 centuries. Stromboli PDC deposits are recognizable from their architecture and the great abundance of fresh, well-preserved juvenile material. General deposit features indicate that Stromboli PDC formed due to the syn-eruptive gravitational collapse of hot pyroclasts rapidly accumulated over steep slopes. Flow channelization within the several small valleys cut on the flanks of the volcano can enhance the mobility of PDC, as well as the production of fine particles by abrasion and comminution of hot juvenile fragments, thereby increasing the degree of fluidization. Textural analyses and historical accounts also indicate that PDC can be fast (15 – 20 m/s) and relatively hot (360 – 700 °C). PDC can thus flow right down the slopes of the volcano, representing a major hazard. For this reason, they must be adequately taken into account when compiling risk maps and evaluating volcanic hazard on the Island of Stromboli...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Fuego volcano, Guatemala {{is a high}} (3, 800 m) {{composite}} volcano that erupts gas-rich, high-Al basalt, often explosively. It spends {{many years}} in an essentially open vent condition, but this activity has not been extensively observed or recorded until now. The volcano towers above a region with several {{tens of thousands of}} people, so that patterns in its activity might have hazard mitigation applications. We conducted 2 years of continu-ous observations at Fuego (2005 – 2007) during which time the activity consisted of minor explosions, persistent degassing, <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions,</b> and lava flows. Radiant heat output from MODIS correlates well with observed changes in eruptive behavior, particularly during abrupt changes from passive lava effusion to paroxysmal erup-tions. A short-period seismometer and two low-frequency microphones installed during the final 6 months of the study period recorded persistent volcanic tremor (1 – 3 Hz) and a variety of explosive eruptions. The remarkable correlation between seismic tremor, thermal output, and daily observational data defines a pattern of repeating eruptive behavior: 1) passive lava effusion and subordinate strombolian explosions, followed by 2) paroxysmal erup-tions that produced sustained eruptive columns, long, rapidly emplaced lava flows, and block and ash flows, and finally 3) periods of discrete degassing explosions with no lava effusion. This study demonstrates the utility of low-cost observations and ground-based and satellite-based remote sensing for identifying changes in volcanic activity in remote regions of underdeveloped countries...|$|R
40|$|Stromboli volcano (Italy) is {{characterized}} by a permanent mild explosive activity disrupted by major and <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions.</b> These strong eruptions could be triggered by phreatomagmatic processes. With the aim of obtaining a better understanding of ground water flow {{in the vicinity of the}} active vents, we carried out a set of geophysical measurements along two profiles crossing the Fossa area (through the Pizzo, the Large and the Small Fossa craters). These measurements include electrical resistivity, induced polarization, self-potential, temperature and CO 2 ground concentration. These methods are used in order to delineate the crater boundaries, which act as preferential fluid flow pathways for the upflow of hydrothermal fluids. The absence of fumarolic activity in the Fossa area and the ground temperature close to 100 °C at a depth of 30 cm indicate that the hydrothermal fluids condense close to the ground surface. Part of this condensed water forms a shallow drainage network (< 20 m) in which groundwater flows downslope toward a perched aquifer. The piezometric surface of this aquifer is located ∼ 20 m below the topographic low of the Small Fossa crater and is close (< 100 m) to the active vents. Electrical resistivity tomography, temperature and CO 2 measurements show that this shallow aquifer separates the underlying hydrothermal body from the ground surface. Further studies are needed to ascertain the size of this aquifer and to check its possible implications for the major and paroxysmal events observed at the Stromboli volcano...|$|R
40|$|On November 3 rd 2002, {{a violent}} gas {{eruption}} occurred E of Panarea Island, {{on top of}} a shallow rise of the seafloor surrounded by the islets of Panarelli, Lisca Bianca, Bottaro, Lisca Nera and Dattilo. A 5. 6 M earthquake about 30 km offshore Palermo on September 6 th and the onset of the strong Etna eruption on October 27 th preceded the gas emissions, while they were followed by the <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> at Stromboli that started on December 28 th. The gas eruption at Panarea coincided with a low magnitude (< 1. 8 M) seismicity occurred November 2 nd. On November 3 rd fishermen reported intense sulphurous smell, dead fishes and seawater boiling between the islets. Three main vents displaying m-sized bubbles could be seen on the sea surface due to sulfur flocculate and suspended sediments. Concern for the degassing induced the DPC and INGV to start a monitoring program aimed to the forecasting of hazard scenarios for Panarea and the islets. The project focused on the study of the still poorly known structure and volcanology of the submarine area near the islets along with a review and implementation of the stratigraphy relative to the recent explosive activity. Particular interest was dedicated to provide more information on the evolution from the submarine to the subaerial explosive activity of Panarea dome and on its collapse structure. The research followed a multidisciplinary approach merging new data and data from the literature in a coherent model by means of field work and laboratory analyses together with a high-resolution DTM that allowed the 3 D spatial analysis of the volcanic complex, in order to give new insights on the volcanic evolution of the PVC together with their implication on hazard scenarios...|$|E
40|$|After the 6 month-long effusive {{event of}} 2002 - 2003, a new lava {{effusion}} occurred at Stromboli between 27 February and 2 April 2007. Despite the different durations, {{approximately the same}} volume of magma was emitted in both eruptions, {{in the order of}} 107 m 3. A <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> occurred at the summit craters in both the 2002 – 2003 and 2007 episodes, during which a signiﬁcant amount of low porphyritic (LP), volatile- rich magma was erupted. In both cases, the paroxysm did not interrupt the lava emission. Here, we present compositional data, including texture, mineralogy, chemistry and Sr and Nd isotope ratios of bulk-rock, groundmass and separated minerals of lavas erupted in 2007, together with chemistry and Sr and Nd isotope composition of the pumices emitted during the 15 March paroxysm. As a whole, the lavas have the same texture and chemistry that characterize the highly porphyritic (HP) products usually erupted at Stromboli during normal Strombolian activity and effusive events. Compared to the previous HP products, the 2007 lavas show minor but systematic mineralogical and isotopic variations which are consistent with a modest increase of the magma supply rate of the volcano. Compositional variations during the entire duration of the event are very modest. Glass chemistry changes in lavas erupted {{in the second half of}} March can be explained by theminormixing between the volatile-rich LPmagma rising through the shallowmagmatic systemduring the 15 March paroxysm and the degassed residing HP magma. A ﬁrst conclusion of this study is that there is no compositional evidence supporting major changes in the magma dynamics of the volcano accompanying the effusive activity, as also suggested for the 2002 – 2003 event. The activity of Stromboli is controlled by a steady state feeding system in which reﬁlling, mixing, degassing and crystallization at shallow level continuously operate,withmodest oscillations in themagma supply rate. Switching between normal Strombolian and effusive activity is related to periods of relatively more vigorous reﬁlling of the shallow system, leading to progressive pressure increase in the upper conduits associated with only minor compositional variations in the erupted products...|$|E
40|$|The Axum-Adwa igneous complex {{consists}} of a basalt-trachyte (syenite) suite emplaced at the northern periphery of the Ethiopian plateau, after the <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruption</b> of the Oligocene (ca 30 Ma) Continental Flood Basalts (CFB), which {{is related to the}} Afar plume activity. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and K-Ar ages, carried {{out for the first time}} on felsic and basaltic rocks, constrain the magmatic age of the greater part of the complex around Axum to 19 - 15 Ma, whereas trachytic lavas from volcanic centres NE of Adwa are dated ca 27 Ma. The felsic compositions straddle the critical SiO 2 -saturation boundary, ranging from normative quartz trachyte lavas east of Adwa to normative (and modal) nepheline syenite subvolcanic domes (the obelisks stones of ancient axumites) around Axum. Petrogenetic modelling based on rock chemical data and phase equilibria calculations by PELE (Boudreau, 1999) show that low-pressure fractional crystallization processes, starting from mildly alkaline- and alkaline-basalts comparable to those present in the complex, could generate SiO 2 -saturated trachytes and SiO 2 -undersaturated syenites, respectively, which correspond to residual liquid fractions of 17 and 10 %. The observed differentiation processes are consistent with the development of rifting events and formation of shallow magma chambers plausibly located between displaced (tilted) crustal blocks that favoured trapping of basaltic parental magmas and their fractionation to felsic differentiates. In syenitic domes, late- to post-magmatic processes are sometimes evidenced by secondary mineral associations (e. g. Bete Giorgis dome) which overprint the magmatic parageneses, and mainly induce additional nepheline and sodic pyroxene neo-crystallization. These metasomatic reactions were promoted by the circulation of Na-Cl rich deuteric fluids (600 - 400 °C), as indicated by mineral and bulk rock chemical budgets as well as by  18 O analyses on mineral separates. The occurrence of this magmatism post-dating the CFB event, characterised by comparatively lower volume of more alkaline products, conforms to the progressive vanishing of the Afar plume thermal effects and the parallel decrease of the partial melting degrees of the related mantle sources. This evolution is also concomitant with the variation of the tectono-magmatic regime from regional lithospheric extension (CFB eruption) to localized rifting processes that favoured magmatic differentiation...|$|E

40|$|From 11 January to 15 November 2011, 18 <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{occurred}} at Etna, Italy. These events {{belong to a}} long sequence of eruptive episodes, which marked the prevalent explosive style of the volcano since the early 2000 s. Applying “KKAnalysis”, a software for pattern classification that combines Self­Organizing Maps and fuzzy clustering, to the background seismic radiation (so-called volcanic tremor), {{we were able to}} detect critical changes in the spectral characteristics (amplitude and frequency content) at a very early stage of the volcano unrest. The online implementation for surveillance purposes of KKAnalysis provided automatic alert of the impending eruptive events from hours to a few days in advance. In its original version, the classifier analyzed the data stream continuously recorded at a single seismic station. By using offline a modified version of KKAnalysis, here we apply the software to the seismic signal recorded at 11 broadband stations in 2011. The seismic sensors were located at various distances (from 1 to 8 km) from the active craters. The continuous records and the optimal geometry of the seismic network offer us the possibility to track the spectral variations in time and space. We show the new results of pattern classification and propose a revised, more powerful multi­station alert method that now provides short­ term forecasting also in the form of animated maps that flag the detection of changes at each station. This allows us to observe how the unrest develops in various sectors of the volcano. We discuss the performance of the method and the robustness of the eruption forecasts {{in the context of the}} complex dynamics of a volcanic system such as Etna...|$|R
