These techniques are applied to the study of congruences of modular forms and modular Galois representations modulo <b>prime</b> <b>powers.</b> Finally, some computational results with implications on the (non-) liftability of modular forms modulo <b>prime</b> <b>powers</b> and possible generalisations of level raising will be presented...|$|R

25|$|This {{section is}} an {{informal}} introduction to -adic numbers, using {{examples from the}} ring of 10-adic (decadic) numbers. Although for p-adic numbers p should be a prime, base 10 was chosen to highlight the analogy with decimals. The decadic numbers are generally not used in mathematics: since 10 is not prime or <b>prime</b> <b>power,</b> the decadics are not a field. More formal constructions and properties are given below.|$|E

25|$|Cyclic {{groups of}} {{integers}} modulo n, Z/nZ, {{were among the}} first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of <b>prime</b> <b>power</b> order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The automorphism group of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of Georg Frobenius and Ludwig Stickelberger and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of linear algebra.|$|E
25|$|Production {{of rolling}} {{stock in the}} area had started already back in 1889, and new {{facilities}} were built in 1898 in an area recently gained. As the new premises were next to railway connection, transportation of products became easier. During 1898–1899 a new sawmill building was constructed from bricks to {{the border of the}} factory area, next to Tokankatu street. A brick-made pump house was built in 1899 and in the following year it was equipped by steam powered centrifugal pump made by Scottish Drysdale & Co. At the same time a new <b>prime</b> <b>power</b> machinery building with a chimney was constructed next to it, to the place of the old sawmill and storage. The boiler installed was a used 6-bar steam boiler taken from a shipwrecked Scottish vessel S/S Jupiter.|$|E
