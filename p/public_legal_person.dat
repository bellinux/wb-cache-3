It also describes the global financial crisis and demonstrates conclusions adopted earlier against its background. The basis of the thesis is the description of the Czech National Bank as an institution and position of its representatives. It focuses on the independence of the central bank and it mentions its responsibility in this context. These phenomena are analyzed on the basis of constitutional and statutory texts and a conclusion is drawn on a relatively high independence and only a small responsibility of the Czech National Bank. We stress that the Czech Naitonal Bank is a highly transparent institution. Attention is paid to the organizational and personal structure of the Czech National Bank. In the first part of the thesis, the Czech National Bank is defined as a <b>public</b> <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> representing one degree of the two-degree bank system endowed with a high level of independence. The following parts deal with the activities of the CNB. In particular they define monetary policy, its aims and tools, issuing activity, [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Considering the {{expanding}} functions {{and activities of}} public authorities the concept of public money has been attracting more and more attention. This category is very complex as the concepts {{of the public sector}} and public finance themselves are not explicitly defined. In the theory of finance many equivalents of the term public money can be found, such as public funds, public monetary resources, public spending. Even though the public finance act lists sources of public money, this does not resolve many theoretical and practical problems with subjecting a given type of funds to laws that are applicable to public money. The distinguishing trail of the Polish public finance system is the multiplicity of organizations that spend public money and the declining role of the national budget in its redistribution. 20 K. Mościbrodzka, Obciążenia wydatków publicznych restrukturyzacją schyłkowych gałęzi gospodarki, „Studia Finansowe”, nr 57, Instytut Finansów Wyższej Szkoły Ubezpieczeń i Bankowości, Warszawa 2001, s. 151. At the same time the role of funds and agencies that spend public money has been growing. This phenomenon should be deemed negative as it hinders rational comprehensive (that is holistic) management of public money. Besides, the diversification of organizations that are allowed to manage public money constrains the parliamentary control of its use. On January 1, 2001, the act “admissibility criteria of public assistance for entrepreneurs and its supervising” was put into effect. It aims to enhance rational spending of public money, to set up a public assistance system addressing entrepreneurs and to harmonize Polish and the EU laws with respect to protecting competition in the market sector. The act applies not only to entrepreneurs but also to a large number of <b>public</b> <b>legal</b> <b>persons</b> that offer assistance funded from public money either directly or indirectly.

Safety requirements are somewhat higher in Germany as qualified electronic signatures can only be created with the use of smart cards. In the Czech Republic, it is possible to create them just with software tools and at lower costs.
