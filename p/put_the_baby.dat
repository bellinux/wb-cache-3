5|$|As {{the family}} eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her {{intention}} {{to become a}} surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset {{at the thought of}} her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she should have an abortion or continue with the pregnancy and <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> up for adoption.|$|E
25|$|Caesarean section, {{also known}} as C-section or {{caesarean}} delivery, {{is the use of}} surgery to deliver one or more babies. A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> or mother at risk. This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible. The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.|$|E
500|$|Julia Stanley married Alfred ("Alf" [...] or [...] "Fred") Lennon on 3 December 1938, and on 9 October 1940, the couple's {{first and}} only child was born. Mimi phoned the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital that evening {{and was told that}} Julia had given birth to a boy. According to Mimi, she went {{straight}} to the hospital during the middle of an air raid, and was forced to hide in doorways to avoid the shrapnel. She ran, as she later recalled, [...] "as fast as my legs could carry me". When a parachute-borne landmine fell outside the hospital, she later said, [...] "My sister [...] stayed in bed, and they <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> [...] under the bed. They wanted me to go into the basement, but I wouldn't. I ran {{all the way back to}} Newcastle Road to tell father [...] the news. 'Get under the shelter,' the wardens were shouting. 'Oh, be quiet,' I told them." [...] The story about the air-raid has since been repudiated, as there was no attack that night. The previous raid had been on 21–22 September, and the next was on 16 October, when the areas of Walton and Everton were badly hit.|$|E

2500|$|While an {{undergraduate}} in {{college at the}} age of 22, the unmarried Ireland became pregnant with a daughter. After discussing the situation with her parents, she went to a special home for single mothers in Colorado where she gave birth. Ireland <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> up for adoption, in what she called [...] "...one of the worst things that ever happened in my life" [...] and [...] "the hardest decision I've ever had to make in my life." [...] She later joined an adoption registry and re-united with her then adult daughter in 1997. Ireland chose to speak out about the adoption as a Justice, saying [...] "I wanted to help reduce some of the shame around issues of adoption and let young people know that you can be a birth parent and still go on and have a successful career and a successful life." ...|$|E
60|$|In Carol's own {{twenty-four hours}} a day she got up, dressed the baby, had breakfast, talked to Oscarina about the day's shopping, <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> on the porch to play, went to the butcher's to choose between steak and pork chops, bathed the baby, nailed up a shelf, had dinner, <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to bed for a nap, paid the iceman, read for an hour, took the baby out for a walk, called on Vida, had supper, <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to bed, darned socks, listened to Kennicott's yawning comment on what a fool Dr. McGanum was to try to use that cheap X-ray outfit of his on an epithelioma, {{repaired}} a frock, drowsily heard Kennicott stoke the furnace, tried to read a page of Thorstein Veblen--and the day was gone.|$|E

60|$|Anna, {{with true}} woman's kindness, asked no questions. She <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> {{carefully}} {{away in a}} trunk, saw Caroline safely to bed in the best room, {{and returned to her}} seat by the fire.|$|E
60|$|Not {{being able}} to discover, and not {{rendering}} the subject much clearer by shaking it, Mrs. Tetterby <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> away in a cradle, and, folding her arms, sat rocking it angrily with her foot.|$|E
60|$|Rilla {{was singing}} upstairs as she <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to bed. Paris was saved--the war was over--Germany had lost--there {{would soon be}} an end now--Jem and Jerry would be back. The black clouds had rolled by.|$|E
60|$|That evening Mrs Bones {{returned}} {{without her}} husband, {{but with an}} additional black eye, and other signs of bad treatment. She found <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> sound asleep, and Tottie in the same condition by his side, {{on the outside of}} the poor counterpane, with one arm round her charge, and her hair tumbled in confusion over him. She had evidently been herself overcome while in <b>the</b> act of <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to sleep.|$|R
50|$|Portia {{long ago}} {{had a secret}} pregnancy, <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> up for adoption, and is shown {{apparent}} proof by Pressman that Jeremiah is her son. Although he is brilliant, Jeremiah's miserable transcript results in his being deemed unfit to attend the University. Portia, in an act that greatly endangers her position, schemes to gain Jeremiah entrance into the school, knowing that Princeton cannot reveal such a scandal.|$|R
50|$|Realising that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> is {{no longer}} worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> crawls down to the street and into a {{construction}} site. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> crawls from one steel beam to another while the cat and mouse look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> from crawling off a wooden plank by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> diaper on himself while <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> crawls off, nonchalantly.|$|R

60|$|Mildred <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> in an arm-chair {{and looked}} round the room. She {{recognised}} {{most of the}} things which she had known in his old diggings.

"Now," [...] said Mary Erskine to the children, as {{they were}} sitting at the table, {{at the close of}} the breakfast, and after Thomas had gone away, [...] "you may go out and play for an hour while I finish my morning work, and <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to sleep, and then I want you to come in and have a school." ...|$|E
5000|$|The sleep advice {{given by}} Baby Wise {{is similar to}} Richard Ferber's advice given in his popular book Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems. The Ferber method of getting a baby to sleep {{includes}} <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to bed when awake; <b>the</b> same as <b>Baby</b> Wise. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> is expected {{to learn how to}} fall asleep alone. Both methods warn the parents against using aids such as a pacifier to ease <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> into sleep, and both methods describe <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> infant to sleep without rocking, cuddling or nursing applied {{for the sole purpose of}} putting child to sleep. [...] "Crying it out" [...] is expected from the infant during the early training periods, until about eight weeks of age.|$|R

She did not ask why the boys slept alone in the cabin, but her aunt felt that she must explain.|$|R

60|$|Inez {{was much}} impressed. She began to regard Mildred more amicably. If she {{were not a}} witch-woman, she reflected, {{there was no reason}} to fear her. The Mexican girl thought deeply on what she had heard, during the next half hour. She watched Mildred <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to sleep and then take up a book to read as she sat beside the crib. Inez went out into the deserted court and {{squatting}} beside the fountain pondered upon the fascinating mysteries of the old house.|$|E
60|$|They {{turned the}} canoe bottom up {{to serve as}} a partial shelter; they kindled a huge fire before it; they set up three large fat ducks to roast in front of it, and were soon busy with a simple but {{satisfying}} supper. After washing this down with an unstimulating draught of pure water, they <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to bed under the bow of the canoe, filled their pipes, and sat down before the ruddy blaze to mingle their hopes, joys, prospects, and sorrows in a halo of smoke--the very personification of primitive contentment and felicity.|$|E
2500|$|While {{breastfeeding}} {{difficulties are}} not uncommon, <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to <b>the</b> breast {{as soon as}} possible after birth helps to avoid many problems. The policy of the American Academy of Pediatrics on breastfeeding says, [...] "delay weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis until after the first feeding is completed." [...] Many breastfeeding difficulties can be resolved with proper hospital procedures, properly trained nurses and hospital staff, speech pathologists and lactation consultants. Another source of information is the volunteer-based breastfeeding promotion organization, La Leche League.|$|R

Fortunately, Cheryl and <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> are soon out of danger.|$|R
50|$|When {{planning}} a family, {{women should be}} aware that reproductive risks increase with the age of the woman. Like older men, older women have a higher chance of having a child with autism or Down syndrome, the chances of having multiple births increases, which cause further late-pregnancy risks, they have an increased chance of developing gestational diabetes, the need for a Caesarian section is greater, older women's bodies are not as well-suited for delivering a <b>baby.</b> <b>The</b> risk of prolonged labor is higher. Older mothers have a higher risk of a long labor, <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> in distress.|$|R
60|$|Thomasin {{took the}} child and ran. When {{she came to the}} covered car the horse, though fresh from the stable, was {{standing}} perfectly still, as if conscious of misfortune. She saw for the first time whose it was. She nearly fainted, and would have been unable to proceed another step but that the necessity of preserving the little girl from harm nerved her to an amazing self-control. In this agony of suspense she entered the house, <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> in a place of safety, woke the lad and the female domestic, and ran out to give the alarm at the nearest cottage.|$|E
60|$|We stayed {{talking for}} some time when Meg had <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to bed. George had a new tone of {{assurance}} and authority. In the first place he was an established man, living in a large house, having altogether three men working for him. In the second place he had ceased to value the conventional treasures of social position and ostentatious refinement. Very, very many things he condemned as flummery and sickly waste of time. The life of an ordinary well-to-do person he set down as adorned futility, almost idiocy. He spoke passionately of the monstrous denial of life to the many by the fortunate few. He talked at Lettie most flagrantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Bobby, {{how could}} you ever think that! Well, I <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> out to board with a family {{of the name of}} Twitter.
