40|$|AbstractThe inflexibility of {{existing}} serological techniques for detection of rabies in surveillance constrains the benefit {{to be gained}} from many current control strategies. We analysed 304 serum samples from Tanzanian dogs for the detection of rabies antibodies in a <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay</b> using lentiviral vectors bearing the CVS- 11 envelope glycoprotein. Compared with the widely used gold standard fluorescent antibody virus neutralisation assay, a specificity of 100 % and sensitivity of 94. 4 % with a strong correlation of antibody titres (r= 0. 915) were observed with the <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay.</b> To increase the assay's surveillance specificity in Africa we incorporated the envelope glycoprotein of local viruses, Lagos bat virus, Duvenhage virus or Mokola virus and also cloned the lacZ gene to provide a reporter element. Neutralisation assays using pseudotypes bearing these glycoproteins reveal that they provide a greater sensitivity compared to similar live virus assays and will therefore allow a more accurate determination of the distribution of these highly pathogenic infections and the threat they pose to human health. Importantly, the CVS- 11 pseudotypes were highly stable during freeze–thaw cycles and storage at room temperature. These results suggest the proposed <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay</b> is a suitable option for undertaking lyssavirus serosurveillance in areas most affected by these infections...|$|E
40|$|The severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) {{spike protein}} (S) {{is a major}} target for neutralizing antibodies. Retroviral SARS-CoV S pseudotypes have been constructed and used to develop an in vitro microneutralization assay that is both sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. Neutralization titers measured by this assay are highly correlated to those measured by an assay using replication-competent SARS-CoV. No cross-neutralization occurred with human sera known to contain antibodies to coronavirus strains OC 43 and 229 E. The <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay</b> was used to profile neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV S in sequential serum samples taken from 41 confirmed SARS patients during the 2003 outbreak in Hong Kong and shows long-lasting immunity in most recovered patients.

40|$|The inflexibility of {{existing}} serological techniques for rabies {{can make it}} difficult to monitor the impact of current control strategies. We have developed a neutralisation assay that uses lentiviral pseudotypes (comprising the outer envelope of rabies virus, human immunodeficiency virus core and a packageable reporter gene) as antigen vectors. The assay can be used for vaccine evaluation, serosurveillance and antiviral screening in low-containment laboratories within developed and resource-limited countries. Post-vaccination serum antibody titres determined using the fluorescent antibody virus neutralisation assay and <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay</b> show a specificity of 100 %, sensitivity of 96. 4 % and strong correlation (r= 0. 85; p< 0. 001). To increase the assay’s utility we incorporated the envelope glycoprotein of lyssavirus isolates from genotypes 1 - 7 and a range of different reporter genes.

40|$|The {{research}} of virus host cell entry {{is essential for}} anti-viral drug development. However, for coronaviruses, such as the highly pathogenic SARS virus, the entry mechanisms are not yet fully discovered. Therefore, many research groups are currently studying the activation of the coronavirus spike protein, which mediates fusion between the viral envelope and plasma membrane. In many fundamental studies, artificial assays are used instead of genuine virus to circumvent the requirement for a high Biosafety level. In this thesis, we discuss systems as <b>pseudotyping</b> <b>assays,</b> cell-cell fusion assays, virus-like particles and some reconstituted systems as well. Some of these systems also have purposes outside viral entry research, for example in gene therapy, targeted drug-delivery and anti-cancer treatment by specifically altering the tropism of the vector to the target cells. Pseudotyping and other artificial assays have the advantages of being allowed to be performed less stringent biosafety conditions and making reverse genetics easier to perform. However, all experimental systems have limitations which we evaluated. While VSV∆G and retrovirus based <b>pseudotyping</b> <b>assays</b> gave comparable results as authentic virus, real virus has still to be taken along as well. Cell-cell fusion assays are simplistic systems to study the basic functionality of a fusion protein. However, these assays gave contradictory results in comparison to virus entry in some studies, which {{can be explained by}} the difference in the interaction context. Therefore, cell-cell fusion assays are not suitable to study entry mediation by fusion proteins. The experimenter has to choose the systems carefully to approach his questions, because of the limitations of the experimental set ups. Finally, we try to experimentally set up a new pseudotyping system based on the coronavirus Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV). We also make a stable cell line expressing recombinant MHV spike protein which could be used for both retrovirus and this new <b>pseudotyping</b> <b>assay...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{envelope}} glycoproteins (SU) of mammalian type C retroviruses {{possess an}} amino-terminal domain of about 200 residues, which {{is involved in}} binding a cell surface receptor. In this domain, highly conserved amino acid sequences are interrupted by two segments of variable length and sequence, VRA and VRB. We have studied the role of these variable regions in receptor recognition and binding by constructing chimeric molecules in which portions of the amino-terminal domains from amphotropic (4070 A), xenotropic (NZB), and polytropic (MCF 247) murine leukemia virus SU proteins were permuted. These chimeras, which exchanged either one or two variable regions, were expressed at the surface of replication-defective viral particles by a <b>pseudotyping</b> <b>assay.</b> Wild-type or recombinant env genes were transfected into a cell line producing Moloney murine leukemia virus particles devoid of envelope glycoproteins in which a retrovirus vector genome carrying an Escherichia coli lacZ gene was packaged. The host range and sensitivity to interference of <b>pseudotyped</b> virions were <b>assayed,</b> and we observed which permutations resulted in receptor switch or loss of function.

40|$|The {{continuous}} rapid {{genetic and}} antigenic evolution of H 5 subtype influenza viruses has major {{implications for the}} sensitivity of serological assays and can limit the efficacy of pre-pandemic human vaccines {{and the ability to}} undertake effective sero-surveillance in susceptible populations. A panel of serum samples collected from the Italian population between 1992 and 2007 and previously found to be positive for antibodies against H 5 N 1 as determined by SRH, were evaluated using pseudotype based neutralisation assays in combination with haemagglutination-inhibition assays using a clade 1 and a clade 2 H 5 N 1 serological antigen.

Rabies virus currently causes > 50, 000 deaths/year across the developing world although the impact of non-rabies lyssaviruses remains unclear. Antigenically, lyssaviruses are currently characterised into three phylogroups based on studies detailing vaccination/challenge experimentation. All current rabies vaccines are based on passage attenuated rabies isolates belonging to phylogroup I. The serological response following vaccination with the current vaccines have been shown experimentally to provide no protection against viruses from phylogroups II and III.

40|$|AbstractThree N-linked {{glycosylation}} {{sites were}} removed from the envelope glycoproteins of Friend, Moloney, and AKV mouse ecotropic gammaretroviruses: gs 1 and gs 2, in the receptor binding domain; and gs 8, in a region implicated in post-binding cell fusion. Mutants were tested for their ability to infect rodent cells expressing 4 CAT- 1 receptor variants. Three mutants (Mo-gs 1, Mo-gs 2, and Fr-gs 1) infect NIH 3 T 3 and rat XC cells, but are severely restricted in Mus dunni cells and Lec 8, a Chinese hamster cell line susceptible to ecotropic virus. This restriction is reproduced in ferret cells expressing M. dunni dCAT- 1, but not in cells expressing NIH 3 T 3 mCAT- 1. Virus binding <b>assays,</b> <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assays,</b> and the use of glycosylation inhibitors further suggest that restriction is primarily due to receptor polymorphism and, in M. dunni cells, to glycosylation of cellular proteins.

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that nasal immunization of anesthetized mice with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) virus-like particles (VLPs) is highly effective at inducing both neutralizing immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG in genital secretions, while parenteral immunization induced only neutralizing IgG. Our data also demonstrated that both isotypes are similarly neutralizing {{according to an}} in vitro <b>pseudotyped</b> neutralization <b>assay.</b> However, {{it is known that}} various amounts of IgA and IgG are produced in genital secretions along the estrous cycle. Therefore, we have investigated how this variation influences the amount of HPV 16 neutralizing antibodies induced after immunization with VLPs. We have compared parenteral and nasal protocols of vaccination with daily samplings of genital secretions of mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis showed that total IgA and IgG inversely varied along the estrous cycle, with the largest amounts of IgA in proestrus-estrus and the largest amount of IgG in diestrus. This resulted in HPV 16 neutralizing titers of IgG only being achieved during diestrus upon parenteral immunization. In contrast, nasal vaccination induced neutralizing titers of IgA plus IgG throughout the estrous cycle, as confirmed by in vitro <b>pseudotyped</b> neutralization <b>assays.</b> Our data suggest that mucosal immunization might be more efficient than parenteral immunization at inducing continuous protection of the female genital tract...|$|R
40|$|Syncytin {{genes are}} fusogenic {{envelope}} protein (env) genes of retroviral origin {{that have been}} captured for a function in placenta-tion. Within rodents, two such genes have previously been identified in the mouse-related clade, allowing a demonstration of their essential role via knockout mice. Here, we searched for similar genes in a secondmajor clade of the Rodentia order, the squirrel-related clade, {{taking advantage of the}} complete sequencing of the ground squirrel Ictidomys tridecemlineatus genome. In silico search for env genes with full coding capacity identified several candidate genes with one displaying placenta-specific expression, as revealed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of a large panel of tissues. This gene belongs to a de-generate endogenous retroviral element, with recognizable hallmarks of an integrated provirus. Cloning of the gene in an ex-pression vector for ex vivo cell-cell fusion and <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assays</b> demonstrated fusogenicity on a large panel of mammalian cells. In situ hybridization on placenta sections showed specific expression in domains where trophoblast cells fuse into a syncytiotro-phoblast at the fetomaternal interface, consistent with a role in syncytium formation. Finally, we show that the gene is conserved among the tribe Marmotini, thus dating its capture back to about at least 25 million years ago, with evidence for purifying selec-tion and conservation of fusogenic activity.

40|$|The {{remarkable}} infectivity and virulence of the 1918 {{influenza virus}} {{resulted in an}} unprecedented pandemic, raising {{the question of whether}} it is possible to develop protective immunity to this virus and whether immune evasion may have contributed to its spread. Here, we report that the highly lethal 1918 virus is susceptible to immune protection by a preventive vaccine, and we define its mechanism of action. Immunization with plasmid expression vectors encoding hemagglutinin (HA) elicited potent CD 4 and CD 8 cellular responses as well as neutralizing antibodies. Antibody specificity and titer were defined by a microneutralization and a <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay</b> that could assess antibody specificity without the need for high-level biocontainment. This pseudotype inhibition assay can define evolving serotypes of influenza viruses and facilitate the development of immune sera and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that may help contain pandemic influenza. Notably, mice vaccinated with 1918 HA plasmid DNAs showed complete protection to lethal challenge. T cell depletion had no effect on immunity, but passive transfer of purified IgG from anti-H 1 (1918) immunized mice provided protective immunity for naïve mice challenged with infectious 1918 virus. Thus, humoral immunity directed at the viral HA can protect against the 1918 pandemic virus...|$|E

Current diagnostic tests are expensive, and as such are not readily performed in resource limited settings. To overcome this, lentiviral pseudotypes have been applied as an alternative platform for post vaccinal assessment and serosurveillance. The assay requires a small amount of serum in comparison to the standard fluorescent virus neutralisation assay (FAVN). Furthermore, the ability to tailor the assay according to facilities available through flexibility of reporter gene expression enables transfer of this technology across areas where the virus remains endemic, i. e. Africa and Asia. These reporter gene detection systems eliminate the need for expensive equipment and facilities allowing the assay to be performed in laboratories throughout the world.

40|$|A {{series of}} Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} (Mo-MuLV) {{envelope}} gene constructs were analyzed for biological activity. Three classes of recombinant envelopes were examined: insertions, deletions, and chimeras. Insertion (4 to 5 amino acids) and deletion (31 to 62 amino acids) mutants spanned most of the SU (gp 70) -coding region and were all biologically inactive. Radioimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that the mutant envelope proteins were incorrectly processed. The Pr 80 env envelope precursor proteins failed to obtain the proper posttranslational modifications and were not cleaved into SU (gp 70) and TM (p 15 E), suggesting that disruption of Pr 80 env structure prevents intracellular transport and processing. To analyze the functional domains of the SU portion of the Env protein, we assembled several chimeric constructs. In these constructs, portions of the ecotropic Mo-MuLV envelope gene were replaced with corresponding sequences from the 4070 A amphotropic MuLV envelope. Using a retroviral vector <b>pseudotyping</b> <b>assay,</b> 5 of 12 chimeric envelope proteins were shown to be biologically active. Host range was determined by retroviral vector transduction of the appropriate cell, by viral interference studies, and by the productive infection of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the murine ecotropic receptor.

40|$|Mucosal {{transmission}} {{accounts for}} the majority of new human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infections and results in a genetically and phenotypically homogenous founder virus population in 60 - 80 percent of cases. Biological properties common to these transmitted and founder (T/F) viruses but not chronic control (CC) viruses would define key targets for microbicides and vaccines. To identify such properties, we tested 45 T/F and 52 CC envelope glycoproteins (Envs) from the best studied and most prevalent HIV- 1 subtypes (B and C, respectively) in various <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assays</b> to determine their receptor and coreceptor interaction, tropism for primary CD 4 + T cell subsets, and sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. T/F Envs were unable to mediate entry into cells expressing low amounts of CD 4, thus macrophages and other CD 4 low cells likely do not support their replication during mucosal transmission. In contrast, T/F Env pseudoviruses efficiently infected primary memory CD 4 + T cells with a preference for the effector rather than central memory subset, as did CC pseudoviruses. There was a trend towards increased sensitivity of T/F viruses to neutralization by antibodies targeting the CD 4 binding site. All T/F Envs were able to use the coreceptor CCR 5 for cell entry, whereas some CC Envs used CXCR 4 alone. However, one bona fide T/F virus entered and replicated very poorly in CCR 5 + cells in vitro, so efficient use of CCR 5 a...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFunctional {{studies of}} HIV- 1 {{envelope}} glycoproteins (Envs) commonly include {{the generation of}} pseudoviruses, which are produced by co-transfection of rev–vpu–env cassettes with an env-deficient provirus. Here, we describe six Env constructs from transmitted/founder HIV- 1 that were defective in the <b>pseudotyping</b> <b>assay,</b> although two produced infectious virions when expressed from their cognate proviruses. All of these constructs exhibited an unusual gene arrangement in which the first exon of rev (rev 1) and vpu {{were in the same}} reading frame without an intervening stop codon. Disruption of the rev 1 –vpu fusion gene by frameshift mutation, stop codon, or abrogation of the rev initiation codon restored pseudovirion infectivity. Introduction of the fusion gene into wildtype Env cassettes severely compromised their function. The defect was not due to altered env and rev transcription or a dominant negative effect of the expressed fusion protein, but seemed to be caused by inefficient translation at the env initiation codon. Although the rev 1 –vpu polymorphism affects Env expression only in vitro, it can cause problems in studies requiring Env complementation, such as analyses of co-receptor usage and neutralization properties, since 3 % of subtype A, 20 % of subtype C and 5 % of CRF 01 _A/E viruses encode the fusion gene. A solution is to eliminate the rev initiation codon when amplifying rev–vpu–env cassettes since this increases Env expression irrespective of the presence of the polymorphism...|$|R

Initial single blind screens were conducted with 10 μM compound in triplicate with a minimum efficacy of 90 % required for lead selection. Lead compounds were then further characterised to determine the median efficacy (IC 50), cytotoxicity (CC 50) and the in vitro therapeutic index in live virus and <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay</b> formats. Results While a number of leads were identified, the current work describes three commercially available compounds: brilliant green, gentian violet and gliotoxin, identified as having potent antiviral activity against Nipah and Hendra virus. Similar efficacy was observed against pseudotyped Nipah and Hendra virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and human parainfluenza virus type 3 while only gliotoxin inhibited an influenza A virus suggesting a non-specific, broad spectrum activity for this compound.

The continuous rapid evolution of these subtypes {{and the emergence of}} new variants influence the ability to undertake effective surveillance. Retroviral pseudotypes bearing influenza haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) envelope glycoproteins represent a flexible platform for sensitive, readily standardized influenza serological assays. We describe a multiplex assay for the study of neutralizing antibodies that are directed against both influenza H 5 and H 7 HA. This assay permits the measurement of neutralizing antibody responses against two antigenically distinct HAs in the same serum/plasma sample thus increasing the amount and quality of serological data that can be acquired from valuable sera.

Our previous studies have resulted in the identification of animals within a research herd of inbred miniature swine that lack the capacity to transmit PERV to human cells in vitro. In contrast, other animals were capable of PERV transmission. The PERVs that were transmitted to human cells are recombinants between PERV-A and PERV-C in the post-VRA region of the envelope (B. A.

Methods: Pseudotyped viruses expressing H 5 N 1 virus hemagglutinin were constructed. Herb-medicated sera were prepared by feeding Wistar rats traditional Chinese herbal compounds. Then inhibitory effects of different drug-medicated sera against pseudotyped virus were evaluated based on incubating serum with pseudotyped viruses or target cells such as Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and human embryonic kidney cell line 293 T cells, and the expression of hemagglutinin (HA) protein was detected by flow cytometry. Results: Pseudotyped virus could be neutralized by specific 2 B 4 monoclonal antibody at doses of 50 μL (500 μg), 25 μL (250 μg) and 12. 5 μL (125 μg), which showed {{that it was a}} feasible assay to screen drugs. No significant difference was observed in inhibition against H 5 N 1 pseudotyped virus between herb-medicated sera and control serum (P＞ 0. 05), meanwhile, the herb-medicated sera also could not inhibit HA expression.

40|$|Background: The {{study of}} heterosubtypic {{antibody}} responses directed against influenza A haemagglutinins in human populations {{is an important}} facet of pandemic preparedness. The evaluation of the ability of vaccines to increase heterosubtypic antibody responses to confer broad protection against different influenza subtypes is one approach to this. Classic serological assays, such as haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralisation, have demonstrated low sensitivity {{for the detection of}} cross-neutralising antibodies, especially those directed against epitopes in the haemagglutinin HA 2 stalk region. For this reason {{there is a need for}} new assay formulations that are able to detect and quantify these heterosubtypic antibody responses. Influenza pseudotypes represent safe tools to study the neutralising antibody response since they are replication-defective viruses and they harbour on their envelope only the haemagglutinin that is the major target of this response. Materials and Methods: We have generated a panel of group 2 influenza A pseudotypes (H 3 A/Udorn/ 307 / 1972, H 4 A/duck/Czechoslovakia/ 1956, H 7 A/chicken/Italy/ 1082 / 1999, H 10 A/chicken/Germany/N 49, H 14 A/mallard/Astrakhan/ 263 / 1982, H 15 A/shearwater/West Australia/ 2576 / 1979) and we have used them as surrogate antigens in neutralisation assays to study the presence and magnitude of heterosubtypic neutralising antibody responses in human sera collected before and after the 2007 - 2008 seasonal influenza vaccination.

Neutralisation assays using sera from vaccinated animals and pseudotyped Challenge Virus Standard- 11 detected {{positive and negative}} samples with 100 % specificity and sensitivity, and titres strongly correlated with the Office International des Epizooties FAVN test (R 2 = 0. 89). We have also studied the cross-neutralising potency of current rabies vaccines against other lyssavirus genotypes. Compared to conventional live virus assays, studying neutralisation with pseudotypes removes the need for high containment facilities and large sample volumes, therefore {{increasing the number of}} laboratories that can undertake active surveillance. Further to this we have adapted the assay so that neutralisation tests can be conducted using luciferase, enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) or lacZ as the pseudotype reporter gene. These facets combined make our rabies <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay</b> an attractive option for use in large vaccine campaigns where it would be advantageous to determine serum neutralising titres in situ. The assay will allow a far greater number of laboratories worldwide, who are presently unable to run live virus test, to be more directly involved in front-line vaccine and antiviral therapy trials, especially in resource limited countries where rabies is a major burden. We aim to develop kits for the distribution of these assays that could be selected with a choice of viral pseudotype and reporter gene...|$|E

We also showed that IAPE are the progenitors of the highly reiterated IAP elements.

We identified Ephrin A 4, a GPI-anchored molecule involved in several developmental processes, as a receptor for the IAPE pseudotypes. We also found that the other 4 members of the Ephrin A family –but not those of the closely related Ephrin B family- were also able to mediate IAPE cell entry, thus significantly increasing the amount of possible cell types susceptible to IAPE infection.

40|$|Autologous {{neutralizing}} antibodies (NAb) against {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 generate viral escape variants; however, the mechanisms of escape are not clearly defined. In a previous study, we determined the susceptibilities of 48 donor and 25 recipient envelope (Env) glycoproteins from five subtype C heterosexual transmission pairs to NAb in donor plasma by using a virus <b>pseudotyping</b> <b>assay,</b> thereby providing an ideal setting to probe the determinants of susceptibility to neutralization. In the present study, acquisition of length in the Env gp 120 hypervariable domains was shown to correlate with resistance to NAb in donor plasma (P = 0. 01; Kendall's tau test) but not in heterologous plasma. Sequence divergence in the gp 120 V 1 -to-V 4 region also correlated with resistance to donor (P = 0. 0002) and heterologous (P = 0. 001) NAb. A mutual information analysis suggested possible associations of nine amino acid positions in V 1 to V 4 with NAb resistance to the donor's antibodies, and five of these were located within an 18 -residue amphipathic helix (α 2) located on the gp 120 outer domain. High nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution (dN/dS) ratios, indicative of positive selection, were also found at these five positions in subtype C sequences in the database. Nevertheless, exchange of the entire α 2 helix between resistant donor Envs and sensitive recipient Envs did not alter the NAb phenotype. The combined mutual information and dN/dS analyses suggest that unique mutational patterns in α 2 and insertions in the V 1 -to-V 4 region are associated with NAb resistance during subtype C infection but that the selected positions within the α 2 helix must be linked to still other changes in Env to confer antibody escape. These findings suggest that subtype C viruses utilize mutations in the α 2 helix for efficient viral replication and immune avoidance...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{retroviral}} pseudotypes as a vector for {{gene therapy}} is well documented. Recently, {{we have developed}} pseudotypes to determine neutralising antibody titres for highly pathogenic viruses. This removes the need for high containment facilities and allows small volumes of serum to be used. G-protein sequences from the rabies isolate CVS- 11 and European bat lyssaviruses were cloned and co-expressed with lentiviral gag-pol and GFP or luciferase reporter genes. The pseudotypes infected a number of target cell lines and produced titres almost equivalent to VSV-G protein <b>pseudotypes.</b> Neutralisation <b>assays</b> using blinded sera and pseudotyped CVS- 11 detected positive and negative samples with 100 % specificity and sensitivity and correlated with the OIE FAVN (R 2 = 0. 89).

40|$|HIV- 1 {{infected}} {{patients who}} acquire HCV infection have {{higher rates of}} chronicity and liver disease progression than patients with HCV mono-infection. Understanding early events in this pathogenic process is important. We applied single genome sequencing of the E 1 to NS 3 regions and viral <b>pseudotype</b> neutralization <b>assays</b> to explore the consequences of viral quasispecies evolution from pre-seroconversion to chronicity in four co-infected individuals (mean follow up 566 days). We observed that one to three founder viruses were transmitted. Relatively low viral sequence diversity, possibly related to an impaired immune response, due to HIV infection was observed in three patients. However, the fourth patient, after an early purifying selection displayed increasing E 2 sequence evolution, possibly related to being on suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Viral pseudotypes generated from HCV variants showed relative resistance to neutralization by autologous plasma but not to plasma collected from later time points, confirming ongoing virus escape from antibody neutralization...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{is a difficult}} target for vaccine development, {{in part because of}} its ever-expanding genetic diversity and attendant capacity to escape immunologic recognition. Vaccine efficacy might be improved by maximizing immunogen antigenic similarity to viruses likely to be encountered by vaccinees. To this end, we designed a prototype HIV- 1 envelope vaccine using a deduced ancestral state for the env gene. The ancestral state reconstruction method was shown to be > 95 % accurate by computer simulation and 99. 8 % accurate when estimating the known inoculum used in an experimental infection study in rhesus macaques. Furthermore, the deduced ancestor gene differed from the set of sequences used to derive the ancestor by an average of 12. 3 %, while these latter sequences were an average of 17. 3 % different from each other. A full-length ancestral subtype B HIV- 1 env gene was constructed and shown to produce a glycoprotein of 160 kDa that bound and fused with cells expressing the HIV- 1 coreceptor CCR 5. This Env was also functional in a virus <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay.</b> When either gp 160 - or gp 140 -expressing plasmids and recombinant gp 120 were used to immunize rabbits in a DNA prime-protein boost regimen, the artificial gene induced immunoglobulin G antibodies capable of weakly neutralizing heterologous primary HIV- 1 strains. The results were similar for rabbits immunized in parallel with a natural isolate, HIV- 1 SF 162. Further design efforts to better present conserved neutralization determinants are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Cross-neutralization between {{rabies virus}} (RABV) and two European bat lyssaviruses (EBLV- 1 and - 2) was {{analysed}} using lentiviral pseudotypes as antigen vectors. Glycoprotein (G-protein) cDNA from RABV challenge virus standard- 11 (CVS- 11) and EBLV- 1 and - 2 were cloned and co-expressed with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) or murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag–pol and packageable green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase reporter genes in human cells. The harvested lentiviral (HIV) vector infected over 40  % of baby hamster kidney (BHK) target cells, providing high-titre pseudotype stocks. Tests on blinded antibody-positive (n= 15) and -negative (n= 45) sera, predetermined by the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Office International des Epizooties (OIE), revealed that the CVS- 11 <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay</b> had 100  % concordance with FAVN and strongly correlated with neutralization titres (r 2 = 0. 89). Cross-neutralization tests using sera from RABV-vaccinated humans and animals on pseudotypes with CVS- 11, EBLV- 1 and EBLV- 2 envelopes showed that the relative neutralization titres correlated broadly with the degree of G-protein diversity. Pseudotypes have three major advantages over live-virus neutralization tests: (i) they can be handled in low-biohazard-level laboratories; (ii) the use of reporter genes such as GFP or β-galactosidase will allow the assay to be undertaken at low cost in laboratories worldwide; (iii) each assay requires < 10  μl serum. This robust microassay will improve {{our understanding of the}} protective humoral immunity that current rabies vaccines confer against emerging lyssaviruses, and will be applicable to surveillance studies, thus helping to control the spread of rabies...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that canine signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM; {{also known as}} CD 150) acts as a cellular receptor for canine distemper virus (CDV). In this study, we established Vero cells stably expressing canine SLAM (Vero. DogSLAMtag cells). Viruses were isolated in Vero. DogSLAMtag cells one day after inoculation with spleen samples from five out of seven dogs with distemper. By contrast, virus isolation with reportedly sensitive marmoset B 95 a cells was only successful from three diseased animals at 7 to 10 days after inoculation, and no virus was recovered from any dogs when Vero cells were used for isolation. The CDV strain isolated in Vero. DogSLAMtag cells did not cause cytopathic effects in B 95 a and human SLAM-expressing Vero cells, whereas the strain isolated in B 95 a cells from the same dog did so in canine or human SLAM-expressing Vero cells as well as B 95 a cells. There were two amino acid differences in the hemagglutinin sequence between these strains. Cell fusion analysis after expression of envelope proteins and vesicular stomatitis virus <b>pseudotype</b> <b>assay</b> showed that their hemagglutinins {{were responsible for the}} difference in cell tropism between them. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that glutamic acid to lysine substitution at position 530 of the hemagglutinin was required for the adaptation to the usage of marmoset SLAM. Our results indicate that Vero cells stably expressing canine SLAM are highly sensitive to CDV in clinical specimens and that only a single amino acid substitution in the hemagglutinin can allow the virus to adapt to marmoset SLAM...|$|E
40|$|Members of the California {{serogroup}} of orthobunyaviruses, including La Crosse (LAC) and Tahyna (TAH) viruses, {{are significant}} human pathogens {{in areas where}} their mosquito vectors are endemic. Previous studies using wild-type LAC and TAH 181 / 57, a highly neurovirulent strain with low neuroinvasiveness have demonstrated that the neuroinvasive phenotype maps to the M segment. To further define {{the role of the}} M segment in fusion and entry, a panel of recombinant M segment constructs were prepared using LAC, TAH 181 / 57, and V 22 F, a monoclonal-resistant variant of LAC with deficient fusion function. These M segment constructs were tested in two surrogate assays for virus entry: a cell-to-cell fusion assay based on T 7 -luciferase expression, and a <b>pseudotype</b> transduction <b>assay</b> based on the incorporation of the bunyavirus glycoproteins on an Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) backbone. Both assays demonstrated that Gc is the principal determinant of virus fusion and cell entry. Further, the region delineated by amino acids 860 - 1442, which corresponds to the membrane proximal two-thirds of Gc, is key to these processes. These results, coupled with structural modeling suggesting homologies between the carboxy region of Gc and the fusion protein (E 1) from two alphaviruses (Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus), suggest that the LAC Gc functions as a type II fusion protein. ^ Using the predicted structural model of Gc, an amino acid region (1066 - 1087) that shares a homologous structural location with the fusion domain of SFV E 1 was identified as the putative fusion domain for LAC Gc. To examine the role of this region in fusion and entry, a panel of LAC point mutant M segments were prepared and examined for total and surface expression by IFA and flow cytometry. These constructs were then examined in our cell-to-cell fusion and <b>pseudotype</b> transduction <b>assays.</b> The results demonstrated mutations within this putative fusion domain either disrupted or abrogated fusion. In total, these results combined with computational modeling, suggest the hydrophobic region (1066 - 1087) of LAC Gc functions as the fusion peptide. These studies provided a better understanding of LAC virus entry and highlighted similarities between disparate viral fusion proteins. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommended}} {{the development of}} simple, safe, sensitive and specific neutralization assays for avian influenza antibodies. We have used retroviral pseudotypes bearing influenza H 5 hemagglutinin (HA) as safe, surrogate viruses for influenza neutralization assays which {{can be carried out}} at Biosafety Level 2. RESULTS: Using our assay, sera from patients who had recovered from infection with influenza H 5 N 1, and sera from animals experimentally immunized or infected with H 5 tested positive for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to H 5 N 1. Pseudotype neutralizing antibody titers were compared with titers obtained by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays and microneutralization (MN) assays using live virus, and showed a high degree of correlation, sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>pseudotype</b> neutralization <b>assay</b> is as sensitive as horse erythrocyte HI and MN for the detection of antibodies to H 5 N 1.

40|$|Licensed {{seasonal}} influenza vaccines induce antibody (Ab) responses against influenza hemagglutinin (HA) that {{are limited in}} their ability to protect against different strains of influenza. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognizing the conserved internal nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein (M 1) are capable of mediating a cross-subtype immune response against influenza. Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus encoding NP and M 1 (MVA-NP+M 1) is designed to boost preexisting T-cell responses in adults in order to elicit a cross-protective immune response. We examined the coadministration of HA protein formulations and candidate MVA-NP+M 1 influenza vaccines in murine, avian, and swine models. Ab responses postimmunization were measured by ELISA and <b>pseudotype</b> neutralization <b>assays.</b> Here, we demonstrate that MVA-NP+M 1 can act as an adjuvant enhancing Ab responses to HA while simultaneously inducing potent T-cell responses to conserved internal Ags. We show that this regimen leads to the induction of cytophilic Ab isotypes that are capable of inhibiting hemagglutination and in the context of H 5 exhibit cross-clade neutralization. The simultaneous induction of T cells and Ab responses has the potential to improve seasonal vaccine performance and could be employed in pandemic situations...|$|R
