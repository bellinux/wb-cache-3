40|$|SUMMARY Haptoglobin (Hp) {{groups were}} {{investigated}} in 81 patients with motor neuron disease. A significant excess of heterozygotes was observed, accentuated among males {{and in the}} <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> subgroup. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} a possible influence of Hp in the immunological response. Motor neuron disease is a progressive disorder of the upper and lower motor neurons. Affected individuals become severely disabled and many die within a few years. Most cases are sporadic but 5 - 10 % occur in a familial pattern suggesting autosomal dominant in-heritance. 1 A slight male overrepresentation is often observed. Three clinical varieties are recognised, de-pending on involvement of upper or lower motor neu-rons: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) shows signs of upper and lower motor neuron disorder, whereas progressive bulbar paralysis (PBP) and <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (PSMA) show only lower motor neuron signs. With time the symptomatologies of these variants often merge and in late stages of the disease subgroups are difficult to distinguish. The cause and pathogenesis of motor neuron dis-ease are unknown and various aetiologies, such as viral, immunological, genetic and environmental, have been proposed. 2 3 On the island of Guam, with a focus of high incidence for motor neuron disease, ex-tensive investigations of genetic markers have been performed without finding any striking associ-ations. 46 Apart from histocompatibility antigens genetic markers have not, to our knowledge, pre-viously been investigated in cases of motor neuron disease outside the high incidence areas. 7 Haptoglobin (Hp), the major haemoglobin-binding serum protein, is an acute phase reactant with various properties of unknown biological significance.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a group of children suffering from <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> or Werdnig-Hoffmann dis-ease. 1 – 3 This <b>progressive</b> infantile <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> is a genetically determined degenerative condition charac-terized by a deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the SMN gene. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by a pro-gressive loss of the motoneurons of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and in the cranial nerve motor nuclei of the brain stem. The main clinical features consist of profound weakness of the proximal and intercostal muscles and occa-sionally of marked bulbar dysfunction. Several subgroups have been distinguished according to the age of onset, clin-ical severity, and other features. Classically, the acute form of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (type I) is characterized by severe generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia at birth or within the first 6 months. Death from respiratory failure usually occurs within the first 2 years. In the intermediate form (type II), the children are able to sit, although they can-not stand or walk unaided and they live longer. Many authors have studied motor nerve conduction in patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> and have shown either normal or abnormal conduction. 4 – 8 However, very few studies have analyzed multimodality evoked poten-tials. In the study reported here, visual evoked potentials, brainstem evoked potentials, and somatosensory evoked potentials were obtained on patients with two types of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> types I and II.

40|$|Increased {{weakness}} during cold (cold paresis) {{was reported}} in single cases of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). This was unexpected because demyelination is a feature of MMN and symptoms of demyelination improve, rather than worsen, in cold. It was hypothesized that cold paresis in MMN does not reflect demyelination only, but may indicate the existence of inflammatory nerve lesions with permanently depolarized axons that only just conduct at normal temperature, but fail at lower temperatures. We investigated symptoms of cold paresis in 50 MMN patients, 48 chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) patients, 35 <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (PSMA) patients, and 25 chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy patients. We also investigated symptoms of increased weakness during warmth (heat paresis). Cold paresis was reported more often than heat paresis. Cold paresis was most frequently reported in MMN. Multivariate analysis indicated that MMN patients had a 4 - to 6 -fold higher risk of reporting cold paresis than CIDP or PSMA patients. Because cold paresis is not consistent with demyelination, the lesions in MMN may involve other mechanisms than demyelination only. In conclusion, symptoms of cold paresis are common in peripheral nervous system disorders, particularly in MMN. This supports the above-described hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|Single fibre {{electromyography}} {{has been}} performed {{in patients with}} partial nerve lesions, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> muscle <b>atrophy,</b> <b>muscular</b> dystrophy, and distal hereditary myopathy. The recorded action potentials were often more complex than in the normal muscle due to increased fibre density in the motor unit and the individual spike components showed a large jitter and occasional blockings. Sometimes two or more spikes in a complex disappeared and reappeared simultaneously upon successive discharges. This phenomenon, called `paired blocking', has been further investigated. The jitter of the blocking potentials {{in relation to the}} rest of the complex was large, up to 500 μsec. The degree of blocking increased with increasing innervation frequency until it eventually proceeded to total block during continuous activity. Sometimes a slight effect on blocking was seen after edrophonium. This type of block is probably localized in the terminal nerve twigs, perhaps in newly formed sprouts.

40|$|Multifocal motor {{neuropathy}} (MMN) {{and chronic}} inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are immune-mediated neuropathies. Despite treatment being available, patients suffer from disabling weakness of {{arm and leg}} muscles and fatigue. Pathogenesis of MMN and CIDP is unclear, but the development of conduction block plays an important role. Conduction block may originate from demyelination, Na-channel damage at the node of Ranvier, and permanently changed resting membrane potential. Better understanding of underlying mechanisms is needed {{in the search for}} new targets for therapy. Two observations may point to specific mechanisms of conduction block. Cold paresis is suggested by complaints of increased weakness in cold and was only reported in single cases of MMN. Activity-dependent weakness, an abnormal increase in weakness during activity, was described in selected MMN and CIDP patients. The objective of this thesis is to further explore cold paresis and activity-dependent weakness in MMN and CIDP. Cold paresis was attributed to conduction block arising in axons affected by inflammation with permanently depolarized axons that just conduct at normal temperature, but fail to conduct at lower temperatures. We showed that MMN patients experience cold paresis more often than patients with other peripheral nervous system disorders including CIDP and <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (PSMA). This supports a specific underlying mechanism in MMN, as was previously proposed. When cold paresis was objectively assessed by muscle force testing, muscle force in MMN did not decrease following cooling. This may, however, be compatible with cold paresis as normal controls showed an increase in force. As similar effects of cooling were found in MMN and PSMA, cold paresis may be related to reinnervated muscle fibers. Nerve excitability studies suggested hyperpolarization in MMN and changes following cooling similar to normal subjects in MMN and CIDP. Taken together, our findings do not clearly support the hypothesis of conduction block arising in depolarizing inflammatory nerve lesions in MMN. Activity-dependent weakness was ascribed to increased activity of the electrogenic Na/K pump causing axonal hyperpolarization, leading to conduction block in already injured demyelinated axons. We showed that MMN and CIDP patients report activity-dependent weakness more frequently than normal subjects. The fact that this was also true for patients with sporadic <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (PSMA) suggests that other mechanisms, not related to demyelination cause activity-dependent weakness. Muscle strength testing during isometric maximal voluntary contraction showed that activity-dependent weakness was more prominent in MMN than in PSMA and normal controls. Activity-dependent conduction block could, however, not be demonstrated in any of 353 nerve segments in MMN and was found in only 1 out of 285 nerve segments in CIDP. Muscle contraction did induce an increase in segmental duration prolongation in segments with signs of demyelination. Taken together, our findings suggest that activity-dependent weakness in MMN is common, but it does not result from overt activity-dependent conduction block. Alternatively, it may result from temporal dispersion of nerve action potentials, impulse blocking at distal axonal motor branch points, or impulse blocking in muscle fiber...|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of the genetic basis of hereditary lower motor neuron disease (LMND) and the recognition of multifocal motor neuropathy as a distinct clinical entity necessitate a new classification of LMND. To this end, we studied the clinical and electrophysiological features of 49 patients with sporadic adult-onset LMND in a cross-sectional study. Disease duration was more than 4 years to exclude the majority of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Based on the pattern of weakness, we identified three groups: 13 patients with generalized weakness (group 1); eight patients with symmetrical, distal muscle weakness (group 2); and 28 patients with non-generalized asymmetrical weakness of the arms in most patients (group 3). Group 3 could be subdivided into patients with weakness in predominantly the distal (group 3 a) or the proximal (group 3 b) muscle groups, both with disease progression to adjacent spinal cord segments. Distinctive features of group 1 were an older age at onset, more severe weakness and muscle atrophy, lower reflexes, greater functional impairment, more widespread abnormalities on concentric needle EMG, respiratory insufficiency and serum M-protein. In groups 2 and 3, concentric needle EMG findings also suggested a more widespread disease process. Retrospectively, the prognosis of sporadic adult-onset LMND appears to be favourable, because clinical abnormalities were still confined to one limb in most patients after a median disease duration of 12 years. We propose to classify the patients in the different subgroups as slowly <b>progressive</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (group 1), distal spinal muscular atrophy (group 2), segmental distal spinal muscular atrophy (group 3 a) and segmental proximal spinal muscular atrophy (group 3 b).

Neuroendocrinological data in two patients demonstrate an androgenic insufficiency of hypothalamo-hypophyseal origin and high levels of circulating oestrogens, which probably have induced gynaecomastia.

Timing of diagnosis is crucial for <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> because early diagnosis may lead to early supportive care and reduction in patient and caregiver stress. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the published literature for diagnostic delay in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed and Web of Science databases for studies published between 2000 and 2014 that listed any type of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> and without molecular, mouse, or pathology in the keywords. Mean and/or median age of onset and diagnosis and delay in diagnosis was extracted or calculated. All estimates were weighted by the number of patients and descriptive statistics are reported. ResultsA total of 21 studies were included in the final analysis. The weighted mean (standard deviation) ages of onset were 2. 5 (0. 6), 8. 3 (1. 6), and 39. 0 (32. 6) months for <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> types I, II, and III, respectively, and the weighted mean (standard deviation) ages of confirmed <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> genetic diagnosis were 6. 3 (2. 2), 20. 7 (2. 6), and 50. 3 (12. 9) months, respectively, for types I, II, and III. For studies reporting both age of onset and diagnosis, the weighted diagnostic delay was 3. 6, 14. 3, and 43. 6  months for types I, II, and III, respectively. ConclusionsDiagnostic delay is common in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> The length of delay varied by severity (type) of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> Further studies evaluating this delay and tools such as newborn screening are warranted to end the diagnostic delay in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> is {{distinct}} among neurodegenerative {{conditions of the}} motor neuron, with onset in developing and maturing patients. Furthermore, the rate of degeneration appears to slow over time, {{at least in the}} milder forms. To investigate disease pathophysiology and potential adaptations, the present study utilized axonal excitability studies to provide insights into axonal biophysical properties and explored correlation with clinical severity. Multiple excitability indices (stimulus–response curve, strength–duration time constant, threshold electrotonus, current–threshold relationship and recovery cycle) were investigated in 25 genetically characterized adolescent and adult patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> stimulating the median motor nerve at the wrist. Results were compared with 50 age-matched controls. The Medical Research Council sum score and <b>Spinal</b> <b>Muscular</b> <b>Atrophy</b> Functional Rating Scale were used to define the strength and motor functional status of patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> In patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> there were reductions in compound muscle action potential amplitude (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005) associated with reduction in stimulus response slope (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005), confirming significant axonal loss. In the patients with mild or ambulatory <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> there was reduction of peak amplitude without alteration in axonal excitability; in contrast, in the non-ambulatory or severe <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> cohort prominent changes in axonal function were apparent. Specifically, there were steep changes in the early phase of hyperpolarization in threshold electrotonus (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005) that correlated with clinical severity. Additionally, there were greater changes in depolarizing threshold electrotonus (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005) and prolongation of the strength-duration time constant (P[*]=[*] 0. 001). Mathematical modelling of the excitability changes obtained in patients with severe <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> supported a mixed pathology comprising features of axonal degeneration and regeneration. The present study has provided novel insight into the pathophysiology of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> with identification of functional abnormalities involving axonal K+ and Na+ conductances and alterations in passive membrane properties, the latter linked to the process of neurodegeneration...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of anterior horn {{cells in the}} spinal cord leading to progressive <b>muscular</b> weakness and <b>atrophy.</b> The <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> candidate interval genes including survival motor neuron, the responsible gene in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> phenotype expression, neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein, and P 44, potential modifying genes, are located on chromosome 5 q 13 in two highly homologous copies (telomeric and centromeric) within the <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> region. Methods: In this study, the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion was analyzed in 34 <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> families, with the consanguinity rate of 65 % (22 / 34), in whom exon 7 of the survival motor neuron- 1 gene was already confirmed and was deleted in 79 % of the affected individuals. Deletion analysis of exons 5, 6, and 13 of the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-t gene {{was carried out in}} our samples. Results: We found 80 % neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion in 5 q-spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> patients (91 % <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> atrophy-I, 50 % <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> atrophy-II and-III), and in 5 % (two of fourty) of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> parents. All the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-deleted samples also lacked the survival motor neuron- 1 gene. Conclusion: The neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> atrophy-I was higher than the other <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> types. The high frequency of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein deletion most likely reflects a higher frequency of survival motor neuron- 1 deletions compared with survival motor neuron- 1 to survival motor neuron- 2 gene conversion in this population...|$|R
