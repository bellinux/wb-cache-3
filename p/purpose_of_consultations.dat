40|$|In post-apartheid South Africa, writing centres {{exist in}} almost every {{university}} to address the academic writing needs of students. At Stellenbosch University Writing Lab, writing consultants use collaborative learning and peer feedback in their work with writers in one-to-one consultations. As {{part of a larger}} research project about how students in a Health Professions Education Master’s degree responded to different types of feedback, our study focuses on whether the feedback received in a writing consultation compares to, or differs from, the feedback from the class group members. Our findings suggest that in general the students were open to interventions such as writing consultations. Furthermore, peer feedback from both a class group member as well as a writing consultant was experienced as useful. The study further shows that the consultants’ approach to giving feedback was in line with the pedagogy practised in writing centres. The article concludes with measures that were implemented to address uncertainties identified in the study. We recommend that the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> be clarified to lecturers, that consultations be integrated in the writing process before the assignment is marked and, to minimise role confusion, that consultants describe to students the way consultations work {{at the beginning of the}} consultation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} public consultative {{procedures}} undertaken by governments or their public services sometimes go awry because of certain confusions {{as to the}} nature and <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> One <b>of</b> {{the most important of}} these is a tendency to view consultation as an exercise in policy determination by the public rather than as public input into the representative democratic process whose ultimate use is to be defined by the elected decision-makers. The result of this confusion is a tendency to misunderstand or overestimate what public consultations can achieve, and a failure to make a distinction between occasions when such consultations are useful and occasions when they must give way to explicit political contest. Three levels of activity - the technical, the transactional and the political - are analytically distinguished along with the modes of action-response appropriate to each - in order to explain and clarify the nature of good consultative practice.

Learning Classifier Systems (Holland 1978) are a Machine Learning technique in which a set of simplified production rules are discovered to solve a given problem. The system must identify patterns within the data it receives from the problem environment, enabling it to classify other, previously unseen inputs. The rules, known as classifiers, are selected and manipulated using a Genetic Algorithm (Holland 1975). This dissertation focuses on Pittsburgh approach classifier systems (Smith 1980), where many candidate rule sets compete with one another. Such systems tend to be slow since the Genetic Algorithm must work with large structures, namely entire sets of classifiers; increasing their efficiency is therefore an important research topic. We propose a technique in which the rule sets are compressed before manipulation and then re-expanded using principles from Grammatica...|$|R

40|$|Consultation {{research}} {{to date has}} largely concentrated on how consultation practices generally serve only the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> procedural compliance. This article identifies and explores the gap in existing research on the impact <b>of</b> law on <b>consultation</b> practices and purposes. To explore current practices and the potential contribution of law to the nature <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> practices, the article focuses on the NSW duty to consult Aboriginal people before permitting harm to Aboriginal cultural heritage. Conventional regulatory approaches to consultation assume that Aboriginal interests are accommodated by the same consultation strategies applied to other stakeholders in rural law and policy. This article uses an administrative law doctrinal research approach to identify the specific issues and requirements for Aboriginal consultation relating to cultural heritage. Consideration {{is given to the}} effectiveness of the case study consultation requirements, the duty design, and the recent Land and Environment Court judgment of Ashton Coal Operations Pty Limited v Director-General, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water. The article argues that statutory consultation requirements and purposes can, and should, be taken more seriously. The law reform discussion highlighted in the paper considers how identified consultation requirements can be incorporated into Australian Cultural Heritage legislation, and the possible impact of such incorporation on the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the <b>consultation.</b> More broadly, the law reform discussion indicates that when consultation requirements are tailored to suit the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the <b>consultation</b> and the consultation parties, the law can play a positive role in consultation, engagement and capacity building...|$|R

It examined four key issues that emerged in the debates about history education during the review and found that stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 views diverged significantly on three of these issues. While loose coalitions formed around particular issues, stakeholders provided different rationales for their positions, and coalitions re-formed on other debates. The analysis highlights the divergence between stakeholders and between the Commonwealth and state governments and stakeholders on the desirable content and goals of history education. The findings indicate that consultation might not produce consensus, and that even the appearance of consensus can be grounded in substantively and philosophically different premises. In practical terms, the findings suggest that if the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> as a method of curriculum development is to produce a syllabus that reflects the diverse perspectives held by stakeholders, then the syllabus structure needs to make provision for content options as well as common core areas of study. <br /...|$|R
