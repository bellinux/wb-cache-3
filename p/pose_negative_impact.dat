Glyphosate may <b>pose</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on land ecosystems because of wide broad usage and hydrofilic characteristic. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate negative effects of glyphosate on soil invertebrate organisms (earthworm Eisenia fetida). The duration of experiment was 8 weeks. The range of the test concentrations of glyphosate were: 0, 1, 1, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg. To investigate the glyphosate impact on earthworm Eisenia fetida the following endpoints were measured: survival, reproduction and weight. The exposure to 20 mg/kg glyphosate has led to the 100 % mortality of earthworms. Glyphosate has led to decreased E. fetida reproduction, the cocoons were observed only in the lowest concentration (0, 1 mg/kg). In general: long-term glyphosate toxicity to earthworms (E. fetida) may be significant...|$|E

Little information regarding their response to local environmental factors has been reported including responses to the local HAB species, Karenia brevis. This study monitored the tissue toxin concentration of brevetoxins in P. viridis from existing populations throughout two consecutive natural K. brevis blooms. The results showed P. viridis to rapidly accumulate PbTx upon exposure to the bloom, far exceeding the peak tissue concentrations of oysters, Crassostrea virginica, sampled during the same period, 57, 653 ± 15, 937 and 33, 462 ± 10, 391 ng g− 1 PbTx- 3 equivalent, respectively. Further, P. viridis retained high PbTx concentrations in their tissues post bloom remaining above the regulatory limit for human consumption for 4 – 5 months, significantly longer than the depuration time of 2 – 8 weeks for native oyster and clam species. In the second year, the bloom persisted at high cell concentrations resulting in prolonged exposure and higher PbTx tissue concentrations indicating increased bioaccumulation in green mussels.

A bridge collapse not only affects the freight movement on the bridge but also the flow in the entire network, <b>posing</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on local, regional, and national economy. This study examines the spatial and {{economic impact of the}} 2002 I- 40 Bridge collapse in Oklahoma on freight flow movement in the U. S. highway network. Freight Analysis Framework (FAF) databases, TransCADTM software, and two assignment models (All-or-Nothing and User Equilibrium) are used to analyze the freight flow changes before and after the bridge collapse along with two different freight assignment approaches. The first approach assigns the origin-destination freight flow to the network with the collapsed bridge removed. The second involves two successive assignments - first by excluding the pre-hazard freight flow on the bridge and assigning the rest of the flow to the post-disaster network, and second, by assigning the freight flow on the bridge in pre-disaster conditions to the post-disaster-network. The research showed that the bridge collapse did not only impact the freight flows on nearby highway network links, but also affected flows on links further away from the bridge. This finding casts doubts on the conventional models relying on gravity-based spatial distance decay effects, which often overestimate the nearby but underestimate the further-out freight flow changes in the network...|$|R

This {{study was conducted to}} identify maize genes associated with host plant resistance or susceptibility to A. flavus {{infection and}} aflatoxin accumulation. Results: Genome wide gene expression levels with or without A. flavus inoculation were compared in two resistant maize inbred lines (Mp 313 E and Mp 04 : 86) in contrast to two susceptible maize inbred lines (Va 35 and B 73) by microarray analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to find genes contributing to the larger variances associated with the resistant or susceptible maize inbred lines. The significance levels of gene expression were determined by using SAS and LIMMA programs.

Aim To investigate the association between physical activity during pregnancy and GWG of Chinese urban pregnant women. Methods A pregnant women cohort was established between 2005 and 2007 in Changzhou, China. Physical activity levels of pregnant women were assessed using pedometer in the 2 nd and 3 rd trimester, respectively. According to step counts, pregnant women were categorized into 4 different physical activity groups: Sedentary, Low Active, Somewhat Active and Active. The pregnant women were followed for eligibility and data collection from the 2 nd trimester to delivery. Multiple linear regression and multiple binary logistic model were applied to determine the association between physical activity and GWG. Results Physical activity levels and GWG of 862 pregnant women were assessed, among them 473 (54. 9 %) experienced excessive GWG. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0. 59 (95 %CI: 0. 36 ~ 0. 95) for excessive GWG in the Active group during the 2 nd trimester and 0. 66 (95 %CI: 0. 43 ~ 1. 00) in the Somewhat Active group during the 3 rd trimester, compared with the Sedentary group respectively. In the last two trimesters, the Active group had 1. 45 kg less GWG, than the Sedentary group. The ORs of excessive GWG decreased with the increased level of physical activity (P Conclusion This study suggests that pregnant women being physically active have less weight gain during pregnancy. </p...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{double strand}} break (DSB) {{is one of}} the major damages that cause genome {{instability}} and cellular aging. The homologous recombination (HR) -mediated repair of DSBs plays an essential role in assurance of genome stability and cell longevity. Telomeres resemble DSBs and are competent for HR. Here we show that in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomere recombination elicits genome instability and accelerates cellular aging. Inactivation of KEOPS subunit Cgi 121 specifically inhibits telomere recombination, and significantly extends cell longevity in both telomerase-positive and pre-senescing telomerase-negative cells. Deletion of CGI 121 in the short-lived yku 80 (tel) mutant restores lifespan to cgi 121 Δ level, supporting the function of Cgi 121 in telomeric single-stranded DNA generation and thus in promotion of telomere recombination. Strikingly, inhibition of telomere recombination is able to further slow down the aging process in long-lived fob 1 Δ cells, in which rDNA recombination is restrained. Our study indicates that HR activity at telomeres interferes with telomerase to <b>pose</b> a <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on cellular longevity...|$|R

The results indicate that the concept of illness is complex and multidimensional with physical and socio-spiritual aspects. Effective management requires a joint approach between indigenous and western health systems. The results further show that traditional healers fully embrace the integrated health approach while there is some skepticism and uncertainty from psychological counselors which could be stemming from their training.

The {{issues related to}} climate change are of prime concern for every nation as its implications are <b>posing</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on society. In this study, we used three climate change scenarios to simulate the impact on local hydrology of a small agricultural watershed. The three emission scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 analyzed {{in this study were}} A 2 (high emission), A 1 B (medium emission), and B 1 (low emission). A process based hydrologic model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was calibrated and validated for the Skunk Creek Watershed located in eastern South Dakota. The model performance coefficients revealed a strong correlation between simulated and observed stream flow at both monthly and daily time step. The Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency for monthly model performace was 0. 87 for the calibration period and 0. 76 for validation period. The future climate scenarios were built for the mid- 21 st century time period ranging from 2046 to 2065. The future climate data analysis showed an increase in temperatures between 2. 2 °C to 3. 3 °C and a decrease in precipitation from 1. 8 % to 4. 5 % expected under three different climate change scenarios. A sharp decline in stream flow (95. 92 %– 96. 32 %), run-off (83. 46 %– 87. 00 %), total water yield (90. 67 %– 91. 60 %), soil water storage (89. 99 %– 92. 47 %), and seasonal snow melt (37. 64 %– 43. 06 %) are predicted to occur by the mid- 21 st century. In addition, an increase in evapotranspirative losses (2 %– 3 %) is expected to occur within the watershed when compared with the baseline period. Overall, these results indicate that the watershed is highly susceptible to hydrological and agricultural drought due to limited water availability. These results are limited to the available climate projections, and future refinement in projected climatic change data, at a finer regional scale would provide greater clarity. Nevertheless, models like SWAT are excellent means to test best management practices to mitigate the projected dry conditions in small agricultural waterhseds...|$|R

Diverse therapeutic options are being used to treat brain metastases including surgical excision, stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy. Of systemic therapies, gefitinib and erlotinib, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), have shown benefit in treatment of brain metastases in patients with NSCLC. They are particularly effective in those whose lesions harbor activating EGFR mutations, as well as those selected with certain clinical features including young non-smokers, females, and those with East-Asian ethnicity or with adenocarcinoma histology. Gefitinib and erlotinib also have the advantage of exerting their antitumor activity with a favorable toxicity profile. However, they may fail after months of continuous use due to development of drug resistance. In these situations, adopting other treatment strategies such as switching drugs or dose escalation may be suitable alternatives. Several clinical trials in different phases are currently evaluating the efficacy of gefitinib or erlotinib in larger populations of NSCLC patients with brain metastases. On the other hand, new drugs such as afatinib, icotinibor crizotinib have shown benefit in patients with corresponding molecular alterations, at least in case reports or in early phase trials, and are awaiting further study in larger populations.

Combustion instability is, in general, characterized by self-sustained growth of large-amplitude pressure tones that are caused by a positive feedback arising from complex coupling of localized hydrodynamic perturbations, heat energy release, and acoustics of the combustor. This paper proposes a fast dynamic data-driven method for detecting early onsets of thermo-acoustic instabilities, where the underlying algorithms are built upon the concepts of symbolic time series analysis (STSA) via generalization of D-Markov machine construction. The proposed method captures the spatiotemporal co-dependence among time series from heterogeneous sensors (e. g. pressure and chemiluminescence) to generate an information-theoretic precursor, which is uniformly applicable across multiple operating regimes of the combustion process. The proposed method is experimentally validated on the time-series data, generated from a laboratory-scale swirl-stabilized combustor, while inducing thermo-acoustic instabilities for various protocols (e. g. increasing Reynolds number (Re) at a constant fuel flow rate and reducing equivalence ratio at a constant air flow rate) at varying air-fuel premixing levels. The underlying algorithms are developed based on D-Markov entropy rates, and the resulting instability precursor measure is rigorously compared with the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of its performance of instability prediction, computational complexity, and robustness to sensor noise...|$|R

As conventional treatments are not able to totally remove these substances it is necessary to seek for alternative advanced technologies such as oxidation with chlorine dioxide (ClO 2). The objective of this master thesis is thus to find the most optimal dose – reaction time of ClO 2 for the oxidation and maximum removal of selected environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals. Factorial design and subsequent optimization with MODDE was selected as the best approach to find the optimal dose – time. Batch oxidation tests were conducted on 100 mL aliquots treated with ClO 2 using wastewater effluent from Henriksdal WWTP. Thereafter solid phase extraction and final determination of pharmaceuticals was carried out on a high performance liquid chromatography- triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Results showed that applying a dose of 5 mg ClO 2 /L and a reaction time of 10 minutes, it is possible to remove more than a half of the 17 analyzed substances. Besides most of the pharmaceuticals with high and moderate environmental risk, would pose a low risk for the environment after treatment with the optimal ClO 2 dose – reaction time. Despite the fact that ClO 2 could successfully degrade most environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals, deeper research concerning the formation of toxic by-products after oxidative treatment needs to be done before upscaling this technology to pilot or full scale as a suitable end of pipe technology for pharmaceuticals removal...|$|R
30|$|Thus, it is observed, both {{plasmonic}} Ag NPs incorporated DSSCs {{experience an}} improvement in their respective photocurrent densities (J sc) with the cell with one SILAR cycle showing better enhancement from plasmonic effect. The generated photocurrent density (J sc) increases {{with the introduction of}} Ag NPs, which is found to be 44 and 19  % higher than the reference device (device 1) for one and two SILAR cycles, respectively, as shown in Table  1; thus, showing the electron transport efficiency in the TiO 2 /dye/electrolyte interface is improved. With the increase in the amount of incorporated Ag NPs, increase in the recombination probability arises and leads to the decline of photocurrent density [20] and, as a result, reduces the PCE of the DSSCs when the SILAR cycles increased from one to two. Considering the size and aggregation state of Ag NPs as observed in Fig.  3 of SEM analysis, these generate defects at the surface of the active layer of the cell. These defects are potential recombination centers which are capable of trapping generated carriers, and thus, the surface recombination <b>pose</b> a <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on the effective carrier lifetime and, subsequently, on the efficiency of the solar cells [21, 32, 44, 45, 46]. Also, the recombination reaction creates an internal short-circuit throughout the bulk of the photoanode layer [32]; as a result, the device shows a lower PCE with two SILAR cycles. Also, the scattering effect may contribute to the decline, but the plasmonic effect still dominates because of the relatively small size of the nanoparticles [20].|$|R

This study used both field assessments and aerial data to improve the accuracy of remotely sensed measures of IWH and estimate current IWH volumes and subsequent condition (compared with reference levels) across approximately 28 [*] 000 [*]km of stream in the south-eastern Australian state of Victoria. We found that aerial measures, when {{used in conjunction with}} measures of stream size and riparian overhang, produced significantly better estimates of IWH loads than using aerial data alone. The statewide assessment indicated that streams currently have IWH volumes, on average, 41 % lower than reference levels that represented an average reduction of 0. 0207 [*]m 3 [*]m− 2. The degree of IWH condition was highly variable across regions (20 – 95 % reductions from reference levels), a likely reflection of regional variation in land use practices and past river work activities. This scale of IWH reduction may <b>pose</b> major <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on the ecological integrity of these streams. Whilst the approach used during this study has temporal and spatial limitations, it was designed as a generalised, rapid and relatively inexpensive method to measure stream condition and assist with priority setting at state and regional levels.

40|$|Abstract. The Le Morne Brabant Peninsula in SW Mauritius is {{a natural}} {{landscape}} of unsurpassed beauty but also a contested cultural landscape. Diverse threats exist to the Le Morne Cultural Landscape that has recently been inscribed on the World Heritage List. The inscription is based on cultural heritage criteria, {{with much of the}} cultural assets being of an intangible nature. The Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of the site is largely based on resistance to slavery, and a suite of intangible heritage that ranges from myths to colourful dances. This paper provides the context for the conservation of the cultural landscape, defines the key components of the intangible heritage, illustrates various examples of obstacles that would have <b>posed</b> <b>negative</b> and irreversible <b>impacts</b> on the intangible heritage, and provides detail re the approach, methodology and legal instruments that were used to successfully protect the intangible heritage of this unique and important place. 1 A context for conservation of the cultural landscape The Nomination Dossier (MAC 2007 a) for the Le Morne Cultural Landscape in the south west of Mauritius was lodged at the World Heritage Committee on 11 May 2007, and was Inscribed (Property Ref No. 1259 (whc. unesco. org /en/list/ 1259)) on 8 July at the 32 n...|$|R
40|$|Land-cover {{change and}} habitat loss are widely {{recognised}} {{as the major}} drivers of biodiversity loss in the world. Land-cover maps derived from satellite imagery provide useful tools for monitoring land-use and land-cover change. KwaZulu-Natal, a populous yet biodiversity-rich province in South Africa, {{is one of the}} first provinces to produce a set of three directly comparable land-cover maps (2005, 2008 and 2011). These maps were used to investigate systematic land-cover changes occurring in the province with a focus on biodiversity conservation. The Intensity Analysis framework was used for the analysis as this quantitative hierarchical method addresses shortcomings of other established land-cover change analyses. In only 6 years (2005 - 2011), a massive 7. 6 % of the natural habitat of the province was lost to anthropogenic transformation of the landscape. The major drivers of habitat loss were agriculture, timber plantations, the built environment, dams and mines. Categorical swapping formed a significant part of landscape change, including a return from anthropogenic categories to secondary vegetation, which we suggest should be tracked in analyses. Longer-term rates of habitat loss were determined using additional land-cover maps (1994, 2000). An average of 1. 2 % of the natural landscape has been transformed per annum since 1994. Apart from the direct loss of natural habitat, the anthropogenically transformed land covers all <b>pose</b> additional <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> for biodiversity remaining in these or surrounding areas. A target of no more than 50 % of habitat loss should be adopted to adequately conserve biodiversity in the province. Our analysis provides the first provincial assessment of the rate of loss of natural habitat and may be used to fulfil incomplete criteria used in the identification of Threatened Terrestrial Ecosystems, and to report on the Convention on Biological Diversity targets on rates of natural habitat loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of DG into utility networks has significantly {{increased over the}} past years primarily as a result of growing energy demand, coupled with the environmental impacts posed by conventional fossil fuel-based power generation. The prominent DG technologies which are capable of meeting bulk energy demands and are clean energy sources are wind and solar energy sources. The resources for solar and wind based DG are available in abundance in most geographical locations in South Africa and the rest of Africa. Through the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) introduced by the South African government in 2011, 3 920 MW of renewable energy has been procured to date. Out of this, solar and wind energy constitute 2 200 MW and 960 MW, respectively. Grid {{integration of}} solar and wind-based intermittent DGs may however <b>pose</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on the quality of power supplied by the utility network. Some of the detrimental impacts of DG include voltage fluctuations, flicker, etc. which are in general categorised as power quality (PQ) problems. The proper planning of DG integration is required to mitigate the <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> they <b>pose</b> on system's PQ to ensure that the performance of the utility network is enhanced in terms of the overall PQ improvement of the system. This dissertation reviews general PQ problems in utility networks with DG integration and whether poor planning of DG integration affects PQ negatively. The work emphasizes on the impacts of grid integration of wind and solar PV sources on power quality. It investigates the manner in which wind and solar energy systems differ in their impacts and capacity to improve PQ of the network in terms of a number of factors such as point of integration and capacity of DG, type of DG, network loading, etc. The role of grid-integrated DG in PQ improvement in electricity network is also investigated by exploring different PQ improvement techniques. The networks considered for the grid integration of DG for PQ improvement in this work are the IEEE 9 -bus sub-transmission network at the nominal voltage of 230 kV and the IEEE 33 -bus distribution network at the nominal voltage of 12 kV. The aspects essential for facilitating proper planning of DG integration for PQ improvement and total loss reduction are investigated and the comparative analysis is made between grid integration of wind and solar PV based DGs. The simulations of different case studies in this work are done using DIgSILENT PowerFactory version 14. 1 as well as coding in MATLAB. The cases studies conducted are aimed at facilitating the proper planning of grid integration of wind and solar PV-based DGs by comparing their PQ improvement capabilities under different scenarios. First the investigation of how their location and capacity affect the network voltage profiles and active power losses is conducted. Their ability to improve the system's PQ is also studied by observing PQ improvement strategies such as voltage control, installation of energy storage and the optimal placement of DGs under different scenarios. In order to account for the weakness of most South African utility grids, PQ improvement in weak networks with DG integration is also studied by investigating how DG integration in networks with different grid strengths affect the system's PQ. The results provide an understanding of the role of grid integration of wind and solar based DGs on PQ which is useful in the planning of grid integration of RE, particularly in South African electricity networks. The results revealed that the location and capacity of integrated DGs indeed affect the quality of power as well as active power losses in the grid. It is also established that a significant improvement in network's PQ and line loss reduction can be achieved in networks with wind and solar integration. The results however indicated that wind and solar PV based DGs differ in their impacts and capacity {{to improve the quality of}} power in the network. Furthermore, the results revealed that wind and solar plants integration into weak utility grids may pose adverse impacts on the system's PQ. It was however established that including reactive power control devices such as STATCOM and SVC at the PCC can successfully improve the system's PQ and enable grid code compliance in electricity networks with DG integration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecombinant vaccinia viruses {{have shown}} promise as vaccine vectors. However, their {{effectiveness}} is markedly reduced by pre-existing anti-vaccinia immunity. The possibility of new vaccinia immunizations {{in the event}} of a bioterror-related smallpox release <b>poses</b> an additional <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on the utility of vaccinia-based vectors. Thus, we aimed to design a vaccinia vector that would enhance the immune response to an expressed foreign protein in a pre-immune animal model. To do this, we made use of the finding that most neutralizing antibodies against the extracellular form of vaccinia virus are directed against the B 5 protein. We found that mice immunized with vaccinia, primed with Gag plasmid DNA, and boosted with a recombinant vaccinia virus lacking the majority of the B 5 ectodomain expressing a test antigen, HIV Gag, had stronger anti-Gag immune responses than mice that were boosted with a wild-type virus-expressing Gag. These findings are particularly striking given the more attenuated phenotype of this virus, as compared to its wild-type counterpart. Importantly, we found that vaccination with a B 5 R deletion virus, followed by boosting with the Gag-expressing virus lacking the majority of the B 5 ectodomain, resulted in poorer anti-Gag immune responses. Thus, recombinant vaccinia viruses lacking the B 5 ectodomain may serve as vaccine vectors in DNA prime-vaccinia boost vaccinations of individuals with pre-existing immunity against vaccinia. These data open the possibility of extending the potential benefit of replication competent recombinant vaccinia virus vectors to a larger population...|$|R
