50|$|A steel shim is {{inserted}} {{to protect the}} face of the lower bearing and to space the cap of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> away from the shaft. After resealing the ends with clay, more metal is then poured to fill the cap of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> {{through the hole in the}} top of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> cap which will eventually be a lubrication hole.|$|E
50|$|In the {{traditional}} {{style of a}} babbitt metal bearing, a cast iron <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> is assembled as a loose fit around the shaft, with the shaft in approximately its final position. The inner face of the cast iron <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> is often drilled to form a key to locate the bearing metal as it is cast into place. The shaft is coated with soot as a release agent, {{the ends of the}} bearing are packed with clay, and molten metal poured into the cavity around the shaft, initially half filling the <b>pillow</b> <b>block.</b> The bearing is stripped, and the metal trimmed back to the top surface of the <b>pillow</b> <b>block.</b> Hardened babbitt metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife or sharp chisel.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> usually {{refers to}} a housing with an {{included}} anti-friction bearing. A <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> {{refers to a}}ny mounted bearing wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface, and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or flange units. A <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including ball, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing. The type of rolling element defines the type of <b>pillow</b> <b>block.</b> These differ from [...] "plumber blocks" [...] which are bearing housings supplied without any bearings and are usually meant for higher load ratings and a separately installed bearing.|$|E
50|$|Stems tighten {{around and}} hold the {{handlebar}} either by pinch bolts, which require 'feeding' the handlebar through the stem after removing controls, accessories and bar covering; or via detachable faceplates, also called <b>pillow</b> <b>blocks,</b> especially on BMX bicycles, which allow a handlebar with controls, accessories or bar covering to be removed intact. Stems with faceplates or <b>pillow</b> <b>blocks</b> are known as pop-top stems.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the Simplicity Bearing {{was only}} offered in closed, {{imperial}} sizes. PBC quickly developed an open {{version of the}} bearing {{to be used with}} supported shafts. Open and closed <b>Pillow</b> <b>Blocks,</b> Flanged bearings, die set bearings and bushings followed. The company then developed ISO Metric and finally JIS Metric bearings.|$|R
50|$|The {{cheapest}} modern pillow is domed {{and made}} of polystyrene (styrofoam). It is often called a cookie pillow, because of its shape. Another modern <b>pillow</b> is a <b>block</b> <b>pillow,</b> with a frame which holds covered polystyrene blocks. The blocks can be moved around as the lace progresses, to keep the lace being worked on at {{the centre of the}} pillow.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pillow</b> <b>block,</b> {{also known}} as a plummer block or housed bearing unit, is a {{pedestal}} used to provide support for a rotating shaft with the help of compatible bearings & various accessories.

50|$|Factory {{machines}} today {{usually have}} lube systems, {{in which a}} central pump serves periodic charges of oil or grease from a reservoir through lube lines to the various lube points in the machine's bearing surfaces, bearing journals, <b>pillow</b> <b>blocks,</b> and so on. The timing and number of such lube cycles {{is controlled by the}} machine's computerized control, such as PLC or CNC, as well as by manual override functions when occasionally needed. This automated process is how all modern CNC machine tools and many other modern factory machines are lubricated. Similar lube systems are also used on nonautomated machines, in which case there is a hand pump that a machine operator is supposed to pump once daily (for machines in constant use) or once weekly. These are called one-shot systems from their chief selling point: one pull on one handle to lube the whole machine, instead of a dozen pumps of an alemite gun or oil can in a dozen different positions around the machine.|$|R
5000|$|The {{expression}} a [...] "run bearing" [...] also {{derives from}} {{this style of}} bearing, since failure of lubrication will lead to heat build up due to friction in the bearing, eventually leading to the bearing metal liquefying and {{running out of the}} <b>pillow</b> <b>block.</b>|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{incredible}} growth that Toyo underwent, the organization decentralized by creating subsidiaries to oversee new products. In 1961, Toyo {{set up a}} joint venture with INA Wälzlager Schaeffler called NTN Wälzlager Europa in order to manufacture needle bearings. Toyo utilized design data from INA Wälzlager Schaeffler to make these products. They also established Kongo Bearing Company to manage the creation of <b>pillow</b> <b>block</b> bearings. One year later, Toyo founded Senyo Kosakuki Kenkyujo, a maker of ball bearing equipment. In 1963, Toyo entered into business with Hardy Spicer to produce Birfield-type constant-velocity universal joints. They also pursued business overseas by establishing NTN Bearing Corporation of America. The following year, working with GKN Transmission, the company fabricated constant-velocity joints in their home country and formed NTN Bearing-GKN while also opening a facility in Europe called NTN France. The year after that, Toyo started manufacturing oil-impregnated sintered bearings and pipe fittings. Four years later in 1968, the company set up yet another facility in North America called NTN Bearing Corporation of Canada.|$|E
40|$|Development {{in science}} and {{technology}} today has been able to produce instant nutritious foods, such as imitation rice. The application of conventional technologies in the granulation process causes minimal quantity and quality of the imitation rice with corn feedstock generated. The purpose of this research was to design and to test its performance. This research was conducted at the Laboratory of Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural Engineering Department, University of Lampung. This research procedures included several stage: design, assembly, testing, observation and data analysis. The corn rice granulator machine is designed to the specifications of length 140 cm, width 75 cm, and height 170 cm and comes also with other components, such as hopper, sprayer, sweeper, corn rice container, electric motors, gearboxes, <b>pillow</b> <b>block,</b> and couple units. Some of component settings in the testing of this machine: the slope of granulator pan at 35 °, discharge of hopper 0, 2 kg/sec, discharge of water sprayer 0, 54 mℓ/sec, speed of granulator pan rotation 28 RPM, and the clearance between corn rice container and granulator pan by 5 cm. The results showed that, this granulator machine had production capacity of wet corn rice up to 10, 92 kg/hour, and efficiency of granulation up to 78, 18 %, for the raw material with composition 75 % corn flour and 25 % tapioca flour...|$|E
500|$|Submersible dives in August were {{followed}} by NOAA-funded research in September and October 1996. These more detailed studies showed the southern portion of Lōʻihi's summit had collapsed, {{a result of a}} swarm of earthquakes and the rapid withdrawal of magma from the volcano. A crater [...] across and [...] deep formed out of the rubble. The event involved the movement of [...] cubic meters of volcanic material. A region of 10 to 13km2 (4 to 5 sq mi) of the summit was altered and populated by bus-sized <b>pillow</b> lava <b>blocks,</b> precariously perched along the outer rim of the newly formed crater. [...] "Pele's Vents," [...] an area on the southern side, previously considered stable, collapsed completely into a giant pit, renamed [...] "Pele's Pit".

40|$|The Avdella Me´lange in the {{northern}} Pindos Mountains and its equivalent formation, the Loggitsion Unit in the Othris Mountains expose early Mesozoic (Mid-Late Triassic) oceanic fragments beneath the Western Greek Ophiolite Belt of the Inner Hellenides, Northern Greece. The me´lange consists of locally interfingering blocks and slices of ribbon radiolarite, radiolarian chert and pillow basalt and is usually overthrust by Jurassic ophiolites. New Middle and Upper Triassic radiolarian biostratigraphic data are presented from radiolarites and basalt-radiolarite sequences within me´lange <b>blocks.</b> <b>Pillow</b> basalts associated with the radiolarites provide clues {{to the opening of}} the Neotethyan ocean basin. The radiolarians indicate a Middle Triassic age (latest Anisian, probably early Illyrian), which is documented {{for the first time in}} {{the northern}} Pindos Mountains. The new radiolarian biostratigraphic data suggest that rift-type basalt volcanism already began in pre-Ladinian time (late Scythian?—Anisian). These basalts were then overlain by Upper Anisian to Carnian (?Norian) radiolarites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The most {{widespread}} blocks {{within the}} North Anatolian ophiolitic mlange of central Anatolia (Turkey) are ophiolitic fragments, Jurassic-Cretaceous carbonate <b>blocks</b> and <b>pillow</b> basalts. The <b>blocks</b> of <b>pillow</b> basalts have an immobile trace-element geochemistry that {{is characteristic of}} ocean-island alkali basalts. An N-MORB-normalized spider diagram shows a distinctive enrichment of most incompatible trace elements and exhibits a far greater range of absolute abundances than N-MORB. Selected incompatible-element contents and ratios of basalts show high Ba/Nb (~ 8), low Zr/Nb (~ 5) and low La/Nb (~ 0. 5) relative to N-MORB. The presence of thin-shelled "Protoglobigerina " and Cadosina associated with miliolids and epistominid foraminifers indicates that {{the age of the}} pink biomicritic carbonates deposited between the pillow basalt lobes is within the Callovian—Hauterivian interval. Collectively, these results support the presence of a seamount on the Neotethyan oceanic crust and prove the presence of an older oceanic crust along the northern branch of Neotethys...|$|R
40|$|Southern Kermadec arc stratovolcanoes (of {{predominantly}} basaltic and andesitic composition) {{provide a}} depth transect {{of the transition}} between effusive and explosive submarine volcanism. Observations along 4. 6 km of towed-camera track from the crests and upper flanks of the Clark and Rumble III volcanoes reveal a consistent pattern of substrate types that are interpreted to record effusive and explosive eruption processes. Below 700 m water depth, substrates are dominated by massive/blocky flows, pillow lavas, <b>pillow</b> and angular <b>block</b> talus, localized sheet flows, and minor granule-sand volcaniclastic detritus. The latter typically forms a substrate mode of 5 – 20 %. Above 450 m, sand lapilli (that is in part winnowed and rippled), have a substrate mode of 50 – 100 %, with minor components of massive flows, pillow lavas, and coarse talus. This difference in abundance of sand lapilli between 450 and 700 m is interpreted to record the transition between effusive and explosive (both phreatic and phreatomagmatic) eruptions. Between 600 and 700 m, a varied distribution of sand-lapilli abundance is interpreted as recording a mix of effusive and explosive eruptions, consistent with possible differences in the physical interaction of magma–water and known compositional magma heterogeneity. <br/...|$|R
