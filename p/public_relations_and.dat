5|$|The Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) is {{a nonprofit}} trade {{association}} for public relations professionals headquartered in New York City.

That year it had its first annual conference and award ceremony. In the 1950s and 1960s, the society created its code of conduct, accreditation program and a student society called the Public Relations Student Society of America. In the 1970s and 1980s, its membership attained a stronger female demographic and the society had its first female Presidents. PRSA created a definition of public relations in 1982, which was updated with a crowd-sourced version in 2011.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to better {{understand}} the disconnect between <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> scholars <b>and</b> practitioners from the practitioner point-of-view using qualitative in-depth interviews with 20 <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> practitioners. The study examines the extent to which they make meaning of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> scholarship <b>and</b> its usefulness. Findings suggest that practitioners are largely unaware of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> scholarship <b>and</b> generally do not find academic research useful. However, practitioners did consider academic research important for solving problems and thought it could become more useful if scholars translate it. This study identifies the importance of forging relationships between <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> scholars <b>and</b> practitioners. Practical implications include making academic research user-friendly <b>and</b> having <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> scholars provide outreach to practitioners...|$|R

5|$|The {{publicity}} from Sanger's trial generated immense {{enthusiasm for}} the cause, {{and by the end}} of 1917 there were over 30 birth control organizations in the United States.Engelman, p. 92. Sanger was always astute about <b>public</b> <b>relations,</b> <b>and</b> she seized on the publicity of the trial to advance her causes.Kennedy pp. 84, 181.Engelman, pp. 92–93. In her memoirs, Sanger often understated or entirely omitted the contributions of fellow activists. After her trial, she emerged as the movement's most visible leader. Other leaders, such as William J. Robinson, Mary Dennett, and Blanche Ames Ames, could not match Sanger's charisma, charm and fervor.|$|E

The findings reveal that <b>public</b> <b>relation</b> roles <b>and</b> crisis communication are positively related. The Islamic approach partially moderates the relationship among <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> roles <b>and</b> crisis communication.

5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections were to the cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters. Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected for the reason that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who had lived there for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve {{in a part of the}} island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> <b>and</b> facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E
