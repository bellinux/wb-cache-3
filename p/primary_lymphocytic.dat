40|$|AbstractDisruption of the {{perforin}} gene {{results in}} primary immunodeficiency {{and an increased}} susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens. Perforin-deficient (PKO) mice fail to clear <b>primary</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) Armstrong, resulting in persistent infection and functional exhaustion of virus-specific CD 8 + T cells. CD 8 + T cell responses to Listeria monocytogenes (LM) challenge within the first week after LCMV infection were diminished in both WT and PKO mice, and correlated with enhanced bacterial clearance. However, bacterial challenge at later time points generated similar CD 8 T cell responses in both groups of mice. The phenotype and function of pre-existing LM-specific memory CD 8 + T cells were maintained in persistently infected PKO mice. Thus persistent LCMV infection, {{as a result of}} perforin deficiency, results in dysfunction of the virus-specific CD 8 + T cell response but does not compromise the host's ability to maintain pre-existing memory CD 8 + T cells or to generate new memory CD 8 + T cell responses against other pathogens...|$|E

The etiopathogenesis of FFA is unknown, but it is widely considered a variant of lichen plano-pilaris usually, but not exclusively, affecting postmeno - pausal women. Current treatment aim to stop the disease progression, but no standardized treatment are recommended, and best results from observational studies have been reported for 5 - reductase inhibitors and intralesional corticosteroids, followed by antimalarials and calcineurin inhibitors.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the attributes of virus-specific memory CD 8 T cells which most effectively control secondary infections. By rechallenging mice that had cleared <b>primary</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> choriomeningitis virus infections, we revealed that the secondary response is remarkably swift. Within 6 h following secondary infection, the production of gamma interferon becomes detectable directly ex vivo. During this protective phase of the secondary response, a very early elaboration of effector activities is preferentially exhibited by T cells specific for the viral NP 396 epitope. This wave of activation contains the infection primarily before the initiation of the proliferative phase of the secondary response. Marked expansion is observed, but its magnitude differs depending on the epitope specificity of the responding cells; between 42 and 48 h following infection, ∼ 70 % of NP 396 -specific memory cells are in the S phase of the cell cycle, as assessed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation studies. Epitope-dependent differences during the proliferative phase of the secondary response were confirmed by adoptive transfer studies with CFSE-labeled T cells. Although NP 396 -specific T cells typically dominate secondary responses, the broader multiepitope-specific population of antiviral T cells is beneficial for controlling a variant virus with an escape mutation in this epitope. These findings indicate that the induction and maintenance of a focused response contribute to the clearance of secondary infections; however, a more diverse pool of antiviral T cells facilitates long-term immunity to mutable pathogens...|$|E

In some cases, {{hair loss}} in the mid-frontal scalp, similar to female pattern hair loss, may be observed. Objective. Assessment of the trichoscopic pattern of mid-frontal scalp hair loss in patients diagnosed with frontal fibrosing alopecia. Material and methods. The retrospective analysis included 31 women diagnosed with frontal fibrosing alopecia and hair {{loss in the}} mid-frontal scalp and 36 women diagnosed with female pattern hair loss. Results. In patients with frontal fibrosing alopecia two different trichoscopic patterns in the mid-frontal scalp were identified. In 68 % of patients (21 / 31) we observed a diffuse fibrotic pattern. It was characterized by irregular arrangement of follicular units with small areas with loss of follicular units, an increased percentage of follicular units with one hair and a decreased percentage of follicular units with three hairs, normal hair shaft thickness and presence of mild perifollicular scaling. The androgenetic alopecia pattern was present in 32 % of patients (10 / 31). It was characterized by hair shaft thickness diversity (20 % or more), a percentage of vellus hairs higher than 10 %, presence of yellow dots, an increased percentage of follicular units with one hair and a decreased percentage of follicular units with three hairs. Conclusions. In patients with frontal fibrosing alopecia and coexisting mid-frontal scalp hair loss, we identified two different patterns of this area in trichoscopy: the diffuse fibrotic pattern (more common) and the androgenetic alopecia pattern.

The apoptosis-inducing ability of these mAbs and different TRAIL preparations, {{in the presence}} or absence of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), varied markedly against <b>primary</b> chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukaemia (CLL) cells and various tumor cell lines, demonstrating an unanticipated preferential apoptotic signaling via either TRAIL-R 1 or -R 2. Contrary to literature reports that TRAIL-induced apoptosis occurs primarily via signaling through TRAIL-R 2, CLL cells, in the presence of HDACi, undergo predominantly TRAIL-R 1 -mediated apoptosis. Consequently, Apo 2 L/TRAIL, which signals primarily through TRAIL-R 2, is virtually devoid of activity against CLL cells. To maximize therapeutic benefit, it is essential to ascertain whether a primary tumor signals via TRAIL-R 1 /-R 2, prior to initiating therapy.

Using these mutants, we now unequivocally show that primary cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma signal to apoptosis almost exclusively through TRAIL-R 1. Thus, no significant therapeutic benefit can be anticipated from treating such patients with agents currently in clinical trials that signal predominantly through TRAIL-R 2, such as HGS-ETR 2 or Apo 2 L/TRAIL.

Here, we investigated whether mAbs directed at other B-cell surface receptors also engaged Fc?RIIb and whether this interaction promoted internalization. Most mAbs engaged and activated Fc?RIIb, with the strength of activation related {{to the level of}} mAb bound to the cell surface.

Furthermore, at high cell concentrations/density both cis and trans interactions between cell-surface bound mAb and Fc?RIIb were evident, but trans interactions did not inhibit type I anti-CD 20 mAb-mediated internalization. These data identify that Fc?RIIb is engaged by many mAbs in both cis and trans configurations, triggering its activation, but that internalization via Fc?RIIb occurs for only a select subset.

To investigate this discrepancy, {{we examined the}} role of Mcl- 1 on HDACi-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition of either Class I or Class II HDAC by selective HDACi caused an upregulation of Mcl- 1 mRNA and protein. Down-regulation of Mcl- 1 by three structurally unrelated cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors potentiated HDACi-mediated apoptosis in <b>primary</b> chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemic (CLL) cells and K 562 cells. Sensitivity to HDACi-induced apoptosis was increased 10 -fold by the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors. Nanomolar concentrations of HDACi, 300 -fold lower than required to induce apoptosis alone, sensitized cells to TRAIL, emphasizing that the mechanism(s) whereby HDACi induce apoptosis is clearly distinct from those by which they sensitize to TRAIL. Furthermore knockdown of Mcl- 1 potentiated HDACi-mediated apoptosis in K 562 cells. Thus HDACi-mediated Mcl- 1 upregulation plays an important anti-apoptotic regulatory role in limiting the efficacy of HDACi-induced apoptosis, which can be overcome by combination with an agent that down-regulates Mcl- 1.

Previously we reported that prior treatment of <b>primary</b> chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukaemia (CLL) cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) was required to sensitize CLL cells to TRAIL and using various receptor-selective TRAIL mutant ligands we demonstrated that CLL cells signalled to apoptosis primarily through TRAIL-R 1.

ABT- 737 induced all the characteristic ultrastructural changes of apoptosis together with early rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane, whereas obatoclax, chlelerythrine and gossypol induced pronounced mitochondrial swelling with formation of phospholipid inclusions. Therefore, we conclude that biochemical measurements used earlier to define apoptosis like mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and caspase cleavage, are insufficient to distinguish between classic apoptosis and other forms of cell death. 1735...|$|R
40|$|Rituximab is {{the first}} line drug to treat non Hodgkin’s {{lymphoma}} (B-NHL) alone or in combination with chemotherapy. However, 30 – 40 % of B-NHL patients are unresponsive to rituximab or resistant after therapy. Human phosphatidyleth-anolamine-binding protein 4 (hPEBP 4) is a novel member of PEBP family and functions as an anti-apoptotic molecule. In this study, we found hPEBP 4 to be expressed in up to 90 % of B-cell lymphoma patients, but in only 16. 7 % of normal lymph nodes. Interestingly, hPEBP 4 overexpression inhibited rituximab-mediated complement dependent cytotoxicity (R-CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in B-NHL cells while downregulation of hPEBP 4 augmented the therapeutic efficacy of rituximab both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, hPEBP 4 silencing sensitized the <b>primary</b> B-acute <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (B-ALL) cells to R-CDC. During rituximab-mediated complement dependent cytotoxicity, hPEBP 4 was recruited to the cell membrane in a PE-binding domain dependent manner and inhibited R-CDC induced calcium flux and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These events contributed to the decrease of cell death induced by R-CDC in B-cell lymphomas. Meanwhile, hPEBP 4 knockdown potentiated the chemosensitization of the rituximab in B-cell lymphoma cells by regulating the expression of Bcl-xl, Cycline E, p 21 waf/cip 1 and p 53 and the activation of caspase- 3 and caspase- 9. Considering that hPEBP 4 conferred cellular resistance to rituximab treatment and was preferentially expressed in lymphom...|$|R
40|$|Mutations or {{deregulated}} {{expression of}} the components of the spliceosome can influence the splicing pattern of several genes and {{contribute to the development of}} tumors. In this context, we report that the spliceosome modulator sudemycin induces selective cytotoxicity in <b>primary</b> chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (CLL) cells when compared with healthy lymphocytes and tumor cells from other B-lymphoid malignancies, with a slight bias for CLL cases with mutations in spliceosome-RNA processing machinery. Consistently, sudemycin exhibits considerable antitumor activity in NOD/SCID/IL 2 Rγ-/- (NSG) mice engrafted with primary cells from CLL patients. The antileukemic effect of sudemycin involves the splicing modulation of several target genes important for tumor survival, both in SF 3 B 1 -mutated and -unmutated cases. Thus, the apoptosis induced by this compound is related to the alternative splicing switch of MCL 1 toward its proapoptotic isoform. Sudemycin also functionally disturbs NF-κB pathway in parallel with the induction of a spliced RELA variant that loses its DNA binding domain. Importantly, we show an enhanced antitumor effect of sudemycin in combination with ibrutinib that might be related to the modulation of the alternative splicing of the inhibitor of Btk (IBTK). In conclusion, we provide first evidence that the spliceosome is a relevant therapeutic target in CLL, supporting the use of splicing modulators alone or in combination with ibrutinib as a promising approach for the treatment of CLL patients...|$|R

Moreover, the MDM 2 small molecule inhibitor Nutlin- 3 significantly increased the levels of SOCS 1 mRNA in both primary p 53 (wild-type) B-CLL cells as well as in p 53 (wild-type) B leukemic cell lines, but not in p 53 (mutated) B leukemic cell lines nor in primary PBMC. Of note, a significant inverse correlation was observed between SOCS 1 mRNA and miR- 155 levels in Nutlin- 3 -treated primary B-CLL cells and PBMC, suggesting that the miRNA- 155 /SOCS 1 axis represents a potentially important therapeutic target of Nutlin- 3 in B-CLL...|$|R
40|$|The mitogenic {{activity}} of the formalin-treated bacterial strains Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and the Cowan I strain of Staphylococcus aureus was assessed in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with <b>primary</b> immunodeficiencies, acute <b>lymphocytic</b> leukaemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and in umbilical cord blood lymphocytes. The bacteria selectively stimulated B cells, {{as demonstrated by the}} finding of a normal de novo DNA synthesis in children with a T cell defect and of an absent response in X-linked agammaglobulinaemia and severe combined immunodeficiency. A decreased mitogenic activity was exerted on PBL from four out of seven adults with common variable hypogammaglobulinemia (CVH). In B-CLL the mitogenic activity was normal while in T-ALL it was decreased. Umbilical cord blood lymphocytes responded better than PBL from adults. The selective stimulative ability of the bacteria for B lymphocytes is expressed when PBL are cultured together with the formalin-treated bacteria for 48 to 72 hr...|$|R
40|$|Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK 1) {{is highly}} {{expressed}} in many cancers {{and therefore a}} biomarker of transformation and potential target {{for the development of}} cancer-specific small molecule drugs. RO 3280 was recently identified as a novel PLK 1 inhibitor; however its therapeutic effects in leukemia treatment are still unknown. We found that the PLK 1 protein was highly expressed in leukemia cell lines as well as 73. 3 % (11 / 15) of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. PLK 1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in AML samples compared with control samples (82. 95 ± 110. 28 vs. 6. 36 ± 6. 35; p < 0. 001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that shorter survival time correlated with high tumor PLK 1 expression (p = 0. 002). The 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of RO 3280 for acute leukemia cells was between 74 and 797 nM. The IC 50 of RO 3280 in <b>primary</b> acute <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (ALL) and AML cells was between 35. 49 and 110. 76 nM and 52. 80 and 147. 50 nM, respectively. RO 3280 induced apoptosis and cell cycle disorder in leukemia cells. RO 3280 treatment regulated several apoptosis-associated genes. The regulation of DCC, CDKN 1 A, BTK, and SOCS 2 was verified by western blot. These results provide insights into the potential use of RO 3280 for AML therapy; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined...|$|R
