Matheson directs Mulder to Arecibo, assuring the agent that {{he will try to}} hold off a Blue Beret UFO {{retrieval}} team said to be headed there in twenty-four hours. Mulder arrives at the Survey station, where he finds a frightened Puerto Rican man, Jorge, who draws a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alien that he claims to have seen. Meanwhile, Scully, unaware of Mulder's whereabouts, tries to find him. Reviewing a list of flights from Washington, Scully tracks Mulder down to Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot {{for the single}} by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, respectively. Hernandez's version opens with busy streets and the dawn of Los Angeles, California. Hamasaki begins singing the song {{on top of a}} skyscraper, whilst several intercut scenes of people walking around Los Angeles during a time lapse are shown. She is then seen {{painting}} a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unidentified man, who raps Verbal's part. It then shows intercut scenes of traffic, a carosuel and couple standing near a bridge. Several parts of these scenes are revised throughout the entire video, which ends with Hamasaki again on top of the skyscraper. For Yokoyama's video, only shots featuring Verbal were only filmed, alongside scenes of him walking through a city in Japan, and residing in a neon-lit club. Parts of Hernandez's version, with the scenes of Hamasaki painting a man and scenes of Los Angeles city and public, were removed in order to merge the first video and Verbal's appearance together. This version premiered one week before the album's release on July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} use of conscription, the compulsory recruitment of soldiers' sons, the relaxation of age and height requirements and the branding of recruits all {{add up to a}} <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> army that had severe difficulties in finding, and retaining, sufficient recruits. Recruitment difficulties are confirmed in the legal code evidence: there are measures to deal with cases of self-mutilation to avoid military service (such as cutting off a thumb), including an extreme decree of 386 requiring such persons to be burnt alive. Desertion was clearly a serious problem, and was probably much worse than in the army of the Principate, since the latter was mainly a volunteer army. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} granting of leave of absence (commeatus) was more strictly regulated. While in the 2nd century, a soldier's leave was granted at the discretion of his regimental commander, in the 4th century, leave could only be granted by a far senior officer (dux, comes or magister militum). In addition, it appears that comitatus units were typically one-third understrength. The massive disparity between official and actual strength is powerful evidence of recruitment problems. Against this, Elton argues that the late army did not have serious recruitment problems, on the basis of the large numbers of exemptions from conscription that were granted.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between the gender of third grade students at Longfellow Elementary and their rating of perceived leadership effectiveness of both males and females as measured by the Kapanke-Sproul scale. The subjects for this study were all of the third grade students at Longfellow Elementary School. This study utilized four pictures with written narrative descriptions attached. The students were each given <b>a</b> packet <b>of</b> four <b>pictures</b> with written narrative descriptions. Each packet contained an effective male leader, an effective female leader, an ineffective male leader, and an ineffective female leader. Half of the students received aii <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> male described as an effective leader while the other half of the students received <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female with the same written description. Next, half of the students received <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female with the description <b>of</b> <b>an</b> effective leader, and the other half of the students received <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> male with the same written description.

25|$|The {{interest}} in the carnivorous family Streptaxidae was undoubtedly raised by Dolf’s prolonged stay in South Africa, quite possibly inspired by Matthew William Kemble Connolly’s (1939) impressive monograph on the South African non-marine Mollusca, in which a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extremely diverse and aesthetically appealing streptaxid radiation was painted. In all, he described three new genera and 60 new species and subspecies of Streptaxidae, all but four from Africa.|$|E

The High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument installed in another ESO telescope led to the discovery of extrasolar planets, including Gliese 581c—one of the smallest planets seen outside the solar system.|$|E
25|$|In higher education, {{linguistic}} profiling {{has been found}} to impede student comprehension. In a 1992 study, D. Rubin found that undergraduate university students would comprehend material more poorly if they heard a non-accented lecture presented with a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Asian female. When the same non-accented lecture was presented with a European American teaching assistant, students had a greater ability to comprehend the material. This suggests that face identification may be enough to make students believe that language performance will be accented, which corresponded with a belief that comprehension would be reduced.|$|E
