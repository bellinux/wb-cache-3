25|$|The LCD {{backlight}} {{systems are}} made highly efficient by applying optical {{films such as}} <b>prismatic</b> <b>structure</b> to gain the light into the desired viewer directions and reflective polarizing films that recycle the polarized light that was formerly absorbed by the first polarizer of the LCD (invented by Philips researchers Adrianus de Vaan and Paulus Schaareman), generally achieved using so called DBEF films manufactured and supplied by 3M. These polarizers consist of a large stack of uniaxial oriented birefringent films that reflect the former absorbed polarization mode of the light. Such reflective polarizers using uniaxial oriented polymerized liquid crystals (birefringent polymers or birefringent glue) are invented in 1989 by Philips researchers Dirk Broer, Adrianus de Vaan and Joerg Brambring. The combination of such reflective polarizers, and LED dynamic backlight control make today's LCD televisions far more efficient than the CRT-based sets, leading to a worldwide energy saving of 600 TWh (2017), equal to 10% of the electricity consumption of all households worldwide or equal to 2 times the energy production of all solar cells in the world.|$|E

In this paper, we present a general kinematic model of rigid origami pattern and obtain a family of deployable <b>prismatic</b> <b>structures.</b> Basically, a four-crease vertex rigid origami pattern can be presented as a spherical 4 R linkage, and the multivertex patterns are the assemblies of spherical linkages. Thus, this <b>prismatic</b> origami <b>structure</b> is modeled as a closed loop of spherical 4 R linkages, which includes all the possible <b>prismatic</b> deployable <b>structures</b> consisting of quadrilateral facets and four-crease vertices.

Energy absorption per unit mass, and the distribution of plastic strain, has been used to assess the structures. This work was in collaboration with BAE SYSTEMS and led to a DTI: Competition of Ideas grant award (£ 300 k). In this study the energy absorption capacity of prismatic cellular materials were examined using 2 D Finite-Element (FE) simulations. The energy absorption capacity of many core topologies has been predicted under quasi-static compression. Subsequently, the dynamic impact behaviour of one of these structures, with good energy absorption characteristics, has been assessed for a range of impact velocities from 10 to 1000 m/s. As the impact speed increases, different deformation modes are noticed and the effects of stress wave propagation become more important.

The Brady Soil separates Bignell Loess from last glacial Peoria Loess and thick sections, which can reach 6 m thickness, may contain four buried soils beneath the modern surface soil. The Brady Soil has A/B/C horizonation, including a thick dark A and a blocky or <b>prismatic</b> <b>structured</b> B horizon. The Brady soil is intensely burrowed, probably by nymphs of cicada species, which require woody vegetation. Secondary carbonate is present in all genetic horizons and was emplaced post burial.

Secondary carbonate is present in most, but not all Holocene soils. Three phases of loess deposition and soil formation are evident from the thick proximal stratigraphic sections presented here. Initial rates of Bignell Loess deposition were low relative to the rate of soil formation, producing a basal aggraded A horizon above the Brady Soil, that is capped by a increment of loess with minimal pedogenic features. The middle portion of the Bignell Loess is finer textured and contains multiple dark buried soils. The final increment of loess is coarser and contains the weakly expressed modern surface soil.
