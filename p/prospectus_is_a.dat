Instead, {{there is a single}} prospectus for multiple, undefined future offerings. The prospectus (often as part of a registration statement) may be used to offer securities for up to several years after its publication.A shelf registration statement is a filing with the SEC to register a public offering, usually where there is no present intention to immediately sell all the securities being registered.

Provided {{that the company has}} more than a certain number of shareholders and has a certain amount of assets (500 shareholders, above $10 million in assets, per Act sections 12, 13, and 15), the '34 Act requires that issuers regularly file company information with the SEC on certain forms (the annual 10-K filing and the quarterly 10-Q filing). The filed reports are available to the public via EDGAR. If something material happens with the company (change of CEO, change of auditing firm, destruction of a significant number of company assets), the SEC requires that the company issue within 4 business days an 8-K filing that reflects these changed conditions (see Regulation FD). With these regularly required filings, buyers are better able to assess the worth of the company, and buy and sell the stock according to that information.|$|E

40|$|<b>Prospectus</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> technical-legal {{instrument}} {{used in the}} capital market for informing potential investors. Liability for {{the content of the}} prospectus can be a result of the content's deficiency. Content of the prospectus is deficient if it is not in accordance with legal rules regulating its completeness, truthfulness and transparency. As for a particular type of deficiency, the prospectus can be incorrect, incomplete or deceptive. The issue of liability for the prospectus' content is very complex. The subject matter of this paper is restricted to defining persons liable and conditions of their liability for the content of the prospectus. The Law on the Capital Market (hereinafter: the LCM) regulates potential liability of the wide number of persons. However, it does not, in most instances, define conditions under which those persons are liable for the content of the prospectus. The paper discusses the liability of each person which is, by virtue of the LCM, potentially liable for the content of the prospectus and also contains a short glimpse on solutions from comparative law. Furthermore, the author underlines a need for a change of the provision which a priori excludes liability of the regulatory body - the Securities Commission...|$|E
40|$|The {{initial public}} {{offering}} process involves a restructuring of a firm’s identity and image. In this paper we explore how the images presented by firms in their prospectus are shaped by the networks of relationships these firms maintain {{to each other and}} to the stakeholders of the IPO process. In the absence of direct experience with entrepreneurial firms, most financial institutions and advisors who evaluate an {{initial public offering}} (IPO) on behalf of their clients must rely on images that convey information about the relevant attributes a legitimate publicly held firm should possess (Pollock & Rindova, 2003). Image is the symbolic representation of an organization (Alvesson, 1990) and an important strategic tool through which managers can communicate select aspects of organizational identity to their stakeholders that shape perceptions of legitimacy (Elsbach, 1994; Lamertz, Heugens, & Calmet, 2005). In the case of a firm issuing an IPO, the <b>prospectus</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> focal example of interest, a written document that is created in order to present a favourable image of an enterprise about to go public. The representation of such an IPO firm image constitutes a difficult challenge because the emerging public enterprise faces a new and unfamiliar field of stakeholders, institutional constraints, and resourc...|$|E
40|$|The Duke University Health System Demand Response <b>Prospectus</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> client-based Masters Project that {{explores the}} {{profitability}} and {{environmental impacts of}} enrolling Duke University Health System and Duke University into Duke Energy’s PowerShare demand response program. Demand response programs are mechanisms used by utilities to decrease energy demand during high-usage periods (e. g. hot days when air conditioning use is highest) by incentivizing their customers to reduce grid consumption for a limited time. This temporary demand reduction results in cost savings to utilities because {{it allows them to}} avoid using their most inefficient and expensive power plants. In our project, we analyze the economic, environmental, and regulatory feasibility of using Duke University and Duke Medicine emergency generators in a Duke Energy demand response program called PowerShare, more specifically the Generator Curtailment Option. Duke Carbon Offset Initiative credits, a Duke University funding mechanism to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, were also considered as a potential revenue source. In order to conduct the analysis, an MS Excel and Visual Basic model was created to calculate the impacts of enrollment. The model provided to the client was designed to offer an easy user interface to quickly conduct the analyses. It was also specially designed to offer the flexibility to incorporate future changes in the energy market and user preferences. The model results indicated that, while feasible, demand response enrollment is not currently attractive from environmental and financial perspectives. The financials are poor for two mains reasons. First, expected net revenues are strictly negative because PowerShare enrollment requires Duke University to re-enroll into paying a demand side management rider (DSM) to which they are currently exempt. The DSM fee, although minimal individually, amounts to an astronomical fee for large consumers like Duke University and Duke Medicine since it is charged per unit of energy purchased. Second, PowerShare curtailment compensation is lower than current cost of diesel fuel. From an environmental perspective, PowerShare is also not a favorable option. Instead of offering a carbon emissions reduction opportunity, PowerShare participation is actually expected {{to increase the amount of}} global carbon emissions because Duke University generators emit more carbon than Duke Energy’s natural gas peak usage plants...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{contributes}} to intellectual capital (IC) disclosure research. Focussing on reducing the information asymmetry associated with agency theory, {{the purpose of}} this paper is to investigate the extent to which managers and owners disclose IC in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses. In particular, it examines the influence on post-issue stock performance based on the IPOs of technology companies listing on the NASDAQ from 2002 to 2013. Parallels are drawn to integrated reporting (), which was developed after the global financial crisis (GFC) because of the perceived shortcomings of regulated forms of financial reporting. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply a two-stage methodology, using content analysis of prospectuses to determine the extent of IC disclosure, then combining this data with market data using regression analysis to determine the influence of IC disclosure in IPO prospectuses on post-issue stock performance. Findings: According to the content analysis results, these IPO prospectuses contain significant amounts of IC disclosure for the subsequent analysis. The authors find that after the GFC technology companies disclose more IC information. The econometric analysis also reveals that IC disclosure has a higher influence on post-issue stock performance after the GFC than before. Research limitations/implications: The research shows how IPO <b>prospectuses</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> valid form of disclosure to investigate the impact of reducing IC information asymmetry because they contain significant amounts of forward-looking non-financial information about the company’s development. Additionally, the results are relevant to discussions about the impact of. If IC and non-financial disclosures contained in <b>an</b> integrated report <b>are</b> forward-looking and reduce information asymmetry then may have value relevance to a firm. Practical implications: The research confirms that more IC disclosure information in prospectuses may positively influence companies’ post-issue stock performance, especially in the long run. However, the authors caution that disclosing IC information to investors is not the panacea for increased post-IPO share performance. Originality/value: This paper is novel because it shows the value relevance of IC disclosures to reduce information asymmetry through its focus on prospectuses, which helps to understand of the potential impact of. 21 page(s...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. At {{the time}} of a fresh issue of shares or {{debentures}} to the public, the principle document that provides potential investors with information {{on which to base}} their investment decisions, is a prospectus. In terms of the Companies Act, an offer of shares may not be made to the public unless it is accompanied by a prospectus. The information to be disclosed in a prospectus must conform to the requirements of Schedule 3 of the Companies Act. A prospectus also has to comply with the JSE Listing Requirements. Schedule 3 was promulgated in 1975 and has not been amended since. The question arises whether the requirements of Schedule 3 are comparable with similar international regulations and meet the needs of a changing business environment in South Africa. In an attempt to overcome this problem, ED 105 - Report offinancial information to be included in a prospectus created the first accounting statement dealing with the financial information that should be included in a prospectus, as well as proposing a revised Schedule 3 to the Standing Advisory Committee on Company Law relating to non-financial information that should be disclosed in a prospectus. Firstly this thesis aimed to establish whether the <b>prospectus</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> protection instrument for potential investors. The prospectus must, therefore, provide potential investors with sufficient and reliable information to enable them to make sound investment decisions. The contents of Schedule 3 were analysed in comparison with the JSE Listing Requirements and ED 105 to determine whether {{progress has been made in}} the provision of quality information to potential investors through the prospectus. The current South African requirements for disclosure in the prospectus were also compared with the requirements of leading overseas bourses and the prospectuses of recently listed companies. ED 105 improved the accuracy, completeness and relevancy of the requirements contained in Schedule 3 and the JSE Listing Requirements. The comparison, however, highlighted additional items of disclosure that can further contribute to the prospectus being a protection instrument for potential investors. In view of the financial literacy levels of the South African population, it was also necessary to investigate the ability of potential investors, especially private investors, to understand, interpret and use the information provided in a prospectus. The second objective was, therefore, to determine whether the prospectus empowers potential investors. The prospectus will be an empowerment instrument if the information provided therein is of - such a nature that potential investors can understand and interpret the information for decision-making purposes. An investigation into the literacy profile of potential investors, into relevant education provided to potential investors and an assessment ofthe understandability of the contents of the prospectus was, therefore, performed. Financial information required in ED 105 is strongly linked to the latest Statements of GAAP. A number of the items are only lectured on CT A level and with the Harmonisation and Improvements Project it can be expected that only individuals with a recent CTA will be able to understand these requirements. ED 105 impaired the understandability of the prospectus by the average potential investor...|$|E
40|$|As {{stated in}} the introduction, a {{prospectus}} aims to ensure investors that they are provided with reliable information about the securities which they are invited to purchase. Two mechanisms exist to enforce the publication of reliable information in the prospectus: the public enforcement mechanism and civil liability claims. The liability of issuers and its directors for the prospectus {{is an example of}} the latter. Given the international nature of the securities market, the question has to be answered which law is applicable to a prospectus liability claim? The Rome II Regulation provides from 11 January 2009 the rules to decide which law applies to claims arising from non-contractual obligations. From the above analysis it is clear that the Rome II Regulation is applicable to prospectus liability claims against the issuing company and its directors or officers, which are brought before a Member State court by investors. Consequently the law applicable to this prospectus liability claim is the law of the country in which the damage occurs: the lex loci damni. The country in which the damage occurs has to be determined in accordance with the respective case-law of the ECJ on the Brussels I Regulation on jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and its predecessor. The damage arising from false or incomplete information in the <b>prospectus</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pure financial loss. According to the ECJ in Kronhoferthe place where the investor holds his investment account is the place where the direct financial loss is sustained by the investor. Given the universal scope of application of the Rome II Regulation as laid down in Article 3, investors holding an investment account outside the European Union may bring proceedings against the issuer and its directors before a court in a Member State and have their domestic prospectus liability laws applied. Since the securities market has internationalised, issuers and its directors may be confronted with many laws applicable to liability claims arising from the issue of securities through the publication of a prospectus. In my opinion this outcome is not desirable and impedes the objective of the PD 2003 to achieve an internal market for capital by granting a single passport to issuers. I have therefore recommended that the European Commission should either use its power to lay down a proposal to amend the Rome II Regulation, or adopt a Directive which harmonises the national laws with respect to the civil responsibility of the issuing company and its directors. With respect to the adaptation of the Rome II Regulation, I propose a new provision which stipulates that the law applicable to liability claims against the issuer and/or its directors based on the provision of false and/or incomplete information by the issuer and its directors to investors should be the law of the Member State in which the securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market where the actual transaction took place. When securities are not admitted to trading the law applicable to liability claims against the issuer and/or its directors based on the provision of false information by the issuer and its directors to investors should be the law of the Member State in which the prospectus is published (the place where the event giving rise to liability in tort occurred). If the Rome II Regulation is amended so as to achieve the aforementioned result, I could adhere to the proverb: ‘all roads lead to Rome’...|$|E
