50|$|In July 1981, all of KA's members visited PFLP in Lebanon. From 1982 to 1984, Bo Weimann began {{compiling}} a file of potential Mossad operatives in Denmark. The file happened {{to include a}} lot of Jews, but the group later insisted that listing or killing Jews in general was never the goal, just figuring out which ones were actively fighting for Mossad {{in a manner similar}} to KA's own relationship with the PFLP. At trial this is ruled espionage. On April 2, 1982, the gang allegedly robbed <b>postal</b> workers carrying <b>cash</b> to a bank, yielding DKK 0.786 million (US$0.096 million) in cash and DKK 72 million in worthless checks. The gang allegedly robbed an armored Bank van on March 2, 1983, robbing DKK 8.3 million (US$0.96 million). No individual gang member was found guilty in this. Two Palestinian PFLP-members were arrested in Paris with DKK 6 million in suspicious cash on March 26, 1983. The investigation was bungled.|$|R
