5|$|Proposed {{transportation}} {{management strategies}} {{are aimed at}} keeping traffic into Aspen at the baseline 1993 level through 2015. There are three levels or strategic response: The first would be when that baseline is equaled or slightly exceeded. It would consist of promoting ride sharing and more extensive transit use, among other informational measures. At Level 2, when traffic reaches a few percentage points above that level, more transit service would be added, and parking rates raised slightly to fund the additional buses required to reduce headways. Level 3 would be implemented when traffic levels had exceeded the baseline by 5–10%, and would use more forceful measures such as steeper increases in <b>parking</b> <b>fees,</b> deliberately {{limiting the number of}} spaces available, and making some parts of downtown Aspen car-free zones.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the State of Connecticut paid $550,000 {{to acquire}} the parcel of land which became Lake Gardner State Park. The land was {{acquired}} from the estate of Carmine Belardo and returned a beach to public service {{that had been a}} private resort for 60 years. The Town of Salem had sought {{to acquire the}} land, but the citizens rejected the plan three times and a state funded grant was rejected in 1994 after the DEP announced the interest in acquiring the property for the state. In 2008, the state spent about $1million to pave the boat launch area and improve parking for 54 vehicles. In 2012, the State of Connecticut was looking to institute <b>parking</b> <b>fees</b> for the park after it experienced several years of increased attendance and incidents in the park limits. Concerns included littering, unkempt toilets, swimmers going outside the designated zone and police arresting almost three times as many visitors from 2011. In response to the issues, patrols were increased and additional signage was added to inform swimmers. The problems with trash problems and portable toilets ending up in the lake caused concerns for a local advocacy group, Friends of Gardner Lake, and the Gardner Lake Authority which has staff to attend the lake during peak hours.|$|E

Within certain limits, inability to charge some drivers for parking does not reduce the potential welfare gain. Drivers who cannot be charged travel when there is queuing.
