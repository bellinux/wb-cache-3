The lack of a change in the activities of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in cell culture upon exposure to TCDD indirectly indicates that the compound is persistent to biodegradation in the cell culture system.

40|$|The major {{limitation}} of using primary hepatocytes is the rapid dedifferentiation of hepatocytes during isolation and culture, whereby {{most of the}} liver-specific functions are lost. Despite the many efforts {{that have been made}} to optimize the culture condition, current primary cultured hepatocyte preparations still only retain partial hepatocyte phenotype observed in liver in vivo. To further optimize primary hepatocytes it is essential to understand the key factors that underlie the dedifferentiation process during <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture.</b> Up or down-regulation of key transcription factors has been observed during <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture,</b> which could lead to dramatic change of downstream target genes. In my study, the influence of <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture</b> on the expression of a more ubiquitously expressed transcription factor family called sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) was examined. SREBP transcriptionally regulates genes involved in glucose metabolism, lipognesis and cholesterolgenesis, which are the three important functions of liver. I compared the expression of SREBP and putative SREBP target genes in two culture media- one of which was a basic support for <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture</b> (MM) and the second of which was. designed to sustain hepatocytes in a more differentiated state for a prolonged period (HepatozymeÃ‚Â™). I showed that mRNA encoding SREBP and putative SREBP target genes decreased during culture in MM, but that HepatozymeÃ‚Â™ selectively improved mRNA expression for SREBP- 2 and NF-Y and all the putative SREBP target genes which contain SRE/NF-Y composite elements in their promoters (FAS, 514, HMGCR and squalene synthase). Genes that lacked the SRE/NF-Y structure within their promoters (SREBP- 1 a, GK, L-PK and PEPCK) showed a decreased mRNA profile during culture in both medium conditions. Transcription factors involved in the transcriptional activation of GK, PEPCK and SREBP- 1 a (including LXR-a, HNF- 4 a and Sp 1) also exhibited a decreased profile during culture in both medium conditions. My data indicates that improved expression of specific transcription factors during <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture</b> could underlie the recovery of a subset of downstream target genes. However, the number of improved transcription factors was small, which suggests that further improvement of the expression of transcription factors would be an important aspect for the maintenance of primary hepatocyte gene expression. My studies have provided an approach of understanding the relationship between the status of key transcription factors with that of downstream target genes during <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture,</b> and this could be a good starting point of understanding a broader aspect of key transcription factors that is involved in the maintenance of global gene expression during <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

To determine the molecular mechanisms, {{the aim of the}} present study was to establish a stress model using <b>primary</b> human <b>hepatocytes</b> (PHHs) and to study the effects of insulin on the hepatic inflammatory signaling cascade. Liver tissue was obtained from general surgical patients, and PHHs were isolated and maintained in <b>culture.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures</b> were challenged with various doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the inflammatory signal transcription cascade was determined by real-time PCR. In subsequent experiments, <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures</b> were challenged with LPS and insulin was added in various doses. Glucose was determined by colorimetric assays. PHHs treated with 100 μg/mL LPS showed a profound inflammatory reaction with increased expression of interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 10, IL- 1 β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT- 5). Insulin at 10 IU/mL significantly decreased IL- 6, TNF, and IL- 1 β at pretranslational levels, an effect associated with decreased STAT- 5 mRNA expression (P < 0. 05). Glucose concentration and cellular metabolic activity were not different between controls and insulin-treated cells. Based on our results, we suggest that <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures</b> can be used to study the effect of LPS on the inflammatory cascade.

Back-cross studies using the progeny between (NZB x C 3 H/HeJ) F 1 and C 3 H/HeJ mice indicate that the basal level of SU is not associated with the Lps locus on chromosome 4. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mitogen response-negative mice did not show the enhancement of serum SU production after LPS injection. Spleen cells from LPS-mitogen response-positive but not from negative mice showed increase of IL- 6 synthesis {{in the presence of}} LPS.

In contrast to what is observed in man, concentrations of alpha 2 -macroglobulin and transferrin were increased. Co-culture of <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures</b> with lipopolysaccharide-activated human peripheral blood monocytes or incubation with conditioned medium prepared from lipopolysaccharide-activated human or rabbit monocytes resulted in dose-dependent induction of serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin and transferrin and depression of albumin synthesis, while C-reactive protein synthesis and mRNA levels remained unchanged. A variety of interleukin- 1 preparations induced dose-dependent increases in the synthesis and secretion of serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin and transferrin and decreased albumin synthesis. Human recombinant tumour necrosis factor (cachectin) induced a dose-dependent increase in synthesis of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin. In general, human interleukin- 1 was more potent than mouse interleukin- 1 and tumour necrosis factor. None of the monokines we studied had an effect on C-reactive protein synthesis or mRNA levels. These data confirm that C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin display acute phase behaviour in the rabbit, and demonstrate that, in contrast to their behaviour in man, alpha 2 M and transferrin are positive acute phase proteins in this species. While both interleukin- 1 and tumour necrosis factor regulate biosynthesis {{of a number of}} these acute phase proteins in rabbit <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures,</b> neither of these monokines induced C-reactive protein synthesis.

40|$|Insulin {{sensitivity}} is impaired in obesity, and {{insulin resistance}} {{is the primary}} risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Here we show that lipocalin- 13 (LCN 13), a lipocalin superfamily member, is a novel insulin sensitizer. LCN 13 was secreted by multiple cell types. Circulating LCN 13 was markedly reduced in mice with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Three distinct approaches were used to increase LCN 13 levels: LCN 13 transgenic mice, LCN 13 adenoviral infection, and recombinant LCN 13 administration. Restoration of LCN 13 significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in mice with obesity. LCN 13 enhanced insulin signaling not only in animals but also in cultured adipocytes. Recombinant LCN 13 increased the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in adipocytes and to suppress hepatic glucose production (HGP) in <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures.</b> Additionally, LCN 13 alone was able to suppress HGP, whereas neutralization of LCN 13 increased HGP in <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures.</b> These data suggest that LCN 13 regulates glucose metabolism by both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent mechanisms.

40|$|We have {{characterized}} the induction of acyl-CoA oxidase and cytochrome P 450 IVA 1 RNAs in a <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture</b> system in vitro, using a sensitive and specific RNAse protection assay. Hepatocytes were cultured with a maximal inducing {{dose of the}} peroxisome proliferator clofibric acid (1 mM), or vehicle control, for 4 days, {{and the level of}} RNAs compared with the level in rats which had been treated with corn oil or clofibric acid (300 mg/kg) for 4 days. The level of acyl-CoA oxidase and P 450 IVA 1 RNAs in 4 -day-old control hepatocytes was less than 2 % of that in control liver. However, the level of these RNAs in RNA from treated hepatocytes was 61 % of that in liver RNA from treated rats. Hepatocytes were treated with the potent peroxisome proliferator methylclofenapate (100 microM), and the induction of RNAs determined at various times after exposure. P 450 IVA 1 RNA was significantly induced 1 h after dosing, rising to 34 -fold above control after 8 h, whereas acyl-CoA oxidase RNA was not significantly induced until 4 h, increasing to 5. 2 -fold above control after 8 h. A similar time course of induction was seen after treatment of hepatocytes with 100 microM-nafenopin, 100 microM-methylclofenapate, 1 mM-clofibric acid or 1 mM-mono(ethylhexyl) phthalate, suggesting that the differential time course of induction of P 450 IVA 1 and acyl-CoA oxidase RNAs is not related to the esterification, structure or potency of the peroxisome proliferator, but is intrinsic to the process of peroxisome proliferation. Hepatocytes were treated with methylclofenapate in the presence and absence of cycloheximide. P 450 IVA 1 RNA was significantly induced by methylclofenapate in the presence of cycloheximide, rising to 17 -fold above control after 8 h. However, no induction of acyl-CoA oxidase RNA was detected in the presence of cycloheximide. Therefore we characterize the induction of acyl-CoA oxidase and P 450 IVA 1 RNAs in <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture</b> in vitro as a faithful model of the induction response in rat liver, and suggest that induction of P 450 IVA 1 RNA is a primary event in the process of peroxisome proliferation...|$|E

Low nanomolar concentrations of protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (OA) and calyculin A blocked the induction of CYP 2 B 10 mRNA. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that OA suppressed Cyp 2 b 10 gene transcription. Pretreatment of the cells with an inhibitor of Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases ¿ 1 -[N, O-bis-(5 -isoquinolinesulphonyl) -N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]- 4 - phenylpiperazine (KN- 62) ¿ or with a flavonoid, naringin, were completely or partly protective respectively against the OA-mediated suppression of CYP 2 B 10 mRNA. Several other established modulators of protein kinase activities did not greatly affect the induction of CYP 2 B 10 mRNA, nor could they prevent the suppressive effect of OA.

These culture methods comprised the co-culture of hepatocytes with rat liver epithelial cells (CCRLEC), a collagen type I sandwich culture (SW) and a conventional <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> monolayer <b>culture</b> (ML). Basal albumin secretion was most stable over time in SW. Fibrinogen secretion was induced by IL- 6 in all cell culture models. Compared with ML, CC-RLEC showed an almost three-fold higher fibrinogen secretion under both control and IL- 6 -stimulated conditions. Induction of fibrinogen release by IL- 6 was lowest in SW. Albumin secretion was decreased after IL- 6 stimulation in both ML and CC-RLEC. Thus, cells growing under the various <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> cell <b>culture</b> techniques react differently to IL- 6 stimulation with regard to acute-phase protein secretion.

Most increases in gene expressions, including FGF 21, were targets for the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF 4), but not for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α.

However, in hepatocytes stimulated with E 2 in combination with sbPTHrP a higher vitellogenin production was seen than with E 2 alone. It is concluded that sbPTHrP has a potentiating effect on estradiol stimulation of vitellogenin production by sea bream hepatocytes.

At the metabolomic level, connexin 43 silencing caused no overt changes, though there was some evidence for a subtle increase in intracellular glycine quantities.

Although NGF was negative or very weakly expressed in adult and developing livers, it was markedly elevated in neoplastic hepatocytic lesions from early stages of carcinogenesis.

The conditioned medium of hepatocellular carcinoma cells caused PC 12 neurite outgrowth, but this was reduced with pretreatment of the conditioned medium with the anti-NGF antibody or NGF antisense expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Although neither TrkA nor p 75 NTR was detectable in either hepatocellular carcinoma or normal hepatic cells, TrkA was demonstrated in the walls of tumor associated arteries that contain abundant nerve fibers. This study demonstrated that NGF is expressed by hepatocytes during carcinogeneis, regeneration and primary culture, but may have cells other than hepatocytes as the target.

Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and P 1 -based artificial chromosomes (PACs) have proved excellent tools for the human genome sequencing projects. We describe a system to rapidly and efficiently deliver and express BAC and PAC library clones in human and mouse cells by converting them into infectious amplicon vectors.

In liver, [14 C]heme was predominately associated with microsomal cytochromes, and its degradation was examined {{over a period of}} 12 [...] 14 h; concurrently, excretion of labeled carbon monoxide 14 CO by the animal was measured. After correction for 14 CO derived from the breakdown of renal [14 C]heme, the rate of heme degradation calculated from the 14 CO excreted was substantially less than the rate of disappearance of hepatic [14 C]heme measured directly. The discrepancy between actual loss of labeled heme from the liver and generation of labeled CO was confirmed by direct study of endogenous [14 C]heme degradation in <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture,</b> in which only 25 % of the labeled heme disappearing during the incubation was converted to 14 CO. By contrast, cultured cells converted exogenous [14 C]heme nearly quantitatively to 14 CO. We conclude that heme associated with microsomal cytochromes in normal rat liver is degraded substantially by non-CO forming processes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{examined}} the effects of various peroxisome proliferators (PPs) such as the hypolipidaemic agents clofibric acid (CLO), bezafibrate (BEZA), ciprofibrate (CIPRO) and nafenopin (NAFE) and the plasticizer di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on peroxisomal enzyme activities, apoptosis and DNA synthesis in rat FaO and human HepG 2 hepatoma cell lines. Both growing and confluent cultures were treated with PPs (250 microM) for 48 or 72 h. In accordance with our previous observations in PP-treated <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures</b> of rat and human origin, the various PPs increased peroxisomal enzyme activities in rat FaO cells but not in human HepG 2 cells. PPs strongly induced apoptosis in FaO cells. They did not affect TGFbeta-induced apoptosis, with the exception of DEHP and NAFE, respectively blocking and increasing induced apoptosis in confluent cultures. Moreover, PPs produced a minor, but significant, decrease in DNA synthesis in FaO cells. PPs also decreased DNA synthesis in growing HepG 2 cells, and CLO, CIPRO and NAFE induced apoptosis in confluent HepG 2 cultures. This is in opposition with the effects of PPs on <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures,</b> i. e. inhibition of both spontaneous and TGFbeta-induced apoptosis and increases in DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes, and unchanged mitosis-apoptosis balance in human hepatocytes...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} hepatoprotective {{capacity}} of Sapindus mukorossi (S. mukorossi) and Rheum emodi (R. emodi) extracts in CCl 4 treated male rats. METHODS: The dried powder of S. mukorossi and R. emodi was extracted successively with petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform, and ethanol and concentrated in vacuum. <b>Primary</b> rat <b>hepatocyte</b> monolayer <b>cultures</b> {{were used for}} in vitro studies. In vivo, the hepatoprotective capacity of the extract of the fruit pericarp of S. mukorossi and the rhizomes of R. emodi was analyzed in liver injured CCl 4 -treated male rats. RESULTS: In vitro: <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> monolayer <b>cultures</b> were treated with CCl 4 and extracts of S. mukorossi & R. emodi. A protective activity could be demonstrated in the CCl 4 damaged primary monolayer culture. In vivo: extracts of the fruit pericarp of S. mukorossi (2. 5 mg/mL) and rhizomes of R. emodi (3. 0 mg/mL) {{were found to have}} protective properties in rats with CCl 4 induced liver damage as judged from serum marker enzyme activities.

40|$|Background/Aims: EGF {{receptor}} is a main {{participant in}} the regulation of liver regeneration. In <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures,</b> EGF or TGFα binding to EGF receptor activates Erk 1 / 2 and PI 3 K pathways, induces cyclin D 1 and thus initiates DNA synthesis. We have explored mechanisms by which prolonged EGF receptor activation induces hepatocyte proliferation. Methods: EGF receptor activation, as well as Erk 1 / 2 and PI 3 K signaling were explored in EGF-stimulated <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures</b> by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. TGFα release to the medium was quantified by ELISA. Effects of a neutralizing antibody to TGFα on EGF receptor signaling and proliferation were explored. Results: Inhibitors of PI 3 K or Erk 1 / 2 inhibited cyclin D 1 expression and G 1 progression when added 12 hours after EGF stimulation, whereas depletion of EGF from the medium at this time point did not. ELISA demonstrated that EGF induced TGFα release to the medium. Cyclin D 1 induction and cellular proliferation were efficiently inhibited when a neutralizing antibody to TGFα {{was added to the}} medium. This also occurred when the antibody was added 12 hours after EGF stimulation. Conclusion: Sustained EGF receptor activity and signaling through both Erk 1 / 2 and PI 3 K pathways were necessary for proliferation. This was achieved by EGF activation of autocrine TGFα...|$|R
40|$|Cichorium intybus {{a member}} of family Asteraceae, has been {{traditionally}} used as liver protectant and claimed as renal protective and antiinflammatory. It contains many essential lipids, vitamins {{and a variety of}} sugar. For routine primary culture and for optimum growth in several secondary cultures of animal cell serum is frequently used as a source of nutrients. Isolation of serum from fetal bovine being barbarous process as well as its use in culture media is also associated with several drawbacks. Available animal free media are having their own shortcomings. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the plant’s methanolic extract for in vitro cell growth supporting activity on rat hepatocyte primary culture. Plant extract was evaluated at five different concentrations in 96 well plates. At highest concentration of plant extract (50 μg mL - 1) cell viability was found to be 66. 83 %, whereas, at lowest concentration (10 μg mL - 1) cell viability was 24. 12 %. Plant extract was also found to overcome toxic effect of DMSO. Hence this work can be used for further characterization of the particular compound/s support the growth of rat <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture</b> as well as if cells of other origin and types.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that aquaporin- 9 (AQP 9) {{is part of}} the unknown route of hepatocyte glycerol uptake. In a previous study, leptin receptor-deficient wild-type mice became diabetic and suffered from fasting hyperglycemia whereas isogenic AQP 9 (-/-) knock-out mice remained normoglycemic. The reason for this improvement in AQP 9 (-/-) mice was not established before. Here, we show increased glucose output (by 123 % +/- 36 % S. E.) in <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture</b> when 0. 5 mM extracellular glycerol was added. This increase depended on AQP 9 because it was absent in AQP 9 (-/-) cells. Likewise, the increase was abolished by 25 mu M HTS 13286 (IC(50) similar to 2 mu M), a novel AQP 9 inhibitor, which we identified in a small molecule library screen. Similarly, AQP 9 deletion or chemical inhibition eliminated glycerol-enhanced glucose output in perfused liver preparations. The following control experiments suggested inhibitor specificity to AQP 9 : (i) HTS 13286 affected solute permeability in cell lines expressing AQP 9, but not in cell lines expressing AQPs 3, 7, or 8. (ii) HTS 13286 did not influence lactate-and pyruvate-dependent hepatocyte glucose output. (iii) HTS 13286 did not affect glycerol kinase activity. Our experiments establish AQP 9 as the primary route of hepatocyte glycerol uptake for gluconeogenesis and thereby explain the previously observed, alleviated diabetes in leptin receptor-deficient AQP 9 (-/-) mice...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{overload}} aggravates {{tissue damage}} caused by ischemia and ethanol intoxication. The underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon are not yet clear. To clarify these mechanisms we followed free iron (loosely bound redox-active iron) concentration in livers from rats subjected to experimental iron overload, acute ethanol intoxication, and ex vivo warm ischemia. The levels of free iron in non-homogenized liver tissues, liver homogenates, and hepatocyte cultures were analyzed by means of EPR spectroscopy. Ischemia gradually increased the levels of endogenous free iron in liver tissues and in liver homogenates. The increase was accompanied by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products. Iron overload alone, known to increase significantly the total tissue iron, did not affect either free iron levels or lipid peroxidation. Homogenization of iron-loaded livers, however, resulted in {{the release of a}} significant portion of free iron from endogenous depositories. Acute ethanol intoxication increased free iron levels in liver tissue and diminished the portion of free iron releasing during homogenization. Similarly to liver tissue, the <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>culture</b> loaded with iron in vitro released significantly more free iron during homogenization compared to non iron-loaded hepatocyte culture. Analyzing three possible sources of free iron release under these experimental conditions in liver cells, namely ferritin, intracellular transferrin-receptor complex and heme oxygenase, we suggest that redox active free iron is released from ferritin under ischemic conditions whereas ethanol and homogenization facilitate the release of iron from endosomes containing transferrin-receptor complexes...|$|E

40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures</b> {{suffer from}} the {{progressive}} occurrence of dedifferentiation followed by spontaneous apoptosis. This is associated with modifications in the expression of connexins (Cxs), which are the building stones of hemichannels that in turn form gap junctions between neighboring cells. Specifically, a shift is observed from the adult hepatocellular Cx 32 species toward the fetal Cx 43 isoform. The current study {{was set up to}} investigate the role of Cx 43 in spontaneous apoptosis taking place in <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures.</b> For this purpose, freshly isolated adult rat hepatocytes were cultivated in conventional conditions for 4 days with daily monitoring of Cx expression, Cx localization, and gap junction channel and hemichannel functionality. Gap junction activity was low shortly after isolation, whereas the inverse was observed for hemichannel functionality. Both channel types displayed high activity near the end stages of the cultivation period. The Cx 32 -to-Cx 43 switch became progressively manifested at the translational level. At the transcriptional level, a fivefold decrease in Cx 32 messenger RNA abundance and a twofold increase in Cx 43 expression were noticed within the first 24 h of cultivation. Throughout the cultivation period, Cx 32 was mainly located at the plasma membrane surface, whereas Cx 43 immunostaining was more diffuse. Application of three Cx 43 inhibitors resulted in the downregulation of both hemichannel functionality and gap junction activity. This was paralleled by decreased expression and activity of caspase 3 as well as by reduced expression of Bid. Collectively, these data show that Cx 43 signaling actively contributes to the occurrence of spontaneous apoptosis in <b>cultures</b> of <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Natural and {{synthetic}} biomaterials utilized in tissue engineering applications require a dynamic interplay of complex macromolecular compositions of hydrated extracellular matrices (ECMs) and soluble growth factors. The challenges in utilizing synthetic ECMs is the effective control of {{temporal and spatial}} complexity of multiple signal presentation, as compared to natural ECMs that possess the inherent properties of biological recognition, including presentation of receptor-binding ligands, susceptibility to cell-triggered proteolytic degradation, and remodeling. We have developed a murine preadipocyte differentiation system for generating a natural basement membrane extract (Adipogel) comprising ECM proteins (collagen IV, laminin, hyaluronan, and fibronectin) and including relevant growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor). We have shown the effective utilization of the growth factor-enriched extracellular matrix for enhanced albumin synthesis rate of <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures</b> {{for a period of}} 10 d as compared to collagen sandwich cultures and comparable or higher function as compared to Matrigel cultures. We have also demonstrated comparable cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 activity for the collagen-Adipogel condition to the collagen double-gel and Matrigel culture conditions. A metabolic analysis revealed that utilization of Adipogel in <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>cultures</b> increased serine, glycine, threonine, alanine, tyrosine, valine, methionine, lysine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, taurine, cysteine, and glucose uptake rates to enhance hepatocyte protein synthesis as compared to collagen double-gel cultures. The demonstrated synthesis, isolation, characterization, and application of Adipogel provide immense potential for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. —Sharma, N.
