5|$|Archaeologist William R. Coe {{divided the}} Mundo Perdido complex into two clearly demarcated areas that he {{referred}} to as the High <b>Plaza</b> and the Low <b>Plaza.</b> The High <b>Plaza</b> is the area around the Lost World Pyramid. It is closed on the south side by Structures 6C-24 and 6C-25. A range of eight adjoining structures divide the High <b>Plaza</b> from the <b>Plaza</b> of the Seven Temples to the east. On the north side, the <b>Plaza</b> is principally delimited by Structures 5D-77, 5C-45, 5C-46, together with some smaller structures. The Low <b>Plaza</b> lies {{to the west of the}} Lost World Pyramid, centred upon Structure 5C-53, a low platform. The Low <b>Plaza</b> is closed on its north side by the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49), which is the second largest structure in the whole complex.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{elevation}} {{above the}} McCormick Tribune <b>Plaza</b> & Ice Rink, the <b>plaza</b> {{has become a}} prime viewing location for Jazz music concerts held during the summer at the McCormick Tribune <b>Plaza.</b> McCormick Tribune <b>Plaza</b> is located below and {{to the west of}} AT <b>Plaza</b> as well as adjacent to Michigan Avenue's Historic Michigan Boulevard District, which are slightly further west.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plaza</b> 2 {{is a large}} <b>plaza</b> at the {{southeast}} of the site core, south of <b>Plaza</b> 1. It is bordered on {{the southeast}}ern side by Structure 4, on the northeast by Structure 1, on the northwest by the ballcourt and on the southwest by <b>Plaza</b> 3.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, The Ohio Turnpike Commission began modernizing {{its service}} <b>plazas,</b> first {{demolishing}} the original <b>plazas</b> and then reconstructing {{them from the}} ground up. In addition to modern restrooms, the new <b>plazas</b> offer several fast food choices, which vary between the <b>plazas.</b> They also include ATMs, gift shops, travel information counters, Wi-Fi internet access, and facilities for truck drivers, including shower facilities, lounge, and laundry areas. Sunoco fuel stations are provided at all service <b>plazas</b> along the Ohio Turnpike. The company signed a new contract to operate all 16 <b>plazas</b> on the Ohio Turnpike beginning in 2012. Facilities for overnight RV campers are provided at the service <b>plazas</b> located at mile markers 20, 76, 139, and 197.|$|R

30|$|The first {{objective}} of the paper is to apply the APA algorithm to the network generated by the <b>plazas</b> of the city. First, we proceed by determining all the squares (<b>plazas)</b> {{that are in the}} urban street network. We have identified a total of 72 <b>plazas</b> in the city area for study. These venues are shown in Fig. 2, where we identify the different <b>plazas</b> over the map of the city and construct a graph taking these venues as nodes and edges connecting neighbor <b>plazas.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Plaza</b> 3 {{is a small}} <b>plaza</b> at the {{southern}} extreme of the site core, southwest of <b>Plaza</b> 2 {{and south of the}} ballcourt.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plaza</b> 5 {{is a small}} <b>plaza</b> {{immediately}} west of <b>Plaza</b> 4 {{and northwest}} of the ballcourt. It is divided from <b>Plaza</b> 6 to the northwest by Structure 21.|$|E

40|$|China’s {{development}} {{during the}} last several decades has happened at an amazing speed, and public <b>plazas</b> in China have changed considerably. For example, public dancing has become a very popular activity in most public <b>plazas,</b> and many more people than before are using these new <b>plazas.</b> However, some <b>plazas</b> are less popular than others. Therefore {{it is important to know}} what are the elements that affect people’s use of China’s public <b>plazas?</b> In the United States, William H. Whyte’s research proposed seven elements in public space that affect people. This study tried to answer the following questions: 1) Do William H. Whyte’s seven elements also apply to China? 2) How are urban public <b>plazas</b> used differently in the United States and China...|$|R

5|$|The AT <b>Plaza</b> is {{a public}} space that hosts the Cloud Gate sculpture. The <b>plaza</b> opened in July 2004 with the {{unveiling}} of the sculpture during the grand opening weekend of the park. Ameritech donated $3million for the naming right for the <b>plaza,</b> but it was SBC <b>Plaza</b> when the park opened, as a merger had changed the company name to SBC Communications. The 2005 merger of SBC and AT Corporation led to the present name. The sculpture and the AT <b>Plaza</b> are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune <b>Plaza</b> & Ice Rink. The <b>plaza</b> has become a place to view the McCormick Tribune <b>Plaza</b> & Ice Rink. During the holiday season, the <b>plaza</b> hosts Christmas caroling.|$|E
5|$|The <b>plaza</b> was {{originally}} named Ameritech <b>Plaza</b> for Ameritech Corporation, the corporate sponsor, who donated $3million for the sculpture-hosting plaza's naming rights. By {{the time the}} park officially opened in 2004, Ameritech had merged with SBC Communications and the <b>plaza</b> was called SBC <b>Plaza.</b> When SBC acquired AT and subsequently changed the name from SBC to AT in 2005, {{the name of the}} <b>plaza</b> changed again.|$|E
5|$|Between El Hatillo and La Lagunita is {{the smaller}} Manuel Escalona <b>Plaza</b> (Spanish: Plazoleta Manuel Escalona), another urban {{monument}} displaying the bust of Escalona that formerly occupied Bolívar Square. Sucre <b>Plaza</b> (Spanish: <b>Plaza</b> Sucre) – graced since 1915 with a ceiba tree {{at its center}} – is {{in the southern part}} of town; this was historically where people tied their mules while frequenting The Four Corners, and it is also known as <b>Plaza</b> La Ceiba. The Four Corners (Spanish: Las Cuatro Esquinas) was a convenient social gathering spot in El Hatillo, comprising a general store, hardware shop, gambling place and bar.|$|E
50|$|Major {{projects}} included tree planting along streets, remodeling {{and designing}} public <b>plazas</b> and walkways {{as well as}} designing completely new parks and expanding older ones. Major parks and <b>plazas</b> that particularly show Thays influence on Buenos Aires include the parks Centenario, Lezama, Patricios, Barrancas de Belgrano and the <b>plazas</b> Constitución, Congreso, and Mayo. Thays' French heritage is reflected in many of his designs, in so far that Buenos Aires' parks and <b>plazas</b> are often compared to similar designs in Paris.|$|R
50|$|The turnpike has 13 service <b>plazas,</b> {{which are}} open 24 hours a day. All feature a Subway, a Dunkin' Donuts, a {{convenience}} store, and fuel service provided by ExxonMobil (branded as Mobil). Most <b>plazas</b> {{also offer a}} variety of other food service options, including McDonald's and Sbarro. From 2011 to 2015, the original <b>plazas</b> were rebuilt with new and expanded buildings and improved fueling facilities. Prior to the rebuilding, the <b>plazas</b> on the I-395 section only had a convenience store.|$|R
40|$|Urban <b>plazas</b> {{as public}} spaces occur in every town and city around the world; however, some <b>plazas</b> are more {{user-friendly}} and successful than others. This study examined that “aesthetics” {{also have a}} significant impact {{to determine the extent of}} success of urban <b>plazas</b> and urban open spaces in combination with other quantitative factors, such as centrality of location, provision of services, and amenities. In addition, this research sought to focus on the relationship between visual characteristics and aesthetic response to urban <b>plazas.</b> Photo elicitation and focus interviews were conducted to identify key visual characteristics as well as to examine aesthetic responses to those characteristics. Eight <b>plazas</b> and designed urban open spaces in Dhaka, Bangladesh, featured in the main study, and research methods included a structured questionnaire to collect data and used semantic differential rating scales as a measuring instrument. Outcomes from this research indicate that a positive aesthetic response was linked to specific visual characteristics of urban <b>plazas,</b> suggesting that this information could be used to more effectively refurbish existing and design new urban <b>plazas</b> as public spaces...|$|R
5|$|Further {{excavations}} {{have taken}} place since the 1990s, including investigations of the West <b>Plaza</b> in 2003, the East <b>Plaza</b> in 2004, the acropolis in 20052006 and the Northwest <b>Plaza</b> in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Originally, PR-22 {{had only}} five toll <b>plazas</b> (Hatillo, Vega Alta, Toa Baja, Fort Buchanan, and the Factor ramp); the Arecibo and Manatí toll <b>plazas</b> were {{added in the}} early 1990s.|$|R
5|$|In 2000 the Arden Group {{settled with}} One Meridian Plaza's owners E/R Partners {{to pay more}} than US$13 million for the site. In 1999 Arden sued E/R Partners for backing out of a deal Arden said it had made with the site owners. E/R Partners had wanted to sell the site to Liberty Property Trust for a higher amount. Arden had already bought the {{adjacent}} Two Mellon <b>Plaza</b> in 1993. Damaged and vacant since the One Meridian <b>Plaza</b> fire, Two Mellon <b>Plaza</b> was converted into a Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2000. Also adjacent to {{the south side of the}} One Meridian <b>Plaza</b> site is 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner Commercial Properties bought the property which contained the site of several three-story shops and the eighteen-story Morris Building, all damaged and vacant due to the One Meridian <b>Plaza</b> fire. The buildings were demolished in 2000. The north side of the One Meridian <b>plaza</b> site faces Philadelphia City Hall across the street. While the One Meridian <b>Plaza</b> site waited for development Arden converted it into an underground parking garage.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, the JBG Companies {{purchased}} L'Enfant <b>Plaza,</b> the L'Enfant <b>Plaza</b> Hotel, and the North and South {{office buildings}} from the Sarakreek Holdings for $200 million. The following year, the JBG Companies upgraded the hotel's physical plant, {{and added a}} Louvre Pyramid-like structure to the <b>plaza</b> {{in front of the}} hotel. This was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.|$|E
5|$|Pei and {{his team}} also {{designed}} a united urban area for Washington, D.C., L'Enfant <b>Plaza</b> (named for French-American architect Pierre Charles L'Enfant). Pei's associate Araldo Cossutta was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building (955 L'Enfant <b>Plaza</b> SW) and South Building (490 L'Enfant <b>Plaza</b> SW). Vlastimil Koubek was the architect for the East Building (L'Enfant <b>Plaza</b> Hotel, located at 480 L'Enfant <b>Plaza</b> SW), and for the Center Building (475 L'Enfant <b>Plaza</b> SW; now the United States Postal Service headquarters). The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both the Washington Post and Washington Star (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and {{a significant reduction in}} scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{centre of}} the site is grouped around the North and South <b>Plazas,</b> {{both of which are}} open <b>plazas,</b> and the closed West and East Plazuelas which are {{completely}} enclosed by architecture.|$|R

50|$|The Mon-Fayette Expressway is a {{toll road}} {{for much of}} its length. Unlike the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{mainline}} and the Northeast Extension, which uses long-distance tickets, the Mon-Fayette Expressway collects fixed tolls at regular intervals. In addition, auxiliary toll <b>plazas</b> exist on certain on- and off-ramps. In 2008, the PTC retrofitted all toll <b>plazas</b> to accept E-ZPass, and Express E-ZPass lanes {{are available at the}} newer toll <b>plazas.</b>|$|R
5|$|Plans {{were made}} in 1993 to build a direct {{interchange}} between the turnpike and I-79 in Cranberry Township, Butler County. A contract was awarded to build this interchange in November 1995. In 1997, transportation officials agreed upon a design for the interchange. The project also included the movement {{the western end of}} the ticket system to a new toll <b>plaza</b> in Warrendale. The interchange project was delayed by a dispute with Marshall and Pine townships in Allegheny County, who wanted to prevent construction of the toll <b>plaza</b> as they thought it would cause noise, air and light pollution. Marshall Township eventually agreed to allow the toll <b>plaza</b> be built. Groundbreaking for the new interchange took place on February 22, 2002. The westbound Butler service <b>plaza</b> was closed because the Warrendale toll <b>plaza</b> was to be located at its site. On June 1, 2003, the <b>plaza</b> opened and the Gateway toll <b>plaza</b> became a flat-rate toll <b>plaza,</b> while all the exit toll plazas west of Warrendale closed. The direct interchange between the turnpike and I-79, connecting to US 19, opened on November 12, 2003. The project cost $44 million.|$|E

50|$|The service <b>plazas</b> {{located in}} Lucas County west of Toledo at mile marker 49 {{were the least}} utilized. The Ohio Turnpike Commission {{eventually}} demolished them, and plans construction of new <b>plazas</b> between mile markers 20 and 49; the new facility {{will most likely be}} located in Fulton County and is expected to open after 2012. Due to the lack of a municipal water/sewer system, the service <b>plazas</b> located near mile marker 20 in Williams County were demolished in 2006, though they were eventually rebuilt and reopened on June 29, 2011. The <b>plazas</b> at mile 237 reopened in 2013.|$|R
