50|$|A jet spray washer cleans by {{flooding}} the parts with warm chemical solution and high chemical concentration {{to clean the}} parts. In the power wash process the parts are blasted with hot chemical solution utilizing the hydraulic impact force of the cleaning solution as the <b>primary</b> <b>cleaning</b> mechanism. A parts washer utilizing the power washer process operates at a very low concentration of cleaning detergent. The lower concentration causes the cleaning solution to last longer before it becomes supersaturated and requires disposal. Additionally, a low concentration of cleaning chemicals allows for easier rinsing of the detergent from the parts thereby minimizing rinse cycle requirements thus saving water and cycle time. A final factor used in the power wash process is an oscillating manifold system that is non-synchronous to {{the rotation of the}} turntable. This system assures that the blasted solution reaches all areas of the parts load that are otherwise blinded by the stationary manifolds used in the jet spray process. All things considered the power wash process is superior to the jet spray process for faster more thorough parts cleaning cycles while minimizing detergent use and waste generation. The power wash process is generally effective for difficult soil removal applications such as burnt hydrocarbons, paint, scale, varnish, carbon, mastic, or rubber. Additional power wash types of applications generally include cleaning diesel engines, aerospace components, aluminum automobile engine parts and rolling mill equipment.|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{testing of}} the <b>primary</b> <b>cleaning</b> station for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and {{canisters}} is reported. A primary clean machine {{will be used to}} remove the gross sludge from canisters and fuel while maintaining water quality in the downstream process area. To facilitate SNF separation from canisters and minimize the impact to water quality, all canisters will be subjected to mechanical agitation and flushing with the Primary Clean Station. The Primary Clean Station consists of an outer containment box with an internally mounted, perforated wash basket. A single canister containing up to 14 fuel assemblies will be loaded into the wash basket, the confinement box lid closed, and the wash basket rotated for a fixed cycle time. During this cycle, basin water will be flushed through the wash basket and containment box to remove and entrain the sludge and carry it out of the box. <b>Primary</b> <b>cleaning</b> tests were performed to provide information concerning the removal of sludge from the fuel assemblies while in the basin canisters. The testing was also used to determine if additional fuel cleaning is required outside of the fuel canisters. Hydraulic performance and water demand requirements of the cleaning station were also evaluated. Thirty tests are reported in this document. Tests demonstrated that sludge can be dislodged and suspended sufficiently to remove it from the canister. Examination of fuel elements after cleaning suggested that more than 95 % of the exposed fuel surfaces were cleaned so that no visual evidence of remained. As a result of testing, recommendations are made for the cleaning cycle. 3 refs., 16 figs., 4 tabs...|$|E

40|$|The Fuel Retrieval System (FRS) Process Validation Procedure (Shen 1999) {{requires}} that a specified quantity of fuel processed through the <b>Primary</b> <b>Cleaning</b> Machine (PCM) be inspected for cleanliness during initial operational and process validation testing. Specifically, these inspections are performed {{to confirm that}} the PCM adequately cleans the fuel elements of canister sludge. The results of these inspections will be used to demonstrate that residual quantities of canister particulate on fuel elements loaded into Multi-Canister Overpacks (MCOs) are within projected levels used to establish safety basis limits (Sloughter 1998). The fuel inspections performed as part of the validation process will be conducted during the Hot Operations portion of the Phased Startup Initiative (PSI) of the Fuel Retrieval and Integrated Water Treatment Systems (Pajunen 1999). Hot Operations testing constitutes Phases 3 and 4 of the PSI. The fuel assemblies in all candidate canisters will be thoroughly inspected during these test phases (highly degraded fuel assemblies are exempt from inspection). During subsequent production operation of the FRS, only periodic (every tenth canister) inspections for cleanliness will be performed and documented.

30|$|We {{have tested}} {{different}} cleaning procedures by quantifying surface cleanliness electrochemically in situ and using surface science techniques ex situ. Based on results published by Fischer et al. [21], {{we tested the}} following cleaning protocols: 1. Electrochemical sweep of the gold coated cantilever in 50  mM potassium hydroxide (KOH) from − 0.2 to 1.2  V (vs. Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl)), 2. Electrochemical sweep in 50  mM potassium perchlorate (KClO 4) from − 0.8 to 1.4  V (vs. Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl)) and 3. Piranha solution (Three parts concentrated sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) and one part hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2); note that great caution is necessary when using piranha solution) treatment of the cantilever for 5  min. We find that the KClO 4 and KOH- mediated processes result in the cleanest surface as monitored using ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ cyclic voltammetry. The atomic percent surface composition measured from XPS results of the survey scan for the piranha cleaning method results in 40.2 % gold, 33.6 % carbon and 26.1 % oxygen. A huge improvement of these value, i.e. higher gold percentage can be seen for the KOH sweep {{as well as the}} KClO 4 sweep. For KOH the composition is 65.3 % gold, 30.0 % carbon and 4.74 % oxygen, which is very comparable to the values for the KClO 4 sweep with 61.7 % gold, 33.8 % carbon and 4.5 % oxygen. The KClO 4 sweep is chosen to be the <b>primary</b> <b>cleaning</b> step for all further experiments, as this is a standard media for electrochemical cleaning of gold. Additionally, perchlorate has a very small affinity for gold and will not adsorb onto the gold surface.|$|E
40|$|The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP), {{owned by}} the Department of Energy (DOE), has been {{enriching}} uranium since the early 1950 s. The enrichment process involves electrical and mechanical components that require periodic cleaning. The <b>primary</b> <b>cleaning</b> agent was trichloroethene (TCE) until the late 1980 s. Historical documentation indicates that a mixture of TCE and dry ice were used at PGDP for testing the integrity of steel cylinders, which stored depleted uranium. TCE and dry ice were contained in a below-ground pit and used during the integrity testing. TCE seeped from the pit and contaminated the surrounding soil. The Lasagna{trademark} technology was identified in the Record of Decision (ROD) as the selected alternative for remediation of the cylinder testing site. A public-private consortium formed in 1992 (including DOE, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection, Monsanto, DuPont, and General Electric) developed the Lasagna{trademark} technology. This innovative technology employs electrokinetics to remediate soil contaminated with organics and is especially suited to sites with low permeability soils. This technology uses direct current to move water through the soil faster and more uniformly than hydraulic methods. Electrokinetics moves contaminants in soil pore water through treatment zones comprised of iron filings, where the contaminants are decomposed to basic chemical compounds such as ethane. After three years of development in the laboratory, the consortium field tested the Lasagna{trademark} process in several phases. CDM installed and operated Phase I, the trial installation and field test of a 150 -square-foot area selected for a 120 -day run in 1995. Approximately 98 percent of the TCE was removed. CDM then installed and operated the next phase (IIa), a year-long test on a 600 -square-foot site. Completed in July 1997, this test removed 75 {{percent of the total}} volume of TCE down to a depth of 45 feet. TCE in the test sites. Based on the successful field tests (Phases I and IIa), the ROD was prepared and the Lasagna{trademark} alternative was selected for remediation of TCE contaminated soils at the cylinder testing site Solid Waste Management Unit 91 (SWMU 91). Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC contracted CDM to construct and operate a full-scale Lasagna{trademark} remediation system at the site (Phase IIb). Construction began in August 1999 and the operational phase was initiated in December 1999. The Lasagna{trademark} system was operated for two years and reduced the average concentration of TCE in SWMU 91 soil from 84 ppm to less than 5. 6 ppm. Verification sampling was conducted during May, 2002. Results of the verification sampling indicated the average concentration of TCE in SWMU 91 soil was 0. 38 ppm with a high concentration of 4. 5 ppm...|$|E

40|$|Mutualistic {{interactions}} between ant and aphid {{species have been}} the subject of considerable historical and contemporary investigations, the <b>primary</b> benefits being <b>cleaning</b> and protection for the aphids and carbohydrate-rich honeydew for the ants. Questions remained, however, as to the volatile semiochemical factor influencing this relationship. A recent study highlighted the role of bacterial honeydew volatile compounds in ant attraction. Here, ant's ability to distantly discriminate 2 aphid species was investigated based on bacterial honeydew semiochemicals emissions using a two-way olfactometer. Both the mutualistic aphid Aphis fabae L. and the nonmyrmecophilous aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris were found to be attractive for the ant Lasius niger L. The level of attraction was similar in both assays (control vs. one of the aphid species). However, when given a choice between these 2 aphid species, ants showed a significant preference for Aphis fabae. Honeydew volatiles, mostly from bacterial origins, are known to be a key element in ant attraction. Using the same olfactometry protocol, the relative attractiveness of volatiles emitted by honeydews collected from each aphid species and by bacteria isolated from each honeydew was investigated. Again, ants significantly preferred volatiles released by Aphis fabae honeydew and bacteria. This information suggests that microbial honeydew volatiles enable ants to distantly discriminate aphid species. These results strengthen the interest of studying the occurrence and potential impact of microorganisms in insect symbioses. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|For centuries, the Ganges River in India {{has been}} the locus of sacred rites for the Hindus. The {{religious}} significance of the Ganges is physically manifested in ghats (stepped landings) that form the land-water interface. Besides serving as a site for religious bathing and cremation, the ghats are also tied to people’s livelihoods and are an inseparable part of their daily lives. Today, the increasingly urbanized Ganges basin sustains more than 40 percent of India’s population. At the same time, industrialization and the pressures of a growing population along its banks have contributed to alarming levels of pollution in the river. In 1985, the federal government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan (GAP) with the <b>primary</b> objective of <b>cleaning</b> the river. However, characterized by centralized planning and control with little public participation, the GAP had limited impact. In 2011, the government launched yet another clean up program—the National Ganga River Basin Project—with support from the World Bank.

Can public participation fit into the technocratic model that is often adopted by environmental programs? What approaches to participation kindle authorship and empowerment among those who share a deep relationship with the river and the ghats? Can religious practices be accommodated within scientific frameworks of adaptive management and resilience?

40|$|Membrane {{filtration}} process {{offers an}} innovative and precise separation technique for wastewater treatment. However, the membranes are easily to be fouled {{on the surface}} by retentate when the filtration system operates for a long period. One of the critical issues {{in the development of}} effective processes is the decline in system performance due to fouling, which limits the economic efficiency of the processing operation. In this research, ultrasound was employed to mitigate and clean a sludge fouled hollow fiber membrane. Specifically, the mechanisms of ultrasound cleaning, temperature effects, ultrasound power effects, ultrasound frequency effects and fouling cake layer effects on ultrasound cleaning were evaluated. ^ In initial studies, cavitation as the <b>primary</b> ultrasound <b>cleaning</b> mechanism was examined by Particle Dynamics Analysis (PDA) laser system. Results reveal that the increase of ultrasound frequency result in smaller cavitation bubble size, higher bubble travel speed and lower bubble density. They are considered to be important in detaching fouling from membrane surface. Subsequently, a hollow fiber membrane system was set up with pumping DI water as feed solution in order to obtain better understanding of membrane characteristics. Results indicate that the increase of transmembrane pressure and feed solution temperatures have significant impact on improving permeate flux. Conversely, the rise of ambient temperature around membrane shows minor effects on permeate flux even though the presence of ultrasonic transducer release an amount of heat into water in which a membrane cartridge was submerged. The primary experiments effectively lay the foundation for later researches. ^ In further studies, ultrafiltration (UF) membrane were fouled by sludge solution in hollow fiber module and subsequently subjected to continuous ultrasound in a water tank at different frequencies, power intensities and duration of treatment. Results indicate that increased power intensity and lower frequency are able to effectively enhance permeate flux. Lower frequency contributes to remove both tightly and loosely bound solids from fouled membrane. However, permeate turbidity test and SEM images suggest that higher ultrasound power and lower frequency have the potential to cause membrane damages. Hence, a gentle method is required for wastewater treatment in an ultrasound-membrane system. ^ Finally, continuous ultrasound was utilized to clean sludge fouled membrane in an offline membrane filtration system. Namely, ultrasound was instead of traditional methods, such as chemical cleaning and back flushing, to clean fouled membrane. Results indicate a better cleaning performance that ultrasound can perfectly restore the original membrane flux at different frequencies. ^ The results of this research elucidate the cavitation bubbles, temperature, ultrasound frequency and ultrasound power influencing ultrasonic cleaning of sludge fouled membrane. A new laboratory-scale hollow fiber membrane filtration system based on ultrasound was developed for entire experiments, suggesting that utilization of this technology will lead to improved membrane performance. ...|$|R

PurposeThe {{purpose of this study was}} to provide data on recommendations that DHCPs make to patients for denture cleaning and on the cleaning regimens of denture wearers. Material and methodsDHCPs (n= 613), including dentists and hygienists, were surveyed in developed (Japan, USA, Italy) and developing (Brazil, India) countries. A questionnaire assessing a range of denture cleaning recommendations was used. The questions addressed products, frequency, how to use remedies, the suggested dilution and duration of cleansing treatment, the location of dentures while cleaning, and the reasoning behind the recommendation of particular products or modes of treatment. Denture cleansing methods and the routine of denture wearers in developed and developing countries were also surveyed with a questionnaire (n= 2862) and a 1 -week diary (n= 1462). ResultsAn average of more than 2 treatments was recommended by DHCPs. Specialist denture cleanser tablets, “regular” toothpaste, mouthwash, soap and water, denture paste, foam or liquid denture cleanser, and dishwashing detergents were most commonly recommended; other product recommendations included baking soda, vinegar, salt water, and bleach.
