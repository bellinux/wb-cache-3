25|$|<b>Polycarbonate</b> film <b>capacitors</b> are {{no longer}} {{manufactured}} because the dielectric material in no longer available.|$|R
50|$|Polycarbonate {{is mainly}} used for {{electronic}} applications that capitalize on its collective safety features. Being a good electrical insulator and having heat-resistant and flame-retardant properties, {{it is used}} in various products associated with electrical and telecommunications hardware. It can {{also serve as a}} dielectric in high-stability capacitors. However, commercial manufacture of <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>capacitors</b> mostly stopped after sole manufacturer Bayer AG stopped making capacitor-grade polycarbonate film at the end of year 2000.|$|R
40|$|The premission {{failure of}} a Voyager {{spacecraft}} capacitor has prompted {{an investigation into the}} use of <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>capacitors</b> in high impedance circuits, during which capacitor failures were induced by thermal cycling together with extended periods at high temperature. Measurement of leakage path temperature coefficients indicates that there are two distinct leakage types whose mechanisms are complicated by movement within the capacitor during temperature changes. A novel system for pulse detection during capacitor burn-in and ramp testing has proven to be beneficial...|$|R
25|$|<b>Polycarbonate</b> film <b>{{capacitors}}</b> are film capacitors with a dielectric {{made of the}} polymerized esters of {{carbonic acid}} and dihydric alcohols polycarbonate (PC), sometimes given the trademarked name Makrofol. They are manufactured as wound metallized as well as film/foil types.|$|R
25|$|Polyphenylene sulfide film {{capacitors}} are well-suited {{for applications}} in frequency-determining circuits and for high-temperature applications. Because of their good electrical properties, PPS film capacitors are an ideal replacement for <b>polycarbonate</b> film <b>capacitors,</b> whose production since 2000 {{has been largely}} discontinued.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there are}} exceptions. The {{manufacturer}} Electronic Concepts Inc, (New Jersey, US) {{claims to be}} an in-house producer of its own polycarbonate film, and continues to produce PC film capacitors. In addition to this manufacturer of <b>polycarbonate</b> film <b>capacitors,</b> there are other mostly US-based specialty manufacturers.|$|R
25|$|These {{capacitors}} {{have a low}} {{dissipation factor}} and because of their relatively temperature-independent electrical properties of about Â±80nbsp&ppm over the entire temperature range, they had many applications for low-loss and temperature-stable applications such as timing circuits, precision analog circuits, and signal filters in applications with tough environmental conditions. PC film capacitors had been manufactured since the mid-1950s, but the main supplier of <b>polycarbonate</b> film for <b>capacitors</b> had ceased the production of this polymer in film form as of the year 2000. As a result, most of the manufacturers of <b>polycarbonate</b> film <b>capacitors</b> worldwide had to stop their production of PC film capacitors and changed to polypropylene film capacitors instead. Most of the former PC capacitor applications have found satisfactory substitutes with PP film capacitors.|$|R
40|$|Changes {{were studied}} which enable <b>polycarbonate</b> metallized film <b>capacitors</b> to {{withstand}} 500 thermal shock cycles while maintaining electrical characteristic integrity without becoming intermittent, and without losing hermeticity. The task was for metallized <b>polycarbonate</b> film <b>capacitors</b> {{designed to meet}} MIL-C- 39022 / 9 and MIL-C- 83421 / 1. The capacitor design improvements implemented were the insertion of a rubber washer between spray cap and end seal and the utilization of a flexible lead assembly. One hundred fifty capacitors incorporating the design improvements were manufactured and subsequently underwent 500 thermal shock cycles. One hundred forty nine capacitors survived the test. Failure analysis revealed that the lone failure was due to a poor solder joint, initially detected in pre-screening tests as having poor dissipation factor and equivalent series resistance measurement readings...|$|R
40|$|The {{alignment}} of the stable electrical characteristics of film capacitors in the physical dimensions of ceramic and tantalum capacitors are discussed. The reliability of <b>polycarbonate</b> and mylar <b>capacitors</b> are described {{with respect to their}} compatibility with military specifications. Graphic illustrations are presented which show electrical and physical comparisons of film, ceramic, and tantalum capacitors. The major focus is on volumetric efficiency, weight reduction, and electrical stability...|$|R
25|$|But the {{manufacture}} of film capacitors does have a critical dependency on the materials supply chain. Each of the plastic film materials used for film capacitors worldwide is produced by {{only two or three}} large suppliers. The {{reason for this is that}} the mass quantities required by the market for film caps are quite small compared to typical chemical company production runs. This leads to a great dependency of the capacitor manufacturers on relatively few chemical companies as raw material suppliers. For example, in the year 2000 Bayer AG stopped their production of polycarbonate films, due to unprofitably low sales volumes. Most of the producers of <b>polycarbonate</b> film <b>capacitors</b> had to quickly change their product offerings to another type of capacitor, and a lot of expensive testing approvals for new designs were required.|$|R
40|$|The Pulsed Plasma {{thruster}} is {{the simplest}} of all electric propulsion devices. It is a pulsed device which stores energy in capacitors for each pulse. The lifetimes and energy densities of these capacitors are critical parameters to the continued use of these thrusters. This report presents {{the result of a}} research effort conducted by JPL into the materials used in capacitors and the modes of failure. The dominant failure mechanism was determined to be material breakdown precipitated by heat build-up within the capacitors. The presence of unwanted gas was identified as the source of the heat. An aging phenomena was discovered in <b>polycarbonate</b> based <b>capacitors.</b> CO build-up was noted to increase with the number of times the capacitor had been discharged. Improved quality control was cited as being essential for the improvement of capacitor lifetimes...|$|R
25|$|As of 2012, {{only five}} plastic {{materials}} {{continued to be}} widely used in the capacitor industry as films for capacitors: PET, PEN, PP, PPS and PTFE. Other plastic materials {{are no longer in}} common use, either because they are no longer manufactured, or they have been replaced with better materials. Even the long-time manufactured polystyrene (PS) and <b>polycarbonate</b> (PC) film <b>capacitors</b> have been largely replaced by the previously-mentioned film types, though at least one PC capacitor manufacturer retains the ability to make its own films from raw polycarbonate feedstock. The less-common plastic films are described briefly here, since they are still encountered in older designs, and are still available from some suppliers.|$|R
