40|$|Street {{lighting}} {{is an essential}} feature of pedestrian paths that may {{increase the amount of}} walking. This study aimed to identify associations between <b>perceived</b> <b>lighting</b> qualities, and experience of the lit environment and performance of critical tasks. In a full-scale laboratory 89 participants walked along a pedestrian path with three different outdoor lighting applications (CDM and LEDs). After each walk they rated the <b>perceived</b> <b>lighting</b> qualities, <b>perceived</b> visibility and affective experience of walking in the lit environment. Walking speed was measured and obstacle detection, sign-reading and facial recognition were tested. Multiple regression analyses suggest that photometric measures are required to guarantee that pedestrians’ can orientate and safely move after dark. <b>Perceived</b> <b>lighting</b> qualities may however account for individual differences in the assessment of one and the same lighting application with regard to perceived visibility and the affective experience of walking in the lit environment and may thereby affect walking...|$|R

It would appear that achieving a perfectly concealed (100%) hole, where an object could be placed and hidden from view, is not probable. The problem is the following: in order to carry images, light propagates in a continuous range of directions. The scattering data of electromagnetic waves, after bouncing off an object or hole, is unique compared to light propagating through empty space, and is therefore easily <b>perceived.</b> <b>Light</b> propagating through empty space is consistent only with empty space.

With Fred Archer, he pioneered the Zone System, a {{technique}} for translating <b>perceived</b> <b>light</b> into specific densities on negatives and paper, giving photographers better control over finished photographs. Adams also advocated {{the idea of}} visualization (which he often called [...] "previsualization", though he later acknowledged that term to be a redundancy) whereby the final image is [...] "seen" [...] in the mind's eye before the photo is taken, toward the goal of achieving all together the aesthetic, intellectual, spiritual, and mechanical effects desired. He taught these and other techniques to thousands of amateur photographers through his publications and his workshops. His many books about photography, including the Morgan & Morgan Basic Photo Series (The Camera, The Negative, The Print, Natural Light Photography, and Artificial Light Photography) have become classics in the field.|$|E
5000|$|The autokinetic effect (also {{referred}} to as autokinesis) is a phenomenon of visual perception in which a stationary, small point of light in an otherwise dark or featureless environment appears to move. It was first recorded by a Russian officer keeping watch, who observed illusory movement of a star near the horizon [...] It is presumed to occur because motion perception is always relative to some reference point, and in darkness or in a featureless environment there is no reference point, so {{the position of the}} single point is undefined. The direction of the movements {{does not appear to be}} correlated with involuntary eye movements, but may be determined by errors between eye position and that specified by efference copy of the movement signals sent to the extraocular muscles. Several researchers, including Richard Gregory, have shown that autokinesis occurs when no eye movements are recorded. Gregory has suggested that, with lack of peripheral information, eye movements which correct movements due to muscle fatigue are wrongly interpreted in the brain as movement of the <b>perceived</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1903, Blondlot {{announced}} his discovery {{while working at}} the University of Nancy and attempting to polarize X-rays. He had perceived changes in the brightness of an electric spark in a spark gap placed in an X-ray beam which he photographed, and he later attributed to the novel form of radiation, naming this the N rays for the University of Nancy. Blondlot, Augustin Charpentier, Arsène d'Arsonval and approximately 120 other scientists in 300 published articles claimed {{to be able to}} detect N rays emanating from most substances, including the human body with the peculiar exceptions that they were not emitted by green wood and by some treated metals. Most researchers of the subject at the time used the <b>perceived</b> <b>light</b> of a dim phosphorescent surface as [...] "detectors", although work in the period clearly showed the change in brightness to be a physiological phenomenon rather than some actual change in the level of illumination. Physicists Gustave le Bon and P. Audollet and spiritualist Carl Huter even claimed the discovery as their own, leading to a commission of the Académie des sciences to decide priority.|$|E

Furthermore, Malacosteus is unique amongst animals in using a chlorophyll derivative to <b>perceive</b> red <b>light.</b> The name Malacosteus {{is derived from the}} Greek malakos meaning [...] "soft" [...] and osteon meaning [...] "bone".

In this paper, we propose a comparison between different lightness definitions applied to lighting measurements acquired by Imaging Luminance Measurement Device (ILMD) on paintings illuminated by daylight, in order to setup a more comprehensive system to evaluate the effective quality of the illumination of museums and art galleries. We actually considered some well-known lightness definitions working on the global image, but we want to investigate local adaptation algorithms...|$|E

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined A {{shift towards}} more {{energy-efficient}} light sources for outdoor lighting such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is underway. Photometric measures {{are not sufficient}} to capture how users experience the light, so complementary tools are required. This study aimed to develop an observer-based environmental assessment tool, based on bipolar semantic differentials, for outdoor lighting in urban spaces. Exploratory (N = 130) and confirmatory (N = 117) factor analyses of observations of lighting installations made by laypersons on-site along pedestrian paths, resulted in two dimensions of high reliability: the Perceived Strength Quality (PSQ, Cronbach's alpha = 0. 82 – 0. 85) and the Perceived Comfort Quality (PCQ, Cronbach's alpha = 0. 77 – 0. 81). PSQ and PCQ differentiated between light sources of different illuminance level, colour temperature and colour rendering. Regression analyses showed that the <b>perceived</b> <b>lighting</b> qualities helped to explain the variance in visual accessibility, whereas PCQ helped to explain perceived danger in the environment. The <b>perceived</b> <b>lighting</b> qualities can add {{to the understanding of}} pedestrians' perception of outdoor lighting, and is proposed as a complementary tool for development of sustainable light designs in the urban environmen...|$|R
40|$|Flowering {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} steps in a plant life cycle. Plants utilize light as an informational source to determine the timing of flowering. In Arabidopsis, phytochrome A (phyA), phyB and cryptochrome 2 (cry 2) are major photoreceptors that regulate flowering. These photoreceptors <b>perceive</b> <b>light</b> stimuli by leaves for the regulation of flowering. A leaf is an organ consisting of different tissues such as epidermis, mesophyll and vascular bundles. In the present study, we examined in which tissue the <b>light</b> signals are <b>perceived</b> and how those signals are integrated within a leaf to regulate flowering. For this purpose, we established transgenic Arabidopsis lines that expressed a phyB-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein or a cry 2 -GFP fusion protein in organ/tissue-specific manners. Consequently, phyB was shown to <b>perceive</b> <b>light</b> stimuli in mesophyll. By contrast, cry 2 functioned only in vascular bundles. We further confirmed that both phyB-GFP and cry 2 -GFP regulated flowering by altering the expression of a key flowering gene, FT, in vascular bundles. In summary, perception sites for different spectra of light are spatially separated within a leaf and the signals are integrated through the inter-tissue communication...|$|R
40|$|The use of Light Emitting Diodes (LED) as a {{main source}} of {{illumination}} can help in significantly reducing global energy conspumtions. The LED is well suited for modulating visible light, enabling a wireless communication channel. A popular topic in Visible Light Communication (VLC) research is to push data throughput past the LED bandwidth limitation of around 4 - 5 MHz. Less {{attention has been given}} to systems using cheaper and slower components. This thesis focuses on effectively utilizing the available bandwidth in low cost dimmable VLC systems, to allow for increased data throughput, where the system bandwidth is limited by the receiver. Non- ickering constant <b>perceived</b> <b>light</b> intensity must furthermore be maintained under variable dimming conditions, to ensure positive user experience. A novel modulation scheme for VLC systems with dimming support is pro- posed. Adaptive Rectified Pulse-Width Modulation (ARPWM) modulates the light source with fine-grained pulses within a defined symbol period. The symbols are demodulated as light intensity levels. This allows for sending multiple bits per symbol {{in a manner similar to}} Pulse Amplitude Modula- tion (PAM). Upper and lower boundaries are applied to the duty cycle of the pulses according to the desired dimming level, reducing the number of light compensation symbols needed to maintain a constant <b>perceived</b> <b>light</b> intensity for the user. ARPWM is compared to existing modulation schemes, and a throughput increase by a factor of 4. 3 was observed compared to state-of-the-art Vari- able On-Off Keying (VOOK). With the testbed used for the experiments we have demonstrated the use of ARPWM in an indoor office environment, with a maximum communication distance of 4. 2 meters in a low-noise en- vironment. ARPWM is shown to offer valuable increase in data troughput at a low complexity level. The relatively high SNR requirements of ARPWM make it best suitable for short-range indoor VLC.

40|$|Biologically-inspired {{event-driven}} silicon retinas, {{so called}} dynamic vision sensors (DVS), allow efficient solutions for various visual perception tasks, e. g. surveillance, tracking, or motion detection [1]. Similar to retinal photoreceptors, any <b>perceived</b> <b>light</b> intensity {{change in the}} DVS generates an event at the corresponding pixel. The DVS thereby emits a stream of spatiotemporal events (spikes) to encode visually perceived dynamic features that in contrast to conventional frame-based cameras, is largely free of redundant background information. The DVS offers multiple additional advantages, but requires the development of radically new asynchronous, event-based information processing algorithms. Particularly a reliable event-driven stereo-matching algorithm still remains as a big challenge in the field. At this project {{we would like to}} implement, evaluate and possibly modify an event-driven stereo matching algorithm using feature matching [2]. We would like to implement the algorithm possibly in a parallel computing platform e. g. GPU and investigate the performance of the algorithm in the real-time applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{lighting}} and furnishing of an interior space (i. e., the reflectance of its materials, the geometries of the furnishings, and their arrangement) determine {{the appearance of}} this space. Conversely, human observers infer lighting properties from the space's appearance. We conducted two psychophysical experiments to investigate how {{the perception of the}} light direction is influenced by a scene's objects and their layout using real scenes. In the first experiment, we confirmed that the shape of the objects in the scene and the scene layout influence the <b>perceived</b> <b>light</b> direction. In the second experiment, we systematically investigated how specific shape properties influenced the estimation of the light direction. The results showed that increasing the number of visible faces of an object, ultimately using globally spherical shapes in the scene, supported the veridicality of the estimated light direction. Furthermore, symmetric arrangements in the scene improved the estimation of the tilt direction. Thus, human perception of light should integrally consider materials, scene content, and layout. </p...|$|E
40|$|When a {{light spot}} is flashed {{repeatedly}} during sac-cade, a dotted line called a phantom array (PA) is perceived. When light spots {{are placed on}} a vertical line and the flashing pattern is changed quickly during saccade, the flashing pattern is expanded to a spatial pattern by the effect of eye movement, and a two-dimensional image is per-ceived. The authors have proposed a visual information presentation method based on this phenomenon. A crucial issue in information presentation by this method is the time relation between the perceived PA and the eye movement. Consequently, this study examines the time relation be-tween the perception and the eye movement. The time course of perceived position for repeatedly flashing stimu-lus is investigated by presenting light spots in the vertical position. It is found that the locus of the <b>perceived</b> <b>light</b> spot starts to curve {{at the start of}} saccade in the direction oppo-site to the saccade, and returns to the vertical direction when the saccade ends. It differs from the locus of the light spot which is expected in accordance with cancellation theory...|$|E
40|$|Whereas the 17 th century painter Canaletto was {{a master}} in linear {{perspective}} of the architectural elements, {{he seems to have}} had considerable difficulty with linear perspective of shadows. A common trick to avoid shadow perspective problems is to set the (solar) illumination direction parallel to the projection screen. We investigated in one painting where Canaletto clearly used this trick, whether he followed this light direction choice consistently through in how he shades the persons. We approached this question with a perceptual experiment where we measured <b>perceived</b> <b>light</b> directions in isolated details of the paintings. Specifically, we controlled whether observers could only see the (cast) shadow, only shading or both. We found different trends in all three conditions. The results indicate that Canaletto probably used different shading than the parallel light direction would predict. We interpret the results as a form or artistic freedom that Canaletto used to shade the persons individually. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
