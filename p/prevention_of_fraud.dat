2500|$|In {{spite of}} the all of the criticisms, the committee's {{investigation}} did lead to new legislation in 1862 for the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraud.</b> Congress enacted legislation requiring that the Secretaries of the Navy, Interior, and War should put every contract made by them, or by officers appointed it, in writing and should have them signed {{with the names of}} the contractors, and also to file a copy in a [...] "Returns Office" [...] of Department of the Interior within 30 days. The officers making such contracts were to swear to them, and penalties were prescribed for violations of the law.

60|$|Again, {{trade is}} a social act. Whoever {{undertakes}} to sell any description of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society: accordingly, it was once held to be the duty of governments, in all cases which were considered of importance, to fix prices, and regulate the processes of manufacture. But it is now recognised, though not till after a long struggle, that both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, quâ restraint, is an evil: but the restraints in question affect only that part of conduct which society is competent to restrain, and are wrong solely {{because they do not}} really produce the results which it is desired to produce by them. As the principle of individual liberty is not involved in the doctrine of Free Trade, so neither is it in most of the questions which arise respecting the limits of that doctrine: as for example, what amount of public control is admissible for the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> by adulteration; how far sanitary precautions, or arrangements to protect work-people employed in dangerous occupations, should be enforced on employers. Such questions involve considerations of liberty, only in so far as leaving people to themselves is always better, cæteris paribus, than controlling them: but that they may be legitimately controlled for these ends, is in principle undeniable. On the other hand, there are questions relating to interference with trade, which are essentially questions of liberty; such as the Maine Law, already touched upon; the prohibition of the importation of opium into China; the restriction of the sale of poisons; all cases, in short, where the object of the interference is to make it impossible or difficult to obtain a particular commodity. These interferences are objectionable, not as infringements on the liberty of the producer or seller, but on that of the buyer.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{financial}} scandals {{have demonstrated}} that the risk <b>of</b> accounting <b>fraud</b> may be vague in any type of economic system. In this context, transparency of information, indispensable element for competitiveness in the market is an efficient operation of systems of corporate governance and especially of control systems. All these must be appropriate in the legislation in terms of external information. The issue of governance will thus {{be seen as a}} fundamental pillar against pressures which induce at the fraud as a result of lack of transparency of information flows. In all models of corporate governance, external regulations cover a primary role in ensuring the effectiveness of controls, but remain central the responsibility of entities to adopt a virtuous mechanism as an internal control profile. An example in this sense of "best practice" may be represented by the multinational companies that have known to harmonize the national rules with the typical instruments of other models of governance. The authors have established that the main objective in this work is the evaluation model of governance already existing in a group of companies in accordance with the principles of corporate governance. In {{the first part of the}} work it was made a comparitive analysis between the models of corporate governance, focusing on the role of transparency of communication, the primary tool in <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>frauds,</b> the link between information and <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>frauds</b> being independent <b>of</b> the model of corporate governance adopted, by the structure of organization and the control mechanisms. The work continued throughout the first part, with the role of internal audit in preventing the accounting fraud, given that any type of government, regardless of how it is configured and the reference market in which we find, to be considered efficiently must provide an appropriate control mechanisms, able to intervene in critical situations and to protect the interests of all categories of users. The role of internal audit of the company, considering the influences of the control of management, assumes a first importance in the corporate governance sphere. This was also the reason why the authors have proposed in the second part of the paper to build a model of optimal risk management in listed and unlisted companies, and based on a model of optimal corporate governance at the level at groups of enterprises, focusing on the fundamental role of the audit...|$|R
