40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the agro {{forestry}} environmental education program, which has been currently in operation since 1996 and managed by the Superior Institute of Agronomy, Lisbon. Tapada of Ajuda belongs to the Superior Institute of Agronomy and was once a country residence of the Portuguese Royal Family. Along with this fine historical country house the grounds consists of a mixture of agricultural land and associated woodland, providing good environmental educational opportunities. Among the 14 areas studied, 4 are exclusively concerned with the forestry issue from different aspects. “Tree and Paper”, thematic campaign included in the project Rural World and Nature Conservation, (the paper market, <b>productive</b> <b>woodland</b> v protected woodland, biodiversity, and influence of forestry management on nature conservation). “Water and Woodland: a sensory experience” aimed at blind and partially sighted individuals who explore their environment. “Woodland and Fire” based on forest fires, their causes, fire ecology and minimising actions. “Desertification” the importance of forestry on soil conservatio...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{selection}} of the Western Yellow Robin (Eopsaltria griseogularis) was examined during the 2001 breeding season at 52 sites throughout Dryandra Woodland, Western Australia. Western Yellow Robins occupied sites according to habitat attributes at various spatial scales. At a microhabitat scale, Western Yellow Robins occupied sites with a high canopy density, and a higher density of leaf litter and logs than in unoccupied sites. These factors could indicate occupation of sites with lower ground surface temperatures and more leaf litter habitat, favouring a higher abundance of leaf litter prey and prey associated with logs compared with more open sites with a low canopy density and low log density. At a macrohabitat scale, occupied sites were characterised as those sites with high proportions of Wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) trees and Gastrolobium shrubs, plants associated with more productive downslope woodland soils. At the landscape scale, Western Yellow Robins occupied sites away from the woodland/agricultural ecotone, indicating sensitivity to edge effects and an inherent area-sensitivity. Persistence of the Western Yellow Robin in the wheatbelt requires the retention of large remnants of <b>productive</b> <b>woodland.</b> In addition, the exclusion of stock grazing in these large remnants would ensure the protection of ground substrate, an important component governing habitat selection by the species.

50|$|In 1988 the Ministry of Environmental Protection was {{responsible}} for implementing forest policy and management. Ministry officials warned {{that the loss of}} <b>productive</b> <b>woodlands</b> would eventually lead to land erosion, environmental degradation, energy shortages, food shortages, and rural poverty in general, and they hoped to change traditional attitudes toward forests and other natural resources.|$|R
40|$|At Dryandra in Western Australia, Yellow-plumed Honeyeaters {{preferred}} the more <b>productive</b> <b>woodlands</b> dominated by Wandoo, Eucalyptus wandoo, {{to those on}} poorer soils dominated by Powderbark Wandoo, E. accedens. They foraged mainly by gleaning and probing foliage and bark within the canopy of the largest trees. Insects were also taken by hawking, hovering, and snatching, but there were significant spatial and seasonal differences {{in the use of}} foraging substrates. Little nectar-feeding was recorded, but lerp, manna, and honeydew obtained from foliage and under bark were likely energy sources. Although the minimum area of habitat required for the conservation of Yellow-plumed Honeyeaters cannot be specified, it probably needs to be large, productive, little disturbed, and with mature eucalypts to ensure a diversity of foraging substrates. Access to a source of nectar for {{at least part of the}} year may also be necessary...|$|R
30|$|Much {{variability}} {{was evident}} among PFRs, with mean FRIs ranging from 11 yr to 610 yr, and median FRIs ranging from 7 yr to 610 yr; mean minimum FRIs ranged from 5 yr to 190 yr, and mean maximum FRIs ranged from 40 yr to 1440 yr. There was also high variability within many PFRs, {{and differences between}} minimum and maximum FRIs ranged from 32 yr to 1324 yr. Generally, median FRIs were lowest for productive drier forests such as yellow pine, dry and moist mixed conifer, and oak woodland (7 yr, 9 yr, 12 yr, and 12 yr, respectively). Median FRIs were highest for less <b>productive</b> <b>woodlands</b> such as pinyon-juniper (94 yr), high elevation types such as subalpine forest (132 yr), very dry types such as desert mixed shrub (610 yr), and productive moist forests such as spruce-hemlock (275 yr mean FRI). Our summary of California’s presettlement fire regimes should be a useful reference for scientists and resource managers, whether they are seeking a general estimate of the central tendency and variability of FRIs in a broadly defined vegetation type, background information for a planned restoration project or a mechanistic model of vegetation-fire interactions, or a list of literature pertaining to a specific vegetation type or geographic location.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{in detail}} the methods being employed to restore productivity quickly and economically to 1, 200 acres of privately owned woodlands, mostly hardwoods, from which all timber 12 inches quarter girth and over had been removed during the war. ' I 'HE recent census (3) {{carried out by the}} Forestry Commission shows that over J- 40 per cent, of the privately owned woodland in Great Britain is either cleared, derelict, or devastated. It is in the devastated woodland that the forester finds his biggest problem, i. e. how to convert acres of smashed and damaged material into <b>productive</b> <b>woodland</b> at least cost and with least loss of time (1, 2). For cost and time are both of vital importance to the private owner of woodland. There will be no need to elaborate the cost theme. As to loss of time, no owner in these days will be prepared to wait longer than he need for his woods to become productive once more, even if the Forestry Commission did not have power to remind him of his duty in this respect. The following is an account of the methods adopted at Cirencester Park, the Cotswold seat of Earl Bathurst, to whom the writer is indebted for permission to publish this paper...|$|E
40|$|In {{northern}} England {{and southern}} Scotland 240, 000 hectares or {{two-thirds of the}} <b>productive</b> <b>woodland</b> area are spruce, mainly Sitka spruce. A continuing theme for the Border Group has been the relation between {{quality and quantity of}} timber production in spruce, particularly Sitka spruce. It is gener-ally accepted that the aim for Sitka spruce should be to produce a good general purpose timber. The most recent meeting discussed the results of a sawmill conversion of logs from Sitka spruce stands grown under different silvicultural regimes. Sitka spruce is intrinsically one of the lighter and weaker timbers and, to ensure that at least 80 per cent of the sawn timber is suitable for structural grades, crops should be grown within current standard silvicultural regimes with particular attention paid to the moulding of the first 6 to 8 metres of the stem which provides more than half the sawn timber. The trees should be light-branched and have the highest possible timber density. Attention must be given from planting to the thicket stage and through to final felling to the production of crops grown uniformly within their yield classes. In the higher yield classes pruning up to 5 metres may be necessary on final crop trees to maintain the strength and grade of timber rather than to provide 'clears'. More information is required on the log sizes required for maximum sawmill recovery of chosen end products. A regional sales grading system of sawlogs should be introduced...|$|E
40|$|Using the proton {{transfer}} reaction {{mass spectrometry}} (PTR-MS) technique, isoprene and its oxidation products were measured in a <b>productive</b> <b>woodland</b> savanna (Calabozo site, during the {{wet and dry}} seasons) and a less productive grassland savanna (La Gran Sabana, Parupa site). The measured protonated masses in the PTR-MS, postulated compounds, and daytime average volume mixing ratios at the Calabozo site during the wet season are: 69 isoprene (1. 62 nmol/mol), 71 methyl vinyl ketone + methacrolein (0. 98 nmol/mol), 83 3 -methyl furan + unsaturated C- 5 -hydroxycarbonyls (0. 12 nmol/mol), and 101 isoprene hydroperoxides (0. 16 nmol/mol). Significant diurnal cycles of the hydrocarbon concentrations were observed, with distinct characteristics between sites and seasons. Two times lower levels of isoprene were observed during the dry season. At the Parupa site measured concentrations of all masses were about three times lower than at the Calabozo site during the wet season, and significant transport of isoprene from upwind forests was observed. Comparison with a photochemical box model revealed that surface deposition is likely a significant sink for isoprene and its oxidation products. An isoprene source of 2. 1 - 3. 2 x 10 (6) molec/cm(3) /s and an HO concentration of 4. 1 - 6. 0 x 10 (5) molec/cm(3) averaged over 24 hours were needed to match the observed mixing ratios. Assuming a mixed boundary layer of 1500 m and an isoprene source half the strength during the 5 months dry season, a global emission of isoprene to the atmosphere from tropical savannas between 53 and 79 Tg C/yr can be calculated from our results if the Calabozo site is representative...|$|E

50|$|The term {{continuous}} cover forestry {{has been}} widely adopted in British forestry practice following {{the creation of the}} Continuous Cover Forestry Group in 1991. Currently the UK Forestry Standard and the guidelines of the silvicultural-systems UK Woodland Assurance Standard call for wider use and application of CCF in British forestry, as there is evidence that continuously <b>productive</b> irregular structured <b>woodlands</b> are more robust and resilient in response to climate change, and forest health threats in addition {{to a wide range of}} other social and environmental benefits. However, there remains some lack of understanding of the definition and practice of CCF among forestry professionals in Britain, and Ireland.|$|R
40|$|Dry {{rainforest}} occurs {{throughout the}} wet-dry tropics as isolated patches in {{a matrix of}} savanna woodland. Dry rainforests may provide important stepping stones for migrating forest birds, resources for woodland birds, and a significant component of bird diversity in arid inland landscapes. Dry rainforest patches may provide both refuge from harsh environmental conditions and pulses of valuable resources not available in the less <b>productive</b> eucalypt <b>woodland.</b> We investigated patterns of bird community composition and resource use in dry rainforest patches and adjacent eucalypt woodland in north Queensland. A preliminary aim was to describe the dry rainforest bird community and to then to assess the role of dry rainforest in the landscape, particularly to woodland birds. Dry rainforest patches {{were found to have}} a distinctive bird community that rarely utilised resources in the surrounding eucalypt woodland. Thirteen bird species were characteristic of dry rainforest. Six of these were only ever recorded in dry rainforest. Woodland birds foraged in the dry rainforest, particularly during sporadic fruiting events. Bird density and species richness was higher in woodlands than dry rainforest. Dry rainforest has a naturally patchy distribution and constitutes only 7...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of competitive and facilitative interactions in plant communities {{is expected to}} change along resource gradients. Contrasting theoretical models predict that with increasing abiotic stress, facilitative effects are higher, lower, or similar than those found under more productive conditions. While these predictions have been tested in stressful environments such as arid and alpine ecosystems, they have hardly been tested for more <b>productive</b> African <b>woodlands.</b> We experimentally assessed the {{strength of}} tree seedling facilitation by nurse trees in mesic and dry woodlands in Benin, West Africa. We planted seedlings of the drought-sensitive Afzelia africana and the drought-tolerant Khaya senegalensis under three microsite conditions (closed woodland, woodland gap, and open fields). Seedling survival was greater within woodlands compared with open fields in both the mesic and dry woodlands. The relative benefits in seedling survival were larger at the dry site, especially for the drought-sensitive species. Nevertheless, plant interactions became neutral or negative {{during the dry season}} in the drier woodland, indicating that the net positive effects may be lost under very stressful abiotic conditions. We conclude that facilitation also occurs in the relatively more productive conditions of African woodlands. Our results underscore the role of environmental variation in space and time, and the stress tolerance of species, in explaining competitive and facilitative interactions within plant communitie...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze the {{transformation}} of forest landscape in the Atlantic Basque Country and the complex factors and actors who participated in that process during Francoism (1939 - 1975). With a high predominance of private property, reforestation was largely a private initiative. Although the sources consulted come mainly from different public administrations involved in woodlands management, the preponderance of the particular owner has allowed us to analyse circumstances and mechanisms often ignored when dealing exclusively with public forest and its man-agreement. The intensive reforestation, the introduction of new species, a new institutional framework, and changes in the <b>productive</b> orientation of <b>woodlands,</b> within a context of strong industrial growth and rural decline, have changed dramatically both, the landscape and the environment, as well as the character of the industry and forest uses...|$|R
40|$|The {{intent of}} Maryland's {{farmland}} preservation policy has remained constant {{over the past}} three decades [...] to preserve <b>productive</b> farmland and <b>woodland</b> for the continued production of food and fiber for all of Maryland's citizens. Therefore, thirty years after this statutory goal was made, how effective have Maryland's farmland preservation programs been in reaching this goal? This study addresses the absence of cultural and social analysis in the evaluation of farmland preservation program success in Maryland's metropolitan counties. In utilizing a socio-cultural framework of analysis, this study shows that farmland preservation policies (in their drafting, implementation, and evaluation) are a cultural process, the outcomes of which create and sustain a particular social space and cultural landscape. Theories on the social production of space and landscape are relevant to the task of farmland preservation and agricultural economic development in metropolitan areas. The failure of farmland preservation policy in Maryland has, in part, been the failure to take culture seriously. Quantitative indicators show that Maryland's state farmland preservation program has achieved moderate success in securing a productive agricultural land base over its first three decades, but has not been successful in preserving farming as a viable "way of life," has not stopped the erosion in the value of agricultural sales, and has not reversed the marketplace alienation between producers and consumers in the state...|$|R
