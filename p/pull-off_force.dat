Current scientific research aims at developing novel strategies to design new antifouling surfaces based on protein repellant polymer surface modifications which tackle {{the initial stages of}} biofouling. In this regard zwitterionic polymer brushes have shown to be environmentally benign and are promising as ultralow fouling marine coatings. Here the molecular basis for antifouling surfaces was further enhanced. The ability of surface grafted zwitterionic pSBMA brushes to resist biofouling was assessed by (a) atomic force microscopy (AFM) adhesion experiments, and (b) laboratory fouling studies using cyprid larvae of Balanus amphitrite. For chemical functionalization of AFM tips, fibronectin was chosen as well as RGD peptide motifs covalently attached to PMAA brushes on gold colloidal probes. Our results demonstrate the efficient suppression of protein adsorption on zwitterionic pSBMA brushes, <b>pull-off</b> <b>forces</b> were only hardly detected in AFM measurements. In contrast, on surfaces reported to be strongly protein adhering significant <b>pull-off</b> <b>forces</b> were detected. These results were in agreement with the laboratory fouling studies correlating protein adherence as assessed by <b>pull-off</b> <b>forces</b> with the tendency of barnacle settlement.

The experimental <b>pull-off</b> <b>force</b> measurement is conducted in a Seville powder tester. Comparison of the predicted results with the experimental results indicates (1) that the <b>pull-off</b> <b>force</b> of sparsely coated cornstarch is larger than that of densely coated cornstarch due to the greater hardness and small particle radius of fumed silica; (2) there is not a continuous variation in the <b>pull-off</b> <b>force</b> with the coverage of silica; on the contrary, values of the <b>pull-off</b> <b>force</b> of sparsely coated samples are grouped in similar range, while the values of the <b>pull-off</b> <b>force</b> of densely coated samples are grouped in another range of lower values. (3) Within a range, the SAC does not have a big effect on the <b>pull-off</b> <b>force</b> for sparsely coated samples and only a slight effect for densely coated samples (4) the <b>pull-off</b> <b>force</b> increases with increasing consolidation force due to larger deformation in the contact area; (5) under consolidation stresses up to 10 KPa, the deformation of the cornstarch particles is not large enough to fully embed the nanosized silica...|$|E

The present experimental study analysed the influence of different material combinations on the long-term development of surface roughness and <b>pull-off</b> <b>forces.</b> Six different material combinations were tested. Secondary crowns were manufactured either by casting or electroforming. Each material combination was tested with n = 10 specimens.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{and removal}} of particles from surfaces is a contemporary problem in many industrial applications like Semiconductor manufacturing, Bioaerosol removal, Pharmaceuticals, Adhesives and Petroleum industry. The {{complexity of the}} problem is due to the variety of factors like roughness, temperature, humidity, fluid medium etc. that affect pull-off of particles from surfaces. In particle removal from surfaces using fluid motion, the dynamic effects of particle separation will play an important role. Thus it is essential to study the dynamic effects of particle removal. Velocity of pull-off and force duration effects are two important dynamic factors that might affect pull-off. Particle adhesion studies can be made using the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The velocity of pull-off and force duration can be varied while making the AFM measurements. The objective of the current work is to obtain the dependence of <b>pull-off</b> <b>force</b> on pull-off velocity. Experiments were conducted using AFM and the data obtained from the experiments is processed to obtain plots for <b>pull-off</b> <b>force</b> vs. particle size and <b>pull-off</b> <b>force</b> vs. pull-off velocity.

Soc., Interface 2008, 5, 383 – 385] proposed to explain the strong underwater adhesion of mushroom-shaped adhesive microstructures (MSAMSs). For this purpose, we measured the <b>pull-off</b> <b>forces</b> of individual MSAMSs by detaching them from a glass substrate under different wetting conditions and simultaneously video recording the detachment behavior at very high temporal resolution (54, 000 – 100, 000 fps). Although microcavitation was observed during the detachment of individual MSAMSs, which was a consequence of water inclusions present at the glass–MSAMS contact interface subjected to negative pressure (tension), the <b>pull-off</b> <b>forces</b> were consistently lower, around 50 %, of those measured under ambient conditions.
