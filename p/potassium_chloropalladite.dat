30|$|PGA (MW 100, 000 – 50, 000  kDa) was {{purchased}} from Yuanye Bio-Technology (Shanghai, China). Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O, >[*] 99.0 %), potassium borohydride (KBH 4, 97 %), <b>potassium</b> <b>chloropalladite</b> (K 2 PdCl 4, 98 %), and p-chlorophenol (p-CP, 99 %) were supplied by Aladdin Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Methanol (CH 3 OH, HPLC grade, 99.9 %) {{was purchased}} from Concord Technology (Tianjin, China). Sodium chloride (NaCl, 99 %), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3, 99.7 %), {{disodium hydrogen phosphate}} (Na 2 HPO 4, 99 %), and sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH 2 PO 4, 99 %) were purchased from Chemregeant (Tianjin, China). Humic acid (HA, technical) was purchased from Heowins (Tianjin, China). All chemicals were used without further purification. All water was purified by a Sartorius arium pro VF water purification system (18.2  MΩ resistivity).|$|E
30|$|The Fe-Pd@PGA NPs were {{synthesized}} using {{a chemical}} reduction method in which potassium borohydride {{served as a}} reduction reagent. Then, 250  mg of FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O was added into 50  mL of PGA solution containing different mass of PGA (10, 25, 50, and 70  mg), resulting in the desired concentrations of Fe 2 + and PGA (wt.%). The mixture was then purged with argon for approximately 20  min to assure the formation of Fe 2 +-PGA complex and to remove dissolved oxygen (DO). Then, 3  mL of KBH 4 (50  mg mL−[*] 1) was injected into the mixture at a BH 4 -to-Fe 2 + molar ratio of 3.0 to form the Fe NPs. To ensure the efficient use of the reductant, the suspension was purged with Argon for 15  min until gas (hydrogen) evolution ceased. Then, Fe nanoparticles were either tested as monometallic particles or loaded with trace amounts (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8  wt.% Pd/Fe) of Pd to yield the PGA-stabilized bimetallic nanoparticles by adding known quantities of <b>potassium</b> <b>chloropalladite</b> aqueous solution into the nanoparticle suspension. In addition, bare Fe-Pd NPs with different degrees of Pd loading were also prepared for comparison. The system was constantly purged with argon during the synthesis and dechlorination reaction. The temperature of the solution was kept at 25  °C by a thermostatic water bath.|$|E
