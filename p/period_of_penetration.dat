40|$|Radiolabeled {{testosterone}} and {{benzyl alcohol}} {{were applied to}} human autopsy skin in vitro perfusion cells. Penetration into the dermal perfusate was measured for 5 days. The half <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> varied greatly with different skin slices; this variation {{was found to be}} related to the dermal thickness of skin specimen. At the conclusion of the experiments, the skin was separated and the amount of material remaining in the epidermis and dermis calculated. With benzyl alcohol, the epidermis retained most of the chemical; however, with testosterone, there was a pronounced residual retention in the dermis. This suggests that the dermis may exhibit a role in the retention and penetration of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 2. 2 million domestic and 1 million wild reindeer in the USSR today. It {{is unlikely that}} the number of domestic reindeer will increase further but there is a tendency for further growth in several large populations of wild reindeer. All middle-sized and small populations of wild reindeer need protection. During the whole initial <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> and adaptation of man to the north, the life of ancient inhabitants was closely linked to hunting wild reindeer. Neolithic relics of North Eurasia witness the wide distribution of a relatively monotonous Stone Age reindeer hunting culture. Domestication of reindeer began not less than a thousand years ago. Large-scale reindeer husbandry developed only 300 - 400 years ago and prospered for about 200 years. Social changes impeded its development after the 1950 s, resulting in the restoration of wild riendeer herds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work extends and refines the phenomenological {{understanding}} <b>of</b> ballistic <b>penetration</b> in {{the vicinity}} of the erosion-threshold velocity, for the case of hemispherical-nosed tungsten rods striking ductile targets. Analysis, supported by experimentation, indicates a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> noneroding <b>penetration</b> for these configurations, which results from lateral support exerted by the target crater upon the deforming, yet noneroding, penetrator. Experiments indicate that the magnitude of the lateral support, the direct result of an interference fit between rod and crater, must be on the order of the target’s ballistic-penetration resistance, and does not vary with the impact velocity over the range studied. Analysis suggests that the duration of the noneroding portion of the ballistic event is neither governed by a fixed time, nor by a fixed depth <b>of</b> <b>penetration,</b> but rather by a fixed, permissible level of deformation in the penetrator...|$|R
30|$|The method we have {{presented}} {{can be used}} by system operators to define requirements for the safe integration of TCLs in PFC. To do so, this would require more accurate power system dynamic models (with multiple areas and higher modelling detail) and a careful consideration of rotational inertia values. We have demonstrated that lower inertia values, which occur during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> high <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> RES, further reduce the controllability margins and require faster response times to avoid unstable operation. Such simulations can provide maximum response times for the measurement of frequency and activation or deactivation of devices. Once these response times have been set as requirements for DR PFC providers, they can be tested in pre-qualification tests, before frequency-responsive loads can be safely integrated in frequency reserves provision.|$|R

40|$|Changes {{of surface}} water {{chemistry}} {{during the spring}} snowmelt were evaluated at the forested experimental catchment Lesni Potok found in National Reservation Area Voděradské bučiny. The pH value of surface waters decreased and together with high discharge it launched changes of solutes concentrations. As a good indicator of groundwater in the discharge were evaluated concentrations of Si and isotopic signature of  18 O-H 2 O. The concentration of the main anion SO 42 - in waters of Lesni potok oscillated during the spring snowmelt in dependence of ratio between melting snow, soil solution, precipitation and groundwater. During the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> increased <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> surface soil horizons with the water from melting snow causing the increase of DOC concentrations. Concentrations of DOC determined the export of total Fe. Concentrations of Al with DOC did not correlate because the driving factor on concentrations of Al at Lesni Potok is the surface water pH.

40|$|The {{infiltration}} {{phenomenon is}} one of the most important processes in hydrologic cycle. Inorder that rain water infiltrates into the ground in unsaturated state, it is necessary that aportion of bulk of air in void of soil or sand is compressed or exchanged by the penetratingwater, because generally there is a groundwater surface or a rock surface underneath the soil orsand stratum. Therefore, the behaviour of the air, in addition to capillary and gravitationalpotentials, is to contribute greatly to the infiltration phenomenon. This paper describes such abehaviour of air during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> rain-water <b>penetration</b> into unsaturated sands and itscontribution to the infiltration. It is disclosed, as the results obtained experimentally, that (1 there is a criterion for water ponding on the surface of porous stratum, (2) the exchangeabilityof air and water changes largely in this criterion, (3) a heavy rainfall over the criterionforces to compress the air in sand void, and (4), in the case of existence of groundwatersurface, the air is confined into the regions just under the sand surface and just above thegroundwater surface...|$|R
40|$|Topically applied {{compounds}} can penetrate {{directly into}} deeper underlying tissues. In this report, an attempt {{has been made}} to establish structure-deep tissue penetration relationships for a variety of solutes with diverse physicochemical properties. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed with the concentration in the immediately overlying tissue, the solute molecular size and the octanol/water partition coefficient as independent variables. During the initial <b>period</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>penetration,</b> the concentration <b>of</b> any solute in a given tissue was dependent on the concentration in the preceding tissue. The presence of molecular weight and lipophilicity terms as independent variables improved the regressions for some tissues. The solute concentration in the deeper tissues of sacrificed animals was higher for the smaller solutes. Due to the dominance of solute clearance by blood perfusing the tissues, the dependence of solute concentrations in anesthetized animal tissues on size was less than observed for sacrificed animals. The predictions from these regression analyses yielded predictions similar to those based on a physiological pharmacokinetic model. However, only about 50 % of the data was explained by both models. Based on the preliminary qualitative and quantitative analysis, deep tissue <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> solutes after application, as aqueous solutions, to the epidermis is greater for smaller solutes with adequate lipophilicity...|$|R
40|$|Completion of cased and {{cemented}} wells by shaped charge perforation causes its {{own damage}} to the formation, potentially reducing well productivity. In practice {{it is found that}} underbalance conditions clean up the damaged zone to some extent, however, the mechanisms of these processes are poorly understood. Most hydrocodes typically used to simulate rock response to shaped charge penetration do not provide permeability estimates. Furthermore, the time scales for formation clean up are potentially much longer than the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> jet <b>penetration.</b> We have developed a simple, yet accurate model for the evolution of porosity and permeability which can easily be incorporated into existing hydrocodes using information from the history of each cell. In addition, we have developed a code that efficiently simulates fines migration during the post-shot surge period using initial conditions taken directly from hydrocode simulations <b>of</b> jet <b>penetration.</b> Results from a one-dimensional model simulation are in excellent agreement with measured fines and permeability distributions. We also present two-dimensional numerical results which qualitatively reproduce experimentally obtained permeability maps for different values of underbalance. Although initial results have been promising, further comparison with experiment is essential to tune the coupling between the hydrocode and fines migration simulator. Currently the permeability model is most appropriate for high permeability sandstones (such as Berea), but with little effort, the model can be extended to other rock types, given sufficient experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The {{retention}} of tritium-labeled all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), 13 -cis-retinoic acid (13 -cis-RA), aromatic retinoid, and arotinoid ethyl ester in the epidermis and dermis of hairless mice was measured up to 24 h following a single topical application in an acetone vehicle. The radioactivity in the tissues was extractable with chloroform:methanol, and {{the identities of}} the radioactive species extracted were confirmed as retinoids using thin-layer chromatography. All the retinoids were absorbed into the skin rapidly. After an initial <b>period</b> <b>of</b> distribution and <b>penetration</b> (lasting for about 1 h) the amount of the applied retinoid remaining in the epidermis and dermis decreased more slowly, obeying first order (exponential) decay kinetics. Both the arotinoid and the aromatic retinoid persisted for longer in the epidermis than equivalent doses of RA or 13 -cis-RA. The half-lives of the retinoids in the dermis tended to be longer than in the epidermis, except for the arotinoid. Aromatic retinoid persisted for longest in the dermis with a half-life of 11 h...|$|R
