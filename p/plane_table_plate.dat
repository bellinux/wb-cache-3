50|$|Some have {{credited}} Johann Richter, {{also known}} as Johannes Praetorius, a Nuremberg mathematician, in 1610 with the first <b>plane</b> <b>table,</b> but {{this appears to be}} incorrect.|$|R
50|$|Abel Foullon {{described}} a <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> in 1551, {{but it is}} thought that the instrument was in use earlier as his description is of a developed instrument.|$|R
5000|$|Alfred H. Brooks also complimented Major Bagley in his {{preface to}} his USGS Bulletin: [...] "The plate camera has heen used {{for many years}} in {{topographic}} surveying in the United States and Canada, as well as in many European coimtries, and since 1910 J. W. Bagley, a topographic engineer of the United States Geological Survey, has been employing the panoramic film camera in conjunction with the <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> in surveys in Alaska. Mr. Bagley has devised some new instruments and methods and has proved conclusively that the panoramic camera is extremely valuable in certain kinds of topographic work. Some of the results of his phototopographic surveys are presented in the maps accompanying this bulletin. These maps give conclusive evidence of the refinements that are made possible by the use of that instrument. The methods and instruments here described have thus far been used only in Alaska, but they promise to have a wider appUcation in topographic surveys; hence this bulletin has been prepared. As the camera is used in conjunction with the <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> the bulletin includes also a brief account of the uses of the <b>plane</b> <b>table.</b> Mr. Bagley shows clearly that the field cost of surveys made by the use of the panoramic camera and <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> is far lower than that of surveys made by the <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> alone, and though the compilation of the field data in the office is more laborious the final cost of the completed map is nevertheless lower. The methods here described are especially applicable to regions where the field season is short, the field cost high, and the climatic conditions adverse to topographic work." ...|$|R
50|$|The survey lab has a {{collection}} of transit theodolites, electronic theodolite, dumpy levels, engineering chains, measuring tapes, <b>plane</b> <b>table,</b> prismatic compass, total station, planimeter, and subtense bar 2m.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> {{became a}} popular {{instrument}} for surveying. [...] Its use was widely taught. Interestingly, {{there were those}} who considered it a substandard instrument compared to such devices as the theodolite, since it was relatively easy to use. [...] By allowing the use of graphical methods rather than mathematical calculations, it could be used by those with less education than other instruments. The addition of a camera to the <b>plane</b> <b>table,</b> as was done from 1890 by Sebastian Finsterwalder in conjunction with a phototheodolite, established photogrammetry in spatial and temporal surveying.|$|R
5000|$|Trough compasses, {{mounted in}} a {{rectangular}} box whose length was often several times its width, date back several centuries. They {{were used for}} land surveying, particularly with <b>plane</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 1874-77 {{survey by}} the Survey of India under E. C. Ryall, I. S. Pocock set up a <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> at c.22050' on the West flank of Abi Gamin.|$|R
5000|$|On {{his return}} to his native county he made a <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> and {{prepared}} {{a map of the}} county, which was published in 1728 at a scale of one inch to one mile.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> {{provided}} a graphical method of recording and measuring angles, which reduced {{the amount of}} mathematics required. In 1829 Francis Ronalds invented a reflecting instrument for recording angles graphically by modifying the octant.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was elected}} as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1720 and contributed four papers to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, {{including}} {{a description of}} his <b>plane</b> <b>table,</b> and of George Sorocold's waterworks at London Bridge.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} a <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> dates to 1551 in Abel Foullon's [...] "Usage et description de l'holomètre", published in Paris. [...] However, since Foullon's description was of a complete, fully developed instrument, {{it must have been}} invented earlier.|$|R
5000|$|Red Ridge (...) is a ridge {{just west}} of Robson Glacier in the Gonville and Caius Range, in Victoria Land. The {{descriptive}} name was given by Frank Debenham of the British Antarctic Expedition (1910-13) during his <b>plane</b> <b>table</b> survey in 1912.|$|R
5000|$|Nibelungen Valley (...) is an ice free valley {{just west}} of <b>Plane</b> <b>Table</b> and Panorama Peak in the Asgard Range, Victoria Land. Nibelungen is one {{in a group of}} mythological names in the range given by New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC).|$|R
5000|$|Colosseum Cliff (...) is an {{impressive}} banded cliff located between Sykes Glacier and the doleritic rock of <b>Plane</b> <b>Table</b> in the Asgard Range, Victoria Land.

50|$|The alidade was {{originally}} {{a part of}} many types of scientific and astronomical instrument.
