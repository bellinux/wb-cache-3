40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the eye {{movement}} depending on <b>putting</b> distance and accuracy in golf <b>putting.</b> The subjects were semi-professional 5 golfers. Golfers had performed golf <b>putting</b> on 2 m and 15 m distances. Visual search had used in order to examine the eye movement in success and failure of <b>putting</b> by eye tracker (Dikablis 2. 0). During golf <b>putting,</b> eye movement analysis had analyzed on the ball and the hole of <b>putting</b> distance and accuracy. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance for repeated measures using SPSS ver. 15. 0 program. Visual search to distance and accuracy on ball were as followed. Duration was significant differences in <b>putting</b> distance. Number of glances was significant differences in accuracy. Percentaged glance proportion was significant differences in <b>putting</b> distance. Glance frequency was significant differences in <b>putting</b> distance. Visual search to distance and accuracy on hole were followed. Total glance time and number of glances were significant differences in <b>putting</b> distance.

Percentaged glance proportion was significant differences in <b>putting</b> distance and between interaction. Maximal glance duration was significant differences in <b>putting</b> distance, accuracy, and between interaction.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of golfer <b>putting</b> skill and combine it with physics-based putt {{trajectory}} and holeout models to study the impact of doubling the radius of the hole on the <b>putting</b> performance of professional and amateur golfers. The <b>putting</b> skill model reflects golfer execution errors, i. e., that golfers cannot hit the ball at exactly their intended velocity and direction. A green reading skill model reflects a golferâ€™s inability to perfectly estimate the slope or contour of the <b>putting</b> surface. The model is calibrated to professional and amateur <b>putting</b> data. Optimal <b>putting</b> strategies are computed using stochastic dynamic programming. Quasi-Monte Carlo and other methods are used to speed up computations. Doubling the hole radius improves the <b>putting</b> performance of both professional and amateur golfers, as expected. However, the improvement for amateur golfers is shown to be relatively larger than for professionals. ...|$|R
