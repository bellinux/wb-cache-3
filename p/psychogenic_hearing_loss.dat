40|$|Abstract Conclusions: Specific {{requests}} for cochlear implantations by persons with <b>psychogenic</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> are {{a relatively new}} phenomenon. A number of features seems to be over-represented in this group of patients. The existence of these requests {{stresses the importance of}} auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements before cochlear implantation. Objective: To describe the phenomenon of patients with psychogenic hearing losses specifically requesting cochlear implantation, and to gain first insights into the characteristics of this group. Methods: Analysis of all cases seen between 2004 and 2013 at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland. Results: Four cochlear implant candidates with <b>psychogenic</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> were identified. All were female, aged 23 - 51 years. Hearing thresholds ranged from 86 dB to 112 dB HL (pure-tone average 500 - 4000 Hz). ABRs and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) showed bilaterally normal hearing in two subjects, and hearing thresholds between 30 and 50 dB in the other two subjects. Three subjects suffered from depression and one from a pathologic fear of cancer. Three had a history of five or more previous surgeries. Three were smokers and three reported other close family members with hearing losses. All four were hearing aid users at the time of presentation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{experienced}} 6 {{patients with the}} <b>psychogenic</b> <b>hearing</b> impairment in the past 6 months. They were all female and their age ranged from 11 to 13 years. Hearing impairment was bilateral in 5 patients and was unilateral in one. To establish the diagnosis, standard audiometry, speech audiometry Bekesy audiometry, Evoked Response Audiometry (Auditory Brainstem Response and Slow Vertex Response), stapedius reflex test, and tympanometry were performed. The visual field test was also examined and {{the personality of the}} patients was tested using Yatabe-Guilford test. The pure tone test revealed that the degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> ranged from 40 dB to out of scale. The degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> obtained by the speech audiometry was better than that was obtained by the pure tone test. Bekesy audiometry in 11 ears showed type V in 5 and type I in 6. The tympanogram, ERA (ABR and SVR), stapedius reflex were normal in all patients. In two patients, the defect of the visual field was observed. The results of the tests to study the personality of the patients revealed various types of abnormalities. This abnormalities were thought to be the intrinsic factors in this disease. In 5 patients, we found the extrinsic factors in their daily lives. The prognosis of 5 out of the 6 patients was good, but in 1 patient, whose charactor showed to be in a high grade neurotic state, the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was not changed. We treated her with the co-operation of a psychiatrist...|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} main types of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> {{conductive}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> central deafness and combinations of conductive and sensorienural <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> {{which is called}} mixed <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is auditory processing disorder {{which is not a}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.|$|R
30|$|This study helps {{increasing}} {{our understanding}} of gambling behavior among adolescents with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> The students with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> have higher prevalence of lifetime and present year gambling than students without <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> As for young people without <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> boys gamble more than girls. More young people with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> than without <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was playing poker with friends. More students with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> compared to normal hearing students were defined as problem gamblers. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{was a significant predictor}} for gambling participation, but not for problem gambling when adjusted for other predictors.|$|R
50|$|In {{autosomal}} dominant <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> one parent who carries the dominant gene for <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and typically has a <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> passes {{it on to}} the child. In this case there is at least a 50% probability that the child will also have a <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> The probability is higher if both parents have the dominant gene (and typically both have a <b>hearing</b> <b>loss)</b> or if both grandparents {{on one side of the}} family have <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> due to genetic causes. Because at least one parent usually has a <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> there is prior expectation that the child may have a <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Autosomal dominant congenital <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can be attributed to such causes like Waardenburg Syndrome.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> may {{be caused}} by a number of factors, including: genetics, ageing, {{exposure}} to noise, some infections, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins. A common condition that results in <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is chronic ear infections. Certain infections during pregnancy such as syphilis and rubella may also cause <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is diagnosed when hearing testing finds that a person is unable to hear 25 decibels in at least one ear. Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can be categorised as mild, moderate, moderate-severe, severe, or profound. There are three main types of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> and mixed <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
50|$|Congenital <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is a <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{present at}} birth. It can include {{hereditary}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> or <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> due to other factors present either in-utero (prenatal) {{or at the}} time of birth.|$|R
50|$|Profound {{unilateral}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is {{a specific}} type of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> when one ear has no functional hearing ability (91 dB or greater <b>hearing</b> <b>loss).</b> People with profound unilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can only <b>hear</b> in monaural (mono).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> may {{be divided}} into four types: {{conductive}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> central auditory processing disorders, and mixed types.|$|R
50|$|Conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{occurs when}} there is a problem {{conducting}} sound waves anywhere along the route through the outer ear, tympanic membrane (eardrum), or middle ear (ossicles).This type of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> may occur in conjunction with sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (mixed <b>hearing</b> <b>loss)</b> or alone.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the {{audiogram}} resulting from PTA audiometry gives {{an indication of the}} type of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> as well as possible causes. Conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> due to disorders of the middle ear shows as a flat increase in thresholds cross the frequency range. Sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> will have a contoured shape depending on the cause. Presbycusis or age-related <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> for example is characterized by a high frequency roll-off (increase in thresholds). Noise-induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> has a characteristic notch at 4000 Hz. Other coutours may indicate other causes for the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
40|$|Congenital human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{occurs in}} 0. 5 – 1 % of live births and approxi-mately 10 % of infected infants develop <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> The mechanism(s) of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> re-main unknown. We developed a murine model of CMV induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in which murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection of newborn mice leads to hematogenous spread of virus {{to the inner}} ear, induction of inflammatory responses, and <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Characteris-tics of the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> described in infants with congenital HCMV infection were observed including, delayed onset, progressive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> and unilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in this model and, these characteristics were viral inoculum dependent.

Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 445 children in stages 2, 6 and 10 of Baghche-Ban school of hard of hearing participated. the research was performed by means of the three-stages questionaires that children filled with help of their parents. Results: The mean age of detection of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in both acquired and congenital <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in children was 3. 5 year-old. while the age in which <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was doubted was 1. 8 year-old. In another word the mean age of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> detection decreased as the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> increases(in moderate- profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss)</b> (P< 0. 01).

50|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is {{classified}} as mild, moderate, severe or profound. Pure-tone audiometry for air conduction thresholds at 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz is traditionally used to classify the degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in each ear. Normal hearing thresholds {{are considered to be}} 25 dB sensitivity, though it has been proposed that this threshold is too high, and that 15 dB (about half as loud) is more typical. Mild <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is thresholds of 25-45 dB; moderate <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is thresholds of 45-65 dB; severe <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is thresholds of 65-85 dB; and profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> thresholds are greater than 85 dB.|$|R
50|$|The {{severity}} of a <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds {{in which a}} sound must be {{so it can be}} detected by an individual. It is measured in decibels of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> or dB HL. The measurement of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in an individual is conducted over several frequencies, mostly 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz. The <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> of the individual is the average of the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> values over the different frequencies. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can be ranked differently according to different organisations; and so, in different countries are different systems in use.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine through a questionnaire how road users with different degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> experience safety and mobility in transport situations compared to road users without <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Participants were recruited from the local branch of HRF (The Swedish hard of hearing society). A control group without any known <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> matched on age, gender and geographical location, was selected from a commercial database. The individuals with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> were grouped into four groups according the degree of their hearing-loss (mild, moderate, severe and profound). The results revealed that <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> affects some specific aspects regarding transport habits, while others remain unaffected. Individuals with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> are not as likely to have a driving license, but for those who have, <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> has no effect on mileage per year. <b>Loss</b> of <b>hearing</b> has an effect on criteria for choosing transportation, but the use of each transportation mode is unaffected. With a few exceptions, <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> does not affect the ratings of importance of hearing for different transportation modes. Degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> affects most questions regarding hearing in relation to driver abilities, while avoidance of specific traffic situations or environments is only associated with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in specific situations. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> has only minor effect on the factors causing inattention when driving and on the interest in a warning system for driver inattention. Preliminary results from open questions point at a general wish for more and complimentary information in all transportation modes, thru texted information, light warnings, traffic light in all crossings etc. It can be concluded that <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> influences the prevalence of driving license and criteria for choosing transportation mode. However <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> had no effect on the travelling frequency independent of mode. Respondents with profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> were less concerned about <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> with respect to travelling, indicating a coping strategy.

Methods: The patients underwent routine otolaryngologic history and physical examination, along with standard pure-tone audiometry. Results: <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was present in 43. 1 % of patients. 16 % of patients had conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and 4. 6 % of patient had sensory neural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> 22. 5 % of thalassemic patients had high-frequency sensory neural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and more importantly, high-frequency <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> attributable to Desferrioxamine ototoxicity was present in 12 % of patients.

This {{study was conducted to}} identify the frequency of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and its related factors on patients referred to audiometry clinic of Kashan University Matini hospital in 2006. Materials and Methods: In a cross sectional study from November 2005 to April 2006, 462 patients referred to the audiometry clinic were enrolled to the study. The causative mechanisms of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> with a decrease of more than 10 db, were considered in 3 main categories of conductive, neuro-sensory, and mixed types on the base of audiogram charts. The data were analyzed with c 2 and fisher exact tests. Results: Of 462 patients, 203 (43. 9) had <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> 53. 7 of whom were male. Mean age was 33. 4 Â± 19. 5.

40|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common birth defects; about 3 - 4 in 1, 000 newborns have {{significant}} <b>hearing</b> impairment. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> that is present at birth is called congenital <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> also can develop later in childhood or during adulthood. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can have a major impact on the life of a child and his family.

50|$|Prelingual <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can {{be either}} acquired, meaning it {{occurred}} after birth due to illness or injury, {{or it can be}} congenital, meaning it was present at birth. Congenital <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can be caused by genetic or nongenetic factors. The nongenetic factors account for about one fourth of the congenital <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> in infants. These factors could include: Maternal infections, such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, or herpes simplex virus, lack of oxygen, maternal diabetes, toxemia during pregnancy, low birth weight, prematurity, birth injuries, toxins including drugs and alcohol consumed by the mother during pregnancy, and complications associated with the Rh factor in the blood/jaundice. Genetic factors account for over half of the infants with congenital <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Most of these are caused by an autosomal recessive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> or an autosomal dominant <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Autosomal recessive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is when both parents carry the recessive gene, and pass it on to their child.

40|$|Purpose The NIOSH <b>Hearing</b> <b>Loss</b> Simulator is a {{software}} training and communication tool for promoting <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> prevention. It allows a user or trainer {{to demonstrate the}} effects of noise exposure on hearing without experiencing an actual noise-induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Estimates {{of the effects of}} different levels of noise exposure are based on the American National Standard Determination of Occupational Noise Exposure and Estimation of Noise-Induced Hearing Impairment, otherwise known as ANSI S 3. 44. This standard specifies the predicted <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> for noise-exposed populations of individuals based on risk factors that include gender, age, sound levels (in A-weighted decibels or dBA), and years of exposure. Algorithms specified in the standard were derived from empirical studies of populations that had no exposure to loud noise and other populations that had experienced various levels and durations of noise exposure. This manual explains the major objectives that can be addressed with the simulator and training scenarios that can be applied to real-life, real-worker scenarios. The majority of this guide explains the simulator's functions in detail. Simulator users are encouraged to read this manual while learning how to run the software. [] Training Objectives The main objective of the <b>Hearing</b> <b>Loss</b> Simulator is to increase motivation for taking effective hearing prevention action by demonstrating simulated noise-induced <b>hearing</b> <b>losses.</b> [The Simulator can also help teach the following facts about <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is affected by noise levels. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> worsens as the noise exposure duration increases. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can become permanent. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> makes it harder to hear what others say. Most <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is not caused by age.
