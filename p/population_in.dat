5|$|After {{several years}} of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of the elk <b>population</b> <b>in</b> Yellowstone National Park, Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. The committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended different management of Yellowstone's elk <b>population.</b> <b>In</b> addressing the goals, policies, and methods of managing wildlife in the parks, the report suggested {{that in addition to}} protection, wildlife populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, fire ecology, and other issues, the report suggested that the National Park Service (NPS) hire scientists to manage the parks using current scientific research.|$|E

40|$|First online: 05 April 2015 Niphanda fusca is an {{endangered}} myrmecophilous butterfly inhabiting environments at {{early stages of}} succession. Most of its habitats are places where succession is prevented by human activity. In some places, however, N. fusca lives in natural semi-bare areas, such as cliffs in mountains or grasslands around volcanos. We investigate the genetic structure of N. fusca in Japan and South Korea to address two questions. (1) Are <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> natural environments genetically different from those in secondary environments? and (2) Do <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> natural environments possess greater genetic diversity than those in secondary environments? The AMOVA {{results indicated that the}} <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> natural environments and those in secondary environments were differentiated to some extent; however, more than 80 % of genetic variation was found to occur within the same habitat type and within each population. We found no differences in genetic diversity between <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> the two environments. At present, we have not found a strong reason to consider <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> the two environments as different evolutionarily significant units. We think it is practical to conserve <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> natural environments at first, because in this case we need not manage habitats to protect N. fusca. We have only to inhibit habitat destruction. In contrast, in order to conserve <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> secondary environments, we would have to continue managing the habitats. This is far more difficult than inhibiting habitat destruction...|$|R
