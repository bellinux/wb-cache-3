5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at the right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time,</b> favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E
25|$|The Daily Mail {{newspaper}} recruited Lady Sarah {{after one}} of its correspondents, Ralph Hellawell, was arrested by the Boers {{as he tried to}} get out of the besieged town of Mafeking to send his dispatch. She was in the right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time</b> to step into the journalistic breach, having moved to Mafeking with her husband, Lt.-Col. Gordon Chesney Wilson, at the start of the war, where he was aide-de-camp to Col. Robert Baden-Powell, the commanding officer at Mafeking. Baden-Powell asked her to leave Mafeking for her own safety after the Boers threatened to storm the British garrison. This she duly did, and set off on a madcap adventure in the company of her maid, travelling through the South African countryside. Eventually, she was captured by the Boers and returned to the town in exchange for a horse thief being held there.|$|E
25|$|PDZ domains {{are found}} in many {{different}} contexts and diverse proteins, but all assist in localization of cellular elements. PDZ domains are primarily involved in anchoring receptor proteins to the cytoskeleton. For cells to function properly {{it is important for}} the right components—proteins and other molecules— to be in the right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> Proteins with PDZ domains are able to bind to different components to ensure that the correct arrangement is met. In the neuron, making sense of neurotransmitter activity requires specific receptors to be located in the lipid membrane at the synapse. PDZ domains are crucial to this receptor localization process. Proteins with PDZ domains generally associate with both the C-terminus of the receptor and cytoskeletal elements in order to anchor the receptor to the cytoskeleton and keep it in place. Without such an interaction, receptors would diffuse out of the synapse due to the fluid nature of the lipid membrane.|$|E

25|$|Brunk {{revealed}} in a shoot promo {{and in the}} documentary film Forever Hardcore that {{in fact it was}} not Paul Heyman that brought him into Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) but that he was at the right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> He was referred by a friend to Tod Gordon. According to the storyline, Sabu, who at that time often arrived to the ring by his handler 911, was an uncontrollable madman strapped to a gurney and with a Hannibal Lecter-style face mask while trying to break free (he claimed to hate this part of his gimmick as he was normally tired before he started his match). Sabu could only be released from his bonds to wrestle his matches. Sabu also quickly became synonymous with table-breaking at this time; if a table was not broken during the match, Sabu would break a table with his own body after the bell had sounded, sometimes leading to 911 having to restrain Sabu during backstage interviews if a table was present.|$|E
500|$|Warwick {{had fought}} for the House of York since {{the early stages of}} the Wars of the Roses and {{alongside}} his cousin, Edward IV, in many of the battles. His years of loyalty earned him the trust of the Yorkists, and his victories—both political and military—and popularity with the common people made him an important figure. He had powerful influence over the line of succession, earning him the nickname [...] "The Kingmaker". Early historians described him as a military genius, but by the 20th century his tactical acumen was reconsidered; Philip Haigh suspects that the Earl largely owed some of his victories, such as the First Battle of St Albans, to being in the right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> Christopher Gravett believes the Earl was too defensive and lacked mental flexibility.|$|E
500|$|Walter Francis O'Malley (October 9, 1903 – August 9, 1979) was an American sports {{executive}} {{who owned the}} Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers team in Major League Baseball from [...] to [...] In , as owner of the Dodgers, he brought major league baseball to the West Coast, moving the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles despite the Dodgers being the 2nd most profitable team in baseball from 1946–1956, [...] and coordinating the move of the New York Giants to San Francisco {{at a time when}} there were no teams west of Kansas City, Missouri. [...] For this, he was long vilified by Brooklyn Dodgers fans. However, Pro-O'Malley parties describe him as a visionary for the same business action, and many authorities cite him as one of the most influential sportsmen of the 20th century. Other observers say that he was not a visionary, but instead a man who was in the right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time,</b> and regard him as the most powerful and influential owner in baseball after moving the team.|$|E

500|$|George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California {{graduate}} {{with experience in}} sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being in the right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time</b> in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on Buffy start {{with one or two}} episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be {{a major part of the}} fourth season. Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the [...] Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, [...] "this is a guy we're going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can't just see him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [...] should scare us with his actions; but there's also innocence. Like the Frankenstein monster, you realize that they're only doing what they know. Or what they've been programmed to do. These aren't born creatures, these are creations." ...|$|E
500|$|Around {{this same}} time, the thirty-two year-old Phips {{had made his}} way to England, where he gained an {{audience}} with Narborough and Charles II. [...] By any measure, this was a remarkable achievement for a poor New Englander like Phips, but it also seems clear that he must have been at the right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> His reputation for finding sunken ships may have preceded him, and he seems to have had demonstrable gains to show, as one letter writer mentions his 'late successful returns.' Perhaps he delivered the King's portion of these returns to Whitehall in person? [...] In any case, a reckless plan was concocted, probably by Narborough, whereby this New England native, despite having no background in the English navy, would be assigned as the commander of a 20-gun frigate, HMS Rose of Algiers for a treasure hunt, but given no other financial backing. He and his crew would be required to pay for all other expenses of the voyage, including food and diving equipment, and give a deposit of £100. Of the treasure they found, 35% would go to the King, and the rest would be divided among the otherwise unpaid crew.|$|E

You need to be a little lucky, being in the right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> For everybody, it's a very exciting race. We were racing all together all the time." [...] Da Matta stated {{he did not want to}} lead the race with two laps remaining because of the draft and believed there would be a larger battle for the victory. Second-place finisher Papis said his team were planning a new strategy after the race's distance was reduced and had been looking forward to further racing and congratulated Da Matta on winning the race. Tagliani, who finished in third, revealed that he lifted from his accelerator pedal and ran in fifth gear on the backstraight and stated it was about conserving fuel and avoiding being caught in any incidents. He said the final ten laps felt like qualifying lap times and felt the race before then was [...] "kind of boring, just driving around and around." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bob Taylor was {{primarily}} a goal poacher. His goals were often unspectacular, and he lacked the pace necessary to chase long balls.

[...] said Oilers defensive coordinator Ed Biles.

2500|$|Fire {{support was}} limited {{for the first}} half of the campaign. A {{commando}} light battery with 105 mm Pack Howitzers had deployed to Brunei at the beginning of 1963 but returned to Singapore after a few months when the mopping-up of the Brunei Revolt ended. Despite the escalation in Indonesian attacks after the formation of Malaysia, little need was seen for fire support: the limited range of the guns (...) , the limited availability of helicopters and the size of the country meant that having artillery in the right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time</b> was a challenge. However, a battery from one of the two regiments stationed in Malaysia returned to Borneo in early to mid-1964. These batteries rotated until the end of the confrontation. In early 1965, a complete UK-based regiment arrived. The short range and substantial weight of the 3-inch mortars meant they were of very limited use.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1887, Eric Lewis, who {{had been}} understudying George Grossmith in the comic [...] "patter" [...] roles, {{resigned}} from the company in frustration that Grossmith had rarely taken ill in four years.
