40|$|In {{software}} development research, early prediction of defective software modules always attracts the developers {{because it can}} reduces the overall requirements of {{software development}} such as time and budgets and increases the customer satisfaction. In the current context, with constantly increasing constraints like requirement ambiguity and complex development process, developing fault free reliable software is a daunting task. To deliver reliable software, {{it is essential to}} execute exhaustive number of test cases which may become tedious and costly for software enterprises. To ameliorate the testing <b>process,</b> <b>a</b> <b>defect</b> prediction model can be used which enables the developers to distribute their quality assurance activity on defect prone modules. However, a defect prediction models requires empirical validation to ensure their relevance to a software enterprises. In recent past, several classification and prediction models, based on historical defect data sets, have been used for early prediction of error-prone modules. Considering these facts, in this paper, a new Support Vector based Fuzzy Classification System (SVFCS) has been proposed for defective module prediction. In the proposed model an initial rule set is constructed using support vectors and Fuzzy logic. Rule set optimization is done using Genetic algorithm. The new method has been compared against two other models reported in recent literature viz. Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine by using several measures, precision and probability of detection and it is found that the prediction performance of SVFCS approach is generally better than other prediction approaches. Our approach achieved 76. 5 mean recall and 34. 65 mean false alarm rate on three versions of Eclipse (Eclipse (2. 0, 2. 1, 3. 0) and Equinox software bug data sets which strongly endorse the significance of proposed model in defect prediction research...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFe-S bound {{proteins}} are ubiquitous {{and contribute}} to most basic cellular <b>processes.</b> <b>A</b> <b>defect</b> in the ISC components catalyzing Fe-S cluster biogenesis leads to drastic phenotypes in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In this context, the Frataxin protein (FXN) stands out as an exception. In eukaryotes, <b>a</b> <b>defect</b> in FXN results in severe defects in Fe-S cluster biogenesis, and in humans, this is associated with Friedreich's ataxia, a neurodegenerative disease. In contrast, prokaryotes deficient in the FXN homolog CyaY are fully viable, despite the clear involvement of CyaY in ISC-catalyzed Fe-S cluster formation. The molecular basis of the differing importance in the contribution of FXN remains enigmatic. Here, we have demonstrated that a single mutation in the scaffold protein IscU rendered E. coli viability strictly dependent upon a functional CyaY. Remarkably, this mutation changed an Ile residue, conserved in prokaryotes at position 108, into a Met residue, conserved in eukaryotes. We found that in the double mutant IscU(IM) Delta cyaY, the ISC pathway was completely abolished, becoming equivalent to the Delta iscU deletion strain and recapitulating the drastic phenotype caused by FXN deletion in eukaryotes. Biochemical analyses of the "eukaryotic-like" IscU(IM) scaffold revealed that it exhibited a reduced capacity to form Fe-S clusters. Finally, bioinformatic studies of prokaryotic IscU proteins allowed us to trace back the source of FXN-dependency as it occurs in present-day eukaryotes. We propose an evolutionary scenario in which the current mitochondrial Isu proteins originated from the IscU(IM) version present in the ancestor of the Rickettsiae. Subsequent acquisition of SUF, the second Fe-S cluster biogenesis system, in bacteria, was accompanied by diminished contribution of CyaY in prokaryotic Fe-S cluster biogenesis, and increased tolerance {{to change in the}} amino acid present at the 108 th position of the scaffold...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} the {{application}} of an information maximization (InfoMax) algorithm to enhance eddy current (EC) measurements to be <b>processed</b> by <b>a</b> <b>defect</b> location/characterization system. Due to the scanning process, the acquired measurements are unavoidably affected by noise effect, like thermal noise, lift-off variations and edge effects. When {{the power of the}} noise signal is very higher than the power of the defect related signal, then the automatic detection/recognition system gives very poor results, since the crack is completely buried in the background of the acquired measurement. The information maximization approach that we propose, is performed by an artificial neural network (ANN), and it is able to separately feature the signal related to the defect presence/absence and the signal that derives from the undesired noise effects. In order to test this algorithm, real eddy current measurements, provided by courtesy of the MANODET Group (Hungarian Academy of Sciences), have been processed.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is an inverse problem of {{identifying}} defects in composite beams and plates. The physical representation of defects is parametrized.

40|$|Anelastic {{relaxation}} {{processes in}} single crystals of aluminum {{have been investigated}} after 3 MeV-electron irradiation at 4. 5 K. The elastic after-effect measurements were made on torsionally stressed and samples (defect concentration 7 · 10 ^- 4 and 4 · 10 ^- 4 respectively). The elastic after-effect method is weIl suited for investigating such relaxation <b>processes</b> where <b>a</b> <b>defect</b> reorientation jump mayaIso lead to migration, and therefore through reactions with other defects in the lattice, to annihilation of the relaxing defect. The advantage of the elastic after-effect method is that it requires only <b>a</b> few <b>defect</b> reorientation jumps {{in comparison to the}} several thousand necessary for an internal friction measurement. In addition to the relaxation processes which have been seen previously in internal friction studies, two new <b>processes,</b> <b>A</b> and B, have been observed. <b>Process</b> <b>A</b> has been identified as the reorientational relaxation of -dumbbell interstitials in recovery stage I_D+E. The measured activation energy (115 meV) for <b>process</b> <b>A</b> shows that reorientation and migration of thisdefect occurs by the same jump process. The value found for the elastic shape factor (A-B = 1. 1 eV) is consistent with that expected from theoretical estimateso Process B exhibits all the characteristics expected for reorientation of the Johnson di-interstitial in stage II_ 1. The defect symmetry and activationenergy for other relaxation processes have been determined, and possible configurations for corresponding defects are discussed. The dose dependence and annealing behaviour of the diaelastic modulus change have also been measured. The anisotropy and magnitude of the diaelastic effect indicate that the interstitialdefect created during irradiation at liquid helium temperature assumes the -split configuration. The annealing behaviour indicates that interstitial atoms in small clusters have an even higher diaelastic polarizability than single interstitials, and that the diaelastic polarizability decreases strongly when the interstitials form dislocation loops...|$|R

By comparing spectra from several samples, we find a weak sub-band gap enhancement of χzxx(2) (ω= 2 ωo) at a two photon energy of 2. 80 eV that is not present in χxzx(2) (ω= 2 ωo). This enhancement is independent of the carrier concentration, intentional doping, and presence of the 2 ̆ 2 yellow luminescence band 2 ̆ 2 defects. This feature may result from <b>a</b> three photon <b>process</b> involving <b>a</b> midgap <b>defect</b> state. We analyze three photon <b>processes</b> that include <b>a</b> <b>defect</b> state with group theory and demonstrate that several processes contribute to χzxx(2) (ω= 2 ωo) but not to χxzx(2) (ω= 2 ωo).

This can be realized by detection of electromagnetic or acoustic process emissions. Up to now, both variants were not leading to realization of satisfying concepts of process monitoring.

METHODS: Thirty two Wistar rats were {{submitted to a}} ventral abdominal wall defect, with integrity of the parietal peritoneum. In the repair, were used polypropylene (group A) and polypropylene/poliglecaprone (group B) meshes. The groups were subdivided into four subgroups of eight animals euthanized on the 30 th (A 30 and B 30) and 60 th postoperative day (A 60 and B 60). Fragments of the abdominal wall of the animals were submitted to macroscopic, tensiometric and histological evaluations. RESULTS: The tensiometry on subgroup A 30 showed a mean average break point of 0. 78 MPa and in A 60, 0. 66 Mpa. In subgroup B 30 it was 0. 84 MPa and in B 60, 1. 27 Mpa.
