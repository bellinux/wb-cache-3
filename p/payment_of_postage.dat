25|$|Any {{letter sent}} within Canada has the {{destination}} {{address on the}} centre of its envelope, with a stamp, postal indicia, meter label, or frank mark on the top-right corner of the envelope to acknowledge <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> A return address, {{although it is not}} required, can be put on the top-left corner or the back of the envelope in smaller type than the destination address.|$|E
25|$|In 1680 William Dockwra, an English {{merchant}} in London, and {{his partner}} Robert Murray established the London Penny Post, a mail system that delivered letters and small parcels inside the city of London for the sum of one penny. The postage for the mailed item was prepaid {{by the use of}} a hand-stamp to frank the mailed item, confirming <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> Though this 'stamp' was applied to a letter instead of a separate piece of paper it is considered by many historians as the world's first postage stamp.|$|E
25|$|The first stamps did {{not need}} to show the issuing country, so no country name was {{included}} on them. The UK remains the only country to omit its name on postage stamps, using the reigning monarch’s head as country identification. Following the introduction of the postage stamp in the UK, prepaid postage considerably increased the number of letters mailed. Before 1839, the number of letters sent in the UK was typically 76 million. By 1850 this increased five-fold to 350 million, continuing to grow rapidly {{until the end of the}} 20th century when newer methods of indicating the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> reduced the use of stamps.|$|E

5000|$|The {{delivery}} of letters without compensation {{and without the}} affixation or <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> any <b>postage</b> is allowed under 39 CFR 310.3(c) by third parties, and under 39 CFR 310.3(b) for one's own letters which includes regular employees only delivering company mail. Thus, {{it is not a}} violation of the PES if one delivers a letter of one's friend even without affixation <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> or if a company has one of its regular employees deliver mail that originates from the company to its customers. Compensation is considered to include barter and goodwill. Thus an individual or business who receives a benefit for the {{delivery of}} letters does not fall under such a free carriage exception. For example, buying a friend dinner in exchange for having him deliver a letter is not considered without compensation; in such a case one would be required to affix and cancel a sufficient amount <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> to the letter. Another example not falling under this exception would be a business that is carrying letters [...] "free of charge" [...] in the hopes of building business or incidental to some other delivery as an accommodation for its customer; this use would also require the affixation and cancellation of a sufficient amount <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> to be in compliance with the PES.|$|R
50|$|A {{postage meter}} is a {{mechanical}} device {{used to create}} and apply physical evidence <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> (or franking) to mailed matter. Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> meters. A postage meter imprints an amount <b>of</b> <b>postage,</b> functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The meter stamp serves as proof <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> and {{eliminates the need for}} adhesive stamps.|$|R
25|$|Postage stamps have {{facilitated}} {{the delivery of}} mail since the 1840s. Before then, ink and hand-stamps (hence the word 'stamp'), usually made from wood or cork, were often used to frank the mail and confirm the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> The first adhesive postage stamp, {{commonly referred to as}} the Penny Black, was issued in the United Kingdom in 1840. The invention of the stamp was part of an attempt to reform and improve the postal system in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which, in the early 19th century, was in disarray and rife with corruption. There are varying accounts of the inventor or inventors of the stamp.|$|E
25|$|A {{postage stamp}} {{is a small}} piece of paper that is {{purchased}} and displayed on an item of mail as evidence of <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> Typically, stamps are printed on special custom-made paper, show a national designation and a denomination (value) on the front, and have an adhesive gum on the back or are self-adhesive. Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration (post office) or other authorized vendor, and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail, as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration. They are sometimes a source of net profit to the issuing agency, especially when sold to collectors who will not actually use them for postage.|$|E
2500|$|In most {{countries}} {{a system of}} codes has been created (referred to as ZIP codes in the United States, postcodes in the United Kingdom and Australia, and postal codes in most other countries), {{in order to facilitate}} the automation of operations. This also includes placing additional marks on the address portion of the letter or mailed object, called [...] "bar coding." [...] Bar coding of mail for delivery is usually expressed either by a series of vertical bars, usually called POSTNET coding, or a block of dots as a two-dimensional barcode. The [...] "block of dots" [...] method allows for the encoding of proof of <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage,</b> exact routing for delivery, and other features.|$|E

50|$|Pre-adhesive mail, {{also called}} pre-stamp mail, are letters carried in mail systems before the {{issuance}} <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> stamps. A stampless cover is another description and generally also refers to any item of mail sent before the issuance <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> stamps {{but it can}} also refer to mail sent, after the introduction <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> stamps, unpaid (as was permitted in many countries) or without the pre-payment being indicated by the affixing <b>of</b> a <b>postage</b> stamp; it could have been pre-paid in cash and marked paid.|$|R
2500|$|Thomas Jefferson's {{likeness}} {{over the}} years has been finely depicted {{on the face of the}} various postage issues that honored him. The first issue to depict Jefferson was issued in 1856, (displayed above) nine years after the Post Office issued its first two stamps of Washington and Franklin in 1847. (Before this time hand-stamps were used to mark and confirm <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.)</b> [...] Almost as popular and famous as George Washington, Jefferson appears comparatively less often on U.S. postage issues, and unlike Washington and Franklin, appears on just two commemorative issues, one in 1904, displayed below, the other on the AMERIPEX presidential issue of 1986. His remaining depictions are confined to regular issues.|$|E
2500|$|President Jefferson Davis had {{appointed}} John Henninger Reagan on March 6, 1861, to {{head the}} new Confederate States of America Post-office Department. The United States Post Office Department continued to handle the mail of the seceded states until June 1 when the Confederate Post office took over collection and delivery throughout the Confederacy, remaining in operation {{for the duration of}} the Civil War. The most immediate concerns of the Confederate postmaster general was the organization of his department and providing for the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> so that it would become self-financing. While the recalled U.S. postage could no longer be used to carry the mail by the U.S. Post Office, the Confederacy did use [...] "appropriated" [...] United States postal stationery for some time. General Reagan claimed he never conferred official authority on postmasters to issue interim, [...] "provisional" [...] stamps, but they filled a need in the absence of national Confederate stamps (which were not issued until October, 1861) and stamped envelopes.|$|E
60|$|Mr. George {{wished to}} stop by the way to put a letter in the post office, and to pay the postage of it. He desired to do this personally, for he wished to inquire whether the letter would go direct. So James led them by {{the way of the}} post office, and {{conducted}} Mr. George into the office where foreign letters were received, and the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> taken for them. Here James served as interpreter. Indeed, {{it is one of the}} most important duties of a commissioner to serve as an interpreter to his employer, whenever his services are required in this capacity.|$|E

500|$|By September 1857, {{the volume}} of Spanish silver coming to the Mint had been so large that Snowden gave {{up the idea of}} being able to pay for it just with cents, authorizing payment with gold and silver coins. On March 3, 1859, the {{redemption}} of the foreign pieces was extended for an additional two years. As commerce was choked with the new cents, Congress repealed this provision in July 1860, though Snowden continued the practice {{for more than a year}} without authorization from Congress. Bankers Magazine for October 1861 reported the end of the exchange, and quoted the Philadelphia Press: [...] "the large issue of the new nickel cents has rendered them almost as much of a nuisance as the old Spanish currency." [...] According to Breen, [...] "the foreign silver coins had been legal tender, receivable for all kinds <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> including <b>postage</b> stamps and some taxes; the nickel cents were not. They quickly filled shopkeepers' cashboxes to the exclusion of almost everything else; they began to be legally refused in trade."
