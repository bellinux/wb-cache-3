5|$|One unusual {{defensive}} weapon was in use at Kenley on 18 August; the parachute-and-cable. Located {{on the north}} side of the airfield at 18 metre (60 foot) intervals, these were fired vertically by a rocket in salvoes of nine or more. As enemy aircraft came in at low-altitude, the parachute deployed and held a 145-metre (480 foot) long steel cable from an altitude of 180 metres (600 feet). If struck by an aircraft, a second parachute deployed and tangled the device around the victim. If the cable was <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing, there was a good chance that the aircraft would go down out of control. This device had not been used before 18 August 1940. Also available were barrage balloons with cutting cables capable of tearing off bombers' wings.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech {{searching for a}} way to answer Georgia's {{previous}} two scores and quash the momentum Georgia had <b>picked</b> <b>up.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> third play of the quarter, however, Virginia Tech quarterback Sean Glennon threw an interception to Georgia's Tony Taylor. Beginning on their own 35-yard line, Georgia capitalized on the mistake quickly, courtesy of a 15-yard personal foul penalty and a 41-yard completion from Stafford to Milner. Georgia, hoping to tie the time, attempted and completed a two-point conversion. The resulting scores tied the game at 21–21 with 12:39 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Xerxes's {{estimated}} time {{of arrival}} at Thermopylae coincided with both the Olympic Games and the festival of Carneia. For the Spartans, warfare during these periods was considered sacrilegious. Despite the uncomfortable timing, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men. The customary elite young men in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had children. Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Allied Peloponnesian cities, and other forces that the Allies <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.|$|E

5|$|He {{believed}} {{that he and his}} men had secured Dai Do and wasn't expecting a sudden massive counterattack by the NVA. Company G took cover in the village cemetery and the fight raged through the night. The next morning, the bodies of more than three hundred enemy soldiers lay near their positions. Vargas's battalion commander arrived on the scene and ordered a renewed assault on the village. He carried to safety a Marine whose arm had been severed, and when the soldier pleaded for his arm, Vargas went back and found it. When the battalion commander, fighting like any other rifleman, was shot in the back three times, Vargas dragged him a hundred yards to an evacuation point, firing at the enemy as he went with an AK-47 he had <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. By {{the end of the third}} day of battle, the North Vietnamese retreated and Vargas finally allowed himself to be treated for a bullet wound in his side and shrapnel from mortar blasts.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the remnant}} low {{associated}} with Josephine {{began to show}} signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September7. Convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September8, wind shear took over the system again. Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September10, the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September14, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely.|$|E
5|$|It {{was these}} 1986 Giants that popularized the {{football}} tradition of dousing {{the head coach}} with a cooler of Gatorade {{near the end of}} a victorious game. This originally started in 1985 when Jim Burt, incensed by what he thought was mistreatment he received in practice the week leading up to a game, exacted revenge on Bill Parcells by dumping a cooler of Gatorade on him after the Giants won that week's game. Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ploy and would often sneak up on Coach Parcells near the end of games to dump the remaining Gatorade over his head. The dousing was a big hit with fans, and the Gatorade dumping would continue on throughout the season after each win, with Taylor, Carson, and several other players (Burt had since ceased doing it) concocting increasingly elaborate, sneaky and playful ruses, so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise.|$|E

5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
5|$|She left Soda Creek for {{her first}} trip {{upstream}} on May 23, leaving at the break of day and arriving in Quesnel at 11 am. Captain Browne made semi-weekly trips between Quesnel and Soda Creek until June 23 when he decided that the BX was ready for testing in the two canyons between Quesnel and Fort George, the Cottonwood Canyon and the Fort George Canyon. He left Quesnel at 1pm and upon arriving at the Cottonwood Canyon, offloaded the passengers and lined through using the steam capstan. However, Browne soon realized that the light and powerful BX {{did not need to}} line through and could run the canyons unaided. By law passengers were forced to disembark and walk around any canyon that a steamer was lining through and be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side. However, by the fall of 1910, the federal steamboat inspector decided that the BX was allowed to keep her passengers on board. This gave her a huge advantage over her rivals, all of which had to line through both canyons, wasting time and fuel as well as inconveniencing the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Set in the author's present day, the interwar period, {{the novel}} centers on two strangers who arrive at {{different}} times in Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, a fictional county based on Faulkner's home, Lafayette County, Mississippi. The plot first focuses on Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Alabama looking for {{the father of her}} unborn child, and then shifts to explore the life of Joe Christmas, a man who has settled in Jefferson and passes as white, but who secretly believes he has some black ancestry. After a series of flashbacks narrating Christmas's early life, the plot resumes with his living and working with Lucas Burch, the father of Lena's child, who fled to Jefferson and changed his name when he found out that Lena was pregnant. The woman on whose property Christmas and Burch have been living, Joanna Burden, a descendant of Yankee abolitionists hated by the citizens of Jefferson, is murdered. Burch is caught {{at the scene of the}} crime and reveals that Christmas had been romantically involved with her and is part black, thus implying that he is guilty of her murder. While Burch sits in jail awaiting his reward for turning in Christmas, Lena is assisted by Byron Bunch, a shy, mild-mannered bachelor who falls in love with her. Bunch seeks the aid of another outcast in the town, the disgraced former minister Gail Hightower, to help Lena give birth and protect Christmas from being lynched. Though Hightower refuses the latter, Christmas escapes to his house and is shot and castrated by a state guardsman. Burch leaves town without his reward, and the novel ends with an anonymous man recounting a story to his wife about some hitchhikers he <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road to Tennesseea woman with a child and a man who was not the father of the child, both looking for the woman's husband.|$|E
