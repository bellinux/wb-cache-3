40|$|This {{research}} addresses {{questions of}} policy transfer, specifically, policy uploading – <b>the</b> upward transfer <b>of</b> national policies to the European level. It contributes to three bodies of literature, namely, institutional theory, new governance, and European Union politics. The questions it addresses are {{why and how}} European Union member countries use the Council Presidency to upload their national policies, {{and what are the}} conditions needed for policy uploading to be successful. To answer these questions I use the case studies method and compare <b>the</b> Council <b>Presidencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom (2005), France (2008), the Czech Republic (2009), Sweden (2009), and Belgium (2010). For each case, specific national policies are looked at and I use process-tracing to identify the variables at play for successful uploading to occur. Based on qualitative data, I find that the reasons explaining why countries attempt to upload their national policies during their Council Presidency supports what has been identified in the literature on venue shopping. In addition, many variables are important in explaining <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> successful policy uploading. First, the country holding the Council Presidency needs to have the intent to upload its national policy and be committed to it, {{and it needs to be}} considered a superior option to the status quo. Second, being able to set the agenda, to shape policy content as well as possess a strong policy capacity contribute to <b>the</b> successful uploading <b>of</b> national policies. Although other variables may not be necessary for successful policy uploading to occur, they strongly influence it. The legal format the policy will take once it is adopted influences the willingness the other Member have to make compromises. The distinction is made between soft law and hard law modes of governance. Another variable making <b>the</b> uploading <b>of</b> national policy easier is <b>the</b> convergence <b>of</b> interests on <b>the</b> proposal. This is true under all decision-making rules, but it is especially significant under more restrictive decision-making rules such as unanimity. Finally, the stage at which the proposal is presented matters. The success cases in this study have taken place at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU policy process. ...|$|R

This means it stood out from <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> South Yemen which was known to be desert. In 1728 Abdulraheem Al-Sallami (member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Al-Sallami family who migrated from Sana'a) established <b>the</b> Sultanate <b>of</b> Lahij and started his own last name after his own name. Abulraheem was shorten to Abdali. This was also to make the distinction between Al-Sallami and Abdali, since not all Al-Sallamis are Abdalis and therefore not all Al-Sallamis were considered royalty, although they enjoyed and maintain amongst the highest tribal respect. <b>The</b> Sultanate <b>of</b> Lahej remained under Al-Sallami/Abdali control until the Cold War. While the 3rd world was beginning to be recolonized economically, the Sultante collapsed in 1967 after the British withdrew from Aden leaving The Abdalis and Al-Sallamis to fight the Russian-backed communist movement.

5000|$|Towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Jimmy Carter's <b>presidency,</b> and {{continued}} strongly through <b>the</b> subsequent <b>presidency</b> <b>of</b> Ronald Reagan, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States rejected disarmament {{and tried to}} restart the arms race through <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> new weapons and anti-weapons systems. <b>The</b> central part <b>of</b> this strategy was the Strategic Defense Initiative, a space based anti-ballistic missile system derided as [...] "Star Wars" [...] by its critics. However, the SDI would require technology {{that had not yet}} been developed, or even researched. This system would require both space and earth based laser battle stations. It would also need sensors on the ground, in the air, and in space with radar, optical, and infrared technology to detect incoming missiles. [...] During <b>the</b> second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, the Soviet economy was stagnating and unable to match American arms spending. The Soviets feared the SDI because the U.S. would have an edge if it ever came to nuclear war. Numerous negotiations by Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to come to agreements on reducing nuclear stockpiles, but the most radical were rejected by Reagan as they would also prohibit his SDI program. However, due to enormous costs and far too complex technology for its time, the project and research was cancelled.|$|R
40|$|Citation: Correll, Willett Ramson. Ethics of {{political}} parties. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1898. Introduction: "Any section {{of men who}} nominate candidates of their own for <b>presidency</b> and vice-presidency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, constitutes {{what is known as}} a political party”. There have been many political parties since the first was organized. There has been a constant struggle between them for supremacy. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time one is in the lead, and <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time is occupied by others. There have always been at least two great political parties in this country, and this fact perhaps accounts for the continuous rapid growth of this nation as compared with some others. History shows that <b>the</b> secret <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many political revolutions in France and the Spanish-American republics, have been caused by <b>the</b> want <b>of</b> two great political parties to check each other and Champion <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people. Wherever republics have fallen, the fall has been <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> struggle between minority parties. Without political parties, this nation would be helpless in <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> a president who would command <b>the</b> respect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation, and could have no legislation that would satisfy <b>the</b> ants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people; but while these parties seem essential to progress, and we as well as others, have progressed by them, do we conclude from this that while our people as a result of progressive evaluation, have risen from <b>the</b> lower depths <b>of</b> ignorance to a higher, and still higher standard of knowledge and morality, until they have reached the present high standard, that while all others things must either progress or die, our political parties have been perfect from the beginning, and {{do not need to be}} changed to suit the times and requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{looks at}} the {{strategies}} American presidents have used {{to communicate with the}} public in relation to the available media channels. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama are used as examples of successful communicators. In addition the thesis looks at <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass media in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States as well as its effects on <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b> <b>The</b> president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States is very much a symbolic figure because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multiple roles he performs. <b>The</b> public’s impression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> president is important, first in order for the candidate to get elected, then for the president to keep the job, and later to maintain a good reputation after the job is done. Image-making is dependent on a successful media strategy, but it is also affected by circumstances, unexpected turns <b>of</b> events, <b>the</b> press, the bloggers (today), and charisma. Franklin D. Roosevelt took over the presidency during a time of depression and served for three full terms. It was important for Roosevelt to restore the confidence in the people, and one way <b>of</b> relating to <b>the</b> public was through his fireside chats on the radio. Ronald Reagan’s <b>presidency</b> signaled <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> a new era in American politics. Reagan symbolized optimism and a new and controversial political agenda, {{especially when it comes to}} the economy. It is said that Reagan was born to be on TV and he is widely perceived as the first successful TV-politician. <b>The</b> ambiguity <b>of</b> Reagan’s popularity as a person in contrast to considerable opposition to his politics is particularly relevant to <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> image-making of a president. Barack Obama is <b>the</b> sitting president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, and considering his limited time in office he is perhaps best understood at this point in time as a candidate. Obama was labeled a “rock-star” politician early in his political career and quickly achieved a celebrity status. The campaign was a result of great grassroots organization and successful fundraising, especially by making use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet. President Obama promised change and “yes we can” proved to have resonance in the American public. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass media has created increased communication as well as immediate communication. This development forms both challenges and increased possibilities when it comes to <b>the</b> image-making <b>of</b> <b>the</b> president who forever strives to connect to the public...|$|R
