25|$|In linguistics, antisymmetry is {{a theory}} of {{syntactic}} linearization presented in Richard Kayne's 1994 monograph The Antisymmetry of Syntax. The crux of this theory is that hierarchical structure in natural language maps universally onto a <b>particular</b> <b>surface</b> linearization, namely specifier-head-complement branching order. The theory derives a version of X-bar theory. Kayne hypothesizes that all phrases whose surface order is not specifier-head-complement have undergone movements that disrupt this underlying order. Subsequently, {{there have also been}} attempts at deriving specifier-complement-head as the basic word order.|$|E

If the specimen warrants further analysis, Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the SAM or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover.|$|E

2500|$|Roughly, {{a surface}} {{is a set}} of points with a local topological {{structure}} of a disc. Surfaces fall into two infinite families: the orientable surfaces include the sphere, the torus, the double torus and so on; the nonorientable surfaces include the real projective plane, the Klein bottle and so on. A graph embeds on a surface if the graph can be drawn on the surface as a set of points (vertices) and arcs (edges) that do not cross or touch each other, except where edges and vertices are incident or adjacent. [...] A graph is planar if it embeds on the sphere. If a graph G embeds on a <b>particular</b> <b>surface</b> then every minor of G also embeds on that same surface.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the present article is the study of duals of {{functional}} codes on algebraic surfaces. We give a direct geometrical description of them, using differentials. Even if this geometrical description is less trivial, it can be regarded as a natural extension to surfaces of the result asserting that the dual of a functional code CL(D,G) on a curve is the differential code CΩ(D,G). We study the parameters of such codes and state a lower bound for their minimum distance. Using this bound, one can study some examples of codes on <b>surfaces,</b> and in <b>particular</b> <b>surfaces</b> with Picard number 1 like elliptic quadrics or some <b>particular</b> cubic <b>surfaces.</b> The parameters of some of the studied codes reach those of the best known codes up to now...|$|R
