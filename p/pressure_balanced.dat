40|$|In {{order to}} obtain more {{accurate}} measurements, the use of <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> with the controlled-clearance system {{is well known in}} the history of high pressures metrology. Furthermore, the introduction of assemblies with cylinders made up of two materials to the construction of controlled-clearance <b>pressure</b> <b>balances,</b> {{is one of the most}} important developments in the field of high pressure measurements. The use of some analytical procedures for the characterization of the <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> (also known as piston gauges) becomes more difficult especially for the case of geometries with composite cylinders. Those geometries were also studied with the analytical method developed by the author[1] (based on a simplified model) and described in this paper. This method was also reported in some not original publications from 2003 to 2007. The analysis begins with the mathematical model of thick-walled cylinder applied to the Mechanical theory of elastic equilibrium for the formulation of the so called Simplified Elastic Theory which represents an analytical approach for the study of <b>pressure</b> <b>balances.</b> This analysis is known as the Lame' problem. The solution of the Lame' Problem is used to determine the pressure distortion coefficient for the controlled-clearance <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> including the case of <b>pressure</b> <b>balances</b> with the cylinder made up of two materials.

50|$|Balanced {{pressure}} molding using fluid as {{the heat}} transfer is commercially practiced as the 'quickstep' process. This process, however, lacks the high pressures of RTM or autoclave curing so does not typically achieve {{the high quality}} associated with aerospace and autoclave curing. This process allows for the curing, partial curing, and joining of composite materials. The process involves a fluid-filled, <b>pressure</b> <b>balanced,</b> heated floating mould technology. The heated floating mold technology used within the process works by rapidly applying heat to the laminate which is trapped between a free floating rigid or semi-rigid mold that floats in, and is surrounded by, a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The mold and laminate become separated from the circulating HTF by a flexible membrane. The part, typically under full vacuum, is subject to less than 3 psi (20 kPa) fluid pressure and can be rapidly heated to the desired cure temperature without risk of catastrophic exothermic reaction. The air is then removed under vacuum and the laminate is compacted and heated until the part is cured.|$|E

40|$|The role of cosmic-ray-modified contact {{discontinuities}} and <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> {{structures in}} two-fluid cosmic-ray hydrodynamics in one Cartesian space dimension are investigated {{by means of}} analytic and numerical solution examples, {{as well as by}} weakly nonlinear asymptotics. The fundamental wave modes of the two-fluid cosmic-ray hydrodynamic equations in the long-wavelength limit consist of the backward and forward propagating cosmic-ray-modified sound waves, with sound speed dependent on both the cosmic-ray and thermal gas pressures; the contact discontinuity; and a <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> mode in which the sum ofthe cosmic ray and thermal gas pressure perturbations is zero. The <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> mode, like the contact discontinuity is advected with the background flow. The interaction of the <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> mode with the contact discontinuity is investigated by means of the method of multiple scales. The thermal gas and cosmic-ray pressure perturbations satisfy a linear diffusion equation, and entropy perturbations arising from nonisentropic initial conditions for the thermal gas are frozen into the fluid. The contact discontinuity and <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> eigenmodes both admit nonzero perturbations in the thermal gas, whereas the cosmic-ray-modified sound waves are isentropic. The total entropy perturbation is shared between the contact discontinuity and <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> eigenmodes, and examples are given {{in which there is a}} transfer of entropy between the two modes. In particular, N-wave type density disturbances are obtained which arise as a result of the entropy transfer between the two modes. A weakly nonlinear geometric optics perturbation expansion is used to study the long timescale evolution of the short-wavelength entropy wave and the thermal gas sound waves in a slowly varying, large-scale background flow. The weakly nonlinear geometric optics expansion is also used to generalize previous studies of squeezing instability for short-wavelength sound waves in the two fluid model, by including a weakly nonlinear wave steepening term that leads to shock formation, as well as the effect of long time and space dependence of the background flow. Implications of cosmic-ray-modified <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> structures and contact discontinuities in models of the interaction of traveling interplanetary shocks and compression and rarefraction waves with the solar wind termination shock are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> at the {{magnetopause}} {{is formed}} by magnetic field and plasma in the magnetosheath, on one side, {{and inside the}} magnetosphere, on the other side. In the approach of dipole earth's magnetic field configuration and gas-dynamics solar wind flowing around the magnetosphere, the <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> predicts that the magnetopause distance R depends on solar wind dynamic pressure Pd as a power low R ~ Pd^alpha, where the exponent alpha=- 1 / 6. In the real magnetosphere the magnetic filed is contributed by additional sources: Chapman-Ferraro current system, field-aligned currents, tail current, and storm-time ring current. Net contribution of those sources depends on particular magnetospheric region and varies with solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity. As a result, the parameters of <b>pressure</b> <b>balance,</b> including power index alpha, depend on both the local position at the magnetopause and geomagnetic activity. In addition, the <b>pressure</b> <b>balance</b> can be affected by a non-linear transfer of the solar wind energy to the magnetosheath, especially for quasi-radial regime of the subsolar bow shock formation proper for the interplanetary magnetic field vector aligned with the solar wind plasma flow.
