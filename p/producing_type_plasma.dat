While α-enolase {{was found to}} be increased in the plasma of patients with tumours of quite different origin, γ-enolase apparently reflected malignancies of the neuroendocrine System. Before the beginning of the cytotoxic therapy γ-enolase was increased above the upper limit of the reference r nge (10 μg/l) in 27 / 27 patients (100 %) suffering from small cell lung cancer. Most patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung or with prostatic cancer exhibited normal γ-enolase, while both tumour <b>types</b> <b>produced</b> high <b>plasma</b> substance concentrations of the a-isoenzymes of enolase.

40|$|Fresh {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} can harbor large and diverse populations of bacteria. However, {{most of the work}} on produce-associated bacteria has focused on {{a relatively small number of}} pathogenic bacteria and, as a result, we know far less about the overall diversity and composition of those bacterial communities found on produce and how the structure of these communities varies across <b>produce</b> <b>types.</b> Moreover, we lack a comprehensive view of the potential effects of differing farming practices on the bacterial communities to which consumers are exposed. We addressed these knowledge gaps by assessing bacterial community structure on conventional and organic analogs of eleven store-bought <b>produce</b> <b>types</b> using a culture-independent approach, 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Our results demonstrated that the {{fruits and vegetables}} harbored diverse bacterial communities, and the communities on each <b>produce</b> <b>type</b> were significantly distinct from one another.

The color features are reduced from eighteen to eight and texture features are reduced from thirty to five. A classifier based on Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is developed which uses reduced color and texture features to recognize and classify the different normal and affected agricultural produce. A feedback from classifier performance is used in reducing the features. The average classification accuracies using reduced color features are 78. 08 % and 75. 17 % for normal and affected agriculture <b>produce</b> <b>type</b> respectively.
