The coelom, or body cavity, of Amphioxus lies, of course, {{as in the}} vertebrata, {{between the}} {{intestinal}} wall and the body walls, and, {{just as in the}} vertebrata, it is largely reduced where gill slits occur. But matters are rather complicated by the presence of an atrial cavity round the pharynx, which is not certainly represented in the vertebrata, and which the student is at first apt to call the body cavity, although it is entirely distinct and different from that space. The mutual relation of the two will become apparent after a study of Figures 10, 11, 12 (Sheet 21). Figure 10 gives diagrammatically a section of a very young stage of Amphioxus; P is the pharynx portion of the alimentary canal, coe. is the coelom surrounding it at this stage here as elsewhere; mt.c. are certain lymph spaces, the metapleural canals, between which a small invagination (i.e., a <b>pushing-in),</b> at., of the outer epidermis occurs; n.c. is the notochord, and s.c. the spinal cord. The gill slits, by which P. communicates with the exterior, are not shown. Next Figure 11 shows the invagination (at.) pushing its way in, and cut off from the exterior by a meeting of the body wall below. Note that at. is a portion of the animal's exterior thus embraced by its body, and that its lining is therefore of the same material as the external integument. In Figure 12, at. is developing upward, so that the true body hangs into it. Now imagine the gill slits perforated, as shown by the double-headed arrow in Figure 12. Figure 3, on Sheet 20, is a less diagrammatic representation of a cross-section of the pharyngeal region (vide Figure 1, Sheet 19). The student should compare Figure 3, Sheet 20, and Figure 12, Sheet 21. The atrium and metapleural canals are easily recognised in both. In Figure 3 the coelom is much cut up by the gill slits, and we have remaining of it (a) the dorsal coelomic canals (d.c.c.) and (b) the branchial canals (br.c.) in the bars between the slits. The atrial cavity remains open to the exterior at one point, the atrial pore (at.p.).|$|E
50|$|The pace {{continued}} on lap 2 with McGuinness increasing his lead with Guy Martin moving into second place and Steve Plater in third with the unfortunate Conor Cummins slipping down to 4th place. With pits-stops {{at the end}} of lap 2, John McGuinness now led by 10.79 seconds and set a new outright course record of 17 minutes, 21.29 seconds an average speed of 130.442 mph. A slow pit-stop by Conor Cummins caused by the chain on his 1000 cc Kawasaki caused him to slip down the leaderboard to sixth place behind the Honda of Gary Johnson. The TT Grandstand stop box was overshot by Keith Amor riding a 1000 cc Honda motorcycle on lap 2 incurring a 10-second race penalty. An engine mis-fire forced Keith Amour to retire at Ballacraine on lap 3. After <b>pushing-in</b> on lap 2 the 1000 cc Yamaha of Michael Dunlop retired at the pits and a further retirement at the TT Grandstand was the 1000 cc Kawasaki of Ryan Farquhar with an oil leak from a replacement TT Superstock engine. At Glen Helen on lap 3, McGuinness led Steve Plater by 7.91 seconds with Guy Martin in third place over 10 seconds adrift of the leader. The rest of the chasing pack at Glen Helen on lap 3 included the 1000 cc Honda of Gary Johnson followed by Conor Cummins, Ian Hutchinson, Ian Lougher and the triple 2008 Manx Grand Prix winner Dan Kneen making the top dozen competitors on his debut Isle of Man TT race. The local Isle of Man competitor Gary Carswell and the former winner of the Senior 1997 Manx Grand Prix crashed heavily at the jump at the exit of Ballacrye Corner and was evacuated to Nobles Hospital on lap 3 with foot, rib and knee injuries and a series of minor fractures.|$|E
40|$|Weathered rock mass {{can have}} thin weak zones or {{cavities}}. These weak zones or cavities {{may not be}} detected during conventional ground investigation because the drillhole investigation is limited and the weak zones are thin. This paper uses the recently developed DPM methodology to divide the DPM data into sub-processes such as pushing, pulling and drilling and builds criteria so that thin weak zones can be detected from the sorted DPM data. The method establishes {{the relationship between the}} drilling rate and its downward thrust pressure and the relationship between the <b>pushing-in</b> rate and its downward thrust pressure. Case studies are given to illustrate the detection method. The case studies demonstrate that the proposed method has good potential for accurately detecting thin weak zones in weathered granitic or volcanic rocks.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: the {{investigation}} of the rolls peculiarities in the cone rolls with parallel axles of the crescent-shaped items, and the development of the technological parameters of the items different typical dimensions on this base. Developed have been the design methods of: the crescent-shaped items in practically used parameters intervals; the power parameters in rolling in the cone rolls in steady modes with the metal lateral displacement accounted for, and in the process of catching with the machine tension to be considered. The formula for the design of the crescence radius has been offered. The programs for the design of the forces on the rolls and on the giuding wiring in the steady mode, and for the design of forces of pushing in the course of catching have been developed. The original devices intended for the experimental determination of forces on the guiding wiring in the steady mode and the force of <b>pushing-in</b> in catching have been dsigned and manufactured. The crescent-shaped items have been received in the experimental-industrial base of institute. The items with the preset radius of curvature, which have been used for the planet-traveller of the second generation, have ben made.

40|$|AbstractPopulation growth, {{enormous}} {{level of}} industrialization and urbanization, especially in cities, are constantly <b>pushing-in</b> the infrastructure {{and creating a}} jostling situation for consumption of resources, which areafter all in limited quantity. Thus indirectly leading to follow-up ill practices (i. e. power theft: {{in order to meet}} power demands) and uncomfortable situation (such as over crowded roads due to heavy population, utilising automobiles). Thus, in order to subdue the above stated problem wearer proposing a solution using intellect and modern technology by means of Automation and Information Engineering. This article deals with smart and secure city, where a framework is proposed to secure the resources (Electrical Energy), meet comfortable driving experience (by means of Advanced traffic channelling) and creating a safe and secure environment for all (by installing Camera based Security system). A smart city (also smarter city) uses digital technologies or information and communication technologies (ICT) to enhance quality and performance of urban services, by carrying out the track of ill practices such as Power theft and maintain security in public places. Also enabling us in providing better control over heavy traffic through diversion and channelling of traffic. The best part of proposed module is that it is centralised, thus controlled and managed over a single base station. Here all the peripherals of system module are into communication, and can be controlled as well as reports can be maintained. The objective of this framework is to stop the draining of resources and improve standard-of-living of city by delivering better services in various domains that are automation based...|$|E
