40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} six {{studies that have}} {{examined}} a new conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance, the measurement issues {{in this area and}} the relation networks <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. In particular, the studies address three issues which are fundamental to understanding the nature <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. Furthermore, an examination of these issues is essential if a fully comprehensive account <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance, which is currently not well specified, is to be gained. The first issue to be addressed is insularity and the multifaceted conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. This issue was investigated in Study One, whereby a new conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance was employed. The second issue here pertains to measuring the construct <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. This issue was investigated in Studies One, Two and Three. Study One introduced the Distress Intolerance Five Factor – Short (DIFF-S), as a parsimonious measure of the general factor and the five facets <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. Study Two supported the concurrent and construct validity and the test–retest reliability of the DIFF-S. Study Three suggested that the DIFF-S demonstrates an association with the Mirror-Tracing Persistence Task and the Cold Pressor Task. The third issue here is the relation networks <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance as they relate to other relevant constructs. This was investigated in Studies Four, Five and Six. Study Four suggests that there is an emphasis on neuroticism in predicting general distress intolerance and the majority <b>of</b> the <b>distress</b> intolerance facets. Study Five suggests the involvement of attentional networks and directed attention {{in the structure of the}} five facets <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. Study Six reveal that, retrospectively, the mechanisms of the family of origin and parental bonding are involved in the five facets <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. Overall, this thesis provides an advanced solution as to the conceptualisation and measurement issues <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance and also explores its relation networks...|$|R

Indeed, we find that the caring relations developed through social media often need to be cared for themselves. The article draws on online and interview data from a larger project investigating how practices of care and support are (re) configured in the mental health-related social media site Elefriends. Users have to negotiate the disruption of moving support online, as well as the possibility of becoming subject to a fragility in care, in which caring for oneself becomes bound up in the ambiguities of caring for others. We argue that understanding how experiences <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> are shaped by social media is essential for understanding the implications of the increased digitisation of mental healthcare...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{a recent}} set of {{influential}} papers, researchers {{have argued that}} residential mortgage foreclosures reduce the sale prices of nearby properties. We revisit this issue using a more robust identification strategy combined with new data that contain information on the location of properties secured by seriously delinquent mortgages and information {{on the condition of}} foreclosed properties. We find that while properties in virtually all stages <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> have statistically significant, negative effects on nearby home values, the magnitudes are economically small, peak before the distressed properties complete the foreclosure process, and go to zero about a year after the bank sells the property to a new homeowner. The estimates are very sensitive to the condition <b>of</b> the <b>distressed</b> property, with a positive correlation existing between house price growth and foreclosed properties identified as being in “above average ” condition. We argue that the most plausible explanation for these results is an externality resulting from reduced investment by owners <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> property. Our analysis shows that policies that slow the transition from delinquency to foreclosure likely exacerbate the negative effect <b>of</b> mortgage <b>distress</b> on house prices.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{documents the}} {{positive relationship between}} financial distress and equity issuance and shows that dilution explains the low stock returns <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> firms. When the cross-section of firms is sorted by degree <b>of</b> <b>distress,</b> the value-weighted mean of the monthly net issuance rate increases significantly from 0. 05 % for the safest decile portfolio to 0. 95 % for the highest. Moreover, the low returns <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> firms are found only in past net issuers. The primary source <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> equity issuances is discounted private issuances. Unlike earlier empirical studies that focus on returns to existing shareholders, I find that firms that issue equity privately do not underperform when returns of existing and new shareholders are combined. I also show that many managers avoid shareholder approval when issuing discounted equity by keeping the fraction of new shares just below the required 20 % approval threshold. These findings suggest that dilution explains the low returns <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> firms. ...|$|R

40|$|Clinical psychologists do {{not appear}} to be willing to talk about their own {{experiences}} <b>of</b> <b>distress.</b> This may be due to the scientist practitioner model that has dominated the profession for some time. Recently, there appears to be a shift towards a reflective practitioner model with a growing interest in personal and professional development which may provide a cultural shift. It is clear from the literature that psychologists’ own experiences <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> prior to training, influence their decision to pursue therapeutic careers. In addition to this, there is evidence that suggests that the life experiences of psychologists influences the theoretical orientations that they use in practice. The present study aims to address the gaps in the literature by exploring the influence <b>of</b> <b>distressing</b> experiences that occur before training and how these experiences influence the decision to train as a clinical psychologist. Furthermore, the present study aims to explore how experiences <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> influence the development of a clinical psychologist’s preferred theoretical orientation. Eight participants‘ accounts were analysed by using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The following four themes were identified; how experiences <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> influence the career pathway to clinical psychology, being a professional who has experiential knowledge <b>of</b> <b>distress,</b> how personal experiences <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> influence how clinical psychologists relate to clients and how distress influences the way change processes are understood.

40|$|We {{argue that}} risk premia affect the {{valuation}} <b>of</b> financial <b>distress</b> costs, because these costs {{are more likely}} to be incurred in bad times. We compute the NPV <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> costs using risk-adjusted default probabilities that are derived from corporate bond spreads. Because credit spreads are large, the magnitude of the risk-adjustment is substantial. For a firm whose bonds are rated BBB, our benchmark calculations show that the risk-adjusted NPV <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> is 4. 5 % of pre-distress firm value. In contrast, a valuation <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> costs that ignores risk premia produces an NPV <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> <b>of</b> 1. 4 %. The risk adjustment also increases the marginal effect <b>of</b> leverage on <b>distress</b> costs. We show that risk-adjusted, marginal distress costs can be of similar magnitude as the marginal tax benefits of debt derived by Graham (2000). Thus, distress risk premia can help explain why firms appear rather conservative in their use of debt...|$|R

Macroeconomic fundamentals, currency crisis vulnerability, credit risk of banks and companies, asset price bubbles, credit growth, and the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> <b>of</b> other economies {{in the region are}} found to be important leading indicators <b>of</b> banking <b>distress</b> in the home economy. The predictive <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the model is reasonably good. A case study of Hong Kong based on the latest estimate <b>of</b> banking <b>distress</b> probability and stress testing results shows that currently the banking sector in Hong Kong is healthy and should be able to withstand well certain possible adverse shocks. Under some extreme shocks originating from real GDP growth and property prices such as those that occurred during the Asian financial crisis, the model indicates a non-negligible risk of an occurrence <b>of</b> banking <b>distress</b> in Hong Kong. However, the chances of the occurrence of such severe events are extremely low. Simulation results also suggest that compared to the period before the Asian financial crisis, the local banking sector is currently more capable of withstanding shocks similar to those that occurred during that crisis. The study also finds that banking distress is contagious, suggesting that to be effective in monitoring banking distress, close cooperation between central banks should be in place.
