40|$|Introduction: The {{etiology}} of pulmonary infections in HIV patients {{is determined by}} several variables including geographic region and availability of antiretroviral therapy. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted from 2012 to 2016 to evaluate the occurrence of pulmonary fungal infection in HIV-patients hospitalized due to pulmonary infections. Patients’ serums were tested for (1 – 3) -β-D-Glugan, galactomannan, and lactate dehydrogenase. The association among the variables was analyzed by univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Results: 60 patients {{were included in the}} study. The patients were classified in three groups: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (19 patients), community-acquired pneumonia (18 patients), and other infections (23 patients). The overall mortality was 13. 3 %. The time since diagnosis of HIV infection was shorter in the <b>pneumocystosis</b> group (4. 94 years; p =  0. 001) than for the other two groups of patients. The multivariate analysis showed that higher (1 - 3) -β-D-Glucan level (mean: 241  pg/mL) and lactate dehydrogenase (mean: 762  U/L) were associated with the diagnosis of <b>pneumocystosis.</b> <b>Pneumocystosis</b> was the aids-defining illness in 11 out of 16 newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients.

Methods Medical records of 660 HIV-infected patients with baseline CD 4 counts Results The incidence rate of <b>pneumocystosis</b> after HAART was 2. 81 per 100 person-years among 521 patients {{who did not}} initiate prophylaxis or had early discontinuation of prophylaxis, which was significantly higher than the incidence rate of 0. 45 per 100 person-years among 139 patients who continued prophylaxis until CD 4 counts increased to ≧ 200 cells/μL (adjusted risk ratio, 5. 32; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 18, 23. 94). Among the 215 patients who had early discontinuation of prophylaxis after achievement of undetectable plasma HIV RNA load, the incidence rate of <b>pneumocystosis</b> was reduced to 0. 31 per 100 person-years, which was {{similar to that of the}} patients who continued prophylaxis until CD 4 counts increased to ≧ 200 cells/μL (adjusted risk ratio, 0. 63; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 03, 14. 89). Conclusions Compared with the risk of <b>pneumocystosis</b> among patients who continued prophylaxis until CD 4 counts increased to ≧ 200 cells/μL after HAART, the risk was significantly higher among patients who discontinued prophylaxis when CD 4 counts remained < 200 cells/μL, while the risk could be reduced among patients who achieved undetectable plasma HIV RNA load after HAART. </p...|$|E

Rats latently infected with Pneumocystis carinii were immunosuppressed by corticosteroids for 7 weeks, and the drugs were administered from the initiation of the corticosteroid treatment. At week 5, the rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with the RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii. Infections were monitored by the counting of P. carinii cysts in lung homogenates and the titration of T. gondii in organs by quantitative culture and an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Fourteen of the 15 untreated rats died after T. gondii challenge, with P. carinii infection in the lungs and T. gondii infection in the lungs, liver, spleen, and brain.

From January 1, 2001, to December 30, 2002, HIV-positive patients older than 14 were evaluated at a hospital in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Patients with respiratory symptoms for seven days or longer, with a normal or abnormal chest X-ray, and those without respiratory symptoms but with an abnormal chest X-ray, were included in the study. All patients were submitted to clinical, radiological and laboratory evaluation, after which induced sputum and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage were carried out. The samples were subjected to the following techniques: Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen staining, quantitative culture growth for pyogenic bacteria, direct staining for fungi, culture growth for mycobacteria and fungi, and Grocott-Gomori staining for Pneumocystis jiroveci, as well as total and differential cell counts. The samples with P. jiroveci were selected, as well as the samples for which no etiologic agents were observed.

40|$|Pneumocystis carinii {{has been}} shown to cause extra-alveolar infections in humans, but the lack of a {{reproducible}} animal model has hindered the elucidation of mechanisms of P. carinii dissemination. In the present study, PCR and the immunosuppressed rat model were used to gain further insight into the dissemination of P. carinii organisms in extrapulmonary (EP) tissues. Primer sequences specific to major surface glycoprotein (MSG) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) were used to detect P. carinii in lungs and EP tissues. Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped into two classes: one group included rats that had primary episodes of <b>pneumocystosis</b> and the other group included rats that had undergone treatment for P. carinii infection and that had second episodes of <b>pneumocystosis.</b> PCR analysis with MSG primers with tissues obtained from both groups of rats showed the presence of P. carinii DNA in adrenal tissue, bone marrow, blood, and heart, kidney, liver, lymph node, spleen, and thyroid tissues. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was carried out with DHFR primers with lung, spleen, heart, kidney, and liver tissues from both groups of rats. Only those tissues that showed a positive PCR result and hybridization signal for the MSG gene were used for the RT-PCR experiments. RT-PCR analysis showed that the P. carinii DHFR gene is actively transcribed in these tissues, thereby indicating the presence of viable P. carinii organisms in EP tissues. Our observations suggest that P. carinii dissemination is influenced by factors other than P. carinii chemotherapy and that heavy organism load and destruction of lung tissue may contribute to the dissemination of P. carinii.
