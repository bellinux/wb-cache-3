500|$|These {{physical}} variations {{create a}} distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire {{a reputation as}} a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude— above sea level—is responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's <b>park</b> <b>effect</b> in the major leagues. Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in. The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball [...] into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.|$|E

40|$|National audienceThis paper aims {{to provide}} {{guidelines}} for designing {{the layout of}} arrays of oscillating Wave EnergyConverters (WECs) based on {{a review of the}} literature of wave interactions and <b>park</b> <b>effect</b> in WEC arraysthat has been published over the past 30 years. First, the fundamentals of wave energy absorption by oscillating bodies are summarised, and theprincipal differences between the <b>park</b> <b>effect</b> in arrays of wave energy converters and wind turbinesare highlighted. Then, the numerical approaches commonly used to deal with WEC arrays are outlinedbriefly and their limitations are discussed. It is argued that, at present, only Boundary ElementMethods (BEM) are capable of the appropriate analysis. Finally, previous work on wave interactionsand <b>park</b> <b>effect</b> in WEC arrays is reviewed. Similar trends are found in these studies, which allowconclusions to be drawn regarding the significance of the <b>park</b> <b>effect</b> as a function of the number ofWECs in the array and their spacing. Based on these conclusions, the following tentative guidelines areproposed:For small arrays of conventional devices (fewer than 10 devices of typical dimension 10 e 20 m) withusual layouts (regular or shifted grids with separating distance of order 100 e 200 m), the park effectappears to be negligible. For larger arrays (more than 10 devices), a negative <b>park</b> <b>effect</b> seems to beincreasingly important with increasing number of rows (the lines of WECs perpendicular to the incidentwave direction). Therefore, the number of rows should remain as small as possible, with a separatingdistance as large as possible. For arrays of non-conventional WECs (WECs of typical dimensions muchlarger than 10 e 20 m), no information has been found. However, trends similar to the previous casescould be expected, provided that aspect ratios are maintained...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyse the {{heterogeneous}} effect of Science and Technology Parks (STPs) on firms’ innovation outcomes, contingent on firms’ size and innovation effort. Despite the worldwide diffusion of STPs and the increasing literature aimed at analyzing their effect on tenants’ performance, empirical evidence on the heterogeneous effect of STPs location on different firms is very scarce. We use information for {{a representative sample of}} 39, 722 Spanish firms, 653 of them located on 22 of the 25 official Spanish STP. Results show, on the one hand, that firm size is negatively related to an STP location effect and, on the other, that only a small amount of internal innovation effort is required to achieve a very high return from park location. However, firms without innovation efforts do not benefit from a park location. Finally, as internal innovation efforts increase, the <b>park</b> <b>effect</b> reduces, but is still at a high level. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{condenses}} various modeling {{techniques for}} different Point Absorber configurations. An alternating frequency - time domain model is implemented in Matlab-FORTRAN {{in order to}} compute the displacement, velocities and the power absorbed in the heave mode for both single and multiple body configurations. Coupling of different degrees of freedom are merely contemplated with regard to a single buoy motion. NEMOH and BEMIO solvers are applied in the solution of Newtons second law according to the Boundary Element Methodology. Initially, this Wave-to-Wire model is validated through comparison with previous experimental results for a floating cone cylinder shape (Buldra-FO 3). A single, generic, vertical floating cylinder is contemplated then, that responds to {{the action of the}} passing regular waves excitation. Later, two equally sized vertical floating cylinders aligned with the incident wave direction are modeled for a variable distance between the bodies. In deep water, we approximate the convolutive radiation force function term through the Prony method. Using for instance triangular or diamond shaped arrays of three and four bodies respectively, the study delves into the interaction effects for regular waves. The results highlight the most efficient layout for maximizing the energy production whilst providing important insights into their performance, revealing displacement amplification-, capture width-ratios and the commonly known <b>park</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E

40|$|Air {{pollution}} levels (NO 2, PAHs, O 3) were investigated, before (BLE) {{and after}} (ALE) leaf emergence, {{in the urban}} landscape of Gothenburg, Sweden. The aims were to study the 1) spatial and temporal variation in pollution levels between urban green areas, 2) effect of urban vegetation on air pollution levels at the same distance from a major emission source (traffic route), 3) improvement of urban air quality in urban parks compared to adjacent sites near traffic, 4) correlation between air pollution and noise in a park. O 3 varied little over the urban landscape. NO 2 varied strongly and was higher in situations strongly influenced by traffic. Four PAH variables were included: total PAH, total particle-bound PAH, the quantitatively important gaseous phenanthrene and the highly toxic particle-bound benzo(a) pyrene. The variation of PAHs was similar to NO 2, but for certain PAHs the difference between highly and less polluted sites was larger than for NO 2. At a vegetated site, NO 2 and particulate PAH levels were lower than at a non-vegetated site at a certain distance from a busy traffic route. This effect was significantly larger ALE compared to BLE for NO 2, indicating green leaf area to be highly significant factor for air quality improvement. For particulate PAHs, the effect was similar BLE and ALE, indicating that tree bark and branches also could {{be an important factor}} in reducing air pollution. Parks represented considerably cleaner local environments (<b>park</b> <b>effect),</b> which {{is likely to be a}} consequence of both a dilution (distance effect) and deposition. Noise and air pollution (NO 2 and PAH) levels were strongly correlated. Comparison of noise levels BLE and ALE also showed that the presence of leaves significantly reduced noise levels. Our results are evidence that urban green spaces are beneficial for urban environmental quality, which is important to consider in urban planning...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters exploring the effect of school program and neighborhood environment on childhood obesity outcome using individual panel data set of Arkansas public schoolchildren. The first chapter (Section 2) investigates how the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), a program that provides funding for the distribution of free {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} to students in participating schools, affects childhood obesity. We combine matching methodology and difference-in-differences analysis to estimate the effect of the FFVP on childhood BMI outcomes. Estimates of the FFVP effect are sensitive to different matching methods. Methods that provide a good balance between treatment and control samples show that the FFVP program causes an economically meaningful reduction in the body mass index of participating children. Less strict matching methods yield insignificant results. The second chapter (Section 3) measures the effect of fast-food restaurant density around the residences of Arkansas public schoolchildren on BMI outcomes. We use the distance from the child 2 ̆ 7 s residence to the nearest US highway or interstate highway as an instrument for the density of fast food restaurants. The results show that the exposure of fast food restaurants around the home environment does have significant and positive effects on children 2 ̆ 7 s BMI z-scores. Our results also indicate that some subpopulations [...] children who are more affluent, rural, non-minority and female [...] are disproportionately affected by fast food proximity. Finally, the third chapter (Section 4) analyzes the effect of neighborhood parks around residences of northwestern Arkansas children on BMI outcomes. Our dataset covers the 2004 through 2007 period. To build comparative groups, we employ propensity score matching to measure the average treatment effect on the treatment group. The results indicate that proximity of neighborhood parks from the residence have a significant and negative effect on children 2 ̆ 7 s BMI z-scores in both the rural and urban areas, with some heterogeneity in the effects across gender. Specifically, our results show that girls in urban and rural areas are significantly influenced by neighborhood parks. The <b>park</b> <b>effect</b> is significant for boys in rural areas but not for boys in urban areas...|$|E
