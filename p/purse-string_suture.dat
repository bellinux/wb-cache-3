40|$|To reduce leakage of peritoneal {{dialysis}} fluid, insertion of a 2 -cuff Tenckhoff catheter (TeC) was performed under local anaesthesia by a lateral approach on 30 occasions in 26 patients. Incision was 3 cm laterally of the linea alba. The inner cuff of the TeC was fixed by a <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> of the peritoneal membrane on the abdominal {{side of the}} cuff and another <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture,</b> of the inner fascial blade, around the distal end of the cuff. A third <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> was placed around the TeC at the exit through the outer fascial blade. A subcutaneus tunnel completed the insertion. In all patients, dialysis was started immediately after TeC insertion. The median treatment time was 6. 5 months (range 3 days- 15 months).

40|$|An {{experience}} with 31 patients who developed major bleeding diatheses during laparotomy was reviewed. Management {{of the initial}} 14 patients was by standard hematologic replacement, completion of all facets of operation, and then closure of the peritoneal cavity, usually with suction drainage; only one patient survived. The subsequent 17 patients had laparotomy terminated {{as rapidly as possible}} to avoid additional bleeding. Major vessel injuries were repaired; ends of resected bowel were ligated; and holes in other gastrointestinal segments and the bladder were closed by <b>purse-string</b> <b>sutures.</b> One patient had a ureter ligated. Laparotomy pads (4 - 17) were then packed within the abdomen to effect tamponade, and the abdomen was closed under tension without drains or stomata. Following correction of the coagulopathy, the abdomen was re-explored at 15 to 69 hours in the 12 survivors. Definitive surgery then was completed: bowel resection and reanastomosis; ureter reimplantation; drains for bile, pancreatic juice, and urine; and stomata for bowel or urine diversion or decompression. Eleven of 17 patients, deemed to have a lethal coagulopathy, survived. This technique of initial abortion of laparotomy, establishment of intra-abdominal pack tamponade, and then completion of the surgical procedure once coagulation has returned to an acceptable level has proven to be lifesaving in previously non-salvageable situations...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to simplify the procedure by using an irrigated bipolar radiofrequency ablation device on the beating heart without cardiopulmonary bypass. MethodsSix domestic pigs underwent median sternotomy. The pulmonary veins were circumferentially ablated. Electrical isolation was confirmed by pacing. Eight lesions were performed epicardially, and three lesions were performed through <b>purse-string</b> <b>sutures</b> with one of the jaws of the device introduced into the right atrium. After 30 days, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess atrial function, pulmonary vein anatomy, and coronary artery patency. Cholinergic stimulation and burst pacing were administered to induce atrial fibrillation. Histologic assessment of the heart was performed after the animal was killed. ResultsA modified Cox maze procedure was successfully performed with the irrigated bipolar radiofrequency device with no deaths. In every instance, the pulmonary veins were electrically isolated. Cholinergic stimulation with burst pacing failed to produce atrial fibrillation. Imaging studies revealed tricuspid regurgitation without evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis, coronary artery stenosis, or intra-atrial thrombus. Total atrial ejection fraction was 16. 9 % ± 7. 5 %, a significant reduction. Histologically, 99 % of the lesions were transmural, and there was no evidence of coronary sinus injury. ConclusionLesions on both the right and left atria can be created successfully on the beating heart with irrigated bipolar radiofrequency. The great majority of lesions with this device were transmural. This device should not be used on valvular tissue...|$|R
40|$|Background. Malfunction of the peritoneal {{catheter}} is {{a frequent}} complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Videolaparoscopy is a minimal invasive technique that allows rescue therapy of malfunctioning catheters and consecutive immediate resumption of PD. Furthermore, Tenckhoff catheters can be safely posi-tioned in patients with previous abdominal surgery. We analysed the clinical diagnosis, videolaparoscopic treatment and the outcome of PD patients on whom videolaparoscopic interventions had been performed at our centre. Methods. Thirty-two cases of videolaparoscopic inter-ventions were performed for salvage of malfunctioning peritoneal catheters, implantation and abdominal surgical interventions in 25 PD patients. The video-laparoscope was inserted through a mini-laparotomy site of 15 mm diameter which was closed with <b>purse-string</b> <b>sutures</b> {{at the end of}} the intervention. Results. Videolaparoscopy was used in 21 cases of catheter malfunction mostly due to omental wrapping (12 cases) and dislocation (five cases). In eight patients with previous surgical abdominal interventions, laparoscopic placement of the PD catheter was performed. In two cases the gall bladder was removed. One case of intestinal occlusion was evaluated lapa-roscopically in an attempt to minimize invasive surgery. Leakage of the peritoneal fluid presented the only complication caused by insufficient closure of one mini-laparotomy site. Minimal follow-up time of rescued catheters was 5 months. Videolaparoscopy prolonged PD catheter function by a median of 163 days (range 5 – 1469 days). Conclusions. Videolaparoscopy prolongs peritoneal catheter survival by treating directly the causes of malfunction. In patients with preceding abdominal interventions, the PD catheter can be placed safely even in cases necessitating surgical preparation like adhesiolysis...|$|R

Laparoscopy with its high magnification and easier access to the inner inguinal ring can be an alternative to open repair. We present our early experience on laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in two boys with repaired bladder exstrophy. The procedures were performed microlaparoscopically which is technically identical to procedures performed during standard laparoscopy with only difference is the exclusive use of small diameter scopes. Three ports {{were used for the}} procedure. The internal inguinal ring was closed with a regular 4 – 0 nonabsorbable monofilamentous suture in a <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> fashion in one case and N suture closure in the other case. Two boys, one year old and four months old respectively were operated with microlaparoscopically. Although postoperative follow-up in the first case operated with N suture closure, was uneventful, early recurrence occurred in last case operated with a <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> fashion. The microlaparoscopic approach in these inguinal hernia operations, is feasible with its nearly scarless healing, and the advantage of evaluation of contralateral side and prevents these unnecessary explorations...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Reconstruction {{of large}} defects in the {{temporal}} region {{can be performed}} with skin grafts or pedicled or free flaps. Results are often not optimal because of the patch of a skin graft, lack of availability of local flaps, and distant skin from free flaps. A technique for reconstruction of these defects with local tissue is {{presented in this article}} that uses superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) plication to allow wide advancement of a cervicofacial flap. METHODS: Once the defect is outlined, a face-lift-like skin incision is used to raise the flap. The SMAS is plicated with two <b>purse-string</b> <b>sutures</b> that relieve tension on the flap and allow maximal advancement. Thirteen face-lift SMAS plication flaps were used in 12 patients (mean age, 70. 2 years) after cancer resection, which was bilateral in one case. Defects up to 8 cm in largest diameter can be closed. In one case of an 8 × 6 -cm defect, a 1 × 1. 5 -cm skin graft was necessary. RESULTS: All flaps healed uneventfully, and no reoperation was necessary. Scars are almost completely hidden and the cosmetic result is satisfactory. The asymmetrical face-lift effect fades out within 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The face-lift SMAS plication (FLISP) flap allows reconstruction of large defects in the temporal region with a local flap providing an excellent cosmetic result and avoiding the need for distant tissue and multiple scarring. This flap provides an example of how reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery are complementary and can be mutually beneficial...|$|R
40|$|Staplers have {{improved}} {{the results of}} esophageal surgery, in our experience and in others experience, as esophago-enteric anastomoses have become safer and faster than when manual suturing is used. Probably {{one of the last}} problems in the stapler technique, especially in the thoracic area, is the performance of on adequate esophageal purse-string suture: an improper performance of this suture can cause a dangerous leak of the anastomosis. So, many surgeons, {{to reduce the risk of}} esophageal dehiscence connected with the esophageal purse-string, use either purse-string devices or alternative methods such as a second handsewn purse-string, U stitches of the esophagus, etc. We think that the risk of improper anastomoses after esophageal resection can be reduced if the need for the esophageal purse-string can be eliminated. This work shows our personal technique for performing esophagoenterostomy, especially in the thoracic area, using the new CEEA stapler (Autosuture) without esophageal <b>purse-string</b> <b>sutures.</b> According to the modified procedure the stapler anvil and the mini rod are introduced in the esophagectomy and a 2 - 0 thread is knotted around the CEEA mini rod. Then the esophageal mutilated part is closed by a linear stapler keeping a syringe needle, which contains the thread, through the linear suture. Then, using the thread as a pulling system, the surgeon makes the needle and the tip of the mini rod slide out of the esophageal suture. Now the surgeon can reassemble the CEEA and perform the anastomosis. There are many clinical reports that cite no leaks following circular stapled anastomoses across linear stapled closures...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study quantifies {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass preparation artefacts on mean systemic arterial pressures (mAP), mean pulmonary arterial pressures (mPAP) {{and their}} ratio (mAP/mPAP) {{in order to}} assess the usefulness of this ratio as a pharmacodynamic marker for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling studies. Materials and Methods: Fifteen anesthetized swine were monitored every minute before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Percent relative changes from pre-artefact values (and # 916;%) were used during anesthesia induction and stabilization (and # 916;% minute- 1 reduction rates). In addition, in some animals, amplitude and duration were recorded for the following procedures: sternotomy, pulmonary artery catheter installation, <b>purse-string</b> <b>sutures</b> and cardiac cannulations. Results: Isoflurane 5 % anesthesia induction effect on mAP, lasted on average 5. 3 +/- 2. 0 minutes at 5. 9 +/- 1. 9 and # 916;% minute- 1. Isoflurane 2 % anesthesia stabilization effect on mAP lasted on average 36. 0 +/- 8. 0 min at 0. 8 +/- 0. 9 and # 916;% minute- 1. During stabilization, no change in mAP/mPAP was observed (p= 0. 68). Average amplitudes of artefacts on mAP were 30 - 50 and # 916;%; almost twice those observed for mPAP and mAP/mPAP for the same manipulations (p< 0. 05). Pulmonary artery catheter installation artefacts lasted longer than those of other procedures (p< 0. 05). Average artefact duration was 4. 5 +/- 2. 5 minutes (n= 160). Conclusions: In isoflurane-anesthetized swine, mAP/mPAP ratio remains constant during anesthesia stabilization, unlike mAP and mPAP individually. Moreover, the ratio shows potential as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies involving CPB. [Arch Clin Exp Surg 2016; 5 (1. 000) : 13 - 20...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesSafe and {{effective}} device closure of ventricular septal defects remains a challenge. We {{have developed a}} transcardiac approach to close ventricular septal defects using a patch delivery and fixation system that can be secured under real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic guidance. MethodsIn Yorkshire pigs (n = 8) a coring device was introduced into the left ventricle through a <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> placed on the left ventricular apex, and a muscular ventricular septal defect was created. The patch deployment device containing a 20 -mm polyester patch was advanced toward the ventricular septal defect through another <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> on the left ventricular apex, and the patch was deployed under real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic guidance. The anchor delivery device was then introduced into the left ventricle through the first <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture.</b> Nitinol anchors to attach the patch around the ventricular septal defect were deployed under real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic guidance. After patch attachment, residual shunts were sought by means of two-dimensional and three-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography. The heart was then excised, and the septum with the patch was inspected. ResultsA ventricular septal defect {{was created in the}} midventricular (n = 4), anterior (n = 2), and apical (n = 2) septum. The mean size was 9. 8 mm (8. 2 – 12. 0 mm), as determined by means of two-dimensional color Doppler scanning. The ventricular septal defects were completely closed in 7 animals. In one a 2. 4 -mm residual shunt was identified. No anatomic structures were compromised. ConclusionsBeating-heart perventricular muscular ventricular septal defect closure without cardiopulmonary bypass can be successfully achieved by using a catheter-based patch delivery and fixation system under real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic guidance. This approach might be a better alternative to cardiac surgery or transcatheter device closure...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Timely {{diagnosis}} of the gastroduodenal perforation usually allows primary repair or resection. Treatment of a large gastric perforation is more difficult than the common duodenal ulcer perforation by plugging and usually requires agastric resection. On the other hand, gastric resection fora hemodynamically compromised patient in sepsis hasa high rate of anastomotic failure and mortality. Here, we described a practical surgical technique that can avoid emergency gastric resection in such situations. Presentation of case: A 83 year-old female admitted with peritonitis, severe sepsis and hemodynamic instability. After the {{diagnosis of}} hollow organ perforation and supportive therapy, laparotomy revealed a delayed and large (7  cm) gastric perforation. Instead of gastrectomy, we downsized the large defect {{by means of a}} <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> around the perforation and made it suitable for the application of omental plugging. Discussion: The patients with poor performance status who are not suitable for the gastric resection, a free omental plug fixation to the narrowed perforation area by a <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> can overcome the problem. Conclusion: This method can be keep in mind as a damage control surgery technique in the non-traumatic abdominal emergencies due to large gastric perforations...|$|E

30|$|Side-to-side linear esophagojejunostomy {{has been}} used by various authors with {{excellent}} results. An Italian multicenter study (Bracale et al. 2010) has shown that this approach is safe and feasible, with a low incidence rate of anastomotic leakage (6 %) and stenosis (3 %). These authors thus concluded that this procedure represents the best choice for reconstruction of the digestive tract after LTG. In the first 5 patients we performed this technique and, although we cannot provide definitive results because of the low number of patients, we did not register any intra- or post-operative complications. Nevertheless, side-to-side intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy is a time-consuming procedure given the need to close the entry hole through which the stapler has been inserted. Our average operative time was quite a bit longer than that reported by the Italian study (Bracale et al. 2010) (333 vs 249  minutes) and this was likely {{due to the fact that}} we used interrupted stitches with extracorporeal knot-tying to close the entry hole. Moreover, we found it difficult to introduce the linear stapler into the esophagus due to the risk of esophageal injury from the dissection of the space between the muscular layers and mucosa. For these reasons, we adopted the OrVil™ technique in the last 7 procedures. In this method, the transoral placement of the anvil simplified the anvil insertion procedure and there is no need to perform <b>purse-string</b> <b>suturing.</b> Furthermore, the intracorporeal stapling technique is not technically demanding due the use of a circular stapler and this, in our experience, significantly reduced the operative time in comparison with side-to-side linear esophagojejunostomy. We have successfully performed this procedure without conversion to open surgery or perioperative complications (e.g., leakage or stenosis) associated with the anastomosis.|$|R
40|$|ObjectivePercutaneous {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} has been performed clinically in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. Transfemoral retrograde valve delivery {{is limited by}} concomitant peripheral vascular disease {{and the size of}} the delivery system. We report on the alternative transapical approach that allows accurate antegrade placement of a catheter-deliverable aortic valve. MethodsOver a 2 -year period, 26 consecutive patients (84. 3 ± 6. 5 years) were treated at our center. Transapical aortic valve implantation was performed with 23 -mm and 26 -mm pericardial valves (Cribier–Edwards; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif) mounted on a stainless steel stent. A limited anterolateral incision, in the fifth intercostal space, was used to access the apex of the heart. The valve was crimped, placed into a 24 F sheath, and introduced into the left ventricle through <b>purse-string</b> <b>sutures.</b> Fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography were used to guide the catheter across the native valve and to direct deployment of the stent at the level of the annulus. During deployment, the heart was unloaded with extracorporeal support or with rapid ventricular pacing. The average logistic EuroSCORE-predicted risk for mortality was 36. 5 % ± 5. 8 %. ResultsAll valves were successfully deployed at the target. On echocardiography, all valves showed good hemodynamic function with only minor paravalvular leakages. The mean transaortic valve gradient was 6 ± 2 mm Hg. Thirty-day mortality was 15 % (n = 4). One patient died of perforation of the right ventricle and 1 of dissection of the aortic root. There were 2 cases of conversion to open surgery. In 2 patients, the left main stem was partially obstructed by the native valve and required stent angioplasty. ConclusionsInitial results of the transapical approach are encouraging. Long-term studies and randomized protocols will be required to further evaluate this procedure...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis study aims {{to report}} our {{experience}} using intraoperative device closure of secundum atrial septal defects and {{to evaluate the}} feasibility and clinical outcome of this technique. MethodsOne hundred patients with secundum atrial septal defects (mean age, 29 ± 16 years; age range, 5 – 71 years; mean weight, 54 ± 18 kg; weight range, 16 – 94 kg) underwent intraoperative device closure through a right minithoracotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass and fluoroscopy. A 2. 5 - to 3 -cm parasternal or submammary incision {{was made in the}} right third or fourth intercostal space. Exposed with a miniretractor, a specially designed plastic sheath loaded with the device was inserted through the <b>purse-string</b> <b>sutures</b> placed on the right atrium. Under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance, it was advanced through the atrial septal defect into the left atrium, and the device was deployed in place. ResultsThe procedure was successful in all patients, including 5 patients with double atrial septal defects. The maximum diameter of the atrial septal defect ranged from 5 to 37 mm (mean, 21 ± 7 mm). There were 61 patients with an atrial septal defect diameter of more than 20 mm, 16 of them with a diameter of more than 30 mm. The mean size of implanted devices was 25 ± 7 mm (range, 8 – 36 mm). Residual shunts were found in 9 (9 %) patients immediately after the operation. The complete occlusion rate was 95 % at discharge, 99 % at the 3 -month follow-up, and 100 % at the 1 -year follow-up. There were no other late complications during the follow-up period. ConclusionsIntraoperative device closure is a safe, cost-effective, cosmetic, and less-invasive operation of most secundum atrial septal defects. Follow-up results are encouraging. It can be considered an acceptable alternative to transcatheter closure or surgical repair...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Wound {{infection}} {{after an}} ileostomy reversal {{is a common}} problem. To reduce wound-related complications, pursestring skin closure was introduced {{as an alternative to}} conventional linear skin closure. This study is designed to compare wound infection rates and operative outcomes between linear and purse-string skin closure after a loop ileostomy reversal. Methods: Between December 2002 and October 2010, a total of 48 consecutive patients undergoing a loop ileostomy reversal were enrolled. Outcomes were compared between linear skin closure (group L, n = 30) and purse string closure (group P, n = 18). The operative technique for linear skin closure consisted of an elliptical incision around the stoma, with mobilization, and anastomosis of the ileum. The rectus fascia was repaired with interrupted sutures. Skin closure was performed with vertical mattress interrupted <b>sutures.</b> <b>Purse-string</b> skin closure consisted of a circumstomal incision around the ileostomy using the same procedures as used for the ileum. Fascial closure was identical to linear closure, but the circumstomal skin incision was approximated using a <b>purse-string</b> subcuticular <b>suture</b> (2 - 0 Polysorb). Results: Between group L and P, there were no differences of age, gender, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores. Original indication for ileostomy was 23 cases of malignancy (76. 7 %) in group L, and 13 cases of malignancy (77. 2 %) in group P.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{new method}} for the {{prevention}} of accidental dislodgment of long-term venous catheters involves the use of an exit site <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> that holds the catheter cuff in place before the ingrowth of fibrous tissue. This method is safe, reliable, easily reproduced, and does not require any additional incisions or anchoring devices. In our clinical practice, it has drastically reduced the number of accidental dislodgments. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 17 : 583 - 584, 1993) The use of long-term indwelling venous catheters: i for the administration of nutrition support or chemo- < therapy has become standard practice at most; i institutions. Primary catheter infection remains the most frequent complication after insertion of these devices. Catheter dislodgment, also a recognize...|$|E
40|$|Few {{situations}} are as vexing for vascular surgeons and their patients {{as the need}} for placement of permanent dialysis access when very few access sites remain viable. We recently encountered a patient who typifies this group. After venoplasty of the patient's right femoral and iliac veins, we placed a right superficial femoral artery to inferior vena cava 6 -mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Under fluoroscopic guidance, we placed the venous limb of the graft directly into the inferior vena cava using a 24 -French Gore thoracic aortic graft (TAG) introducer sheath. We secured the venous limb with a <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> at the entrance site in the femoral vein. A standard end-to-side arterial anastomosis was performed. The access has worked without issue for over a year at this point...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of a large {{pseudoaneurysm}} of the ascending aorta, originating from the <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> of the cardioplegia line which was essentially asymtomatic but was diagnosed during patient follow up for fever and elevated white blood count of unknown origin. During intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, a free floating tumor was localized in his right atrium which after removal appeared to be an infected embolus with excessive neutrophils and monocytoid cells interspersed with cell debris and fibrin. Material send for culture was positive for streptococci, whereas tissues cultures from the pseudoaneurysm were essentially negative. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an asymtomatic, non-infected aortic pseudoaneurysm which was accidentally diagnosed due to concomitant infection of an deep venous thrombus which had embolized into the right atrium...|$|E
40|$|Umbilical endometriosis {{infrequently}} {{presents to}} the plastic surgeon. As such, {{the diagnosis is}} difficult to make because it is often overlooked. The current report presents a 35 -year-old nulligravid woman with a six-month history of a firm, cyclically swelling lesion in her umbilical region. None of the signs characteristic of pelvic endometriosis except dysmenorrhea and a one-year history of infertility were present. Biopsy of the lesion revealed umbilical endometriosis (grade IV), and laparoscopy uncovered extensive disease. Monopolar cautery with coagulating current umbilical excision and reconstruction with a <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> was used. The results underscore {{the importance of a}} broad differential diagnosis for an umbilical lesion in a middle-age woman. They also highlight the importance of early recognition and appropriate surgical intervention to minimize morbidity and mortality associated with umbilical endometriosis...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} report of direct intrajejunal feeding in 1858 by Busch, ’ feeding jejunostomy has {{undergone}} sev-eral modifications. Delany et aF, 3 used a commercially available catheter marketed for central venous cannula-tion for creating the recent modification of feeding jeju-nostomy termed, needle catheter jejunostomy (NCJ). According to their technique, a seromuscular tunnel is created by inserting a 14 -gauge needle into {{the wall of the}} bowel through a 3 - 0 silk <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture.</b> The needle is then turned into the lumen of the bowel and approximately 10 inches of 16 -gauge Polyvinyl catheter is threaded down the jejunal lumen. After withdrawing the metal needle, the purse string is secured. At this stage the plastic hub of the catheter is amputated to enable the removal of the needle. The catheter is the...|$|E
30|$|We {{will present}} two cases with ovarian {{malignancy}} who underwent {{single incision laparoscopic surgery}} (SILS). Case one presented with 11  kg suspected borderline tumor. The young patient’s parents strongly requested {{minimally invasive surgery}} despite the risks of tumor content spillage which also existed in open surgery due to tumor size. She underwent a SILS port adnexectomy as the skin incision is larger than traditional laparoscopy. To minimalize tumor content spillage we made a <b>purse-string</b> <b>suture</b> on the tumor wall and aspirated the content. After removal, the peritoneal cavity was irrigated with saline. Pathology revealed mutinous borderline malignancy so we performed a SILS port laparoscopic intraperitoneal restaging procedure consisting of ascetic fluid sapling, multiple peritoneal biopsy, appendectomy, omentectomy. The second case suffered from epithelial ovarian cancer and underwent a SILS port transperitoneal lymphdenectomy and extraperitoneal para-aortic dissection.|$|E
