50|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{oxidation}}: dry oxidation and wet oxidation. During dry oxidation, dry oxygen is {{introduced into the}} <b>process</b> <b>tube</b> where it reacts with silicon. Dry oxidation is a slow process that grows films at a rate between 140 and 250 Ǻ/hour. It is typically only used to grow thin oxides (<1000 Å).During wet oxidation, water vapor is introduced into the heated oxidation tube. Because water molecules form hydroxyl structures, they diffuse faster in silicon dioxide and the oxide growth rate increases. The wet oxidation growth rate is 1000 to 1200 Ǻ/hour, so wet oxidation is the preferred method to grow thick oxides. The growth rate slows with increasing thickness, according to the Deal-Grove model.|$|E

The advanced barrier glass was achieved by the formation of a standard phosphorous glass treated with additional thermal oxidation immediately after deposition in the same <b>process</b> <b>tube.</b> The resistant layer is used as a barrier for the second diffusion after selective opening of the finger contact areas by screen printing of a SiO 2 etching paste. The process was applied for multicrystalline Elkem Solar SoG-Si wafers as well as for references from standard EG-Si. The achieved cell parameters were compared with cell results from a homogenous emitter process. While the efficiency was not enhanced so far due to the relatively high shadow loss of the selective emitter solar cells, the open collector voltage could be increased by up to 9 mV and the short wavelength spectral response increased slightly with this selective emitter.

The quality levels obtained were satisfactory, and casting was {{proven to be a}} feasible fabrication method for U - 10 wt. % Mo fuel slugs. Extrusion and liquid pouring were both investigated as methods of handling sodium to bond fuel rods. The extrusion technique was shown to be impractical because of difficulty in supplying a sufficient volume of sodium to fill the rod. Satisfactory bonding was obtained using the liquid technique.

These latter applications will require vast quantities of nanotubes at competitive prices to be economically feasible. Moreover, reinforcing applications may not require ultrahigh purity nanotubes. Indeed, functionalization of nanotubes to facilitate interfacial bonding within composites will naturally introduce defects into the tube walls, lessening their tensile strength. Current methods of aerosol synthesis of carbon nanotubes include laser ablation of composite targets of carbon and catalyst metal within high temperature furnaces and decomposition of a organometallics in hydrocarbons mixtures within a tube furnace. Common to each approach is the generation of particles {{in the presence of}} the reactive hydrocarbon species at elevated temperatures. In the laser-ablation approach, the situation is even more dynamic in that particles and nanotubes are borne during the transient cooling phase of the laser-induced plasma for which the temperature far exceeds that of the surrounding hot gases within the furnace <b>process</b> <b>tube.</b> A shared limitation is that more efficient methods of nanoparticle synthesis are not readily incorporated into these approaches.

The MCO is a stainless steel canister approximately 24 inches in diameter and 166 inches long with cover cap installed. The shell and the collar which is welded to the shell are fabricated from 304 / 304 L dual certified stainless steel for the shell and F 304 /F 304 L dual certified for the collar. The shell has a nominal thickness of 1 / 2 inch. The top closure consists of a shield plug with four processing ports and a locking ring with jacking bolts to pre-load a metal seal under the shield plug. The fuel is placed in one of four types of baskets, excluding the SPR fuel baskets, in the fuel retention basin. Each basket is then loaded into the MCO which is inside the transfer cask. Once all of the baskets are loaded into the MCO, the shield plug with a <b>process</b> <b>tube</b> is placed into the open end of the MCO. This shield plug provides shielding for workers when the transfer cask, containing the MCO, is lifted from the pool.

40|$|Background: Stromal {{fibroblasts}} {{are the key}} cell {{types in}} tumour stroma, that support angiogenesis, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. Therefore, inhibition of stromal fibroblasts activity might inhibit tumour growth. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) is a potent cytokine and {{has been used for}} the treatment of experimental fibrosis. However, poor pharmacokinetics and severe side effects prevented its clinical application. In this study, we hypothesized that specific delivery of IFNγ to stromal fibroblasts may be beneficial to inhibit the tumour growth. Since Platelet-derived Growth Factor beta receptor (PDGFβR) is abundantly expressed on stromal fibroblasts, we developed a PDGFβR-specific drug carrier (PPB-HSA) by modifying albumin with a PDGFβR-recognizing cyclic peptide to deliver IFNγ. Materials and Methods: The IFNγ was conjugated to PPB-HSA carrier via a heterobifunctional PEG linker and characterized with Western blot analyses and nitric oxide release assay in RAW monocytes. In vitro, PPBHSA- IFNγ was examined for its effectivity in 3 T 3 fibroblasts using wound healing assay, immunocytochemistry and qRT-PCR. To simulate fibroblastsinduced angiogenesis <b>process,</b> <b>tube</b> formation assay was developed in which conditioned medium from 3 T 3 fibroblasts (incubated with TGFb and IFNγ or IFNγ constructs) was added to the endothelial cells (H 5 V) and tubes formed were counted. In vivo, the effects of the targeted PPB-HSAIFNγ on tumour growth were determined in subcutaneous B 16 melanoma tumour model in mice. Treatments with vehicle, IFNγ, PPB-HSA-IFNγ, PPBHSA (n = 5 per group) at the equivalent doses (5 μg/dose/mouse) were administered intravenously. Results: PPB-HSA-IFNγ construct was successfully synthesized and the conjugated IFNγ retained its biological activity. The construct showed PDGFβR-specific binding in 3 T 3 cells which was blocked with anti-PDGFR antibody. The IFNγ construct significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of 3 T 3 cells as determined with wound healing assay. Treatment with the targeted IFNγ drastically reduced TGFb-induced collagen-I, alpha smooth muscle actin and fibronectin expression in staining and gene expression. Furthermore, the PPB-HSA-IFNγ inhibited the 3 T 3 fibroblastsinduced angiogenesis as determined with the tube formation assay in H 5 V cells. In vivo, the targeted IFNγ construct attenuated the tumour growth by 60 % (p < 0. 01) compared to vehicle whereas untargeted IFNγ and PPBHSA carrier did not induce any reduction in the tumour growth. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that specific targeting of IFNγ to the stromal fibroblasts using PPB-HSA carrier is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit tumour growth...|$|E

In addition, we have performed a scaled up pyrolysis using the preparative GC system that was described in a previous report. This instrument consisted of a packed column gas chromatograph (SRI 8010) with a TCD detector and injector valve equipped with a thermal desorber. Pyrolysis experiments were performed in a 6 ” tube furnace manufactured by Carbolyte. This programmable furnace has a 0. 5 ” diameter <b>process</b> <b>tube</b> that can hold 8 - 100 mg samples of peat or ion exchange resin. During sample heating helium stream sweeps products from the tube furnace to the carbosieve trap located in the thermal desorber unit. Volatile materials that are collected on the carbosieve trap can {{be transferred to the}} gas chromatograph by actuating the valve and activating the thermal desorption oven. Chromatography is initiated by thermally desorbing trapped volatiles from the carbosieve trap to the GC column (2 mm x 2 m, Porapak Q). The instrument was calibrated with by injecting methyl iodide into the thermal desorber trap. The response factor and retention time of methyl iodide were thus determined. Pyrolysis experiments with 8 - 12 mg of organic matter have been conducted using this experimental apparatus. Experimental results for a two series of incubations are shown in Figure 1. Results for experiments with a peat sample incubated at 40 oC and pH 4. 3 are shown. In addition, the results for a commercially available humic acid at pH 2 are presented. The low pH was used to prevent dissolution of the humic material. During this last quarter we have investigated the influence of pyrolysis temperature on the yield of methyl iodide. We have done experiments with the analytical pyrolysis unit described in previous reports and with the preparative GC. The results of these studies are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 and demonstrate optimum methyl iodide production at 400 oC. The peat (350 mg) was incubated in 20 mL of 2. 7 * 10 - 3 M KIO 3. The suspension pH was established with phosphate buffer and the sample was held in a constant temperature incubator.
