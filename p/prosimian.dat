5|$|The {{selective}} {{pressure that}} shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb {{has been a}} topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence {{can be seen as}} supporting a grooming function, food procurement function, or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although <b>prosimian</b> primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one grooming claw on each foot to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.|$|E
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other <b>prosimian</b> {{primates}} (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|Other {{distinguishing}} {{features of the}} false potto are in the dentition. Sarmiento notes, however, that captive specimens may develop abnormalities in the teeth and that some dental characters Schwartz uses are quite variable, sometimes even {{from one side of}} the same individual to another. The third upper molar (M3) is more reduced in the false potto than in any other <b>prosimian,</b> according to Schwartz, but Leon notes that western pottos also have a relatively small M3. The third upper premolar (P3) is also reduced, resembling the condition in the fork-marked lemurs (Phaner). Stump writes that small P3s are also common in western pottos, although the false potto's P3 is shaped differently. Groves notes that P1 is quite long, another point of similarity with the fork-marked lemurs. The lower premolars are compressed laterally in Pseudopotto, the cusps on the cheekteeth are higher, and the cristid obliqua (a crest connected to the protoconid cusp) is at a relatively buccal position (in the direction of the cheeks).|$|E
50|$|While {{primates}} {{are often}} thought of as fairly intelligent animals, the <b>prosimians</b> are not very large-brained compared to other placental mammals. Their brain-cases are markedly smaller than those of simians of comparable sizes. In the large-eyed tarsiers, {{the weight of the}} brain is about {{the same as that of}} a single eye. <b>Prosimians</b> generally show lower cognitive ability and live in simpler social settings than the simians. The <b>prosimians</b> with the most complex social systems are the diurnal lemurs, which may live in social groups of 20 individuals. The nocturnal <b>prosimians</b> are mainly solitary.|$|R
50|$|The order Primates was {{traditionally}} {{divided into}} two main groupings: <b>prosimians</b> and anthropoids (simians). <b>Prosimians</b> have characteristics more {{like those of the}} earliest primates, and include the lemurs of Madagascar, lorisoids, and tarsiers. Simians include monkeys, apes and hominins. More recently, taxonomists have preferred to split primates into the suborder Strepsirrhini, or wet-nosed primates, consisting of non-tarsier <b>prosimians,</b> and the suborder Haplorhini, or dry-nosed primates, consisting of tarsiers and the simians.|$|R
50|$|The <b>prosimians</b> have {{retained}} the primitive mammalian condition of a bicornuate uterus, with two separate uterus chambers. In the simians, the uterus chambers have fused, an otherwise rare condition among mammals. <b>Prosimians</b> usually have litters rather than single offspring, {{which is the}} norm in higher primates.|$|R
5|$|The single known tooth, a third upper molar (M3) {{known as}} T Li 41, is tiny, with {{a length of}} 1.29mm and width of 1.82mm. Mein and Ginsburg claim {{that it is the}} {{smallest}} known <b>prosimian</b> molar. The tooth is triangular in shape and shows a simple, reduced morphology. Three important cusps—the protocone, paracone, and metacone—are present, connected by a crest. They are low and rounded. The metacone, located {{at the back of the}} tooth, is closer to the protocone, which is on the front lingual corner (the side of the tongue), than it is to the paracone on the front labial corner (the side of the cheeks). The protocone is rounded on the lingual side and is attached to a weak crest on the front and back. On the front labial corner, a lengthy crest, the parastylar crest, is present, which includes a minor cusp known as a parastyle. Some wear is visible on the parastylar crest, and at the front of the tooth a contact facet with the preceding second upper molar is present. The tooth has a single, well-developed root, which contains a number of grooves, suggesting that it consists of three smaller, fused rootlets.|$|E

25|$|Rasmussen was a {{biological}} anthropologist {{who specialized in}} both paleontology and behavioral ecology. He studied primate evolution, utilizing his knowledge of both living and fossil primates.

5000|$|Simians emerged {{within the}} <b>Prosimians</b> as sister {{group of the}} haplorhine tarsiers, and {{therefore}} cladistically belong to this group.

500|$|... ?Nycticebus linglom was {{described}} in 1997 by French paleontologists Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg in {{a report on the}} fossil mammals of Li Mae Long, a Miocene site in Thailand. The animal is known from a single tooth, and on the basis of comparisons with other <b>prosimian</b> primates Mein and Ginsburg concluded that it is most closely related to the living slow lorises (genus Nycticebus). However, in view of the very limited material, they only tentatively assigned the fossil species to Nycticebus, using open nomenclature.

500|$|... ?Nycticebus linglom is {{a fossil}} strepsirrhine primate from the Miocene of Thailand. Known {{only from a}} single tooth, an upper third molar, it {{is thought to be}} related to the living slow lorises (genus Nycticebus), but the {{material}} is not sufficient to assign the species to Nycticebus with certainty, and the species name therefore uses open nomenclature. With a width of 1.82mm, this tooth is very small for a primate. It is triangular in shape, supported by a single root, and shows three main cusps, in addition to various crests. The absence of a fourth cusp, the hypocone, distinguishes it from various other <b>prosimian</b> primates.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the first}} taxonomic {{classification}} of lemurs, many {{changes have been}} made to lemur taxonomy. [...] Within the primate order, treeshrews (order Scandentia) were considered basal, <b>prosimian</b> primates—close relatives of lemurs—until the 1980s. Colugos, also incorrectly referred to as [...] "flying lemurs", were once considered lemur-like primates, but were reclassified as close relatives of bats, and more recently as close relatives of primates within their own order, Dermoptera. [...] Primates, together with their closest relatives, the treeshrews, colugos, and long-extinct plesiadapiforms, form the taxonomically unranked Euarchonta clade within the Euarchontoglires. Lorisids, some of which were originally placed in the genus Lemur by Carl Linnaeus, have since been moved into either their own infraorder (Lorisiformes) or their own superfamily (Lorisoidea) within Lemuriformes.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between known fossil primate families remains unclear. [...] A conservative estimate for the divergence of haplorhines (tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans) and strepsirrhines is 58 to 63mya. [...] A consensus is emerging that places omomyids as a sister group to tarsiers, eosimids as a stem group to simians (non-tarsier haplorhines), and Djebelemur, an African genus {{likely to be}} related to an early Asian branch of cercamoniine adapiforms, as a stem group to modern strepsirrhines, including lemurs. [...] In 2009, a highly publicized and scientifically criticized publication proclaimed that a 47-million-year-old adapiform fossil, Darwinius masillae, demonstrated both adapiform and simian traits, making it a transitional form between the <b>prosimian</b> and simian lineages. [...] Media sources inaccurately dubbed the fossil as a [...] "missing link" [...] between lemurs and humans.|$|E
500|$|Lemurs were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} have evolved during the Eocene (55 to 37mya) based on the fossil record, although molecular tests suggest the Paleocene (66 to 56mya) or later. Until recently, they were {{thought to have}} descended directly from the diverse group of adapiforms due to several shared postcranial traits, as well as long snouts and small brains. Although adapiforms also had lemur-like auditory bullae, a <b>prosimian</b> characteristic, they had smaller brains and longer snouts than lemurs. [...] There are also several other morphological differences. [...] Most noticeably, adapiforms lack a key derived trait, the toothcomb, and possibly the toilet-claw, found not only in extant (living) strepsirrhines but also in tarsiers. Unlike lemurs, adapiforms exhibited a fused mandibular symphysis (a characteristic of simians) and also possessed four premolars, instead of three or two.|$|E
500|$|Since {{their arrival}} on Madagascar, a biogeographically {{isolated}} island {{with a unique}} mammalian fauna, lemurs have diversified both in behavior and morphology. [...] Their diversity rivals that of the monkeys and apes found {{throughout the rest of}} the world, especially when the recently extinct subfossil lemurs are considered. Ranging in size from the [...] Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, probably the world's smallest primate, to the extinct [...] Archaeoindris fontoynonti, the largest known <b>prosimian,</b> lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate. [...] They went on to fill many niches normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, and large grazing ungulates. [...] In addition to the incredible diversity between lemur families, there has also been great diversification among closely related lemurs.|$|E
