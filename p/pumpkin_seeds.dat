After hearing of her grandfather Walt's death, Emma returns to her childhood home in Valleyville, Washington.

In his last letter, Walt instructs his granddaughter {{to find someone to}} take care of the farm. Emma's new neighbor Seth Cullen contemplates asking Emma for Walt's seeds so that he can enter the contest and win its grand prize, which would allow him to open his own automobile repair shop. Emma and Seth first meet when he is repairing her front door and she mistakes him for a burglar. During Walt's funeral, Emma learns that Walt was in debt. Bobby tells her that the entire debt must be paid by the end of the year or the farm will be foreclosed. Mayor Kyle Finster informs Emma that he intends to develop the land following its foreclosure.|$|E
40|$|Pumpkin is a leafy green vegetable; {{it belongs}} to the Cucurbitaceae family. <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil supplementation can prevent changes in plasma lipids and blood pressure. The present study was {{conducted}} to evaluate the protective effect of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil against cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of azathioprine. Oral administration of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil either before or after treatment of azathioprine was effective in the reduction of the frequencies of Mn-PCEs, decreased the DNA fragmentation, total sperm abnormalities and significantly increased sperm count, percentage of PCEs, and enhanced the ratio of PCEs to NCEs. However, random amplified polymorphism of DNA (RAPD) showed distinct differences in animal groups intoxicated with azathioprine before and after <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil treatment, which reflected a DNA protective effect of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil {{obtained}} from Cucurbita pepo {{has been shown}} to be useful for the treatment of nocturia in patients with urinal disorders in several western countries. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil from Cucurbita maxima on urinary dysfunction in human overactive bladder (OAB). Forty-five subjects were enrolled in this study. An extract of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil from C. maxima (10 g of oil/day) was orally administrated for 12 weeks. After 6 and 12 weeks, urinary function was evaluated using Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil from C. maxima significantly reduced the degree of OABSS in the subjects. The results from our study suggest that <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil extracts from C. maxima as well as from C. pepo are effective for urinary disorders such as OAB in humans...|$|R

They are about 1.5cm (0.5in) long, flat, asymmetrically oval, light green in color and usually covered by a white husk, {{although}} some pumpkin varieties produce seeds without them. <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>seeds</b> are a popular snack {{that can be found}} hulled or semi-hulled at most grocery stores.

25|$|Pumpkin seed oil, a {{thick oil}} pressed from roasted <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds,</b> appears {{red or green}} in color {{depending}} on the oil layer thickness, container properties and hue shift of the observer's vision. When used for cooking or as a salad dressing, pumpkin seed oil is generally mixed with other oils because of its robust flavor. Used in cooking {{in central and eastern}} Europe, it is considered a delicacy in traditional local cuisines such as for pumpkin soup, potato salad or even vanilla ice cream. Pumpkin seed oil contains fatty acids, such as oleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid.|$|E
25|$|Plant-based, or vegetarian, {{sources of}} Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seeds,</b> canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy {{vegetables}} such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 {{than any other}} known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While {{the health effects of}} low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{our study}} was to test the {{protective}} effect of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil against sodium nitrite toxicity in rats.

Results: The results indicated that sodium nitrite induced oxidative stress, lipids profile disorders, DNA damage and chromosomal abnormalities. The <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> oil has antioxidant effect; it improved levels of total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde and lipids profile. It also has antimutagenic effect; it decreased the DNA damage and structural chromosomal abnormalities.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the nutritional value and quality of the sorghum bread (kisra) supplemented with <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> kernels flour. Proximate analysis of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> kernels flour and production of Sudanese sorghum bread (kisra) supplemented with various ratios (5 %, 10 % and 15 %) of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> kernels flour were carried out. Energy values, contents of minerals and amino acids were determined for raw flour of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> kernels, sorghum flour and their supplemented kisra product. The most significant (P≤ 0. 05) effect of supplemented kisra was the increase in protein content from 10. 6 % for the control kisra to 12. 6 %, 14. 7 % and 16. 5 % for kisra supplemented with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> kernels flour, respectively. The contents of crude fiber, ash, moisture and fat of the supplemented sorghum kisra were also increased, but the content of carbohydrate was decreased as a result of supplementation. The replacement of sorghum flour with different ratios of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> kernels flour resulted in a concomitant increase in the energy value of the kisra produced. Minerals content significantly (P≤ 0. 05) increased especially K from 17. 07 mg/ 100 g in control kisra to 18. 5, 19. 6 and 20. 4 mg/ 100 g, P from 206. 1 mg/ 100 g in control kisra to 240. 6, 253. 6 and 266. 8 mg/ 100 g and Mg from 9. 6 mg/ 100 g in control kisra to 11. 6, 13. 8 and 15. 5 mg/ 100 g in kisra supplemented with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> kernels flour, respectively. Amino acids content of kisra supplemented with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> kernels flour also increased especially lysine from 24. 9 mg/ 100 g in control kisra to 55. 5 mg/ 100 g, 58. 7 mg/ 100 g and 64. 1 mg/ 100 g protein and thrionine from 38. 9 mg/ 100 g in control kisra to 56. 2 mg/ 100 g, 80. 9 mg/ 100 g and 85. 4 mg/ 100 g protein, respectively. The sensory evaluation revealed that the supplemented sorghum kisra was highly accepted by the panelists at 10 % <b>pumpkin</b> <b>seed</b> kernels flour supplementation.
