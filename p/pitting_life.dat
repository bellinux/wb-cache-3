40|$|In {{order to}} find the best {{combination}} of materials for reduction gears of marine turbines, the authors carried out an investigation on pitting using a disc machine. The resistance to pitting of wheel material was considerably affected by the work-hardening effect owing to rolling contact. Hard pinion material raised the resistance of wheel material to a great extent. The best result was attained by the combination of materials showing both the greatest work-hardening tendencies. The work-hardening tendency estimated by measuring the Meyer index served to predict the <b>pitting</b> <b>life.</b> The test results were discussed further based upon the theory of elastohydrodynamic lubrication...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{demands on}} the {{automotive}} industry to produce fuel-efficient vehicles has led the industry to explore different approaches, including reducing power losses and improving fuel efficiency of engines. The goal of this project has been to investigate the possibilities of reducing the frictional losses in drive axles and hypoid gears. In the literature, different ways of achieving low friction has been reported. However, before major changes {{can be made to}} commercial hypoid gear oils, a better understanding of their effect on the durability of transmission components has to be understood. The durability of gears includes many different failure modes. Macro-size contact fatigue (pitting) {{is one of the more}} commonly encountered and that ultimately limits the life of the components. In this work, experimental <b>pitting</b> <b>life</b> studies have been conducted using rolling four-ball and twin-disc test setups to analyse the impact of various gear oils’ physical and chemical properties on pitting during operation in the mixed lubrication regime. The results show that the frictional properties of the gear oils are the most significant in determining the <b>pitting</b> <b>life.</b> Enhancements in <b>pitting</b> <b>life</b> can be achieved in several ways, for example, by the choice of the base oil type, high viscosity oil, viscosity modifier type, and the tribofilms formed by anti-wear and extreme-pressure additives. Amongst these, all except high viscosity oils is compatible with the aim of reducing losses (load and load-independent losses). However, especially, the use of low friction type base oils or the low friction tribofilms formed by certain anti-wear and extreme-pressure additives have been found to be effective (with a slight preference for the latter) in improving <b>pitting</b> <b>life.</b> The results of these studies have been contained in five paper manuscripts and a brief gist of the work and salient results in each of these are briefly described below. Paper A: A range of different hypoid gear oils based on different base oils, viscosity levels, and friction modifying additives, were chosen for pitting studies. Each oil was characterized in terms of its physical properties and the pitting performance was analysed using a rolling four-ball test. The correlation between specific oil properties and pitting performance was analysed using multiple linear regression analysis. Paper B: In this, the used ball samples from tests with two of the oils tested in paper A were analysed to investigate the pit formation mechanisms. The worn surfaces and sub-surface materials revealed the differences in the behaviour of the two oils. Paper C. Based on the findings of paper A and B, a second batch of oils was prepared for investigations with a view to obtain low thin-film friction by the using different additives. The oils’ frictional behaviour was characterized in a ball-on-disc test rig. The pitting lives of two of these oils were measured using rolling four-ball tests and compared to two of the oils from paper A. Papers D and E: These two papers focussed on studies performed by using twin-disc rolling/sliding machine. The results confirmed that the trends and conclusions drawn from the rolling four-ball tests were relevant for gear contacts and enabled into optimising the gear oil formulation. Paper D deals with characterising of the frictional behaviour of several gear oils and identifying the two best performing formulations. In paper E, the pitting behaviour of the two oils has been analysed and compared to reference oil. Godkänd; 2015; 20150405 (jenjoh...|$|E

This work incorporates state of the art analytical and numerical models to evaluate kinematic error, load capacity, bending fatigue strength, and pitting. The geometric variables considered in this study include gear modulus, pressure angle, and tooth correction factor. The statistical analysis follows a three-level full-factorial design of experiments. Nonlinear dynamic simulation is accompanied by finite element analysis to estimate contact and bending stresses. Largest bending fatigue strength is also determined. Results demonstrate that gear modulus is the geometric parameter with prevalent influence on the kinematic error, and <b>pitting</b> <b>life</b> is rather high for all geometric variables considered...|$|E

40|$|Downloaded{{material}} elastic {{and fatigue}} properties, initial material defectiveness. A simple {{application of the}} model to determining fatigue (<b>pitting)</b> <b>life</b> of thrust and radial ball bearings is given. Bearing fatigue life besides the normal stress also depends on the residual and frictional stresses. It {{is a function of}} the maximum contact pressure, a certain combination of the normal, frictional and residual stresses as well as of the average initial defect size. More specifically, fatigue life is inverse proportional to a positive power of the maximum contact pressure and of the average initial defect size. The above power is directly related to a material fatigue resistance parameter. For a high enough compressive residual stress the fatigue life distribution exhibits the appearance of a fatigue limit. However, under the same operating conditions the same material for low compressive and tensile residual stress does not present the appearance of a fatigue limit. A qualitative comparison of the theoretical fatigue data with the test fatigue life data obtained for tapered bearings is presented...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{development}} of new machine tool concepts, gear honing {{has turned out to be}} a competitive process for exclusive machining of hardened gears. In Coroning or gear honing with electroplated diamond tools respectively, very low cutting speeds have to be mentioned as outstanding characteristics. Low thermal and high mechanical loads emerge which lead to high compressive residual stresses in the subsurface of gear flanks. Thermal damage can be avoided with high reliability and under all conditions. In addition, the process has high economic potential as exemplary comparisons of machining costs to reference processes have shown. The properties of the surface and the surface near material have turned out to be almost independent of a variation of process parameters. The specification of diamond tools constitutes one important parameter as an increase of the grain size effects increasing flank roughness. The diamond tools achieve high tool life quantity. Whereas the properties of the surface and the surface near material continuously improve iwth increasing tool wear, increasing tooth form errors and mechanical loads mark the criterions for end of tool life. Among the properties of the surface and the surface near material, the roughness exerts the main influence on pitting formation: With increasing flank roughness, a decrease of <b>pitting</b> <b>life</b> occurs.
