50|$|Rice is {{relatively}} immune to <b>propanil</b> but most weeds {{are susceptible to}} it. The reason for the selectivity is that rice contains {{a high level of}} the enzyme aryl acylamidase (AAA), which rapidly metabolizes <b>propanil</b> to relativity nontoxic 3,4-dichloroaniline. Susceptible weeds lack the gene(s) coding for the AAA enzyme and thus succumb to <b>propanil.</b> However, intensive use of <b>propanil</b> and natural selection have caused some weeds to become resistant to <b>propanil.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 2. The method {{according}} to claim 1 wherein the <b>propanil</b> is applied in a composition comprising <b>propanil</b> and an inert dilutent therefor {{at a rate of}} between 0.5 and 6 pounds of <b>propanil</b> per acre.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, {{the fact}} that <b>propanil</b> is a nonstaple product having no {{substantial}} use except in the patented process has been without significance at least since B.B. Chemical, and only serves to reinforce the conclusion that respondent is attempting to extend the patent monopoly to unpatented materials. Because <b>propanil</b> has no substantial noninfringing use, it cannot be sold without incurring liability for contributory infringement unless the vendor has a license to sell <b>propanil</b> or its vendee has an unconditional license to use the patented process. Respondent's refusal to license {{those who do not}} purchase <b>propanil</b> from it thus effectively subjects all competing sellers of <b>propanil</b> to liability for contributory infringement.|$|E
50|$|This case {{is part of}} the {{aftermath}} of Monsanto Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., in which Rohm & Haas succeeded in invalidating Monsanto's patent on <b>propanil,</b> a selective herbicide, by showing that Monsanto deceived the Patent Office in procuring the patent. <b>Propanil</b> thus became an unpatented product. With an estimated use of about 8 million pounds in 2001, <b>propanil</b> was one of the more widely used herbicides in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The claims {{describe}} the only substantial use for <b>propanil.</b> Rohm & Haas exploits the process patent by manufacturing <b>propanil</b> and {{selling it to}} farmers. Rohm & Haas does not license the patent to the farmers but they acquire an implied license to practice the process by operation of law when they buy <b>propanil</b> from Rohm & Haas, {{the owner of the}} process patent. Rohm & Haas does not license the patent to other manufacturers of agricultural chemicals, such as Dawson, which had been making and selling <b>propanil</b> for herbicidal use before Rohm & Haas received its patent. Dawson did not stop engaging in this business after the patent issued, and it sold <b>propanil</b> in packages labeled with instructions to use it as described in the patent. Accordingly, Rohm & Haas sued Dawson for contributory infringement and active inducement of infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(c)-(d). Dawson then requested a patent license but Rohm & Haas refused.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propanil</b> was {{the subject}} of several patent {{infringement}} suits. In one, Monsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co., the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that Monsanto committed fraud on the Patent Office in procuring its patent on <b>propanil.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Propanil</b> is {{a widely}} used contact herbicide. With an {{estimated}} use of about 8 million pounds in 2001, {{it is one of}} the more widely used herbicides in the United States. <b>Propanil</b> is said to be in use in approximately 400,000 acres of rice production each year.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Propanil</b> is made industrially by {{nitration}} of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1) to give 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (2), {{followed by}} hydrogenation of the nitro group with Raney nickel to give 3,4-dichloroaniline (3). Acylation of the amine with propanoyl chloride yields <b>propanil</b> (4). [...] The resulting product is white or brown crystals.|$|E
5000|$|He {{sees the}} result of the {{decision}} [...] "not as inherently unjustifiable as the dissent suggests." [...] To be sure, Rohm & Haas may choose to monopolize the sale of all <b>propanil</b> in the United States {{for the life of the}} patent, but <b>propanil</b> is not in widespread noninfringing use—it has no noninfringing use. Unless someone discovers another use, the monopoly and commercial value will coincide with the patented invention. Before the invention, <b>propanil</b> was worthless nec it had no commercial use. On the other hand, Hodgeman says the compromise made here may give Rohm & Haas too long an exclusive right: ...|$|E
5000|$|Monsanto {{obtained}} the patent by providing {{data to the}} Patent Office showing that <b>propanil</b> [...] "had [...] "unusual and valuable herbicidal activity" [...] and that its activity was [...] "surprising" [...] because [...] "related compounds possess little or no herbicidal efficiency." [...] Monsanto had conducted a number of tests and submitted test data to the Patent Office that indicated that <b>propanil</b> was superior to other similar chemicals, including one chemical that differed from <b>propanil</b> only in eliminating the CH2 group {{to the left of}} the CH3 group at the far right of the diagram shown at above right. (The two chemicals are so-called adjacent homologues.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Monsanto had {{obtained}} the product patent on <b>propanil</b> {{on the basis}} of its selective herbicidal property, Rohm & Haas was able in 1974 to obtain U.S, Patent No. 3,816,092 (the Wilson patent) on a process for applying <b>propanil</b> to inhibit the growth of undesirable plants in areas containing established crops. Claims 1 and 2 are illustrative for purposes of this case: ...|$|E
5000|$|Section 271(d) {{should not}} be {{interpreted}} to immunize this conduct without a clear signal from Congress that it desires that result, he said, and that signal is lacking. 271(d) [...] "does not state that respondent may exclude all competitors from the <b>propanil</b> market by refusing to license all {{those who do not}} purchase <b>propanil</b> from it. This is the very conduct that constitutes patent misuse under the traditional doctrine." ...|$|E
5000|$|The issue {{presented}} in Dawson Chemical was [...] "whether Rohm & Haas' method of selling unpatented <b>propanil,</b> {{coupled with a}} refusal to license competitors to sell that item, constituted patent misuse," [...] and therefore [...] "that Rohm & Haas should have been required to grant express licenses to competing producers of <b>propanil</b> before it could claim and recover for contributory infringement. Both parties and the majority and dissent made strong arguments for their respective positions. Hodgeman maintains that the majority correctly rejected the proposal to impose compulsory licensing: ...|$|E
5000|$|According to White, {{the line}} of cases since Motion Picture Patents [...] "established, even before this Court's {{decisions}} in the Mercoid cases, [...] [...] [...] that the patent misuse doctrine would bar recovery by a patent holder who refused to license others to use a patented process unless they purchased from him an unpatented product {{for use in the}} process." [...] He argued that Rohm & Haas's [...] "conduct in this clearly constitutes patent misuse under these pre-Mercoid decisions because it refuses to license others to use its patented process unless they purchase from it unpatented propanil." [...] He dismissed as irrelevant the fact that <b>propanil</b> was a non-staple. Indeed the fact that <b>propanil</b> lacked non-infringing use further made the conduct misuse: ...|$|E
50|$|In 1969, Monsanto sued Rohm and Haas for {{infringement}} of Monsanto's {{patent for}} the herbicide <b>propanil.</b> In Monsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co., the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Monsanto {{on the basis}} that the company had fraudulently procured the patent it sought to enforce.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. A {{method for}} {{selectively}} inhibiting growth of undesirable plants {{in an area}} containing growing undesirable plants in an established crop, which comprises applying to said area <b>propanil</b> {{at a rate of}} application which inhibits growth of said undesirable plants and which does not adversely affect the growth of said established crop.|$|E
5000|$|Monsanto {{filed the}} Husted Affidavit. The trial {{court found that}} this {{document}} [...] "contains no affirmative misrepresentation and is accurate {{so far as it}} goes" [...] but [...] "it is misleading, and was intended to be misleading, in that it fails to state facts known to the applicant which were inconsistent with its position that <b>propanil</b> is a superior herbicide." [...] The court of appeals commented: ...|$|E
50|$|Monsanto {{procured}} U.S. Patent No. No. 3,382,280, issued May 7, 1968, {{having the}} title 3',4'-dichloropropionanilide (known as 3,4-DCPA or <b>propanil),</b> a herbicide that selectively killed weeds without killing crop {{plants such as}} rice. In November 1969 Monsanto sued Rohm and Haas for patent infringement. The only substantial issue was {{the validity of the}} patent, and that ultimately turned on whether Monsanto had committed fraud on the Patent Office in procuring the patent.|$|E
5000|$|But Monsanto had {{withheld}} data {{on those}} tests {{that showed that}} other similar compounds also had herbicidal activity {{similar to that of}} <b>propanil.</b> The court said that this amounted to a misrepresentation and Monsanto was not entitled to a patent, so that the patent was invalid or unenforceable. In an earlier case, however, a judge had accepted Monsanto's argument that Monsanto [...] "did nothing more than put their best foot forward" [...] with the Patent Office.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} mode of propanil's herbicidal {{action against}} weeds is inhibition of their photosynthesis and CO2 fixation. Plants photosynthesize in two stages. In stage I photosynthetic reactions capture sunlight energy and yield molecules with high energy content. In stage II these molecules react to capture CO2, yielding carbohydrate precursors. In the stage I reaction a chlorophyll molecule absorbs one photon (light) and loses one electron, starting an electron transport chain reaction {{leading to the}} stage II reactions. <b>Propanil</b> inhibits the electron transport chain reaction and its conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate precursors. That inhibits further development of the weed.|$|E
5000|$|He {{turned to}} {{the opinion of the}} court of appeals, which chose to give Rohm & Haas a {{monopoly}} over unpatented <b>propanil</b> because [...] "the rights to license another to sell nonstaple unpatented items would be rendered worthless if the only right conferred by (d)(1) were the right to sell the item as one competitor among many freely competing." [...] That was wrong for two reasons. First, Rohm & Haas could collect royalties from its licensed competitors, who would need licenses to avoid contributory infringement liability. Second, [...] "it also is fundamentally inconsistent with the congressional policy 'to preserve and foster competition' in the sale of unpatented materials, a policy that, as we have recognized, survived enactment of § 271." ...|$|E
50|$|Two recent {{approaches}} for coupling capillary scale liquid chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry (LC-EI-MS) {{can be incorporated}} {{for the analysis of}} various samples. These are capillary-scale EI-based LC/MS interface and direct-EI interface. In the capillary EI the nebulizer has been optimized for linearity and sensitivity. The direct-EI interface is a miniaturized interface for nano- and micro-HPLC in which the interfacing process takes place in a suitably modified ion source. Superior sensitivity, linearity, and reproducibility can be obtained because the elution from the column is completely transferred into the ion source. Using these two interfaces electron ionization can be successfully incorporated for the analysis of small and medium-sized molecules with various polarities. The most common applications for these interfaces in LC-MS are environmental applications such as gradient separations of the pesticides, carbaryl, <b>propanil,</b> and chlorpropham using a reversed phase, and pharmaceutical applications such as separation of four anti-inflammatory drugs, diphenyldramine, amitryptyline, naproxen, and ibuprofen.|$|E
5000|$|Justice Stevens {{joined in}} the White dissent but added further remarks to criticize the majority's approach. He called Rohm & Haas's conduct [...] "a classic case of patent misuse" [...] that [...] "nothing in 35 U.S.C. § 271(d) {{excludes}} [...] [...] [...] from the well-established misuse doctrine." [...] He observed that the majority was led into reaching its result {{by the fact that}} it would not have been [...] "profitable to exploit this patent by granting express licenses for fixed terms to users of <b>propanil</b> or by granting licenses to competing sellers." [...] and that the patent would have little value [...] "unless the patentee is permitted to engage in patent misuse." [...] That was not a sound basis for the majority's decision: [...] "For the logic of the Court's holding would seem to justify the extension of the patent monopoly to unpatented nonstaples even in cases in which the patent could be profitably exploited without misuse." ...|$|E
5000|$|First, {{we agree}} with the Court of Appeals that the {{concepts}} of contributory infringement and patent misuse [...] "rest on antithetical underpinnings." [...] [...] [...] And an inevitable concomitant {{of the right to}} enjoin another from contributory infringement is the capacity to suppress competition in an unpatented article of commerce. Proponents of contributory infringement defend this result {{on the grounds that it}} is necessary for the protection of the patent right, and that the market for the unpatented article flows from the patentee's invention[...] [...] [...] Yet suppression of competition in unpatented goods is precisely what the opponents of patent misuse decry. If both the patent misuse and contributory infringement doctrines are to coexist, then each must have some separate sphere of operation with which the other does not interfere. Second, we find that the majority of cases in which the patent misuse doctrine was developed involved undoing the damage thought to have been done by A.B. Dick. The desire to extend patent protection to control of staple articles of commerce died slowly, and the ghost of the expansive contributory infringement era continued to haunt the courts. As a result, among the historical precedents in this Court, only the Leeds & Catlin and Mercoid cases bear significant factual similarity to the present controversy. Those cases involved questions of control over unpatented articles that were essential to the patented inventions, and that were unsuited for any commercial noninfringing use. In this case, we face similar questions in connection with a chemical <b>propanil,</b> the herbicidal properties of which are essential to the advance on prior art disclosed by respondent's patented process. Like the record disc in Leeds & Catlin or the stoker switch in the Mercoid cases, and unlike the dry ice in Carbice or the bituminous emulsion in Leitch, <b>propanil</b> is a nonstaple commodity which has no use except through practice of the patented method. Accordingly, had the present case arisen prior to Mercoid, we believe it fair to say that it would have fallen close to the wavering line between legitimate protection against contributory infringement and illegitimate patent misuse.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{diseases}} and pests pose threats to rice cultivation {{within the state}} of Arkansas. One such culprit, Pyricularia grisea, commonly known as rice blast, is an invasive fungus that spreads primarily through infected rice stubble from the prior year, related host species and even sometimes infected seed. Though epidemics of the fungus seem to be sporadic (infected seed most likely accounts for the randomness in distribution of the rice blast in Arkansas rice fields), [...] "rice blast has caused significant yield losses in Arkansas." [...] Another disease that is actually [...] "second only to, and often rivals, rice blast in importance" [...] is sheath blight, which is a soil borne pathogen the initial symptoms of which commonly begin with [...] "lesions on the sheaths of lower leaves when plants are in the late tillering or early internode elongation stage of growth." [...] The weed that poses perhaps the largest threat to Arkansas rice is barnyard grass, due to its [...] "widespread resistance to <b>propanil</b> and quinclorac, {{two of the most}} frequently used herbicides." [...] Along with this, [...] "weedy red rice (Oryza sativa) is a problematic weed in cultivated rice," [...] and of the rice fields in Arkansas that account for 50% of the nation's rice crop, [...] "about 60% of these...have some red rice infestation." [...] Weeds such as barnyard grass and weedy red rice can often have detrimental effects to rice fields throughout the state of Arkansas, accounting for over $22 million worth of crop yield losses in 1992.|$|E
5000|$|When Rohm & Haas {{refused to}} grant it a license, Dawson raised {{a defense of}} patent misuse and counterclaimed for alleged {{antitrust}} violations. The parties stipulated the facts and Dawson moved for summary judgment of patent misuse, {{on the grounds that}} Rohm & Haas misused its patent by allowing the use of the patented method only to purchasers of its own <b>propanil.</b> The district court agreed and dismissed the complaint. In concluding that patent misuse occurred the district court stressed several points. First, Rohm & Haas refused to grant licenses when requested, which Mercoid had offered to do in the Mercoid cases. Therefore, Rohm & Haas [...] "by seeking to monopolize the sale of an unpatented component of its protected method without even attempting to license other manufacturers, is exploiting its patent in a manner which is less legitimate than the exploitation condemned by the Supreme Court in Mercoid." [...] Further, the court pointed to the court of appeals opinion in B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, in which the misuse was based on the patentee's selling [...] "unpatented component products specially made for use in a patented process for reinforcing shoe insoles; and the component had no other substantial commercial use." [...] Finally, the facts of Mercoid involved a non-staple switch specially designed for use to practice the patent. The court concluded that the enactment of § 271(d) was intended to overrule the dicta in Mercoid against there being any residuum of contributory infringement but was not intended to overturn the ruling as to the specific facts, which the court considered equivalent to those of the case before it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} [...] "acknowledges that respondent {{refused to}} license others to sell <b>propanil,</b> but it observes that 'nothing {{on the face}} of the statute requires it to do so.'&#8202;" [...] White says that is so, but that does not [...] "absolve" [...] Rohm & Haas from misuse: [...] "Section 271(d) does not define conduct that constitutes patent misuse; rather, it simply outlines certain conduct that is not patent misuse. Because the terms of the statute are terms of exception, the absence of any express mention of a licensing requirement does not indicate that respondent's refusal to license others is protected by § 271(d). This much seems elementary." [...] The legislative history indicates only an intention by Congress [...] "of reinstating the doctrine of contributory infringement as it had been developed by decisions prior to Mercoid, and of overruling any blanket invalidation of the doctrine that could be found in the Mercoid opinions." [...] The majority can find nothing in the debates or Committee Reports to support its position, or anything said by legislators, so it turns to [...] "the opinions of private patent attorneys as to the meaning of the proposed legislation." [...] White then says it is contrary to precedent to do that. Moreover, not even the patent attorneys went as far as the majority in overturning misuse law. The patent attorneys only argued that knowingly selling a non-staple specially adapted for infringement should be made unlawful, as it was in § 271(c). That testimony does [...] "not support the Court's broad holding that Congress intended to give patent holders complete control over nonstaple materials that otherwise would be in the public domain." [...] The majority, White protested, was extending contributory infringement [...] "far beyond what the Committees were told § 271(d) would effect. Indeed, the representations were that, aside from the exemptions spelled out in § 271(d), a patentee's control of nonstaples would be subject to the doctrine of patent misuse." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Propanil</b> is an {{important}} cause of death from acute pesticide poisoning, of which methaemoglobinaemia is {{an important}} manifestation. However, there is limited information about the clinical toxicity and kinetics. The objective {{of this study is}} to describe the clinical outcomes and kinetics of <b>propanil</b> following acute intentional self-poisoning. Methods 431 patients with a history of <b>propanil</b> poisoning were admitted from 2002 until 2007 in a large, multi-centre prospective cohort study in rural hospitals in Sri Lanka. 40 of these patients ingested <b>propanil</b> with at least one other poison and were not considered further. The remaining 391 patients were classified using a simple grading system on the basis of clinical outcomes; methaemoglobinaemia could not be quantified due to limited resources. Blood samples were obtained on admission and a subset of patients provided multiple samples for kinetic analysis of <b>propanil</b> and the metabolite 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (DCA). Results There were 42 deaths (median time to death 1. 5 days) giving a case fatality of 10. 7 %. Death occurred despite treatment in the context of cyanosis, sedation, hypotension and severe lactic acidosis consistent with methaemoglobinaemia. Treatment consisted primarily of methylene blue (1 mg/kg for one or two doses), exchange transfusion and supportive care when methaemoglobinaemia was diagnosed clinically. Admission plasma concentrations of <b>propanil</b> and DCA reflected the clinical outcome. The elimination half-life of <b>propanil</b> was 3. 2 hours (95 % confidence interval 2. 6 to 4. 1 hours) and the concentration of DCA was generally higher, more persistent and more variable than <b>propanil.</b> Conclusion <b>Propanil</b> is the most lethal herbicide in Sri Lanka after paraquat. Methylene blue was largely prescribed in low doses and administered as intermittent boluses which are expected to be suboptimal given the kinetics of methylene blue, <b>propanil</b> and the DCA metabolite. But in the absence of controlled studies the efficacy of these and other treatments is poorly defined. More research is required into the optimal management of acute <b>propanil</b> poisoning. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{dissipation}} of <b>propanil</b> and 3, 4 dichloroaniline (3, 4 DCA) over time in the soil, field water, inlet water, and outlet water of paddy fields under three management systems: conventional water seeding (CON), conventional water seeding with supplied liquid manure (LMA), and dry seeding (DRY). <b>Propanil</b> dissipation in water was also investigated under laboratory conditions. The field study was conducted from 2004 to 2006 at Vercelli, northern Italy. <b>Propanil</b> and 3, 4 DCA showed rapid dissipation in water and soil environments both {{in the field and}} in the laboratory. Under controlled conditions, chemical hydrolysis was not detected for either compounds for up to 100 d at pHs of 5, 7, and 9. In the laboratory, the half-life of <b>propanil</b> in irrigation water was 1. 1 d; its half-life in soil was routinely measured at < 1. 0 d (between 0. 17 and 1. 77 d). 3, 4 DCA was found to persist much longer. Measured in all three study years at 50 d after treatment, its concentration ranged between 44 μg kg − 1 (CON) and 140 μg kg − 1 (DRY). <b>Propanil</b> and 3, 4 DCA concentrations in paddy water were particularly high in samples collected at 4 d (2004) and 2 d (2005) after treatment. Maximum concentrations were 54. 4 μg L − 1 (CON) for <b>propanil</b> (2005) and 113. 7 μg L − 1 (LMA) for 3, 4 DCA (2004). The concentrations of <b>propanil</b> and 3, 4 DCA in inlet water were never above 1. 1 and 0. 3 μg L − 1, respectively, whereas the highest concentration of each compound in outlet water was in samples collected first after treatment in 2005 and 2006. Both chemicals dissipated rapidly in all the soil-water environments but displayed no important differences among the three management systems.
