40|$|To {{relieve the}} axial stress induce rature {{high-pressure}} pipelines in deepwater, current design methods leave the pipe unburied {{and allow the}} formation of the lateral buckles along the pipeline in a controlled manner. However, this approach requires {{a better understanding of the}} interaction between the seabed soil and the partially embedded pipeline under both vertical and lateral movements. Research has been carried out to examine the two soil-pipe interaction mechanisms, vertical <b>pipe</b> <b>penetration</b> and lateral <b>pipe</b> movement, involved in the installation and operation of an on-bottom offshore pipeline. The findings reported in this thesis improve the current knowledge of pipe-soil interaction in clay. A series of physical model tests was conducted to investigate the behaviour of <b>pipe</b> <b>penetration</b> and lateral <b>pipe</b> movement in clay. The experiments were carried out using short pipe sections in a I g model tank equipped with a transparent Perspex window in the front panel, from which high quality images were obtained for the measurement of the soil deformation in the tests using an image analysis technique. The computational limit analysis, Discontinuity Layout Optimisation (DLO), was adopted to back-analyse and compare with the experimental results. In addition, parametric studies were conducted using DLO to investigate the effects of the change in soil geometry and soil condition on the pipe resistances and soil flow mechanisms for the vertical <b>pipe</b> <b>penetration</b> and the lateral pipe sweep processes. Experimental results showed that <b>pipe</b> <b>penetration,</b> prior to the fully embedded flow-around failure mechanism at very deep penetrations, involves four distinct stages in development of the failure mechanism from 'soil heave' to 'local flow-around' at shallow and deep pipe embedments, respectively. Good agreement was observed between the experimental and numerical results. The results of the parametric studies suggested that the onset depth of the fully embedded flow-around failure mechanism is strongly dependent on the undrained strength profile and tensile strength of the soil. The lateral resistance of a partially embedded pipe under different loading conditions was measured at both small and large lateral displacements. Results showed that the lateral resistance is strongly affected by the change in soil geometry, soil heave induced by the initial penetration and formation of the active berm in front of the pipe during lateral movements. Based on the results from the numerical and experimental studies, design equations are proposed for the predictions of (i) the <b>pipe</b> <b>penetration</b> resistance at both shallow and deep embedments, and (ii) the lateral resistance of a partially embedded pipe under combined vertical and horizontal loads at both small and large lateral displacements.

40|$|The as-laid {{embedment}} of an on-bottom pipeline strongly {{influences the}} resulting thermal insulation, and {{the resistance to}} subsequent axial and lateral movement of the pipeline. Reliable assessment of these parameters {{is essential for the}} design of offshore pipelines. Static vertical <b>penetration</b> of a <b>pipe</b> into a soft clay seabed—which can be modeled as an undrained process—causes heave of soil {{on each side of the}} pipeline. The heaved soil contributes to the vertical penetration resistance and the horizontal capacity. This paper describes a series of large deformation finite-element analyses of <b>pipe</b> <b>penetration,</b> supported by a simple analytical assessment of the heave process. The conventional bearing capacity approach to the analysis of <b>pipe</b> <b>penetration</b> is reviewed, and modifications for the effects of soil weight and heave are presented. It is shown that in soft soil conditions—which are typical for deep water—the soil self-weight contributes a significant portion of the vertical penetration resistance and horizontal capacity. If heave is neglected, the soil weight leads to a vertical force due to buoyancy, based on Archimedes’ principle. When heave is considered, the soil weight contributes an additional component of vertical load, exceeding simple buoyancy, due to the distorted geometry of the soil surface. Archimedes’ principle does not apply. The finite-element analyses, benchmarked against rigorous plasticity solutions, are used to calibrate simple expressions for predicting static vertical <b>pipe</b> <b>penetration,</b> and the resulting horizontal capacity. These simple solutions allow the conventional bearing capacity approach to be used in a manner which correctly accounts for the effects of soil self-weight and heave. An approximate solution for predicting the “local” pipe embedment—relative to the raised soil level immediately adjacent to the pipe—is derived. The local embedment significantly exceeds the nominal embedment relative to the original soil surface. This effect counteracts the tendency for heave to reduce the embedment by raising the penetration resistance...|$|R

Essential prerequisites for these methods include proven and validated statistics applied to potential discontinuities and material properties in the component and their detectability using nondestructive testing methods. Enhanced, hands-on nondestructive testing techniques, capable of determining flaw type and size, are currently available. These technological advancements are achieved through the complete imaging of inspected components using tomography reconstruction techniques, which also clearly define physical flaw detection limits.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} the ITER Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS) Area was performed to assess dose rates outside {{the walls and ceiling}} of the facility after 1. 5 years of operation at shutdown, 2 days, and 10 days after shutdown. For this purpose a simplified Monte Carlo computer model was developed using the MCNP (MCNP 5 Ver. 1. 51) code. Two components are included: the smaller filter tank and the larger ion exchanger. These pieces of equipment are associated with the Integrated Blanket ELM Divertor Primary Heat Transfer System, which will have the largest dose rates associated with activated corrosion products during operation in comparison with other systems. The ion exchanger contained two source regions, a 1. 2 -m-thick resin bed above a 0. 55 m-thick skirt, and a 0. 8 -m-thick water region. The filter constituted an additional source. Thus the model consisted of three sources (filter, resin, water), homogeneously distributed within the appropriate source regions. However, much of the results (that address individual isotopes) are presented with the two sources in the ion exchanger combined. In these cases the sources are referred to as the 'ion exchanger source' and the 'filter source. ' Dimensions for the facility and components, as well as source isotopes and strengths, and material densities, were supplied by US ITER. Because of its simplification, the model does not contain pipes. Consequently, radiation streaming through <b>pipe</b> <b>penetrations,</b> radiation emanating from the pipes, and shielding from the pipes were not considered in this analysis. Dose rates on the outside of two walls and the ceiling were calculated. The two walls are labeled as the 'long' wall (aligned with the X-axis) and the 'short' wall (aligned with the Y-axis). These walls and ceiling were nominally set to 30 -cm-thick concrete. In the original analysis, standard concrete (2. 3 g/cc density) was used. In addition to the shielding walls/ceiling, a floor and an additional wall opposite the long wall were added for photon scattering contributions. These were both 10 -cm-thick, standard concrete structures. Other components (tanks, pipes, etc.), that {{were not included in the}} model, would potentially add additional scattering and shielding. Possibly these additional effects will be addressed in a later, more detailed analysis. The room was 29. 6 m in length (X-axis), but was limited to 15 m in the model. The inside width (Y axis) and height (Z axis) were 4 m and 3. 4 m, respectively. The origin for the model was located inside the room at the corner opposite the long wall and adjacent to the short wall at the floor level. The room was filled with air at standard temperature and pressure. The stainless steel (SS 304) wall thicknesses for the ion exchanger and filter were 2. 2 cm and 0. 8 cm, respectively. The axial center of the filter was located 140 cm from the short wall and 100 cm from the long wall (outer surface). The axial center of the ion exchanger was located 440 cm from the short wall and 250 cm from the long wall (inner surface). The resin was assumed to be a homogeneous mixture of equal atom density fractions of hydrogen and carbon* at a specified density of 1. 136 g/cc. The filter material was assumed to be homogeneous carbon at a specified density of 1. 8 g/cc. If the filter media were stainless steel and the accumulated activity were the same, the dose rate outside the filter would be lower, provided the density of the stainless steel sintered filter material is significantly higher than 1. 8 g/cc. The densities of the water and air were assumed to be 1. 0 g/cc and 1. 096 E- 3 g/cc, respectively. The model included 10 small volumes placed outside the model adjacent to the wall at locations where the dose rates were expected to be highest and which showed to a degree the fall-off of the dose rate with distance along a particular wall or ceiling. These 'tally cells' are shown in Fig. 2 and are described in Table 1. Each cell had dimensions of 50 cm x 50 cm x 1 cm and was oriented so that the 1 -cm-thick dimension was perpendicular to the wall against which the cell was located. Also, smaller tally volumes were placed at 5 cm (updated model), 30 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm from each source, both radially from the outside of each component at the height of each source mid-plane, and vertically, along the axial centerline, above the ion-exchanger and below the filter. (For the ion exchanger, the vertical distance was limited to 75 cm because of interference from the ceiling.) These tally regions can be seen in Fig. 3. Each cell had dimensions of 5 cm x 5 cm x 1 cm, oriented so that the 1 -cm-thick dimension was perpendicular to the X, Y or Z axis...|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{analysis}} of the new radiation shield design, verification and dose distribution calculations for three irradiation facilities: The analysis of the new radiation design concrete shield for the Citrusdal facility, and shield verification calculations (radiological safety assessment) for the already constructed Stellenbosch and HEPRO irradiation facilities. Additionally, as a subordinate objective, the study reports on dose distributions in the irradiated insect containers of the Citrusdal irradiation facility, and sample product boxes of the HEPRO irradiation facility. In 2006 a private company, Citrus Research International (CRI), began the engineering design of a new insect sterilization facility in Citrusdal in the Western Cape region of South Africa, which was then constructed from ordinary concrete density (3 ¸ 2. 35 g/cm) in the year 2007. This facility employs a very successful ionising radiation based method, the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), for drastically reducing or controlling insect population, which poses a serious pest problem in the Citrusdal agricultural area. The SIT uses the radionuclide 60 Co {{as the source of}} ionising radiation. The design-base activity of the 60 Co source for the Citrusdal facility was 740 TBq (20 kCi). Therefore, the new radiation shield design was done for this source strength. Analysis of the shield design has been carried-out using the integrated point-kernel (QAD-CGGP and the MathCAD worksheet) and confirmed with a Monte Carlo (MCNPX) radiation transport computer codes. This was done by considering the concrete shielding walls, the roof as well as the entrance/exit labyrinth at critical points for radiological protection purposes. However, only MCNPX was used to ascertain whether the labyrinth entrance/exit was radiologically safe because the point-kernel uses a semi-analytical, approximate methodology that is not able to account for radiation streaming through labyrinth. Satisfactory agreement was found between the three computational methods. Stellenbosch irradiation facility is being operated by the Agricultural Research Council as insect sterilization facility at Nietvoorbij, that is situated approximately 70 km from Cape Town. This facility uses a radiation based Sterile Insect technique; using 60 Co as the source of ionising radiation. The facility is designed chiefly for sterilization of fruit flies which presents a major problem in the agricultural area in South Africa. The facility was designed for a 5 kCi (0. 185 PBq) 60 Co source, but is now operated with a 10 kCi (0. 37 PBq) 60 Co source (reference source strength in the year 1999). The source activity was 3. 32 kCi (0. 12 PBq) in October 2007, i. e., shield verification calculations was performed for this activity. This was carried out using QAD-CGGP and verified with MCNPX radiation transport computer codes, and where possible, validated with measurements. Dose rates were measured with a calibrated gamma-ray monitor, GRAETZ X 5 C. The spatial distribution of dose rates around the shielding concrete walls, on top of the roof and in various positions along the maze were considered. The dose rates at the closest distance (at 10 cm) from the exterior of the concrete shielding walls were slightly higher. However, good agreement was found between measured and simulated (calculated) values. HEPRO is a commercial irradiation facility situated in Ferrule Avenue, Montagu Gardens, Milnerton, City of Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa. The HEPRO facility is mainly used for food irradiation and sterilization of medical instruments. This facility was originally designed to operate with a maximum '!Co source strength of 1 MCi (37 PBq). However, to increase the product throughput rate, the source strength had to be increased to a nominal 1. 5 MCi (55. 5 PBq) in 2005 / 6. Nevertheless a radiological safety assessment was performed for a source strength of 2 MCi (2 37 PBq 74 PBq) 60 Co, because any radiation safety system such as radiation shielding must have a “safety factor”. Again the point-kernel method was used for radiological safety assessment and verified with MCNPX radiation transport computer code. Observation of critical spots and where possible the spatial distribution of dose rates were measured using a calibrated gamma-ray monitor, GRAETZ X 5 C, to provide additional confirmation of results. The spatial distribution of dose rates around the shielding concrete along the walls, roof, cable penetration inside the hut on roof, inside irradiation vault, above water pool, hotspot on wall, pneumatic <b>pipe</b> <b>penetrations,</b> sliding plug-door, and ducts of the hoistcable situated {{on the roof of the}} locked hut were considered. The comparison of dose rate values obtained using the aforementioned methods showed a slight deviation such that they were considered satisfactory. The use of Monte Carlo computational tools such as MCNPX in support of the prediction/assessment of the absorbed dose distributions in the irradiated product of the irradiation facilities can prove to be economically effective, representing savings in the utilization of dose meters, among other benefits. The absorbed dose distributions within the insect containers were calculated with the model developed in MCNPX for one hour of exposure. The modelling was carried out for a 60 Co source with a nominal activity of 16. 8 kCi, i. e., 622 TBq. The calculated values were compared to an average value from the preliminary experimental (sterility test) measurements. The sterility test for the insects, False Codling Moths, was done during the onset of the SIT programme at Citrusdal irradiation facility. The variability of the dose distribution inside the insect canisters were within acceptable dose values for adequate sterilising False Codling Moths. A systematic computational calculation methods was used to model/simulate the sample product undergoing irradiation in a 60 Co source for HEPRO industrial irradiator facility. This was carried-out using the Monte Carlo code—MCNPX. The calculation was done for a source-rack containing 4 25 100 60 Co pins, having a total activity of about 1 MCi (37 PBq). Four boxes were stacked around about 50 cm away from the source centerline. Each square box of sample product was rotated by 90 ° around the horizontal axis (perpendicular to the source rack), i. e., three times so that each of the four side of the box faced the source rack once during an irradiation session. A specific Fortran- 90 code uses an algorithm to calculate the absorbed dose distribution for equal-time irradiation was therefore applied. The Fortran- 90 code uses the dose values calculated by MCNPX and sums them in a suitable way in order to reproduce the mentioned rotations. The calculations revealed highest absorbed dose at the edges of the box, and even slightly higher at the four corners. The lowest absorbed dose was noticed at the centre of the sample product...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{amount of}} energy {{transfer}} from the hammer to the casing is a critical consideration for assessing of the constructability of the required length and diameter of pipe with a given hammer. Due to various contractor-selected pipe-hammer connections and natural sources of energy loss (e. g., thermal, frictional, etc.), the energy transfer efficiency of pipe ramming hammers must be less than 100 percent; however, actual hammer- pipe energy transfer efficiencies, defined as the ratio of actual energy transferred to the rated hammer energy, have not been reported to-date. Overestimates of hammer- pipe energy transfer could result in corresponding overestimates of driving stresses and penetration rates; likewise, over-estimates of driving stress could lead to excessive and uneconomical wall thickness. This study focuses on the characterization of hammer- pipe energy transfer efficiencies for commonly used pneumatic and hydraulic hammers observed during production and test pipe ramming installations. The observed energy transfer was found {{to depend on the}} type of hammer, the hammer-pipe connection (e. g., collets vs. ram cones), the hammer alignment, and the degree of tension on restraining chains. Observations of energy transfer indicate that hammer efficiency can vary widely; average observed efficiencies ranged from 20 to 50 percent.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaf 60). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. An experimental program was conducted to study the penetration behavior of mines in soft sediment. Model tests were conducted on sediments collected from the Gulf of Mexico seabed. The size of the model mine was approximately one third of that of actual mines. The factors selected for the investigation were mine weight, preburial condition of the mine, mine orientation, impact velocity of the mine and shear strength and creep characteristics of the soil. Only the geotechnical aspects of the problem were investigated. The model tests were divided into nonimpact and impact tests. In the nonimpact tests, the mine penetration behavior qualitatively follows the theoretical predictions of <b>pipe</b> <b>penetration.</b> Normalized mine weight vs. normalized penetration curve has a steeper slope when the penetration is less than one mine radius. When the penetration is more than one mine radius the mine tends to penetrate more readily with increasing mine weight. The preburial condition of the mine does not influence the penetration behavior, especially for long term penetration. Mine orientation plays a role in immediate penetration, but when the mine is in full contact with the soil, it does not influence penetration significantly. Creep behavior of the Gulf of Mexico soil was found to be of a terminating nature, which contributes significantly to long term penetration. In impact tests, the impact velocity of the mine plays the most important role in mine penetration. The acceleration induced in the mine due to free fall becomes negative after some amount of penetration. The mine gains ultimate penetration immediately after hitting the mud and does not penetrate further as time passes. So, soil creeping does not contribute to penetration when the mine is being impacted on sediment...|$|R

40|$|The trenchless {{technology}} {{known as}} pipe ramming {{for construction of}} culverts and buried pipes under roadways or other infrastructure has gained significant popularity due to its cost-effectiveness and ability to alleviate surface disruptions associated with open-cut trenching. Although the experience with pipe ramming is increasing, there has been remarkably little technical guidance available for engineers to appropriately specify aspects of a pipeline or culvert installation, including the planning of feasible layouts, rates of <b>penetration,</b> <b>pipe</b> diameters, and hammers. This research provides a comprehensive engineering framework for evaluation of culvert installations at the planning phase to address the gaps in knowledge associated with pipe ramming. Presently there are no existing and proven techniques for prediction of settlement, vibration, driving stresses, soil resistance to ramming, and drivability for pipe ramming installations. This study has adopted existing drivability, soil resistance, settlement, and vibration prediction models from pipe jacking, microtunneling, and pile driving models and examined their applicability in pipe ramming installations, resulting in new and technology-specific design guidance. The development of this comprehensive engineering guidance is based on engineering calculations empirically tuned using a database of actual performance measurements.

40|$|The {{generalized}} Hough transformmethod {{is applied}} to the measurement of the diameters of buried cylindrical <b>pipes</b> by Ground <b>Penetration</b> Radar (GPR). 600 MHz radar scans across long pipes, buried in one metre or so of soil, show complex reflection patterns consisting of a series of inverted hyperbolic arcs. The time of flight t(y) as the radar probe is scanned along an axis, y, perpendicular to the pipe, shows an arc whose shape and position depends on 4 unknown variables: y 0, the position of the center of the pipe along the scan, z 0, the depth of the pipe center, R 0, its radius and V 0 the velocity in the medium. Analytic expressions for the solution of these variables have been obtained. They use sets of times ti at corresponding positions yi, along the arc, depending on the number of variables to be determined. In the generalized Hough method many such sets of times are chosen randomly from points on the arcs. The results are presented for example as peaks in an accumulator space for each variable. The method is demonstrated for a 0. 18 m radius concrete pipe buried at a nominal 1 m depth in a road. Using data acquired at 600 MHz frequency (around 0. 16 m wavelength in soil) the estimated radius was 0. 174 ± 0. 059 m. 1...|$|R
40|$|Density is a {{fundamental}} property of polar snowpacks and of particular importance for various applications such as remote sensing, surface-mass-balance estimates and paleoclimatic ice-core studies. As a result, there is growing interest in quantifying and understanding the stratigraphy of the snowpack and its spatial variability. Melting and refreezing significantly impact the density layering. Melt frequencies observed in polar ice cores are commonly used as markers for extreme summer temperatures. Moreover, {{the evolution of a}} seasonal cycle in density with depth is not well-understood as all of these aspects require extensive field data. To provide a larger sample size, we analyzed snow cores up to 5 m depth from two sampling sites on the Greenlandic and East Antarctic plateaus and determined the spatial distribution of melt features along two orthogonal trench walls of 60 m length and 4 m depth for the Greenland site. We quantify how the observed variability of melt features is strongly influencing the ability to interpret single-core melt records. In particular, prominent vertical melt <b>pipes</b> indicate deep <b>penetration</b> of water in cold Greenlandic plateau firn. For the spatial variability in density, we find a much larger homogeneity of the snowpack along the main wind direction and an imprint of surface features orthogonal to it. Thus, within a certain area (such as the footprint of an altimeter) the stratigraphic variability is directionally dependent and estimation of a representative profile (e. g. from snow cores or modeling) is not straightforward...|$|R
40|$|Subsea {{pipelines}} play {{a significant}} role in transporting hydrocarbon from offshore. For both shallow and deep water, an effective means of hydrocarbon transportation is the usage of pipeline. However, deep water pipelines are expensive to bury and an economic way is to lay the pipelines on seabed. Due to pipe installation procedures (e. g. wave action, pipelines self weight etc.), pipelines could penetrate into the seabed a fraction of its diameter. Pipelines might experience thermal expansion (due to low ambient and high internal temperature) during operation cycles which can cause pipelines to expand axially. But due to restraining conditions from accumulated soil/pipe interaction and effective longitudinal force along the pipeline, bending moments can develop in the pipelines, which cause pipelines to buckle laterally. This lateral buckling is resisted mainly through soil/pipe interaction. In addition, the berm formed around the pipe (during installation period) plays a vital role in resisting the lateral pipe movements. Thus, accurate prediction of soil/pipe interaction of an as-laid pipeline is very important for the development of pipeline design guidelines. To address this critical phenomenon, the first step is to capture the soil behaviour during <b>pipe</b> vertical <b>penetration</b> along with the berm formulation mechanism. This is a large deformation problem. To solve the problem numerically, a large deformation numerical tool is required. In this study, the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian (CEL) finite element method is used for analysis of partially embedded pipelines. Analyses are performed using ABAQUS 6. 10 -EFl software. In the deep sea, the undrained shear strength of clay typically increases with depth. In addition, the undrained shear strength is strain rate dependent. Moreover, strain softening behaviour of clay is another critical phenomenon that should be considered. The standard von Mises yield constitutive model available in ABAQUS cannot capture this clay behaviour. Therefore, in this study an advanced soil constitutive model that considered these phenomena is implemented in ABAQUS using user subroutines programmed in FORTRAN. Results from the analysis are compared with centrifuge test results and other available solutions in the literature. [t is shown that the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian (CEL) approach together with the advanced soil constitutive model is a very effective tool for modelling large deformation behaviour of partially embedded pipelines in seabed both for vertical penetration and lateral movement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Expansive soils {{cause more}} damage to {{structures}} annually than a combination of other major natural disasters. Because of the cost to our society, all means and methods need to be fully explored to mitigate {{the problems associated with}} expansive soils. This study will present a foundation design approach that is underutilized in this application, driven piles. The main objective of the study is to present pile test results and analysis from four driven pile project sites in three types of expansive soils found in central Texas: Del Rio formation, Taylor/Navarro formation, and expansive alluvium. High strain dynamic pile tests were conducted on each of the four studies with rigorous signal matching analysis from the CAse Pile Wave Analysis Program (CAPWAP). Ultimate pile capacities ranged from 73 to 311 kips with an average of 61 % of the total capacity coming from the pile shaft and were two to six times the structural capacity needed. Allowable loads calculated from Modified Gates dynamic formula best modeled allowable test results. Average unit skin frictions ranged from 0. 50 to 4. 71 ksf. Restrike pile tests of 1 to 17 days after initial driving reported 30 to 100 % shaft capacity gain. All open-ended pipe piles driven produced soil plugs ranging from 4 to 14 feet thick. Small diameter, thick-walled, open-ended <b>pipe</b> piles reached <b>penetration</b> of twice the depth of designated zone of seasonal moisture change without problem. The observed production rate of the driven piles was on average 8 minutes, which implied daily production of 15 to 40 piles. Predrills or augered holes should be specified for underground obstructions found in soil investigation...|$|R
40|$|Health {{improvement}} planning models {{exist to}} support strategic management of health improvement efforts and to guide program administrators in taking {{a comprehensive approach}} to health promotion planning from problem identification to program evaluation and diffusion. This article outlines a model which follows four simple steps to program design and four simple steps to program evaluation. The first phase is characterized as the 4 -Ss of program design, which includes size, scope, scalability, and sustainability. The second phase is characterized as the penetration, implementation, participation and effectiveness (<b>PIPE)</b> Impact Metric. <b>Penetration</b> refers to {{the proportion of the}} target population that is reached with invitations to engage in the program or intervention. Implementation refers to {{the degree to which the}} program has been implemented according to the design specifications and the associated work plans. Participation refers to the proportion of invited individuals who enroll in the program according to program protocol. Effectiveness refers to the rate of successful participants. It is considered in the context of programming conducted in the real-world setting. The product of all elements of the PIPE Impact Metric can be calculated to represent the impact from a program administration perspective, while the product of participation and effectiveness can be calculated to represent the impact of the program from a user/consumer perspective. The model is designed to inform program administrators about opportunities for improvement. First, administrative impact can be compared with user/consumer impact. Secondly, the PIPE Impact Metric total score, as well as its individual subscores, should be considered in the context of the 4 -Ss of program design. This model has been derived from work conducted in the applied setting, however it is based on scientific theory and appears congruent with findings from existing, but more complicated, models. The results of the application of the model indicate the presence of a simple set of rules related to critical health improvement program design and evaluation features. Whereas additional experience with the model will allow for further modifications and evolution, early experience indicates it serves program planners and administrators well in terms of systematic program improvement and documentation of effort and impact.

30|$|The {{phenomenon}} is well-known, but {{little is known}} about the mechanism of soil plug formation inside pipe piles, especially for the sleeve driven by vibratory hammers. The formation of a soil plug depends upon a number of factors, e.g. installation method, pile diameter, penetration depth, soil density, whereas the investigation on the influencing factors are still not complete. A lot of researches were conducted to evaluate the soil plugging effect during pipe pile driving. Based on the principle of static equilibrium, Randolph et al. (1991) developed the concept of active height of soil plug and established the one-dimensional static equilibrium equation. Holeyman et al. (2013) presented another analytic expression of the shaft resistance of vibratory driven pile taking account of the soil damping. The limitation of the 1  g model test (O’Neill and Raines 1991) is the same with that of the soil samples under low stress, therefore, the ideal stress condition required by the investigation of the soil plug can be achieved by the use of the geotechnical centrifuge. Nicola and Randolph (1997) analyzed the behavior of soil plug during pipe pile driving by model tests. It was found that the height of soil plug decreased with the increase in the relative compactness of the sands during pile jacking, but increased with the relative compactness of the sands during impact pile driving. Experimental studies of Xing et al. (2012) indicated that the height of soil plug inside impact-driven pipe pile increased as the pipe wall thickness decreased. The distribution of the shaft resistance was nonlinear along the pile length, and depended on the impact force and soil conditions. Tan and Lin (2013) found that the soil plug developed from partially plugged mode in the upper soft cohesive soils into fully plugged mode in the underlying medium dense to dense cohesionless soil layers, and the external shaft resistance was about two-thirds of shaft resistance through a series of steel <b>pipe</b> pile static <b>penetration</b> tests. Liyanapathirana et al. (2000) analyzed the behavior of the soil plug during impact pile driving with Eulerian finite element method, and their researches showed that the degree of soil plug inside the sleeve developed from unplugged mode to partially plugged mode. Thongmunee et al. (2011) analyzed the mechanism and influence of soil plugging bearing capacity performance by discrete element method, and their simulated results were consistent with the experimentation results.|$|R

Field observations of five production installations and a full-scale experiment were conducted to form the performance database employed to understand the mechanics associated with pipe ramming installations, ranging from vertical ground movements, ground vibrations, and installation performance. Settlement prediction was evaluated using the inverted normal probability distribution based models, and these methods over-estimated the observed settlements close {{to the center of}} the pipes and under-estimated settlements at radial distances away from the pipe. A pipe-ramming-specific hyperbolic model was developed for better prediction of the vertical settlement induced by pipe ramming in granular soils. Attenuation of observed pipe ramming-induced vibrations was modeled using a simple semi-empirical approach, and the calibrated model resulted in reasonable predictions of the ground vibrations for granular soils. The static soil resistance to ramming was evaluated using the traditional quasi-static pipe jacking models and the models resulted in inaccurate predictions for instrumented pipe ramming installations. Therefore pipe ramming-specific static soil resistance models were developed for both the face and casing resistance in granular soils. Principles of stress wave theory routinely applied in the drivability analyses for pile foundations were adopted for the evaluation of the dynamic response pipes during ramming. Reliable estimates of the static soil resistance and dynamic soil parameters were obtained through signal matching processes. Data-informed drivability analysis were performed to simulate the magnitude of driving stresses and develop drivability curves which relate the penetration resistance of a given pipe and hammer to the range of static soil resistances. The study culminates in the first comprehensive framework and recommendations for the installation of pipes by ramming, and should help owners, consultants, and contractors to appropriately plan pipe ramming installations...|$|R
