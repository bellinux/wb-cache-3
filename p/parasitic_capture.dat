40|$|In sodium {{fast reactor}} designs, {{negative}} reactivity feedback is accomplished mainly through <b>parasitic</b> <b>capture</b> in U- 238. However for an efficient minor actinide burning system, {{it is desirable}} to reduce or eliminate U- 238 entirely to suppress further transuranic actinide generation. Consequently, reactivity feedback is accomplished by enhancing axial neutron streaming during a loss of coolant void situation. This is done by flattening “pancake ” the active core geometry. Flattening the reactor also increases axial leakage which removes neutrons that could otherwise be used to destroy minor actinides. Therefore, {{it is important to}} tailor the neutron spectrum in the core for optimized feedback and minor actinide destruction simultaneously by using minor actinide and fission product targets. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of nuclear power {{reactors}} is the release of energy arising from the initiation and maintenance of the fission chain reaction in nuclear fuels. It was known that the U 235 isotope, present in 0. 72 % abundance in natural uranium, was fissionable with thermal neutrons but that the U 238 isotope present in 99. 28 % abundance could only be caused to fission with neutrons of higher energy. In addition, the U 238 nucleus was capable of capturing thermal neutrons and would therefore act as a parasite in the nuclear chain reaction. This <b>parasitic</b> <b>capture</b> was soon recognized {{to lead to the}} formation of Pu 239 in the following way...|$|E
50|$|Komodo dragons {{have long}} been great zoo attractions, where their size and {{reputation}} make them popular exhibits. They are, however, rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection and <b>parasitic</b> disease if <b>captured</b> from the wild, and do not readily reproduce. As of May 2009, there were 13 European, 2 African, 35 North American, 1 Singaporean, and 2 Australian institutions that kept Komodo dragons.|$|R
40|$|Calculations were {{performed}} using MOCUP, {{which includes the}} use of MCNP for neutron transport and ORIGEN for depletion. The MOCUP calculations were done using a unit cell (pin cell) model, where the ThO 2 varied from 65 - 75 wt% and the UO 2 varied from 25 - 35 wt%. The fission products and actinides being tracked in the calculations account for > 97 % of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>captures</b> in the fuel. The fuel pin was surrounded by four reflecting planes, where typical parameters were used for a 17 x 17 PWR assembly. The hydrogen to heavy metal ratio (H/HM) was varied by increasing or decreasing the water density in the cell. The {{results show that the}} drier lattices have insufficient reactivity due to the limited enrichment of the uranium. However, a slightly wetter lattice will increase the reactivity-limited burnup by 26 % for the 25 % UO 2 – 75 % ThO 2, and 19 % for the 35 % UO 2 – 65 % ThO 2 as compared to the standard coolant density. This is appears to be consistent with similar studies done with all-uranium lattices, where advantages are gained by hardening or further softening the neutron spectrum. Although some advantage is gained by softening the spectrum, {{the same can be said}} of all-uranium fueled cores. The spectral changes and, to a lesser extent, competing resonances between the 238 U and bred-in 233 U appear to hamper advantages in the conversion of thorium in homogeneous fuel that might otherwise be gained by shifting the neutron spectrum. Physically separating the uranium and thorium (e. g., in micro-heterogeneous and seed-and-blanket arrangements) have been shown alleviate this problem. A change in moderation may further enhance the reactivity-limited burnup of these lattices, and will be the focus of future work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. If {{we are to}} {{understand}} human-level intelligence, we need {{to understand}} how meanings can be learned without explicit instruction. I take a step toward that understanding by showing how symbols can emerge from a system that looks for regularity in the experiences of its visual and proprioceptive sensory systems. More specifically, the implemented system builds descriptions up from low-level perceptual information and, without supervision, discovers regularities in that information. Then, the system, with supervision, associates the regularity with symbolic tags. Experiments conducted with the implementation shows that it successfully learns symbols corresponding to blocks in a simple 2 D blocks world, and learns to associate the position of its eye with the position of its arm. In the course of this work, I propose a model of an adaptive knowledge representation scheme that is intrinsic to the model and not <b>parasitic</b> on meanings <b>captured</b> in some external system, such as the head of a human investigator. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to collect informative data on the parasitic infection of wild rodents, emphasizing on finding parasites, which have medical importance to human. Methods:   During 2012 - 2014, a total number of 91 wild rodents were captured from rural areas of Turkmen Sahra, Golestan Province, using handmade traps. Animals were anesthetized, surveyed for any ectoparasite and then their carcasses were carefully dissected for examination of endoparsites. Results: Four species of rodents including Mus musculus (52. 75 %), Rattus norvegicus (38. 46 %), Rhombomys opimus (4. 40 %) and Meriones libycus (4. 40 %) were <b>captured.</b> <b>Parasitic</b> infestation was detected in 38. 5 % of sampled rodents. Parasite infestation rates of sampled rodents was Hymenolepis diminuta = 7. 7 %, Cryptosporidium spp = 6. 6 %, Trichuris spp. = 5. 5 %, Cysticercus fasciolaris = 2. 20 %, Angiostrongylus spp. = 2. 20 %, Capillaria sp. = 1. 09 %, Rhipicephalus spp. = 8. 70 %, Nosopsyllus fasciatus = 1. 09 %, and Laelaps nuttalli = 3. 29 %. Among 10 genera/species of identified parasites, at least 8 of them were zoonotic with public health importance. L. nuttalli and N. fasciatus were the only two non-zoonotic detected parasites in this survey. Conclusion: Harboring a wide variety of zoonotic parasites in sampled wild rodents particularly when they live nearby villages, represents a potential risk to native inhabitants. Hence, controlling rodents’ population in residential regions and improving awareness of local people about the risk of disease transmission through rodents seems to be entirely necessary. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis {{was done in the}} context of the modeling of parasitic physical effects, like field couplings and crosstalk, that may adversely affect the functional performance of Integrated Circuits (ICs). The modeling of parasitic effects, through simulations with the resulting models, provides insight into the performance of the IC, before its actual fabrication. This thesis has particularly studied the modeling of the IC substrate as a medium for crosstalk between active devices. Modeling of the substrate can be done through modeling techniques like the Finite Element Method (FEM), or the Boundary Element Method (BEM), with each its own characteristics. The FEM is accurate and flexible, but typically slow, whereas the BEM is typically faster, but less flexible and only accurate in more restricted situations. When applied to modern substrate technologies, however, the speed limitations in the FEM and the accuracy limitations in the BEM are typically emphasized. In this context, this thesis proposes a combined BEM/FEM method, where the substrate modeling problem is consistently partitioned into a BEM and a FEM part, such that the structure of the modeling problem itself and the properties of the BEM and FEM modeling techniques are exploited. In particular, global <b>parasitic</b> couplings are <b>captured</b> with a coarse and sparse (i. e. fast) BEM, while local couplings are captured with a reduced-order FEM that contracts equipotential nodes. The result is a sparse, reduced-order BEM/FEM method that operates in a new trade-off between the speed of the BEM and the accuracy of the FEM.
