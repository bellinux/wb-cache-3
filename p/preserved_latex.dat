5000|$|The {{leaves are}} {{elliptical}} in overall shape with a pointed base and a tip that gradually tapers to a point. The {{length of the}} leaves ranges up to 10 cm with a width that can reach half that at 5 cm. A petiole up to 2 cm long is attached at the base. [...] The leaves have a single main vein with at least five alternating pairs of secondary veins placed along its length. The lower secondary veins have a brochidodromous structuring, forming large loops that do not reach the leaf margin but curve up and attach to the next secondary up. The secondaries near the tip have a similar looping structure, but {{with a series of}} smaller loops formed by cross-veins rather than the single continuous loop of the basal secondaries. Tertiary veins run from the main vein out to the margin, some forking, and all straight to slightly wavy. The finer vein structure forms a network of irregularly shaped, polygonal areolae. The margins of the leaves are serrated, with the teeth having a strong curve towards the leave tip. This results in the teeth often being pressed against the leaf margin above the tooth or against the base of the next tooth along the margin. The middle area of each tooth hosts very small veins originating in the marginal vein structure. E. rolandii leaves are notable for the <b>preserved</b> <b>latex</b> that is found on them. All the studied leaves of E. rolandii have small bundles of latex filaments that are found in all the veins. The filaments are rarely found in the areolae that are formed by the veins.|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the final}} product, {{additional}} chemicals {{can be added to}} the <b>latex</b> cup to <b>preserve</b> the <b>latex</b> longer. Ammonia solution helps prevent natural coagulation and allows the latex to remain in its liquid state. Plastic bags containing a coagulant have replaced cups in many plantations in Malaysia. This form of latex is used as the raw material for latex concentrate, which is used for dipped rubber products or for the manufacture of ribbed smoke sheet grades.|$|R

Among the SU(N) Weinberg - Susskind models and the SU(N) Farhi - Susskind models for $N> 2 $ only the SU(4) Farhi - Susskind model may possess the mentioned symmetry. We also show that the hypercharge assignment of Minimal Walking SU(2) Technicolor model may be chosen {{in such a way}} that the additional discrete symmetry is <b>preserved.</b> Comment: <b>Latex,</b> 16 page...|$|R

The features of this Hamiltonian are (i) it reduces to a quadratic combination of the generators of sl(N+ 1); (ii) the interaction potential contains two-body terms and interaction with the force center at the origin; (iii) for quantized values of a certain cohomology parameter n it is quasi-exactly solvable, the multiplicity of states in the algebraic sector is (N+n) !/(N!n!); (iv) the energy-reflection symmetry of the parent system is <b>preserved.</b> Comment: <b>Latex,</b> 12 page...|$|R
50|$|The {{asymmetrical}} {{fruits of}} E. montana {{are composed of}} two flattened nutlets with narrow surrounding wings. The fruit tips are generally rounded with a stigmatic cleft located off center of the apex {{as a result of}} the fruit asymmetry. The fruits range from 5.2 to 11.4 mm in length with an average length of 8.65 mm. They vary in width from 3.2 to 6.8 mm. Fruits of E. montana are composed of a single mature carple, with the second carple present as a narrow strip of tissue that is usually just over half the length of the mature carple. The presence of <b>preserved,</b> polymerized <b>latex</b> threads on the fossils from Quilchena and the Klondike Mountain Formation confirm the fossils are Eucommia seeds.|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest the}} model with the gauge group [...] . ⊗ SU(6) ⊗ SU(5) ⊗ SU(4) ⊗ SU(3) ⊗ SU(2) ⊗ U(1). This {{group is the}} {{infinite}} continuation of the gauge group SU(4) ⊗ SU(3) ⊗ SU(2) ⊗ U(1) of Farhi - Susskind model. The constructed model contains fermions from the fundamental representations of any SU(N) subgroups of the gauge group. In {{the construction of the}} model we use essentially the requirement that it posseses an additional discrete symmetry Z that is the continuation of the Z_ 6 symmetry of the Standard Model. It has been found that there exists such a choice of the hypercharges of the fermions that the chiral anomaly is absent while the symmetry Z is <b>preserved.</b> Comment: <b>LATEX,</b> to appear in Mod.

The key to this analysis is that the normal variational equations along a certain solution {{happen to be in}} a type of Lamé equations.

25|$|Smallholders’ lump is {{produced}} by smallholders who collect rubber from trees far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in remote areas, tap dispersed trees {{on their way to}} work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often impossible to <b>preserve</b> the <b>latex</b> sufficiently to get it to a factory that processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products, and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the smallholder will coagulate it by any means available, in any container available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to coagulate the latex— a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are formed, which may also include tree lace.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present thesis is the {{implementation}} of symmetries in the Wilsonian Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) approach. After recalling how the ERG can be introduced in a general theory (i. e. containing both bosons and fermions, scalars and vectors) and having applied it to the massless scalar theory {{as an example of how}} the method works, we discuss the formulation of the Quantum Action Principle (QAP) in the ERG and show that the Slavnov-Taylor identities can be directly derived for the cutoff effective action at any momentum scale. Firstly the QAP is exploited to analyse the breaking of dilatation invariance occurring in the scalar theory in this approach. Then we address SU(N) Yang-Mills theory and extensively treat the key issue of the boundary conditions of the flow equation which, in this case, have also to ensure restoration of symmetry for the physical theory. In case of a chiral gauge theory, we show how the chiral anomaly can be obtained in the ERG. Finally, we extend the ERG formulation to supersymmetric (gauge) theories. It is emphasized regularization is implemented in such a way that supersymmetry is <b>preserved.</b> Comment: <b>Latex,</b> 113 pages, PhD thesis, Parma University, November 1998, 21 eps-figures, 34 files compressed into tesi. tar. g...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia is {{a primary}} {{chemical}} used for <b>preserving</b> rubber <b>latex.</b> Consequently, the wastewater from concentrated rubber latex processing contains high ammonia concentration. The volatilization of ammonia from such wastewater may cause an air pollution problem such as {{the formation of an}} acid rain or an aerosol of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, which can seriously affect environment and human being. To assess the air pollution problem regarding atmospheric ammonia volatized from wastewater, the model for the prediction of ammonia volatilization rate and flux is therefore desirable. The purposes of this study were to investigate the effects of water temperature and pH on ammonia volatilization process and to develop a model to describe ammonia volatilization rate and flux including such effects. Ammonia volatilization from water was studied by using a volatilization tank (surface area = 780 cm 2, volume = 7 L) placed in a water bath in order to control the water temperature. The temperature and pH in the range of 25 to 50 ºC and 5 to 11 were respectively investigated. The overall mass transfer coefficients of ammonia were measured as a function of temperature and pH. The quadratic multiple regression technique was used to obtain the model for mass transfer coefficient from experimental data. The model suggests that the overall mass transfer coefficient of ammonia increases with increasing water temperature and pH while the temperature-pH interaction retards the increasing characteristic of mass transfer coefficient. Thus the increasing in mass transfer coefficient at higher temperature and pH was slower than that at the lower one. The simple model for the prediction of ammonia volatilization rate and flux was developed based on mass transfer theory and mass transfer coefficient model obtained from this study. This simple ammonia emission model can be used to predict ammonia volatilization rate and flux at any pH, water temperature and ammoniaconcentration in water...|$|R
