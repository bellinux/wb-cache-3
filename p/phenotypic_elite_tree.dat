Agroforestry is an approach to sustainable landuse aimed at reversing these land degradation processes worldwide. In recent years, the domestication of indigenous fruit and nut trees {{has been added to}} the package of techniques making agroforestry more effective. By improving the livelihood benefits derived from agroforestry, the domestication of agroforestry trees is becoming a tool for the alleviation of the severe ecological and socio-economic problems of many developing countries. This thesis describes research to develop techniques for the domestication of indigenous nut tree species in the Solomon Islands. The first step was to determine which species the local communities considered to be their top priorities for domestication. Consequently, participatory surveys were undertaken in 155 households from five villages (Ringi, Seusepe, Rei, Poporo and Hunda) around Kolombangara Island. These surveys identified that Barringtonia procera (Cutnut) and Inocarpus fagifer (Tahitian chestnut) were the species that were most important as a source of food and income, while also filling in critical niches in the farming systems. A review of the literature found that very {{little is known about the}} biology of either species and that no previous studies had been done to domesticate these species. Farmers, however, confirmed that they were growing seeds from trees with desirable nut characters. The next step was to quantitatively characterise the phenotypic variation in the dry matter partitioning between different components of fruits and nuts from the five target villages. Whenever possible, 24 fruits were collected from each of 119 trees of B. procera and separated into their components (pulp, nut and kernel) for measurement. Within each population, highly significant (P= 0. 001) and continuous intraspecific variation was found in all the measured traits. However, site-to-site variability was not significant. This quantitative data was also used to: (i) identify the market-oriented traits which could be combined to describe the 'ideal tree' or 'ideotype', in which 'Harvest Index' is maximised through the partitioning of dry matter to the commercially and domestically important kernel, (ii) identify the <b>elite</b> <b>trees,</b> which could be vegetatively propagated and (iii) ascertain through an anlaysis of the frequency distribution of the data, the degree to which farmers have already from their own actions initiated the domestication process. This study was complemented by a molecular study of genetic variation in each population. This molecular study found significant genetic diversity within and between the five populations of Barringtonia procera. It was also used in parallel with the morphological data, to evaluate: (i) the relatedness of three edible species of Barringtonia, and (ii) the relatedness of <b>elite</b> <b>trees</b> within the five populations. The results imply that the field collections failed to accurately distinguish the different species because of overlapping morphological characteristics. There was no conclusive evidence of any hybridisation between these species, it was clear that <b>elite</b> <b>trees</b> were generally unrelated. Further studies are required to elucidate the taxonomy of the three species. The final section of this thesis examined the factors which affect the rooting ability of both B. procera and I. fagifer stem cuttings. These results are then used to define the most appropriate material and techniques for the development of robust vegetative propagation protocols for village scale nurseries. Both species were found to be easily propagated by single-node, leafy, stem cuttings. Seventeen experiments tested the main factors known to affect the rooting of tropical tree cuttings. It was found that auxin (indole- 3 -butyric acid) did not significantly increase the rooting percentage, although there were significant differences in the numbers of roots formed, which in both species were maximal with 0. 8...|$|R

The profiles of pit aspiration percentage (ASP) of earlywood and latewood from pith to bark for green and air-dry conditions were determined to study the relationship between heartwood color and pit aspiration. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) observations showed that the ASP of earlywood was low in sapwood and high in heartwood in the green condition. Pit aspiration increased in intermediate wood when compared with sapwood. On the other hand, latewood pits did not aspirate during heartwood formation. Comparing the air-dry condition with the green condition, sapwood pits aspirated during drying in both earlywood and latewood; however, {{there was no significant difference}} in pit aspiration of heartwood. There was no significant difference between samples with red and black heartwoods for ASP. The difference in ASP between individual trees was larger than that by heartwood color. The general advantage of CLSM over light microscopy is that serial optical sections along the Z axis can be obtained for any moisture condition, without the need for thin sectioning or embedding.|$|R
40|$|Adventitious rooting is an {{essential}} but sometimes rate-limiting step in the clonal multiplication of <b>elite</b> <b>tree</b> germplasm, because the ability to form roots declines rapidly with age in mature adult plant tissues. In spite {{of the importance of}} adventitious rooting, the mechanism behind this developmental process remains poorly understood. We have described the transcriptional profiles that are associated with the developmental stages of adventitious root formation in the model tree poplar (Populus trichocarpa). Transcriptome analyses indicate a highly specific temporal induction of the AINTEGUMENTA LIKE 1 (PtAIL 1) transcription factor of the AP 2 family during adventitious root formation. Transgenic poplar samples that overexpressed PtAIL 1 were able to grow an increased number of adventitious roots, whereas RNA interference mediated the down-expression of PtAIL 1 expression, which led to a delay in adventitious root formation. Microarray analysis showed that the expression of 15 genes, including the transcription factors AGAMOUS-Like 6 and MYB 36, was overexpressed in the stem tissues that generated root primordia in PtAIL 1 -overexpressing plants, whereas their expression was reduced in the RNA interference lines. These results demonstrate that PtAIL 1 is a positive regulator of poplar rooting that acts early in the development of adventitious roots...|$|R

Here we describe a new, fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of <b>Phenotypic</b> <b>Elites</b> (MAP-Elites) algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single, high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of the search space, it also tends {{to find a better}} overall solution than state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots.

Given the high plasticity of syllepsis, we established a field trial to monitor the performance of these trees under outdoor conditions and a SRC management. Results: We examined two CsRAV 1 -overexpression poplar events for their ability to maintain syllepsis and their potential to enhance biomass production. Two poplar events with reduced expression of the CsRAV 1 homologous poplar genes PtaRAV 1 and PtaRAV 2 were also included in the trial. Under our culture conditions, CsRAV 1 -overexpression poplars continued developing syllepsis over two cultivation cycles. Biomass production increased on completion of the first cycle for one of the overexpression events, showing unaltered structural, chemical, or combustion wood properties. On completion of the second cycle, aerial growth and biomass yields of both overexpression events were reduced as compared to the control.

40|$|The {{increasing}} loss {{of forest}} resources in tropical countries leaves farmers without {{the food and}} other products {{that used to be}} gathered locally. This coupled with land degradation creates a poverty trap from which it is difficult for smallholder farmers to escape. To address these problems, the domestication of new perennial crops from traditionally important indigenous trees is seen as a way to diversify farming systems making them more sustainable through the provision of a range of products and environmental services. This enriches existing mixed tree/crop farming systems and creates new ones that are more productive and enhance the livelihoods of poor households. A participatory approach to tree domestication is used to ensure that farmers' needs are met. <b>Elite</b> <b>trees</b> are {{selected on the basis of}} 'ideotypes' derived from quantitative data of the tree-to-tree variation in many commercially important traits. Genetically superior cultivars are then developed using simple techniques of vegetative propagation. In parallel with domestication, markets are being developed for the products from these new crops so that integrated mixtures of food crops and agroforestry trees can generate income, as well as social and environmental benefits. This approach is thus in accord with the findings of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), which has recently identified the need for agriculture to be more multi-functional and to simultaneously achieve economic, social and environmentally sustainability by restoring:- biological resources and natural capital (soil fertility, water, forests, etc); livelihoods (nutrition, health, culture, equity, income) and agroecological processes (nutrient and water cycles, pest and disease control, etc.) ...|$|R

In Sweden the method of forest cultures is used on 75 %, in Finland – 84 %, in Czech Republic – 78 %, in Poland – 85 %, in Ukraine – 79 %. In Germany a share of natural restoration of woods is more than 50 %, in Lithuania – 25 %, however 31 % from total amount is mixed forest cultures. In Russia the method of natural renewal is used on 78 % of sites, but growth of volumes of use of a containerized planting material and mixed forest cultures is observed.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the inter-relationships between the traits characterising tree-to-tree variation in fruits and kernels is fundamental {{to the development of}} selected cultivars based on multiple trait selection. Using data from previously characterised marula (Sclerocarya birrea) trees in Bushbuckridge, South Africa and North Central Region of Namibia, this study examines the relationships between the different traits (fruit pulp, flesh/juice mass, and nut shell and kernel mass) as a means to determine the opportunities to develop cultivars. Strong and highly significant relationships were found between fruit mass and pulp mass in trees from South Africa and Namibia, indicating that size is a good predictor of fruit pulp production. However, fruit size is not a good predictor of nut or kernel production, as there were weak relationships between fruit and nut and/or kernel mass, which varied between sites and landuses. Generally, the relationships between fruit mass and kernel mass were weaker than between fruit mass and nut mass. Relationships between kernel mass and shell mass were generally weak. The lack of strong relationships between fruit and kernel mass does, however, imply that there are opportunities to identify trees with either big fruits/small nuts for pulp production, or trees with large kernels in relatively small fruits for kernel oil production. However, within fruits from the same tree, nuts could contain 0 – 4 kernels, indicating that even in trees with an inherent propensity for large kernels, improved pollination may be required to maximise kernel mass through an increase in kernel number. Finally, the relationships between percentage kernel oil content and the measured morphological traits were also very weak. The conclusions of these results are that there is merit in identifying different combinations of traits for the selection of trees producing either pulp or kernels. Consequently, fruit and kernel ‘ideotypes’ are presented as guides to the selection of <b>elite</b> <b>trees</b> for cultivar development. These results have important implications for the domestication of the species as a producer of fruits or kernels for food/beverages or cosmetic oils...|$|R

Furthermore, a need for evaluating the productivity of different cocoa clones and for the documentation of best practices was expressed. In order to address these points, several research activities were carried out: 1. 16 cocoa clones have been evaluated for productivity and susceptibility to P&D for four consecutive years (2010 — 13) in on-farm trials at multiple locations. 2. The yield development and prevalence of P&D in the fields of four outstanding farmers was assessed for two years (2012 – 13) Data analysis revealed that some locally selected clones (<b>elite</b> <b>tree</b> selection program) were not only among the most productive, but also showed earliest maturation and some degree of resistance to Monilia (i. e. with lower incidences of the disease). Thus these clones hold the potential to escape attacks by P&D which occur later on in the season and may serve as a basis for further germplasm development towards clones with resistance to Monilia. However, before disseminating information to farmers and farmers’ organisations, sound scientific data from at least five years is required...|$|R
30|$|The {{environmental}} factors strongly affected the yield components. However, we only conducted a 45 -day {{survey of the}} {{environmental factors}}, and thus, {{we were unable to}} evaluate the effect of environmental factors on heading date, plant height, and various yield components. The effect of various environmental factors on the entire growth period should be investigated in a future study. We found that some RILs showed extremely large variations among four areas, whereas only a few RILs exhibited a stable phenotype in all four areas. The molecular mechanism underlying the stability of a phenotype among different areas requires further investigation. The stable lines may also serve as a rare germplasm for breeding highly adaptable varieties that exhibit <b>elite</b> <b>phenotypic</b> features in different areas.|$|R
40|$|Tamarindus indica (Tamarind) is a wild {{tropical}} tree species, over exploited commercially {{in third}} world countries but remains unimproved and neglected. Tissue culture has the potential to propagate <b>elite</b> genotypes of <b>trees.</b> Micropropagation of Tamarindus indica was achieved through adventitious shoots or axillary bud proliferation from nodes of adult trees (10 - 15 years old) on MS medium with BA, Kin. Proliferation of shoots continued on the medium with reduced levels of growth regulators and vitamins. Rooting was obtained with IBA. Nodal explants from young shoots responded better in comparison with the explants from mature shoots {{in the early stages of}} establishment of cultures and rooting of shoots...|$|R
40|$|A {{participatory}} approach to tree domestication is being pioneered by ICRAF and international partners in Cameroon and Nigeria. The domestication of Dacryodes edulis offers opportunities {{to improve the}} livelihoods of subsistence farmers and to diversify farming systems, such as cocoa farms. The trees produce marketable fruits as well as shade for cocoa and coffee. Twenty-four ripe fruits were collected from each of 100 D. edulis trees in Mgbuisi, southeast Nigeria by subsistence farmers. There was continuous and significant tree-to-tree variation in fruit mass (10. 2 ± 0. 5 – 71. 4 ± 1. 3 g), flesh mass (6. 8 ± 0. 3 – 62. 2 ± 1. 2 g) and kernel mass (1. 3 ± 0. 5 – 15. 1 ± 0. 4 g). Mean fruit mass {{did not differ significantly}} between different land uses. Flesh mass:kernel mass ratio varied from 0. 79 to 29. 0. Two trees had fruits without kernels. There was also continuous and significant tree-to-tree variation in fruit length (39. 0 ± 0. 6 – 95. 1 ± 1. 2 mm), fruit width (21. 82 ± 0. 16 – 43. 75 ± 0. 33 mm) and flesh thickness (1. 82 ± 0. 1 – 6. 39 ± 0. 1 mm). Fruit length:width ratio varied from 1. 35 to 3. 18. Cooked fruits varied in taste with only 14 % of trees getting the highest score. Similarly, fruits varied in oiliness with only 3 % of trees getting the highest score. Thirteen skin colours were recorded, with the most common being dark blue (31 %), greyish violet (29 %) and deep blue (9 %). Ninety-nine percent of the trees had been planted, with 57 % in homegardens, 22 % in crop fields, 17 % in fallow land and 4 % in cocoa. Tree height ranged from 4 to 22 m, and DBH from 9. 55 to 63. 65 cm. Tree age ranged from 5 to 64 years. Farmers reported first fruiting from age 3 up to 22 years (average of 9. 4 years). Most trees originated from seeds bought in markets (63 %). Market prices of fruits from different trees, ranged from 2 to 12 fruits for 10 Naira (US 0. 07). These quantitative results will help in the identification of <b>elite</b> <b>trees</b> of D. edulis for cultivar development through clonal propagation...|$|R
40|$|Correlation between genetic {{characters}} and growth para-meters was studied {{with respect to}} four provenance samples, which {{are part of a}} 47 -year-old provenance trial of Scots pine. Two samples with superior growth were contrasted with two weakly growing samples. Based on a sample size of 100 trees per provenance, genotypes were monitored at 16 enzyme coding gene loci. Effects between genetic and growth traits were studied by means of two-factorial analysis of variance and linear regression models with respect to diameter classes and subsets of <b>elite</b> and non-elite <b>trees</b> within provenance samples as well as diameter subsets of pooled provenance samples. Significant deviations are evident among the genetic struc-tures of the four provenance samples. In each sample, devia-tions from HARDY-WEINBERG structures are indicated at single loci. Inbreeding does not primarily account for such deviations. The study of diameter classes reveals that an increase of stem volume tends to coincide with an increase of the observed heterozygosities in three out of four provenance samples. In the case of two-locus genotypes at 6 -PGDH and MDH-C, significant effects of heterozygosity on diameter growth are observed. By focusing the two most frequent alleles at six differentiation effective gene loci, significant relations to diameter growth can be particularly verified for two locus combinations including AAT-A. The genetic comparison of the <b>elite</b> and non-elite <b>trees,</b> the first subset reveals larger values for diversities, differentia-tion and heterozygosities than the second does. The genetic comparison between the subset of the 50 thinnest and the 50 thickest trees among the 400 individuals indicates higher values for the genetic multiplicity and the gene pool and multi-locus diversity for the subsets with superior growth. It is con-cluded for the present that isoenzyme gene markers reveal an indicative potential for quantitative traits.

40|$|Eucalyptus globulus Labill. {{has been}} used in Spain for decades as a {{cellulose}} source for the paper and textile industry. Since 1997, Sniace group has tested new provenances and families from 29 different Eucalyptus species to explore their capacity for biomass and bioenergy production. Plus trees for growth, wood quality, rooting capacity and tolerance to Mycosphaerella sp have been identified by mass selection, and more than 300 controlled crosses among those trees have been carried out. However, the restrictions caused by the high susceptibility to Mycosphaerella leaf disease and the low rooting capacity of the species Eucalyptus globulus Labill. delay the application of the gains to a commercial scale. The objective of this project is to improve the production of Eucalyptus in the North of Spain focused on the improvement of two traits of economic importance: clonal/rooting capacity and tolerance to Mycosphaerella sp. To achieve this goal three partial objectives have been approached: Mass propagation of selected adult clones and rooting improvement by in vitro tissue culture Clonal propagation by sequential subcultures of axillary buds in proliferation and elongation media and further rooting of elongated shoots will be developed. This will further optimize a simple in vitro protocol for the micropropagation of identified <b>elite</b> mature <b>trees</b> for raising plantations. Micropropagation can maintain selection gains, developed in improvement programmes...|$|R
40|$|Tea tree oil {{production}} from leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia {{is a significant}} agricultural industry with the establishment in recent years of large plantation crops in Australia and several other countries. The oil is highly valued in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries for its broad-spectrum germicidal properties. Considerable differences in oil yield and composition are {{of particular interest to}} commercial producers, and suggest significant genotypic variability. However, apart from some limited varietal selection, little breeding work has been conducted. Sampling of M. alternifolia leaf material was undertaken from 40 sites throughout the geographic range of the species, which is endemic to north-eastern New South Wales and far south-east Queensland, Australia. Genotypic diversity within the species was studied utilising specifically developed microsatellite DNA markers. These were used to study the genotypic distribution within the species population and between subpopulations. Oil yield and quality analyses were conducted from more than 600 samples in order to identify superior varieties for future commercial production. More importantly, data from the research provides the foundation for a tea tree breeding program to pursue further varietal improvement. Analysis of the microsatellite genotype distributions and the oil phenotypes has facilitated the development of an optimal breeding strategy aimed at parent selection for efficient generation of <b>elite</b> tea <b>tree</b> varieties. The research also lends itself to the future possibility of marker-assisted breeding...|$|R

The employment {{of the techniques}} of plant tissue culture for the propagation and the genetic improvement of forest trees are importants support tool to the reforestation programs {{and the establishment of}} clonal seed orchards. This work's main objective was the development of a methodology for the in vitro clonal propagation of teak, starting from <b>elite</b> <b>trees.</b> As explants source apical shoots from epicormic buds were used, which were placed in the basal medium of Schenk and Hildebrandt supplemented with 0. 5 mg/L of BAr, Bourgin and Nitsch micronutrients and solidified with agar. For the proliferation phase it was used the basal medium of Murashige and Skoog with half of the normal NH 4 N 03 and KN 03 concentration. Different concentrations of BAP were evaluated (0, 0, 1, 0, 5 and 1, 0 mg/L). The biggest multiplication coefficient and better quality of the buds was achieved with 0. 5 mg/L of BAP. The rooting was carried out under ex vitro conditions; were used microcutings between 1. 5 and 2. 0 em of length. Then, they were treated with different concentrations of IBA (0, 250, 500, 1. 000, 2. 000, 4. 000 and 5. 000 mg/L). The biggest rooting percentage and plantlets survival was achieved with 4000 mg/L of IBA.
