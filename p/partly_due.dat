5|$|A {{number of}} songs written by Mendelssohn's sister Fanny {{originally}} appeared under her brother's name; {{this may have}} been <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to the prejudice of the family, and partly to her own retiring nature.|$|E
5|$|Aikido derives {{mainly from}} the martial art of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to Ueshiba's {{involvement}} with the Ōmoto-kyō religion. Ueshiba's early students' documents bear the term aiki-jūjutsu.|$|E
5|$|Denver's {{automotive}} beltway {{does not}} include a component in the northwest sector, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to concerns over unremediated plutonium contamination.|$|E
50|$|He is {{also well}} known for the drama Romanticismo, whose success was <b>partly</b> <b>dued</b> to its {{patriotic}} content; it was later adaptated in a film with the same name directed by Clemente Fracassi and starred by Amedeo Nazzari and Clara Calamai. In theatre Romanticismo and I disonesti found in Paola Pezzaglia an ideal interpreter.|$|R
50|$|Spencer was a trombonist who, {{after playing}} in the band that he led from 1946 to 1949, gave up playing entirely, <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> to a heart murmur, <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> to the hard {{economics}} of big bands in {{that began in the}} late 1940s, and <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> to the band's record label, Black & White Records, which went out of business in October 1949.|$|R
25|$|Christchurch Hospital was <b>partly</b> {{evacuated}} <b>due</b> {{to damage}} in some areas, but remained open throughout {{to treat the}} injured.|$|R
5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to the promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for French military personnel.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, the {{domestic}} and international demand for durian in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region has increased significantly, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to the increasing affluence of Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{consumption}} of coffee, vitamin C and dairy products, {{as well as}} physical fitness, appear to decrease the risk. This is believed to be <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to their effect in reducing insulin resistance.|$|E
50|$|The {{preceding}} {{budget of}} the Labour Party in March was only <b>partly</b> enacted <b>due</b> to the calling of the election.|$|R
50|$|Kenny George is from Chicago, Illinois. In October 2008, George had {{his right}} foot <b>partly</b> amputated <b>due</b> to a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.|$|R
50|$|Seismic surveys {{indicate}} that the Reed Bank is rich in oil and gas deposits, but they have only been <b>partly</b> tapped <b>due</b> to disputed claims from various countries, most particularly the PRC.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of SEATO members were not located in Southeast Asia. To Australia and New Zealand, SEATO {{was seen as}} a more satisfying organization than ANZUS – a collective defense organization with the U.S. The United Kingdom and France joined <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to having long maintained colonies in the region, and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to concerns over developments in Indochina. Pakistan, however, was simply interested in joining over the appeal of potential support for its long struggle against India. Last but not least, the U.S. upon perceiving Southeast Asia to be a pivotal frontier for Cold War geopolitics saw the establishment of SEATO as essential to its Cold War containment policy.|$|E
5|$|Before The 3rd Birthdays {{release in}} 2010, both Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura {{discussed}} the re-release of Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve II. The release {{was being held}} up <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to the series rights being co-owned with Hideaki Sena.|$|E
5|$|By 1858, Malo-Galipeau {{had become}} widely {{recognised}} as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to {{her role as}} Mother Superior and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to the endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival. This understanding was reflected in published works of the time, including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853. However, during Bourget's visit to the Institute in late 1858, he made {{a speech to the}} assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church, Cadron-Jetté should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation. He also bestowed upon Cadron-Jetté the title of Mother (such that her religious name became Mother Mary of the Nativity, or Mère de la Nativité) and confirmed that she was second in authority only to the current Mother Superior of the community.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1939-40 season the {{reserves}} played two Football Combination games and one Southern League game before football was <b>partly</b> suspended <b>due</b> to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|R
5000|$|... (CC) day off or <b>partly</b> day off <b>due</b> to {{collective}} contract (German: Kollektivvertrag) ...|$|R
25|$|Infrastructure failure. According to the WHO, 50% {{of medical}} {{equipment}} {{in developing countries}} is only <b>partly</b> usable <b>due</b> to lack of skilled operators or parts. As a result, diagnostic procedures or treatments cannot be performed, leading to substandard treatment.|$|R
5|$|David Villa {{ended the}} season with a large amount of his {{appearances}} coming from the bench, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to the recovery time of his previous injury. Despite this, he was still able to amass 16 goals in 39 appearances while his performances earned him a spot in Spain's 2013 Confederations Cup squad.|$|E
5|$|Houston is multicultural, in {{part because}} of its many {{academic}} institutions and strong industries, as well as being a major port city. Over 90languages are spoken in the city. It has among the youngest populations in the nation, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to an influx of immigrants into Texas. An estimated 400,000 undocumented immigrants reside in the Houston area.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} was subject to {{significant}} delays due to cost overruns and contract re-negotiations. This was <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to difficulties combining refurbished Nimrod MR2 fuselages, which had not been built to a common standard, with newly built wings. The numbers of aircraft to be procured fell from 21 to nine over a course of years, while costs continued to climb.|$|E
50|$|His 2007 {{season was}} <b>partly</b> {{disrupted}} <b>due</b> to a broken hand sustained in May, {{and he did}} not make a first team appearance although won the Giants Reserves Player of the Year award {{at the end of the}} season.|$|R
50|$|Infrastructure failure. According to the WHO, 50% {{of medical}} {{equipment}} {{in developing countries}} is only <b>partly</b> usable <b>due</b> to lack of skilled operators or parts. As a result, diagnostic procedures or treatments cannot be performed, leading to substandard treatment.|$|R
50|$|Fort Ia (Boyen). Built 1887-1890 in Minikowo. Moats <b>partly</b> contain water, <b>due</b> {{to damage}} to {{drainage}} pipes.|$|R
5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in late summer and early fall, but are often weak {{by the time they}} reach Washington, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to the city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{spent seven}} months of {{recording}} and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, he wanted the album {{to be released in}} March, but it was pushed back to August, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to the prolonged success of The Winner's Journey and partly because of the large amount of songs they had to cull.|$|E
5|$|Magnus's kingship {{has been}} downplayed in later history <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to his short tenure, and {{because most of}} it was {{together}} with his brother. The subsequently long reign of Olaf also contributed to overshadow Magnus's reign, combined {{with the fact that the}} later Norwegian royal dynasties only descended (or claimed descent) from Olaf.|$|E
25|$|Infrastructure {{failure is}} also a concern. According to the WHO, 50% of medical {{equipment}} in developing countries is only <b>partly</b> usable <b>due</b> to lack of skilled operators or parts. As a result, diagnostic procedures or treatments cannot be performed, leading to substandard treatment.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} of the abbey buildings still extant is its church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, whose construction began in 1208 with the transept and the apse. The edifice remained <b>partly</b> unfinished, <b>due</b> to financial and political troubles within the order.|$|R
50|$|There {{have also}} been {{concerns}} over potential eye pain caused by users new to Glass. These concerns were validated by Google's optometry advisor Dr. Eli Peli of Harvard, though he later <b>partly</b> backtracked <b>due</b> to the controversy which ensued from his remarks.|$|R
5|$|On {{the day of}} the wedding, Mr. Burns and Jacqueline {{attempt to}} marry. However, Grampa crashes the {{ceremony}} and asks that Jacqueline marry him instead. <b>Partly</b> <b>due</b> to Mr. Burns' boorish behavior, she decides not to marry either man. Deciding that Jacqueline decision is good enough for him, Grampa grabs her and they run out of the church and onto on a bus.|$|E
5|$|Salford {{is covered}} by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, and the Church of England Diocese of Manchester. During the mid-19th century, there was an influx of Irish people into the Salford area, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to The Great Hunger in Ireland. In 1848, Salford Roman Catholic Cathedral was consecrated, {{reflecting}} Salford's large Irish-born community at the time.|$|E
5|$|Today, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> to the {{foresight}} or business acumen of Ralph Hawkes, the company controls the copyrights in major 20th-century music. It also publishes many prominent contemporary composers and the company's New York branch has developed its own catalogue emphasising {{the works of}} American composers.|$|E
5000|$|The Scarlet Empire had {{a longer}} life than many popular novels enjoy, however. This was <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> to its humor and its {{effective}} storytelling—and <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> to effective promotion by capitalist interests. (The novel was serialized in American Industries, the magazine of the National Association of Manufacturers.) The book went through multiple editions; {{as late as}} 1954, L. Sprague de Camp would {{refer to it as}} a [...] "well-known" [...] work.|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} {{action on the}} kidneys is not understood completely, but may be <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> to nephrotoxic metabolites of myoglobin.|$|R
50|$|It {{is located}} {{on the north side of}} the Water of Leith, and has an {{impressive}} landscape; partly planned, <b>partly</b> unplanned <b>due</b> to recent neglect. It lies in the Inverleith Conservation Area and is also a designated Local Nature Conservation Site. The cemetery is protected as a Category A listed building.|$|R
