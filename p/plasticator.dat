40|$|WO 2006069696 A UPAB: 20060801 NOVELTY - Preparation of fine {{particles}} of metals or metal compounds mixed with thermoelastic and/or themoplastic polymers, comprises: producing a solution {{from at least}} a precursor substance, which is adapted under prevailing conditions in the <b>plasticator,</b> {{in at least a}} solvent; dispersing the solution with plasticised polymer in the plasticator; and producing the {{fine particles}}. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preparation of fine particles of metals or metal compounds mixed with thermoelastic and/or themoplastic polymers, (in which at least one polymer, which is plastified in a <b>plasticator,</b> adding the fines to the plastified polymer, extruding the plastified polymer that is interspersed with fines from the <b>plasticator,</b> allowing to solidify and forming a molded polymer element) comprises: producing a solution from at least a precursor substance, which is adapted to react to the substance of the desired fine particles from metals/metal compounds under prevailing conditions in the <b>plasticator,</b> in at least a solvent; dispersing the solution with plasticised polymer in the plasticator; and producing the fine particles in situ, from the solution of the precursor substance, where the thermal/pressure-initiated/catalytic reaction of the precursor substance with the <b>plasticator</b> are adjusted catalytically; and/or by reacting the precursor substance with a reactant, optionally further reaction products by a catalytic reaction, and forming the fines. USE - The polymer fine particles are useful in the manufacture of polymer molded articles (polymer electrolyte membrane (preferably gas cells) and in polymer foils, granulates or packing containers. ADVANTAGE - The preparation of polymer fine particles is simple and economical. The polymer fine particles are anti-bacterially effective. The fine particles are non-toxic to lungs due to their particular particle size of approximately 1 pm or less. The handling and processing of the fine particles are free...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two rotor {{configurations}} {{were designed}} for the continuous <b>plasticator</b> in this paper. The rotor configuration, rotor speed and machine barrel temperature were set as the variable parameters in this contrast experiment. What’s more, the experimental investigation showed that, the three factors had effects on the plastication performance. When the temperature of machine barrels and extrusion dies reached C 060 and the rotor speed was at min 30 r, the plastication performance of two rotor configurations was relatively better. And the rotor configuration II was better than I by synthesizing all kinds of factors...|$|E
40|$|Natural rubber (NR) nanocomposites were {{prepared}} in a double-roller <b>plasticator</b> mixer with purified attapulgite (PAT) or modified attapulgite, which was treated at 450 °C (PAT- 450) and 850 °C (PAT- 850) for two hours. The {{structures of the}} pristine, purified, and modified attapulgite were characterized by FTIR, TEM, XRD, and BET. The {{results indicated that the}} structure of attapulgite changed with the increased temperature. The effects of the PAT treatment and content on the mechanical properties of the NR nanocomposites were also investigated. The results showed that AT increased curing process of natural rubber. A significant improvement in the tensile strength, wearability, and solvent resistance of the nanocomposites was observed with the addition of different types of attapulgite as compared to those of pure NR. Scanning electron microscope images showed that the filler was located at the interface, which induced compatibilization in the immiscible blends. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed a significant improvement in the thermal stability of the NR/PAT nanocomposites...|$|E
