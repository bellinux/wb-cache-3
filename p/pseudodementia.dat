Data indicate that some of the disorders that can convert to a pseudodementia-like presentation include depression (mood), schizophrenia, mania, dissociative disorders, Ganser syndrome, conversion reaction, and psychoactive drugs (2). Although the frequency distribution of disorders presenting as <b>pseudodementia</b> remains unclear, {{what is clear is that}} depressive <b>pseudodementia,</b> synonymously referred to as depressive dementia(3) or major depression with depressive dementia (4), represents a major subclass of the overarching category of <b>pseudodementia</b> (4).It has long been observed that in the differential diagnosis between dementia and <b>pseudodementia,</b> depressive <b>pseudodementia</b> appears to be the single most difficult disorder to distinguish from nosologically established [...] "organic" [...] categories of dementia(5), especially degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer type (6).Depressive <b>Pseudodementia</b> is a syndrome seen in older people in which they exhibit symptoms consistent with dementia but the cause is actually depression.|$|E

Clinically, people with <b>pseudodementia</b> differ from those with true dementia when their memory is tested. They will often answer that they don't {{know the answer to}} a question, and their attention and concentration are often intact, and they may appear upset or distressed. Those with true dementia will often give wrong answers, have poor attention and concentration, and appear indifferent or unconcerned.|$|E
50|$|Ganser {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} dissociative disorder previously classified as a factitious disorder. It is characterized by nonsensical or wrong answers to questions or doing things incorrectly, other dissociative symptoms such as fugue, amnesia or conversion disorder, often with visual pseudohallucinations and a decreased state of consciousness. It is also sometimes called nonsense syndrome, balderdash syndrome, syndrome of approximate answers, <b>pseudodementia,</b> hysterical <b>pseudodementia</b> or prison psychosis. This last name, prison psychosis, is sometimes used because the syndrome occurs most frequently in prison inmates, where it {{may be seen as}} an attempt to gain leniency from prison or court officials.|$|E
50|$|Investigations such as SPECT imaging of {{the brain}} show reduced blood flow in areas {{of the brain}} in people with Alzheimer's disease, {{compared}} with a more normal blood flow in those with <b>pseudodementia.</b>|$|E
50|$|In general, <b>pseudodementia</b> {{patients}} {{present a}} considerable cognitive deficits, including disorders in learning, memory and psychomotor performance. Substantial evidences from brain imaging such as CT scanning and {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) have also revealed abnormalities in brain structure and function.|$|E
50|$|As {{certain of}} <b>pseudodementia</b> remains {{potentially}} treatable, {{it is essential}} that they are distinguished from primarily dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), and multi-infarct dementia (MID). For instance, <b>pseudodementia</b> associated with depression (DD) has been found as the most frequently appearing, while as many as 10% to 20% patients are misdiagnosed as primary degenerative dementia (PDD) or vice versa. A significant overlapping in cognitive and neuropsychological dysfunction in DD and PDD patients seemed to increase the difficulty in diagnosis. However, differences in the severity of impairment and quality of patients' responses could be observed, and DD patients exhibited a greater depressive symptomatology. Additionally, a test of antisaccadic movements may be used to differentiate DD from PDD patients. as PDD patients significantly display poorer performance on this test. A general comparison between aspects of DD and PDD is shown below.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the term}} of [...] "reversible" [...] has been used, it simply implies a high {{possibility}} of recovery from the disease.

[...] Poor results have also been reported in Copeland et al. (1992)'s studies, as 1 out of 21 DD patients had fully recovered. Thus, attention should be arisen that the diagnosis of reversible or <b>pseudodementia</b> needs to be given with extreme care, and the recovery pattern for individual patient remains uncertain.|$|E
50|$|Some mental illnesses, {{including}} {{depression and}} psychosis, may produce symptoms {{that must be}} differentiated from both delirium and dementia. Therefore, any dementia evaluation should include a depression screening such as the Neuropsychiatric Inventory or the Geriatric Depression Scale.

This is called <b>pseudodementia.</b> However, in recent years researchers have realized that many older people with memory complaints in fact have MCI, the earliest stage of dementia. Depression should always remain {{high on the list of}} possibilities, however, for an elderly person with memory trouble.|$|E

One night, after getting a beating [...] "for being a wiseass," [...] Munch told his father that he hated his guts. That {{was the last thing}} he ever said to his father before his father committed suicide; for years afterward, he believes that his father's death was his fault. Munch has an uncle, Andrew (played by Jerry Lewis), who suffers from depressive <b>pseudodementia.</b> Andrew is found by Elliot Stabler living as a transient in Manhattan, and is subsequently reunited with his nephew. Andrew, however, reacts badly to his antidepressant medication, which triggers a mania that results in his taking a personal vendetta against a suspected rapist/murderer SVU is investigating, eventually killing the man by pushing him in front of a subway train. Andrew refuses to plead insanity and take further medication, and says goodbye to his nephew one last time before being sent to prison. [...] In a deleted scene from the third season of Homicide, Munch mentions to both Meldrick Lewis and Tim Bayliss that he had an uncle who lived up north but was unsure of what became of him—this is presumably Andrew. Munch is affected by the death of a young girl who lived near him when he was younger; he blames himself, at least partially, for not noticing that she was being abused by her mother, despite seeing her every day when he came home from school. In the 14th-season SVU episode [...] "Twenty-Five Acts," [...] it is mentioned that Munch's mother is living in a retirement community.|$|E

General paralysis was the commonest diagnosis put forward to account for patients with depression who went on to develop dementia. Patients so diagnosed, however, often recovered and clinical and statistical analysis of Mairet's case histories suggests that some were in fact suffering from depressive <b>pseudodementia.</b> Evidence is marshalled to show that during the 19 th century there was wide disagreement concerning the clinical domain, course and even histopathology of general paralysis.

Patients presenting with com-binations of cognitive, affective, and behavioral problems pose a clinical conundrum.

40|$|Background and Aim: Depressive <b>pseudodementia</b> (DPD) is a {{condition}} which may develop secondary to depression. The {{aim of this study}} was to contribute to the differential diagnosis between Alzheimer disease (AD) and DPD by comparing the neurocognitive tests and hippocampal volume. Materials and Methods: Patients who met criteria of AD/DPD were enrolled in the study. All patients were assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), clock-drawing test, Stroop test, Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT), Boston Naming Test, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Hippocampal volume was measured by importing the coronal T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance images to the Vitrea 2 workstation. Results: A significant difference was found between the AD and DPD groups on the WMS test, clock-drawing test, Stroop test, Boston Naming Test, MMSE, GDS, and left hippocampal volume. A significant correlation between BFRT and bilateral hippocampal volumes was found in the AD group. No correlation was found among parameters in DPD patients. Conclusions: Our results suggest that evaluation of facial recognition and left hippocampal volume may provide more reliable evidence for distinguishing DPD from AD. Further investigations combined with functional imaging techniques including more patients are needed...|$|E
40|$|The author reports {{three cases}} of <b>pseudodementia</b> {{and discuss the}} {{difficulties}} in establishing limits between normality and illness in the elderly. The mental and neuropathological changes that accompany the normal ageing of the brain {{are similar to those}} of early Alzheimer's dementia (AD). These similarities often lead to difficulties in the differential diagnosis, hence the search for consensus criteria. The decline of working and secondary memory is greater than that of primary and tertiary memory, as is found in AD. On the other hand, tests of delayed recall of 10 to 15 unrelated words, logical memory, categorical thinking, visuo-motor-spatial skills, and Boston Naming Test have been pointed out as the most discriminative. Neuroimaging findings of atrophy or hipoperfusion in the entorhinal-hippocampal or temporo-parietal regions are suggestive of DA, but they can be lacking in the early stages of this disease. In the conclusion, the author suggests the diagnostic process should be based on a comprehensive neuropsychological and behavioral evaluation (including a survey of the subject's premorbid level of cognitive and socio-occupational functioning), supplemented by neuroimaging and laboratory tests. If inconclusive, the whole evaluation can be repeated after 4 to 6 months, to check the consistency of the findings...|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of new treatments, there is an increasing need for early diagnosis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, biological markers allowing positive diagnosis early {{in the course of the}} disease are highly desirable. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of protein tau were shown to be significantly increased in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Although sensitivity is high, poor specificity limits the diagnostic value of this marker. The same is true for the 42 amino acid isoform of beta-amyloid protein that is significantly decreased in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease patients. However, combining both markers could improve specificity at least allowing differentiation between Alzheimer's disease, normal ageing and depressive <b>pseudodementia.</b> Other biological markers such as cerebrospinal fluid levels of neurotransmitters, cytokines or superoxide dismutase were shown to have even less diagnostic value. The apolipoprotein epsilon 4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease but not a diagnostic marker as many individuals who inherit epsilon 4 do not develop the disease. Till now, a single diagnostic marker allowing discrimination between Alzheimer's disease and other dementias does not exist. Combined cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta-amyloid protein and tau protein might be used as a marker that helps discriminating Alzheimer's disease from normal ageing and depression. </p...|$|E
40|$|Dementia {{is a major}} {{burden for}} many {{countries}} including South Korea, where life expectancy is continuously growing {{and the proportion of}} aged people is rapidly growing. Neurodegenerative disorders, such as, Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Huntington disease, can cause dementia, and cerebrovascular disease also can cause dementia. Depression or hypothyroidism also can cause cognitive deficits, but they are reversible by management of underlying cause unlike the forementioned dementias. Therefore these are called <b>pseudodementia.</b> We are entering an era of dementia care that will be based upon the identification of potentially modifiable risk factors and early disease markers, and the application of new drugs postpone progression of dementias or target specific proteins that cause dementia.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{utility of}} some electrophysiologic studies such as long latency 'cognitive ' event-re-lated potentials (ERPs) remains controversial. A number of authors have studied this question but no consensus of opinion had emerged. Most clini-cal {{studies on the}} ERP {{have been on the}} P 3 or P 300 component and my remarks will therefore be confined to a discussion of this component and its clinical role. P 3 is an electropositive wave that occurs approximately 300 msec after an infre-quently occurring stimulus to which the subject is attending. It has been linked experimentally to such variables as expectancy, task difficulty and memory. Because of this apparent relationship to 'cognitive ' functions, it has been used to evaluate demented patients in order to distinguish 'true' dementia from the <b>pseudodementia</b> hat can occur in depression or other psychiatric disorders. Most authors agree that if the P 3 response permitted this distinction to be made, the test would be of clinical value. Thus, the controversy that exists relates principally to the reliability of the test in making this distinction. There are many reasons for the differences of opinion regarding the clinical utility of P 3, includ-ing confusion about what constitutes clinical util-ity.

40|$|Amnesia (Fig. 1) {{has been}} defined as ‘an {{abnormal}} mental state in which memory and learning are affected out of all proportion to other cognitive functions in an otherwise alert and responsive patient ’ (Victor 1971). Memory impairment can affect the learning of new material (anterograde amnesia), owing to impairments in the encoding, storage or retrieval stages. It can also affect the recall of previously acquired memories (retrograde amnesia), which might involve personal experiences (episodic memory), general information (semantic memory) or perceptuomotor skills (procedural memory). Psychological factors can cause both anterograde and retrograde memory loss (or a combination of the two). Types of psychogenic amnesia Psychologically based amnesia includes the persistent anterograde memory impairment present in mental disorders such as depression, which in an extreme form can lead to depressive <b>pseudodementia.</b> Alternatively, it can cause transient or discrete episodes of retrograde and/or anterograde memory loss, which we refer to here as ‘psychogenic ’ amnesia (i. e. loss not due to identifiable brain disease).

Language impairment is an inherent component of Alzheimer`s disease (AD), which can also be encountered in depressed patients. The {{aim of this study}} wasto compare the profiles of language abilities in late-onset depression and mild AD groups. Methods: We studied 25 patients with late-onset depression (mean age 73. 6 +/- 6. 6 years; schooling 9. 1 +/- 5. 7 years) and 30 patients with mild AD (77. 6 +/- 5. 4 years; 7. 5 +/- 7. 1 years) using the Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD), compared to a group of 30 controls (73. 8 +/- 5. 8 years; 9. 1 +/- 5. 4 years). Cut-off scores to discriminate between Controls x Depression and Depression x AD were determined. Results: Depressed patients` scores were similar to AD in confrontation naming, concept definition, following commands, repetition and reading comprehension (sentence). Episodic memory and mental status subtests were useful in differentiating depressed patients from AD, a result that was reproduced when using analysis of covariance to control for the effect of age in the same subtests (p = 0. 01 and 0. 04, respectively).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to {{identify}} and measure cognitive and social abilities in people with dementia and learning disabilities. In Chapter 1, normal agemg was discussed, distinguishing it from abnormal ageing and highlighting the problems it brings in terms of physical and psychological factors. Normal memory was also discussed and how the processes involved may be effected by dementia. Definitions of dementia were discussed in detail, outlining the neuropathology, neuropsychology and clinical signs of Alzheimer's disease, and the neuropsychology of multi-infarct dementia. The psychology of <b>pseudodementia</b> was presented and discussed and reference was made to the difficulties of a differential diagnosis. This {{was placed in the}} context of defining learning disabilities, such as Down's syndrome, and the complexity of assessing people who have both a learning disability and dementia. Social and cultural differences were discussed together with the influence of environmental factors in measuring dementia. Theoretical considerations about the difficulties in assessing people with learning disabilities, particularly people who have Down's syndrome and dementia, were presented and discussed. These issues arose from the abnormalities in intellectual development and therefore, impacted upon subsequent cognitive rehabilitation and integration into the community of such individuals. A description and critique of the instruments used in the clinical studies ensued with important reference to the reliability, validity, and standard error and norms of each tool used. Finally, the goals of the study series were presented and discussed. Part I: Empirical Studies (Published Papers) Clinical studies were presented in chapters 2 - 5. All clients participating in the studies were randomly selected from consultant psychiatrists' lists ofpeople living in their own homes or in voluntary sector group homes in England. In Chapter 2, a neuropsychological test battery was devised in order to identify dementia in people with Down's syndrome. This battery comprised a series of standardised neuropsychological tests and rating scales measuring intellectual profiling, cognitive and social functioning and ability, and anxiety and depression. In addition to gathering biographical information, self-care information was also gathered. The Dementia Questionnaire for Mentally Retarded Persons proved to be a useful tool for indicating general areas of clients' skills that had declined; however, there is still a need for a definitive assessment of depression for these clients in order to discriminate between the effects of depression and those ofdementia. In Chapter 3, clients with Down's syndrome and non-Down's syndrome learning disabilities were assessed usmg specially selected neuropsychological assessment tools at two points separated by twelve months. Evidence was found to support hypothesis 1 which suggested that people with Down's syndrome show a greater decline in social abilities with age, compared with other groups ofpeople with learning disabilities. Statistically, score changes reflecting the social abilities of the Down's syndrome clients were found to be significantly greater (p <. 002) than those of the non-Down's syndrome clients. Findings were explained in terms of poor language abilities in the Down's syndrome people generally, and the link between declining social abilities and dementia. In Chapter 4, forty-one clients with learning disabilities were assessed using specially selected neuropsychological assessment tools at two time points separated by twelve months. Evidence for hypothesis 1 suggested that people with Down's syndrome show a greater decline in cognitive abilities with age, compared with other groups of people with learning disabilites. A weak linear association (p <. 004; r =. 625; 2 -tailed) between cognitive performance and social abilities was also found for the Down's syndrome clients, supporting hypothesis 2. Findings were explained in terms of the link between declining cognitive abilities and dementia. In Chapter 5, a clinical investigation was undertaken to determine the rate of decline in cognitive and social abilities in 16 clients with learning disabilities, 8 of which had Down's syndrome. Clients assessed at 6 months using specially selected neuropsychological tests and rating scales measuring cognitive and social abilities as well as intellectual profiling. Both Down's syndrome and non-Down's syndrome clients were found to decline in cognitive abilities (Down's syndrome: p <. 005; I-tailed); NonDown's syndrome: p <. 01; I-tailed; p <. 005; I-tailed). The Down's syndrome clients also showed decline in social abilities (p <. 005; I-tailed) over 6 months suggesting that changes between the two client groups may be significantly greater over a longer period, ie 12 months. Hence, the rate of change in cognitive abilities for the Down's syndrome clients was faster. Part 11 : Evaluation of Treatment and Services (Published Papers) In Chapter 6, {{a new version of the}} Benton Visual Retention Test for assessing people's memory functioning was evaluated. Findings showed that the conventional method of testing was preferred and not significantly different in terms of efficacy and reliability of measurement. In Chapter 7, the potential benefits of Aricept, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, was investigated. There were significant effects and benefits for patients who had mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease over a short period of time. However, the results were encouraging as they signalled the first documentation of the effect and a promising future for a possible remission of the disease. In Chapter 8, a support group for wives of husbands with dementia was presented and discussed. The psychoeducation support group was shown to be an effective way of supporting newly diagnosed people with dementia and their carers. In Chapter 9, a new interdisciplinary clinic for people with cognitive abilities was discussed. Importance in the constitution of the clinic personnel as well as the fbcus on assessment and follow-up treatment was emphasised. Part Ill: Future Direction (Published Papers) In Chapter 10, the importance of assessing people with dementia in the early stages of diagnosis and at particular intervals was demonstrated in the context of the legal process. Suggestions were made for improving the test for testamentary capacity. Part IV: In Summary Discussion in Chapter 11 covers the empirical work presented together with suggestions for future research, namely considering the differences between discrete types of dementias such as multi-infarct (vascular) dementia versus Alzheimer's disease and also longitudinal studies. Interesting findings from the clinical studies revealed a greater decline in social abilities of Down's syndrome clients versus non-Down's syndrome clients. These findings were explained in terms of poor language abilities in Down's syndrome clients generally, and the link between declining social abilities and dementia. A link between cognitive performance and social abilities was also found for the Down's syndrome clients. Findings of declining cognitive abilities in both groups of clients were associated with dementia; and in particular, with a failure of the Central Executive System and Articulatory Loop System, considered to be important in nonnal memory. Modifying assessment techniques such as by computerisation is presented and treatment efficacy using the acetycholinesterase inhibitor, Aricept, is presented and discussed. The establishment of cognitive assessment clinics is also presented as a way of providing a comprehensive service for people with early onset dementia. Service implications for people with learning disabilities is discussed and finally, ways of improving the test for testamentary capacity for people with dementia is detailed. Collectively, these writings significantly contribute to our academic and clinical knowledge of assessing dementia. We have learned a great deal from studying and helping people with Down's syndrome; however, perhaps more importantly, this work should contribute significantly to our rather limited knowledge of assessing dementia in people with Down's syndrome and thus may step towards improving and widening access to service provision for these valued people...|$|E
