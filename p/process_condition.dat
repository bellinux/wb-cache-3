The joint research work aims to determine optimised machining <b>process</b> <b>conditions</b> based on advanced signal processing, feature extraction, and pattern recognition, with the scope to classify Acceptable / Not Acceptable <b>process</b> <b>conditions.</b> Turning tests were carried out on under diverse cutting conditions.

50|$|Vibrating viscometers are rugged {{industrial}} systems used {{to measure}} viscosity in the <b>process</b> <b>condition.</b> The active part of the sensor is a vibrating rod. The vibration amplitude varies according to the viscosity of the fluid in which the rod is immersed. These viscosity meters are suitable for measuring clogging fluid and high-viscosity fluids, including those with fibers (up to 1,000 Pa·s). Currently, many industries around the world consider these viscometers {{to be the most}} efficient system with which to measure the viscosities {{of a wide range of}} fluids; by contrast, rotational viscometers require more maintenance, are unable to measure clogging fluid, and require frequent calibration after intensive use. Vibrating viscometers have no moving parts, no weak parts and the sensitive part is very small. Even very basic or acidic fluids can be measured by adding a protective coating such as enamel, or by changing the material of the sensor to a material such as 316L stainless steel.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, person(trait)-oriented praise {{was thought}} to instill a child's belief {{that they have the}} {{capacity}} to succeed, and thus help motivate them to learn. However, social-cognitive theorists have more recently suggested that person-oriented (as opposed to process-oriented) praise may have detrimental impacts on a child's self-perceptions, motivation and learning. For example, praising children for their personal attributes, rather than specifics about their performance, may teach them to make interferences about their global worth, and may thus undermine their intrinsic motivation. In a study of person- versus process-oriented praise, Kamins and Dweck found that children who received person-oriented praise displayed more [...] "helpless" [...] responses following a failure including self-blame, than those in the <b>process</b> <b>condition.</b> Henderlong and Lepper suggest that person-oriented praise may function like tangible rewards, in that they produce desired outcomes in the short-run, but may undermine intrinsic motivation and subsequent perseverance. However, Skipper & Douglas found that although person- versus process-oriented praise (and an objective feedback control group) predicted more negative responses to the first failure, all three groups demonstrated similarly negative responses to the second failure. Thus, the long-term negative consequences of person-oriented praise are still unclear.|$|E

50|$|Biochar is a high-carbon, {{fine-grained}} residue {{that today}} is produced through modern pyrolysis processes; {{it is the}} direct thermal decomposition of biomass {{in the absence of}} oxygen (preventing combustion), which produces a mixture of solids (the biochar proper), liquid (bio-oil), and gas (syngas) products. The specific yield from the pyrolysis is dependent on <b>process</b> <b>condition,</b> such as temperature, and can be optimized to produce either energy or biochar. Temperatures of 400 - 500 C produce more char, while temperatures above 700 C favor the yield of liquid and gas fuel components. Pyrolysis occurs more quickly at the higher temperatures, typically requiring seconds instead of hours. High temperature pyrolysis is also known as gasification, and produces primarily syngas, which has been used as vehicle fuel in some times and places. Typical yields are 60% bio-oil, 20% biochar, and 20% syngas. By comparison, slow pyrolysis can produce substantially more char (~50%); it is this which contributes to the observed soil fertility of terra preta. Once initialized, both processes produce net energy. For typical inputs, the energy required to run a “fast” pyrolyzer is approximately 15% of the energy that it outputs. Modern pyrolysis plants can use the syngas created by the pyrolysis process and output 3-9 times the amount of energy required to run.|$|E
5000|$|Acquiring objects, whether {{temporarily}} {{for loan}} or consideration or permanently for the collection, requires {{a great deal}} of documentation. Once an institution accepts responsibility for the care of an object, certain legal obligations are imposed: the item must be properly stored, maintained, conserved, and made available {{for the benefit of the}} public. [...] Documenting activities pertaining to the stewardship of cultural property can be helpful in recording and assessing the fulfillment of these obligations. Before an object even arrives at an institution, the first piece of documentation produced is an Initial Custody Agreement. This document contains contact information for the owner/source of the object; intention for the outcome of this transaction—gift, loan, purchase, or bequest; responsibilities for insurance, packing, and shipping; and a description of the object. If the object is to be formally accessioned into the permanent collection, a Transfer of Title is also required upon the object's arrival. The documentation required for a transfer of title could be a Deed of Gift or a sale slip. As part of the standard accessioning <b>process,</b> <b>condition</b> reports are also created, numbers are assigned and marked, and photographs can be taken. These initial documents are the beginning of the object's file. If supplementary documentation, such as Donor and Provenance Questionnaires and research files pertaining to the object's history or context/art historical significance are available, they can be included in the file as well. Documentation of the provenance of a work of art has long been a valuable component of art historical research.

30|$|Most of the {{presented}} work considered constant absorptivity {{for various}} set of <b>process</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, in real practice, the absorptivity is not constant and depends on various parameters such as workpiece surface condition, properties of laser beam, temperature at the irradiating {{surface and the}} properties of workpiece material.
