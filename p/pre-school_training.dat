A particularly interesting result of our econometric analysis is that boys and girls follow fundamentally different patterns of schooling. Our model suggests that this could be due to different return from <b>pre-school</b> <b>training</b> in the family's economic activities or it could be related to the wish to have girls ready to be married as early as possible. ...|$|E

The present study investigated nutritional practices in full-day-care pre-schools in Dublin, Ireland, aiming to determine the nutritional support that pre-school managers deem necessary, thereby facilitating the amelioration of existing <b>pre-school</b> nutritional <b>training</b> and practices. A telephone questionnaire completed by pre-school managers (n= 54) examined pre-school dietary practices, food provision and the association between these and <b>pre-school</b> size, nutritional <b>training</b> attendance, possession of the Food and Nutrition Guidelines for Pre-school Services and having a healthy eating policy. Nutritional training needs were also investigated. Twenty-five pre-schools provided all food for attending children; parents were sole providers in six. Thirty-four pre-schools had a written healthy eating policy. Attendance at nutritional training was reported by 40. Possession of the Guidelines (n= 40) did not consistently result in their use. Poor parental and staff involvement in policy and menu development was cited. Although the delayed introduction of iron-containing foods and a feeding beaker in infants was clearly evident, inappropriate beverages and snacks were served to children aged 1 - 5 years in 43 and 37 <b>pre-schools,</b> respectively. <b>Training</b> priorities cited by managers included parental education {{and the provision of}} information regarding menu planning and healthy food choices.

The material produced includes 230 conversations from a Facebook Group used by 210 students and several teachers, field notes and transcribed interviews with nine students. Comparative analysis is used to analyse the Facebook conversations to identify ways of positioning identity and engaging in information sharing activities. Interviews with students are analysed to contextualise and validate the findings from the online interactions. FindingsThree identity positions are identified: discussion-oriented learner, goal-oriented learner and customer-oriented learner. The way a student commits to others, to ideas and to a career choice affects their identity positions and information sharing activities. Results suggest that information sharing with social media should be understood as a powerful device for identity development in <b>pre-school</b> teacher <b>training.</b> Research limitations/implicationsThis study is designed to provide detailed accounts with high validity on the expense of a high degree of representativeness.

While the child met the teacher {{at the beginning of}} the primary school in the period when pre-school education did not become widespread, now the situation has changed and the importance of pre-school education has expanded, too. Consequently, teachers of pre-school education have important tasks and responsibilities in this stage. The main purpose of this research is to reveal whether there is a relationship between multidimensional perfectionism, humor styles and life satisfaction and the extent to which the variables of multidimensional perfectionism, humor styles contribute to the prediction of subjective well-being.

Life Satisfaction Scale that was developed by Diener, Emmons, Larsen and Griffin (1985) and adapted in Turkish by Köker and Yetim (1991) has been used to determine the students’ life satisfaction levels. Besides this scale, the inputs of the study have been obtained by using Multi-Dimensional Perfectionism Scale that was developed by Hewitt and Flett (1989) and adapted in Turkish by Oral (1999) and “Humor Style Scale” that was developed by Weir (2003) and adapted in Turkish by Yerlikaya (2003).
