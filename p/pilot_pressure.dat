5000|$|The Quick Dump Valve is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the choices of valves for spudding. A QDV is a spool valve that is balanced under pressure with {{one end of the}} spool oriented toward the barrel. The spool is manually unbalanced allowing pressure between the end of the spool and the projectile in the barrel. The air pressure then forces the spool back and the projectile forward. Since the valve is triggered with no <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure,</b> the valve snaps open with no <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> to hinder it. Currently it is not commercially for sale and must be hand built by the hobbyist like most piston valves.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increasing}} use of sensors in mobile hydraulic equipment, the need for hydraulic pilot lines is decreasing, being replaced by electrical wiring and electrically con-trollable components. For controlling some of the existing hydraulic components there are, however, still a need for being able to generate a hydraulic <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure.</b> In this paper con-trolling a hydraulic variable pump is considered. The LS-pressure is measured electrically and the hydraulic <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> is generated using a small spool valve. From a control point of view there are two approaches for controlling this system, by either generating a copy of the LS-pressure, the LS-pressure being the output, or letting the output be the pump pressure.

An inverse kinematic model, which calculates the required pump drive speed for a desired actuator speed and given <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> input, is formed.

40|$|Abstract: A {{hydraulic}} power limiting valve, HPLV, {{is a key}} hydraulic element to realize power limiting control for hydraulic drive system in engineering machinery. By tracing with the discharge pressure of hydraulic pump, HPLVs are used to real-time control the <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> that corresponds to the displacement of hydraulic pump, and match the output power of hydraulic pump {{with the power of}} its prime mover within high efficiency scope. So good dynamics is important for HPLVs to reflect the frequently change of pump pressure.

50|$|During {{the earlier}} {{part of its}} service life, the Barracuda {{suffered}} a fairly high rate of unexplained fatal crashes, often involving experienced pilots. In 1945 this was traced to small leaks developing in the hydraulic system. The most common point for the leak was {{at the point of}} entry to the <b>pilot's</b> <b>pressure</b> gauge and was situated such that the resulting spray went straight into the pilot's face. The chosen hydraulic fluid contained ether and as the aircraft rarely were equipped with oxygen masks (and few aircrew wore them below 10,000 ft/3,000 m anyway) the pilot quickly became unconscious leading to a crash. An Admiralty order issued at the end of May 1945 required all examples of the type to be fitted with oxygen as soon as possible, and for pilots to use the system at all times.|$|R

40|$|A sound {{operated}} {{directional control}} valve (SODC-Valve) is proposed which opens and closes {{in response to the}} sound of a specific frequency propagated inside the gas supply tube and therefore needs no electric wiring to convey the control signals. By using multi-frequency sound, several valves can be controlled simultaneously and resultantly the pneumatic multi-degree wearable system can be constructed compactly. Firstly, the sound-gas pressure converter is proposed and improved so that self-excited vibration can be suppressed. Secondly, the basic characteristic of the sound-gas pressure converter is investigated to show that the back pressure is different depending on whether the sound of specific frequency is added or not. Furthermore, a pilot valve is developed. Because the <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> change of the pilot valve developed is only 20 kPa, a main valve is proposed and developed. Finally, a pneumatic multi-degree-of-freedom wearable power-assist system is constructed by using a Dry Ice Power Cell as the portable gas supply, wearable actuators developed in the previous study, and two sound operated {{directional control valve}}s developed. Experimental results show that the sound operated directional control valve is feasible and practical in the pneumatic multi-degree-of-freedom wearable system...|$|E
40|$|Counterbalance valves {{are widely}} used in {{hydraulic}} deck machinery to balance the overrunning loads. However, as is well known, counterbalance circuit designed with poor choice of counterbalance valve tends to introduce instability to the system. This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a pilot operated counterbalance valve which can operate at a flow rate about 2000 L/min. A linearized stability analysis of such a hydraulic circuit which consists of a slip in cartridge, a pilot counterbalance valve and a hydraulic winch is presented. Pole-zero plots are employed to reveal {{the effect of the}} volume of control cavity, the hydraulic resistance on pilot line and counterbalance valve pilot area ratio on the stability of the system. The analysis results indicate that such a system will be unstable within the normal range of each parameter. An alternative approach that guarantees system stability by adding an accumulator on the pilot line is put forward. The approach stabilizes the <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> by reducing the hydro-stiffness of pilot control cavity, thus the system can reach its stability condition.

40|$|The paper shows {{standard}} circuits {{with load}} reactive and non load reactive counterbalance valves. A Matlab simulation {{based on a}} linear model for the circuit with load reactive counterbalance valves shows what parameters have a significant influence on {{the stability of the}} system. The most important parameters of the counterbalance valve that influence the stability are pilot gain and relief gain. The factors describe how <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> and load pressure affect the flow across the counterbalance valve. A new counterbalance valve (patent pending) has the pilot gain and relief gain required for stability only in operating ranges that require the parameters for stability. When the load is not moving or the counterbalance valve is not required for positive (non overrunning) loads, the new valve has a higher pilot ratio, which means that the valve opens further at lower inlet pressures. The new counterbalance valves saves about 30 % power compared with a standard counterbalance valve that has the same parameters for stability when it is lowering an overrunning load. The standard counterbalance can be replaced with the new load adaptive valve in the same cavity. The paper shows test results and the design of the valve...|$|E

An electro-pneumatic regulator {{is a type}} of pressure control valve that is a combination of a poppet valve for main pressure control, two multilayered PZT valves for <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> control, a microprocessor with a feedback controller and a pressure sensor. The benefits of bender type PZT actuator are faster response times, low energy consumption, and the ability to be used in hazardous environments and field bus systems.

40|$|Over {{time the}} harsh outdoor {{environment}} wears away at asphalt surfaces. Asphalt emulsion is sprayed {{onto the surface}} {{to act as a}} sacrificial barrier. To pump this asphalt emulsion for spray application an effective pressure relief device must be incorporated. High pressure is needed to achieve the desired spray pattern, but this same pressure can cause components to fail {{in the presence of a}} pressure spike. Hydraulically driven positive displacement pumps are used to pump the emulsion, so a pinched hoses or a clog in the system results in a severe pressure spike. Due to the emulsions viscosity and abrasive additives a direct relief device is not suitable for long term service. A remote activated pressure relief device is needed to allow adequate spray pressure and prevent system failure. The device is manufactured with off the shelf hydraulic and pneumatic parts bolted to a steel base plate.

Advanced reservoir characterization techniques are being used at the Nash Draw project to develop reservoir management strategies for optimizing oil recovery from this Delaware reservoir. Analysis, interpretation, and integration of recently acquired geological, geophysical, and engineering data revealed that the initial reservoir description was too simplistic to capture the critical features of this complex formation. As {{a result of the}} analysis, a proposed pilot area was reconsidered. Comparison of seismic data and engineering data have shown evidence of discontinuities in the area surrounding the proposed injector.

The implication is that since amplitude attenuation is a function of porosity, then this is not the best area to be attempting a <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> maintenance project. Because the original pilot area appears to be compartmentalized, the lateral continuity between the pilot wells could be reduced.
