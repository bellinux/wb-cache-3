5|$|Official {{religion}} {{involved a}} variety of rituals, based in temples. Some rites were <b>performed</b> <b>every</b> day, whereas others were festivals, taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity. The gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies, in which their statues were clothed, anointed, and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor. These offerings, in addition to maintaining maat for the gods, celebrated deities' life-giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful.|$|E

5|$|Parsifal {{far exceeds}} {{the other members}} of the canon in the number of {{performances}} it has received at Bayreuth. It is the only work to have had three festival seasons (1882, 1883 and 1884) dedicated solely to its staging, and was <b>performed</b> <b>every</b> season from 1882 until the start of World War II, with the exception of 1896 when Cosima first revived the Ring. Most of these performances were of the original production, which received 205 performances before a new staging was introduced in 1934. Another production – the influential one by the composer's grandson Wieland – was staged every year from 1951, when Bayreuth reopened after the war, until 1973, accumulating 101 performances.|$|E
5|$|The major {{religious}} activities (or pujas) <b>performed</b> <b>every</b> morning are mahabhishek (ablution), abhishek, gitapath and bhagavat puja, {{while in the}} evening the pujas include geet govinda and aarti. Recital in vedic scripts like Ashtotram and Sahasranama is practiced during all the rituals. After aarti, the decorations are removed from the image of Badrinath and sandalwood paste is applied to it. The paste from the image {{is given to the}} devotees the next day as prasad during the nirmalaya darshan. All the rituals are performed in front of the devotees, unlike those in some Hindu temples, where some practices are hidden from them. Sugar balls and dry leaves are the common prasad provided to the devotees. From May 2006, the practise of offering Panchamrit Prasad, prepared locally and packed in local bamboo baskets, was started.|$|E

25|$|The Vagina Monologues, a 1996 episodic play by Eve Ensler, {{has contributed}} to making female {{sexuality}} a topic of public discourse. It {{is made up of}} a varying number of monologues read by a number of women. Initially, Ensler <b>performed</b> <b>every</b> monologue herself, with subsequent performances featuring three actresses; latter versions feature a different actress for every role. Each of the monologues deals with an aspect of the feminine experience, touching on matters such as sexual activity, love, rape, menstruation, female genital mutilation, masturbation, birth, orgasm, the various common names for the vagina, or simply as a physical aspect of the body. A recurring theme throughout the pieces is the vagina as a tool of female empowerment, and the ultimate embodiment of individuality.|$|E

500|$|Cuomo {{recorded}} demos for Songs {{from the}} Black Hole on an 8-track recorder at his {{family home in}} Connecticut over Christmas 1994. Most of the songs already existed and were rewritten to fit the Songs for the Black Hole concept. Cuomo <b>performed</b> <b>every</b> part himself, pitch-shifting his voice for the female characters. Wanting to add a science fiction element to Weezer's sound, he used synthesizers including an Electrocomp 101 monophonic synthesizer he had recently purchased from a pawn shop in rural Connecticut. By February, he had completed an initial track list. While Weezer was on tour in Europe later that month, Sharp returned to America because of a family emergency, leaving the band stranded in Hamburg for a week.

In the United States, it is sometimes practiced on girls born with a clitoris that is larger than usual. Comfort Momoh, who specializes in the topic of FGM, states that FGM might have been [...] "practiced in ancient Egypt as a sign of distinction among the aristocracy"; there are reports that traces of infibulation are on Egyptian mummies. FGM is still routinely practiced in Egypt. Greenberg et al. report that [...] "one study found that 97% of married women in Egypt had had some form of genital mutilation performed." [...] Amnesty International estimated in 1997 that more than two million FGM procedures are <b>performed</b> <b>every</b> year.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was <b>performed</b> <b>every</b> night of the tour.|$|E
