50|$|Examples of two earlier {{generation}} {{instruments are}} the waveometer or a microtopographer. A waveometer uses a <b>plastic</b> <b>tip</b> that {{is connected to}} an electronic pickup which then measures the surface variations. The measurement is recorded as an electronic signal which is amplified and split into two signals: a high band and a low band. For measuring a ball bearing, the low band signal records variations that occur every four to seventeen times per revolution and the high band signal records variations that occur seventeen to 330 times per revolution; the low band is the waviness. These bands are transmitted to an oscilloscope for analysis.|$|E

50|$|Lawn darts (also {{known as}} Javelin darts, jarts or yard darts) is a lawn game for two players or teams. A lawn dart set usually {{includes}} four large darts and two targets. The game play and objective {{are similar to}} both horseshoes and darts. The darts {{are similar to the}} ancient Roman plumbata. They are typically 12 inches (30 cm) long with a weighted metal or <b>plastic</b> <b>tip</b> on one end and three plastic fins on a rod at the other end. The darts are intended to be tossed underhand toward a horizontal ground target, where the weighted end hits first and sticks into the ground. The target is typically a plastic ring, and landing anywhere within the ring scores a point.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956, {{the company}} made the Jotter barrel smooth plastic and changed the clip to the [...] "21" [...] style. This clip used a {{reversed}} [...] "V" [...] rather than an inverted one and incorporated a ball on the clip for pocket retention. This clip remained in use for approximately two years. During the period this variation was in production a metal barrel end (or tip) was added in response to complaints that the early <b>plastic</b> <b>tip</b> broke from pressure. Examples without the metal tip and the [...] "21" [...] clip are relatively rare. There are also some examples of the grooved nylon barrel being mated to the [...] "21" [...] clip and the inverted clip being mated to smooth barrels without tips. One can only conjecture {{that this was an}} {{effort on the part of}} the factory to use up surplus parts from different series. Barrels and caps were all interchangeable during this period. and 3rd edition barrels (c. 1963 up) have been found fitted to the [...] "21" [...] caps because of the ease of attaching them. These barrels are of slightly smaller diameter. Collectors have added these incorrect barrels because they were manufactured in several colors unavailable at the time. These colors demand higher prices for this edition of the Jotter. Before acquiring a [...] "21" [...] mode, one should establish that the attached barrel is the larger diameter if concerned about accuracy and authenticity. It is suggested that the collector should acquire a sample of both sized refills and test the inside diameter of the barrel. The newer and more colorful barrels will not accept the larger diameter refills.|$|E
30|$|Spores were {{initially}} {{collected from the}} lids in 200  µl sterile water. Spores did however not easily transmit into the water but showed an affinity {{to stick to the}} plastic lid of a Petri-dish. Quick wiping with the <b>plastic</b> <b>tip</b> of a micro-pipette was required to transfer the spores into the liquid. Spores tended to clump and quickly sink to the bottoms of sterile Eppendorf cups into which spore solutions were transferred. Addition of mild detergent such as Tween 80 can help to suspend clumped basidiospores (Dhawale and Kessler 1993; Rincón et al. 2005). Therefore in later experiments, we used 200  µl sterile 0.1 % Tween 80. With the detergent, spores were easily taken up from the lids and suspended.|$|E

The DualShock also features two additional buttons {{when compared to the}} Dual Analog, L3 and R3, which are triggered by depressing the analog sticks. Other differences between Dual Analog and the DualShock include the longer grips/handles and slightly different L2/R2 buttons.|$|R
50|$|Prong collars {{must never}} be {{turned inside out}} (with the prongs facing away from the dog's skin), as this may cause injury against the body and head. <b>Plastic</b> <b>tips</b> are {{occasionally}} placed {{on the ends of}} the prongs to protect against tufts forming in the fur or, in the case of low quality manufactured collars with rough chisel cut ends, irritating the skin. Like the choke chain, the prong collar is placed high on the dog's neck, just behind the ears, at the most sensitive point.|$|R

The ring around {{the outer edge of}} the shutter speed dial was changed from a scalloped design to a diamond textured design. Finally, a shutter speed display was added in the lower left hand corner of the viewfinder. This model was unofficially known as FTb-N or FTbn.|$|R
40|$|The most {{essential}} limitation of batch-injection analysis (BIA) methodology {{compared to other}} flow methods (CFA, FIA, SIA) {{is the lack of}} possibility of on-line sample processing in the measuring system. Some procedures of on-line sample pretreatment in BIA are possible by changing the <b>plastic</b> <b>tip</b> of the automatic micropipette used for sample injection into a flow-through reactor, e. g. by packing it with a bed of a solid sorbent. This concept is employed in the voltammetric stripping determinations of trace metals using a bed of commercial chelating resin Chelex- 100. It was found that, besides the electrochemical preconcentration of analytes in the form of amalgams on the surface of mercury thin film electrodes, an approximately 10 -fold additional preconcentration can be achieved on the packed sorbent bed by using different volumes of aspirated sample solution and eluent. This procedure allows also efficient elimination of some matrix effects. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, visual image {{techniques}} such as Digital Image Correlation (DIC) enabled to experimentally determine the crack tip displacement and strain fields at small scales. The displacements are tracked during loading, and parameters as the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF), opening and closing loads, T-stress can be readily measured. In particular, the SIFs and the T-stress {{can be obtained by}} fitting the analytical equation of the Williamstype expansion with the experimentally-determined displacement fields. The results in terms of fracture mechanics parameters strictly depend on the dimension of the area considered around the crack tip in conjunction with the crack length, the maximum SIF (and thus the <b>plastic</b> <b>tip</b> radius), and the number of terms to be considered in the Williams-type expansion. This work focuses in understanding the accuracy of the SIF calculation based on these factors. The study is based on Finite Element Analysis simulations where purely elastic material behavior is considered. The accuracy of the estimation of the SIF is investigated and a guide-line is provided to properly set the DIC measurements. The analysis is then experimentally validated for crack closure measurements adopting the SENT specimen geometry...|$|E

All factors produced the significant effect (p  0. 05). It was found that <b>plastic</b> <b>tip</b> with smaller diameter produced eye drops of lower weight {{in comparison to the}} rubber dropper tip with larger diameter. The change of dispensing angle from 90 ř to 45 ř led to the decrease in the drop weight produced by both dropper tips tested. Non-linear increase in drop weight was occurred when viscosity increased in consequence to the gradually increased concentration of the 0. 00 %- 0. 16 %- 0. 25 %- 0. 50 %- 0. 75 %- 1. 00 % hypromellose (HPMC) solution. Statistically significant increase in the weight of the drops was detected for wetted dropper tips, either plastic or rubber, at 0. 16 % HPMC concentration which corresponded to viscosity of 3 mPas. In contrast, the weight of the drops produced by non-wetted dropper tips was increased above viscosity of 17 mPas corresponding to the 0. 50 % HPMC concentration...|$|E
