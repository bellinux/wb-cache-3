5|$|After the Iraqi {{forces were}} defeated, the U.N. {{mandated}} that the U.S. withdraw from Iraq, ending the Gulf War. By {{the end of}} combat operations, the 24th Infantry Division advanced 260 miles and destroyed 360 tanks and other armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers,</b> 300 artillery pieces, 1,200 trucks, 25 aircraft, 19 missiles, and over 500 pieces of engineer equipment. The division took over 5,000 Iraqi prisoners of war while suffering only eight killed, 36 wounded, and five non-combat casualties.|$|E

5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers</b> through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat because it might take too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} white smoke that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers</b> turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{the company}} moved its axle {{production}} from Helsinki {{to a new}} factory at Hämeenlinna. In 1995, axle production was separated into an independent unit called Sisu Axles; this was sold to investors in 1999. The main factory builds military vehicles; the state separated it from the parent company in 1996 and renamed it Patria Vehicles Oy. Its main products are Patria AMV armoured <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April, the Bosnian Serbs {{were able}} to deploy 200,000 troops, {{hundreds}} of tanks, armoured <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers</b> (APCs) and artillery pieces. The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25,000 soldiers {{and a handful of}} heavy weapons, while the Bosniaks were largely unprepared for combat with nearly 100,000 troops, but small arms for less than half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons.|$|E
50|$|TAB-63 (Romanian: Transportor Amfibiu Blindat model 1963, Amphibious Armoured <b>Personnel</b> <b>Carrier</b> model 1963) was an {{experimental}} Romanian prototype of an armoured <b>personnel</b> <b>carrier.</b> Basically, the Romanian engineers used {{the hull of}} a Soviet BTR-60P armoured <b>personnel</b> <b>carrier</b> and installed a number of Romanian auto parts in it.

This triad of capabilities EFV - MPC - JLTV comprises the USMC ground mobility portfolio and the means by which expeditionary, scalable, and networked armored protected seats will be provided to the Marine Air-Ground Task Force in the future.|$|R
5|$|In {{the five}} days between 25 February, the day FSB 31 fell, and 1 March, three major engagements took place. With {{the help of}} air strikes, ARVN {{destroyed}} 17 PT-76 and six T-54 tanks at a loss of three of its five M41 tanks and 25 armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers</b> (APC)s. On 3 March the South Vietnamese column encountered a PAVN battalion without supporting armor and, {{with the assistance of}} B-52 strikes, killed 400 PAVN.|$|E
5|$|Some Canadian and British {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} temporarily equipped with M7 Priest self-propelled guns for the D-Day landings, {{which had been}} replaced by towed 25-Pounder field guns. Simonds had the Priests converted into Kangaroo Armoured <b>Personnel</b> <b>Carriers,</b> which would allow infantry to follow the tanks closely on any terrain. Permission was first requested from the Americans, from whom the M7s had been borrowed, to convert them into APCs.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{at about}} 11:00 am, 16 tanks, 2 armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers</b> and 30 cars {{had been sent}} from the Officer School of Armored and Mechanized Formations, a Poznań garrison, to protect the {{designated}} buildings, but no shots were exchanged {{between them and the}} insurgents. These soldiers engaged in friendly conversation with the protesters; some reports state that two tanks were seized and some troops disarmed. Then the Soviet General Konstantin Rokossovsky, the Minister of National Defense, who was then in command of all armed forces in Poland, decided to take personal control, and the situation changed dramatically.|$|E

5|$|Reinforcements, {{consisting}} of elements from the QRF, 10th Mountain Division soldiers, Rangers, SEALs, Pakistan Army tanks and Malaysian armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers,</b> finally arrived at 1:55am on 4 October. The combined force worked until dawn {{to free the}} pilot's body, receiving RPG and small arms fire throughout the night. All the casualties were loaded onto the armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers,</b> and {{the remainder of the}} force was left behind and {{had no choice but to}} move out on foot. AH-6 gunships raked the streets with fire to support the movement. The main force of the convoy arrived at the Pakistani Stadium-compound for the QRF-at 6:30am, thus concluding one of the bloodiest and fiercest urban firefights since the Vietnam War. Task Force Ranger experienced a total of 17 killed in action and 106 wounded. Various estimates placed Somali casualties above 1,000. Although Task Force Ranger's few missions were successes, the overall outcome of Operation Gothic Serpent was deemed a failure because of the Task Force's failure to complete their stated mission, capturing Mohamed Farrah Aidid. Most U.S. forces pulled out of Somalia by March 1994. The withdrawal from Somalia, was completed on March 1995. Even though Operation Gothic Serpent failed, USSOCOM still made significant contributions to operations in Somalia. SOF performed reconnaissance and surveillance missions, assisted with humanitarian relief, protected American forces and conducted riverine patrols. Additionally, they ensured the safe landing of the Marines and safeguarded the arrival of merchant ships carrying food.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack, {{hundreds}} of policemen and army forces personnel and two armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers</b> were brought into Yerevan, positioned on Baghramyan Avenue surrounding the National Assembly building. An anti-terrorist squad from Russia {{also participated in}} the operation. Meanwhile, ambulance vehicles rushed {{to the site of}} the shooting. President Robert Kocharyan was directing the operation of the security forces around the parliament building. While holding around 50 hostages inside the building, the men demanded a helicopter and airtime on national television for a political statement.|$|E
5|$|While the JNA's {{casualties}} are not known, the HV {{sustained a}} loss of 18 killed and 18 wounded, as well as {{a loss of}} eight tanks, two armoured <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers</b> and seven boats. The 2,011-strong 102nd Infantry Brigade alone suffered 13 dead. Their names were later inscribed on a memorial plaque in Šišinec, at the Kupa River crossing point. In the aftermath of the offensive, there were speculations in Croatia that the casualties were much higher, possibly as many as 60 killed and 200 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Artillery and 90mm {{tank fire}} {{destroyed}} seven more North Korean T-34 tanks, three more SU-76 towed guns, and several trucks and <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers.</b> This night battle, {{which was at}} times very intense, lasted about five hours. The US B Battery, 8th Field Artillery Battalion alone fired 1,661 105mm rounds, the 4.2-inch mortar platoon fired 902 rounds, the 81mm mortar platoon fired 1,200 rounds, and F Company, 27th Infantry fired 385 60mm mortar rounds. The North Korean column was completely destroyed. US patrols after daylight estimated the North Koreans had suffered 1,300 casualties in the fight. Eleven prisoners captured by the patrol said the action had decimated their units and that the division was only at 25 percent strength.|$|E
5|$|At the Great Bitter Lake, the Egyptian 130th Amphibious Brigade {{performed}} its own crossing. Composed of the 602nd and 603rd Mechanized Infantry Battalions with 1,000 men, {{including a}} Sagger anti-tank battalion, an anti-air battalion, 20 PT-76 tanks and 100 amphibious armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers,</b> it was tasked with seeking and destroying enemy installations at the entrances of the Gedy and Mitla Passes. The sand rampart {{that lined the}} entire Suez Canal {{did not exist in}} the Bitter Lakes, and there were no Israeli defences or units to be encountered, and the brigade reached the opposite bank around 14:40 without any losses. The Egyptians discovered a minefield blocking their advance, and military engineers worked to clear a path.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the battle, the JNA and the paramilitaries pushed the Croatian force out of eastern Gospić. On 5 September, Croatian forces {{captured}} JNA Major General Trajče Krstevski, along with three armoured <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers</b> (APCs) and 32 soldiers, when he attempted to reach JNA barracks that were isolated in the centre of the town but released them the next day following the successful negotiation of a prisoner exchange (POWs). The Croatian commanders in Gospić, however, declined a request that the APCs also be returned—contrary to the instructions of Croatian authorities in Zagreb. Following the capture of Krstevski, the JNA artillery bombardment intensified, averaging 1,100 artillery shells per day. Despite the intense bombardment, the second week of the battle was a stalemate, without any changes in lines of control.|$|E

5|$|In 2004 the {{commander}} of the F-FDTL formed a team, which included international contractors, to develop a long-term strategic vision document for the military. This study was supported by the Australian Government. The resulting Force 2020 document was completed in 2006 and made public in 2007. The document sets out an 'aspirational' vision {{for the development of the}} F-FDTL to 2020 and beyond and is of equivalent status to a defence white paper. It proposes expanding the military to a strength of 3,000 regular personnel in the medium term through the introduction of conscription. It also sets longer-term goals such as establishing an air component and purchasing modern weapons, such as anti-armour weapons, armoured <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers</b> and missile boats, by 2020.|$|E
5|$|In July 1964, the Viet Cong 271st and 272nd Regiments, {{began moving}} into the provinces of Bình Dương, Bình Long and Phước Long {{to carry out their}} mission. During the first phase of their campaign, the Viet Cong regiments overran several {{strategic}} hamlets at Xan Sang, Cam Xe, Dong Xa, and Thai Khai. Between August and September 1964, Viet Cong regiments executed deep thrusts into Bình Dương and Châu Thành to apply additional pressure on South Vietnamese outposts situated on Route 14. During the second phase of their campaign, the Viet Cong ambushed two South Vietnamese infantry companies and destroyed five armoured vehicles, which consisted of M24 Chaffee light tanks and M113 armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers.</b> The Viet Cong defeated regular ARVN units at the strategic hamlets of Bình Mỹ and Bình Co.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale American support began {{during the}} Kennedy Administration {{in the early}} 1960s, {{with the arrival of}} large numbers of the US Special Forces to help out in the field. The arrival of {{helicopters}} changed the nature of the battle considerably. Helicopters enabled South Vietnamese soldiers to quickly fly to almost any point in the country, leaving little time for a retreat. Throughout 1962, the combined forces were increasingly effective in routing the Viet Cong. These tactics, combined with the use of armored <b>personnel</b> <b>carriers,</b> took a heavy toll on various fledgling Viet Cong units. The lightly armed Viet Cong had no weaponry capable of stopping the armored carriers and inevitably were forced to flee, taking heavy casualties.|$|E
