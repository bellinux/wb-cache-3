40|$|AbstractHIV- 1 {{envelope}} glycoproteins (Env) and Env-based immunogens {{usually do}} not interact efficiently with the inferred germline <b>precursors</b> <b>of</b> known broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs).

We evaluated the binding of 15 inferred germline <b>precursors</b> <b>of</b> bNAbs directed to different epitope clusters to three soluble native-like SOSIP. 664 Env trimers. We found that native-like SOSIP. 664 trimers bind to some inferred germline <b>precursors</b> <b>of</b> bNAbs, particularly ones involving the V 1 /V 2 loops at the apex of the trimer.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{were used}} to examine the immunoglobulin isotypes expressed by B lymphocyte <b>precursors</b> <b>of</b> IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgA 2 plasma cells. Plasma-cell differentiation was induced by the addition of pokeweed mitogen to cultures of blood mononuclear cells. Anti-mu, - gamma, -alpha, and -alpha 1 antibodies were used in some experiments to inhibit differentiation of B lymphocytes bearing these heavy chain isotypes, and for selective removal <b>of</b> B lymphocyte <b>precursors</b> before culture with pokeweed mitogen in other experiments. Three major subpopulations <b>of</b> B lymphocyte <b>precursors</b> were identified: (a) a subpopulation of surface (s) IgM+ <b>precursors</b> <b>of</b> IgM plasma cells that did not express IgG or IgA isotypes, (b) a subpopulation <b>of</b> sIgG+ <b>precursors</b> <b>of</b> IgG plasma cells of which approximately one-half bore some IgM and none had detectable IgA receptors, and (c) a subpopulation <b>of</b> sIgA+ <b>precursors</b> <b>of</b> IgA plasma cells; one half <b>of</b> these <b>precursors</b> could be shown to express functional IgM receptors but none were found to express IgG receptors. The sIgA subpopulation could be further subdivided into sIgA 1 + <b>precursors</b> <b>of</b> IgA 1 plasma cells and IgA 1 - negative <b>precursors</b> <b>of</b> IgA 2 plasma cells.

5|$|According to Tchernov's 1962 paper, Passer predomesticus {{was found}} in the middle Acheulean (middle Pleistocene, {{probably}} more than 400,000 years old) layer E1 of the Oumm-Qatafa cave in Wadi Khareitoun near Bethlehem. In 1984, however, Tchernov wrote that P.predomesticus was about 140,000 years old, from the Yabrudian. Layer E1 contained remains of about 40bird species, including a premaxilla Tchernov described as a <b>precursor</b> <b>of</b> the Dead Sea sparrow (Passer moabiticus) and a tarsometatarsus and humerus tentatively allied with the house sparrow. An undetermined Acheulean layer of the same cave also contained fossils Tchernov described as precursors of both the house and Spanish sparrows.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a <b>precursor</b> <b>of</b> norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
