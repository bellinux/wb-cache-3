Through an annealing heat treatment, the brittle structure as first cast {{is transformed into}} the malleable form. Carbon agglomerates into small roughly spherical aggregates of graphite leaving a matrix of ferrite or pearlite according to the exact heat treatment used. Three basic types of malleable iron are recognized within the casting industry: blackheart malleable iron, whiteheart malleable iron and <b>pearlitic</b> <b>malleable</b> iron.|$|E
