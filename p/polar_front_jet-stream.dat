Pigment distributions were determined by HPLC on 40 -m samples collected from the mixed layer during the ANTXII/ 4 cruise in March–May 1995 aboard RV “Polarstern”. A transect was covered (90 °W, from 51 °S to 70 °S), crossing the Subantarctic Front in the north, the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front,</b> and the Southern <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> in the south. Coinciding with high concentrations of silicate, diatoms dominated in the Antarctic waters south of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front.</b> North of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front,</b> silicate concentrations dropped to values less than 10 [*]μM. In this area flagellates (Prymnesiophyceae and green algae) were the dominant phytoplankton group. Nutrient depletion of the surface waters near the Southern <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> indicated formerly enhanced productivity. These findings confirmed previous observations by the British Sterna expedition, which described locally elevated chlorophyll a biomass near the southern boundary of the Southern <b>Polar</b> <b>Front.</b> We propose a role for supply of bioavailable iron via the front, and emphasise the importance of frontal systems for phytoplankton productivity in the Southern Ocean. ...|$|R

The front lies 6 ° south of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> at 88 °W and 3 ° north of the Continental Water Boundary. The front is continuous to the east through Drake Passage where it forms a southern branch of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front,</b> for which reason we have named it the Southern <b>Polar</b> <b>Front.</b> Data from a towed profiling CTD were able to distinguish the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> from the Southern <b>Polar</b> <b>Front,</b> even though they were only 0. 5 ° apart. Thus the width of the ACC south of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> varied considerably. About a third of the transport of the ACC also lay south of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front,</b> with 15 Sv carried by the Southern <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> alone at 85 °W. Distinguishing features of the Southern <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> were a water mass boundary associated with a zone of concentrated baroclinic flow and a surface salinity minimum. These features also have been found at the Greenwich Meridian at 53 °S, so the Southern <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> can be traced round at least a quarter of the globe. To the west of the Bellingshausen Sea both Eltanin data and the Fine Resolution Antarctic Model show that the AAC is at its narrowest at 145 °W, where its southern boundaries lie as far north as 56 °S. At this longitude the ACC meets the topographic barrier of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge. To conserve potential vorticity the current is forced to make a southward loop as it crosses the ridge and the current broadens dramatically. The flow remains broad until forced to sharpen by the constriction of Drake Passage. A similar broadening of the ACC is seen where it crosses the Southwest Indian Ridge south of Africa at 30 °E. Here it remains broad until it encounters the Kerguelen Plateau. Thus the eastern boundaries of both the Weddell and Ross Gyres are determined by where the ACC crosses midocean ridges...|$|R

Understanding the foraging ecology {{of these species}} in the Southern Ocean is important for monitoring and ecosystem conservation and management. Methodology/Principal Findings Tracking data from sooty and short-tailed shearwaters from three regions of New Zealand and Australia were combined with at-sea observations of shearwaters in the Southern Ocean, physical oceanography, near-surface copepod distributions, pelagic trawl data, and synoptic near-surface winds. Shearwaters from all three regions foraged in the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> zone, and showed particular overlap in the region around 140 °E. Short-tailed shearwaters from South Australia also foraged in Antarctic waters south of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front.</b> The spatial distribution of shearwater foraging effort in the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> zone was matched by patterns in large-scale upwelling, primary production, and abundances of copepods and myctophid fish.

The breeding success of four seabird species foraging mainly south of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> in Antarctic waters was significantly depressed by warm SST occurring mainly in winter and spring, prior to breeding. Conversely, warm SST anomalies were associated with a higher breeding success for species foraging mainly north of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Front,</b> while no significant effect was found for two species that forage on the Kerguelen plateau. These different responses to changes in the SST were also observed for two closely related species (sooty albatross Phoebetria fusca and light-mantled sooty albatross P. palpebrata) breeding at Kerguelen. These observations highlight the importance of multi-species long-term monitoring programs for understanding the ecological consequences of environmental variability.

The North Atlantic <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> jet stream is of particular significance to the heavily populated areas of western Europe and eastern North America as storm track variability, atmospheric modes of variability such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), temperature and rainfall are all intimately linked with jet stream changes. Although seasonal and interannual variability are often attributed to internal variability, there are several possible drivers of <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> jet stream changes that are reviewed in this study. Cryospheric effects from sea-ice extent and snow cover, oceanic effects from North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures and tropical influences such as the El-NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation, and stratospheric effects due to stratospheric circulation variability, solar variability, volcanic eruptions and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation are all identified in the literature as factors that impact on the Atlantic <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> jet stream.

Mesopelagic carbon remineralization (MR) was assessed using the excess, non-lithogenic particulate barium (Ba xs) inventories in mesopelagic waters and compared with bacterial production (BP), surface primary production (PP) and export production (EP). Results for this early season study are compared with the results obtained during a previous study (2005; KEOPS 1) for the same area at a later stage of the phytoplankton bloom. Our results reveal the patchiness of the seasonal advancement and of the establishment of remineralization processes between the plateau (A 3) and <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> sites during KEOPS 2. For the Kerguelen plateau (A 3 site) we observe a similar functioning of the mesopelagic ecosystem during both seasons (spring and summer), with low and rather stable remineralization fluxes in the mesopelagic column (150 – 400 m). The shallow water column (~ 500 m), the lateral advection, the zooplankton grazing pressure and the pulsed nature of the particulate organic carbon (POC) transfer at A 3 seem to drive the extent of MR processes on the plateau. For deeper stations (> 2000 m) located on the margin, inside a <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> meander, {{as well as in the}} vicinity of the <b>polar</b> <b>front,</b> east of Kerguelen, remineralization in the upper 400 m in general represents a larger part of surface carbon export. However, when considering the upper 800 m, in some cases, the entire flux of exported carbon is remineralized. In the <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> meander, where successive stations form a time series, two successive events of particle transfer were evidenced by remineralization rates: a first mesopelagic and deep transfer from a past bloom before the cruise, and a second transfer expanding at mesopelagic layers during the cruise. Regarding the deep carbon transfer efficiency, it appeared that above the plateau (A 3 site) the mesopelagic remineralization was not a major barrier to the transfer of organic matter to the seafloor (close to 500 m). There, the efficiency of carbon transfer to the bottom waters (> 400 m) as assessed by PP, EP and MR fluxes comparisons reached up to 87 % of the carbon exported from the upper 150 m. In contrast, at the deeper locations, mesopelagic remineralization clearly limited the transfer of carbon to depths of > 400 m. For sites at the margin of the plateau (station E- 4 W) and the <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> (station F-L), mesopelagic remineralization even exceeded upper 150 m export, resulting in a zero transfer efficiency to depths > 800 m. In the <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> meander (time series), the capacity of the meander to transfer carbon to depth > 800 m was highly variable (0 to 73 %).
