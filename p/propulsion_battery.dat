5000|$|The Mark 34 torpedo (initially Mine Mk 44, {{technically}} Mk 34 mod 1) was a U.S. torpedo {{developed that}} entered service in 1948. It was an improved {{version of the}} Mark 24 FIDO passive acoustic homing torpedo developed during World War II for launch from fixed-wing aircraft.

Excess power {{can be stored in}} the main <b>propulsion</b> <b>battery</b> banks. The ship was presented as the first passenger boat in the US to use both wind and sun power.|$|E
50|$|Achieving {{these goals}} {{in the next five}} years will result in an {{automotive}} <b>propulsion</b> <b>battery</b> with five-times the present range capacity, costing one-fifth present lithium-ion batteries. The DoE aim is to level the purchase plus operating (fuel) cost of an all-electric vehicle with a 280 mi range with the costs of an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle of similar size. The DoE expects than even before the latter goals are met, the 5-year cost of ownership of most plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and of all-electric vehicles with shorter ranges, such as 100 mi, will be comparable to the same cost of ICE vehicles of similar size.|$|E
40|$|The {{scarcity}} of fossil fuel {{and the increased}} pollution leads the use of Electric Vehicles (EV) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) instead of conventional Internal Combustion (IC) engine vehicles. An Electric Vehicle requires an on-board charger (OBC) to charge the <b>propulsion</b> <b>battery.</b> The objective of the project work is to design a multifunctional on-board charger that can charge the <b>propulsion</b> <b>battery</b> when the Electric Vehicle (EV) connected to the grid. In this case, the OBC plays an AC-DC converter. The surplus energy of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>battery</b> can be supplied to the grid, in this case, the OBC plays as an inverter. The auxiliary battery can be charged via the <b>propulsion</b> <b>battery</b> when PEV is in driving stage. In this case, the OBC plays like a low voltage DC-DC converter (LDC). An OBC is designed with Boost PFC converter at the first stage to obtain unity power factor with low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and a Bi-directional DC-DC converter to regulate the charging voltage and current of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>battery.</b> The battery is a Li-Ion battery with a nominal voltage of 360 V and can be charged from depleted voltage of 320 V to a fully charged condition of 420 V. The function of the second stage DC-DC converter is {{to charge the battery}} in a Constant Current and Constant Voltage manner. While in driving condition of the battery the OBC operates as an LDC to charge the Auxiliary battery of the vehicle whose voltage is around 12 V.

40|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) {{are driven by}} at least two prime energy sources, such as an internal combustion engine (ICE) and <b>propulsion</b> <b>battery.</b> For a series HEV configuration, the ICE drives only a generator, which maintains the state-of-charge (SOC) of propulsion and accessory batteries and drives the electric traction motor. For a parallel HEV configuration, the ICE is mechanically connected to directly drive the wheels {{as well as the}} generator, which likewise maintains the SOC of propulsion and accessory batteries and drives the electric traction motor. Today the prime energy source is an ICE; tomorrow it will very likely be a fuel cell (FC). Use of the FC eliminates a direct drive capability accentuating the importance of the battery charge and discharge systems. In both systems, the electric traction motor may use the voltage directly from the batteries or from a boost converter that raises the voltage. If low battery voltage is used directly, some special control circuitry, such as dual mode inverter control (DMIC) which adds a small cost, is necessary to drive the electric motor above base speed. If high voltage is chosen for more efficient motor operation or for high speed operation, the <b>propulsion</b> <b>battery</b> voltage must be raised, which would require some type of two-quadrant bidirectional chopper with an additional cost. Two common direct current (dc) -to-dc converters are: (1) the transformer-based boost or buck converter, which inverts a dc voltage, feeds the resulting alternating current (ac) into a transformer to raise or lower the voltage, and rectifies it to complete the conversion; and (2) the inductor-based switch mode boost or buck converter [1]. The switch-mode boost and buck features are discussed in this report as they operate in a bi-directional chopper. A benefit of the transformer-based boost converter is that it isolates the high voltage from the low voltage. Usually the transformer is large, further increasing the cost. A useful feature of the switch mode boost converter is its simplicity. Its inductor must handle the entire current, which is responsible for its main cost. The new Z-source inverter technology [2, 3] boosts voltage directly by actively using the zero state time to boost the voltage. In the traditional pulse width modulated (PWM) inverter, this time is used only to control the average voltage by disconnecting the supply voltage from the motor. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the Z-source's potential for reducing the cost and improving the reliability of HEVs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Concern for the {{environment}} and energy security is changing {{the way we think}} about energy. Grid-enabled passenger vehicles, like electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) can help address environmental and energy issues. Automakers have recognized that electric drive vehicles are critical to the future of the industry. However, some challenges exist to greater adoption: the perception of cost, EV range, access to charging, potential impacts to the grid, and lack of public awareness about the availability and practicality of these vehicles. Although the current initial price for EV’s is higher, their operating costs are lower. Policies that reduce the total cost of ownership of EVs and PHEVs, compared to conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, will lead to faster market penetration. Greater access to charging infrastructure will also accelerate public adoption. Smart grid technology will optimize the vehicle integration with the grid, allowing intelligent and efficient use of energy. By coordinating efforts and using a systems perspective, the advantages of EVs and PHEVs can be achieved using the least resources. This paper analyzes these factors, their rate of acceleration and how they may synergistically align for the electrification of vehicles.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for new and greater sources of energy for future global transportation applications. One recognized possibility for a renewable, clean source of transportation fuels is solar radiation collected and converted into useable forms of electrical and/or chemical (hydrogen) energy. This paper describes methods for utilizing and combining existing technologies into systems that optimize solar energy collection and conversion into useful transportation fuels. Photovoltaic (PV) -electrolysis (solar hydrogen) and PV-battery charging systems described in this paper overcome inefficiencies inherent in past concepts, where DC power from the PV system was first converted to AC current and then used to power electrical devices {{at the point of}} generation, or fed back to the grid to reduce electricity costs. These past, non-optimized concepts included efficiency losses in power conversion and unnecessary costs. These drawbacks can be avoided by capitalizing on the unique feature of solar photovoltaic devices that match their maximum power point to the operating point of an electrolyzer or a battery charger without intervening power transformers.

This power electronic interface translates the varying dc voltage on an ultracapacitor with bi-directional power flow to the dc bus of an inverter-supplied ac propulsion system in an electric vehicle application. In a related application, the electronic interface {{can also be utilized}} to interface a low-voltage battery to a dc bus of an inverter supplied ac propulsion system. Variations in voltage for these two intended applications occur (1) while extracting energy (discharge) or supplying energy (charge) to an ultracapacitor, and (2) while extracting energy (discharge) or supplying energy (charge) to a low-voltage battery. The control electronics of this interface is designed to be operated as a stand-alone unit acting in response to an external power command.

40|$|With ever {{increasing}} concern on energy diversification, {{energy efficiency and}} environmental protection, electric vehicles (EVs) including the pure EV (PEV), hybrid EV (HEV) and fuel-cell EV (FEV) are becoming attractive for road transportation. Although {{some of them have}} become commercially available, there are many challenges and opportunities for EV development and transition. This paper gives an overview of key research on various types of EVs, with emphasis on their challenges, opportunities and emerging technologies. Firstly, the classification of EVs is conducted based on their energy sources and propulsion devices, leading to deduce the PEV, HEV and FEV as well as to subdivide the HEV into the conventional version (the micro HEV, mild HEV and full HEV) and the gridable version (the plug-in HEV and range-extended EV). Then, their energy diversification, energy efficiency and overall harmful emissions are briefly introduced. Secondly, the challenges and opportunities of the PEV, HEV, gridable HEV and FEV are discussed in details. Thirdly, emerging technologies including the energy sources, electric <b>propulsion,</b> <b>battery</b> charging and vehicle-to-grid that are promising for application to EVs are reviewed. For the energy source technology, the batteries, fuel cells, ultracapacitors and ultrahigh-speed flywheels are discussed, while the concept of on-board renewable energy sources is put forward. For the electric propulsion technology, the requirements of electric machines for EVs are identified so that research activities on advanced machines and machine systems are described. For the battery charging technology, the concepts of park-and-charge and move-and-charge are presented, and hence the arrangements of inductive charging and wireless charging are described. For the vehicle-to-grid technology, the corresponding framework and operation are discussed, hence the concept of energy arbitrage is delineated.
