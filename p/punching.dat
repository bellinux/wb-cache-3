40|$|Research on {{the drawing}} cup aims to {{determine}} the effect of defective models <b>punch</b> against wrinkling and differences in cup drawing results using standard <b>punch</b> and <b>punch</b> modification, with two different materials.

40|$|The {{sticking}} {{of a model}} ibuprofen-lactose formulation {{with respect}} to compaction force, <b>punch</b> tip geometry and <b>punch</b> tip embossment was assessed. Compaction was performed at 10, 25 or 40 kN using an instrumented single-punch tablet press. Three sets of 'normal' concave <b>punches</b> were {{used to evaluate the}} influence of <b>punch</b> curvature and diameter. The <b>punches</b> were 10, 11 and 12 mm in diameter, respectively. The 10 -mm <b>punch</b> was embossed with a letter 'A' logo to assess the influence of an embossment on sticking. Flat-faced <b>punches</b> (12. 5 mm) were used for comparison with the concave tooling. Surface profiles (Taylor Hobson Talysurf 120) of the upper <b>punch</b> faces were obtained to evaluate the surface quality of the tooling used. Following compaction, ibuprofen attached to the upper <b>punch</b> face was quantified by spectroscopy. Increasing <b>punch</b> curvature from flat-faced <b>punches</b> to concave decreased sticking. Altering <b>punch</b> diameter of the concave <b>punches</b> had no effect on sticking when expressed as mug mm(- 2). The embossed letter 'A' logo increased sticking considerably owing to the probable concentration of shear stresses at the lateral faces of the embossed logo...|$|R
