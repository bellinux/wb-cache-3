5000|$|Tanaka’s pieces {{can be seen}} as {{abstract}} {{works that}} rejected conventional notions of how works of art should appear or “perform.” [...] Tanaka's works, which include abstract paintings, sculptures, performances and installations, generally feature objects from everyday life: textiles, door bells, light bulbs and the like. One of these pieces, called Work Bell, produced in 1955, consisted of a string of electric bells laid out around the border of a gallery; the piece included a button for visitors to press which consequently set off a chain of shrieking rings. [...] Another one of her works, called Work (Yellow Cloth),executed in 1955, Tanaka had taken long pieces of <b>plain,</b> <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> and tacked them to a gallery's walls, creating 'paintings' that removed any suggestion of human handling from their forms and surfaces. [...] Her piece, Stage Clothes, produced in 1956, consisted of gigantic stick-figure frames draped with fabric and light bulbs, and an immense red dress with sleeves 30 ft long sleeves. This {{turned out to be a}} multi-part ensemble that she wore at a Gutai performance. She had peeled off each layer rapidly in a costume-changing routine. Tanaka literally inserted her body into the work of art, making herself a part of the performance.|$|E
40|$|Abaya, a {{traditional}} outer garment worn {{by women in}} the Middle East, is made from black fabric. Black fabric absorbs most of the heat from sunlight, making the abaya wearer very uncomfortable in hot climate. In {{order to reduce the}} amount of heat absorption by abaya and improve its comfort performance, a treatment with solar energy reflecting chemicals is proposed. This could lead to wearer feeling cooler and perspire less. This paper investigates the thermal comfort properties of <b>plain</b> woven <b>fabrics</b> <b>dyed</b> in black and treated with chemicals that would reflect the energy from sunlight. The fabrics were made from either 100 % wool or polyester/wool blends.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} was taken up as an {{exploratory}} study to test {{the possibility of using}} one-bath dyeing and finishing (ODF) with Mangosteen Rind dye and glyoxal by the exhaustion and pad-dry-cure techniques. Both ODF techniques provided a darker shade on the <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> than <b>fabric</b> <b>dyed</b> and finished using a two-bath conventional process or <b>fabric</b> <b>dyed</b> with Mangosteen Rind dye only. The ODF exhaustion method would not produce a good wrinkle recovery angles property on the <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric.</b> To improve this property of the <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> in an ODF process the pad-dry-cure technique should be used. Wash fastness results of the <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> obtained from the ODF pad-dry-cure process were comparable with those of the <b>fabric</b> <b>dyed</b> with Mangosteen Rind dye only.

40|$|Conservators use a {{range of}} 'gap filling' {{techniques}} to improve the structural stability and presentation of objects.

The most common technique is to use <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> of a single colour but while a <b>plain</b> <b>dyed</b> support provides good reinforcement, it can be visually obtrusive when used with patterned or textured textiles. Two recent postgraduate dissertation projects at the Textile Conservation Centre (TCC) have experimented with hand printing and digital imaging techniques to alter the appearance of support fabrics so that they are less visually obtrusive and blend well with the colour and texture of the textile being supported.

H 577 P ITC 2015 Luoxxv, 211 leaves :color illustrations; 30 cmCommercial spectrophotometers {{and current}} {{state-of-the-art}} digital camera imaging systems {{are unable to}} measure the spectral reflectance of yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics,</b> the former can only measure the average reflectance of an area and the latter can only measure the tristimulus values derived from the camera's RGB responses. Multispectral imaging systems, on the other hand, {{have the potential to}} measure the reflectance of a multi-colour object, such as yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics,</b> since they can record both of the spectral and spatial information of a sample. In this thesis, colour measurement of yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> based on the multispectral imaging technique is studied. The major factor restraining multispectral imaging systems from application in textile is the difficulty of correlation the measurement results of a yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> to the true colours of the yarns. The spectral response of multispectral imaging systems to yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> is dramatically affected by irregular 3 D shapes of yarns, inter-reflection between neighbouring yarns, and interstices between weft and warp yarns. In this thesis, a novel reflection model is first proposed to estimate the interaction between light and a yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> surface. Surface texture, illumination occlusion and inter-reflection are taken into account. The reflection model is then verified by reducing the influence of texture on spectrophotometric colour. Derived from the proposed reflection model, reflectance and tristimulus values of yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> with different texture structures are linear. The linear relationship in the reflectance space can be used to estimate a theoretical reflectance which discounts the influence of texture. Experimental results show that the impact of texture on colour for yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> samples in four colour centres and twenty-one texture structures can be reduced by 79 %, 55 %, 71 % and 57 %, respectively. Based on the proposed reflection model, multispectral imaging colour measurement of yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> are achieved through a series of image processing techniques, namely, colour region segmentation, solid-colour and multi-colour region detection, and weft and warp yarn segmentation. Firstly, a yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> image is partitioned into dominant colour regions by a Gaussian model. The Gaussian model is used to reconstruct the CIELAB colour histograms of dominant colour regions from those of yarns. A hierarchical segmentation structure is then devised to obtain dominant colour regions by combining histogram segmentation results in three colour channels. Experimental results shows the proposed approach has excellent performance for dominant colour region segmentation with high computational efficiency. Secondly, a dominant colour region is detected as solid-colour or multi-colour by CIExyY histogram distributions. Derived from the proposed reflection model, the CIExyY histogram of a multi-colour yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> accords with a combination of two Gaussian distributions, whereas for that of a solid-colour yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric,</b> it correlated to one Gaussian distribution. Experiments on real yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> samples demonstrate that solid-colour and multi-colour yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> regions can be distinguished in terms of CIExyY histogram distribution. Finally, a multi-colour yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> is segmented to weft and warp yarns by a modified K-means clustering method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can segment weft and warp yarns in yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric</b> images, with both high segmentation accuracy and fast processing speed. In addition, the proposed reflection model can be utilized to accomplish multispectral imaging colour measurement of single yarns. Single yarns are the elemental weaving components of yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> and have much simpler structures. The multispectral imaging colour of a single yarn is not affected by surface texture and inter-reflection. The colour measurement of single yarns is achieved by two steps. Firstly, a single yarn is segmented from backgrounds by an image difference method. Secondly, the reflectance of a single yarn can be specified by different weighting methods. Experimental results show that multispectral imaging colour measurement of single yarns can achieve a repeatability of 0. 1185 CMC(2 : 1) units and a spatial reproducibility of 0. 2827 CMC(2 : 1) units. Experimental results also show that single yarns measured by multispectral imaging systems can accomplish the similar colour matching results as solid-colour yarn <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> measured by spectrophotometers. Finally, an optical-based approach is proposed to explore the relation between the multispectral imaging colour of a single yarn and the spectrophotometric colour of the corresponding yarn card. A colour mapping equation between the single yarn and corresponding yarn card can be then found by the simplex optimal method. Experimental results show that colour difference between single yarns and corresponding yarn cards reduces from 2. 97 to 1. 20 CMC(2 : 1) units for 50 pairs of training samples and from 3. 09 to 1. 37 CMC(2 : 1) units for 50 pairs of testing samples.
