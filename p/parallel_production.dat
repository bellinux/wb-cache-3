5000|$|The {{number and}} {{character}} of these new, suburban auto factories was a harbinger of future trends detrimental to the economic health of Detroit. There was an interaction between factory decentralization {{and the nature of}} the industry's post-New Deal unionized labor force. Ford Motor was one of the first to undertake major decentralization, in reaction to labor developments. Ford's workers voted to join the UAW in 1941. This led Ford to be concerned about the vulnerability of its huge, flagship Rouge River plant to labor unrest. The workers at this plant were [...] "among the industry's most well-organized, racially and ethnically diverse, and militant." [...] A strike at this key plant could bring the company's manufacturing operations as a whole to a halt. Ford therefore decentralized operations from this plant, to soften union power (and to introduce new technologies in new plants, and expand to new markets). Ford often built up <b>parallel</b> <b>production</b> facilities, making the same products, so that the effect of a strike at any one facility would be lessened. The results for the River Rouge plant are striking. From its peak labor force of 90,000 around 1930, the number of workers there declined to 30,000 by 1960 and only about 6,000 by 1990. This decline was mainly due to automation.|$|E

The landscape she has been working on since sometime ago became a <b>parallel</b> <b>production</b> that allows her to approach color and to leave behind the black- and- white world of her insects, carnivals, and funerals while deepening her mastery of the craft of painting (Rodríguez). They are bright, full-of-life photos of her family and friends, mixed with digital design. In the middle of her new project, Viteri became very ill and while overcoming all obstacles with great tenacity, and with the support of Benjamin Villegas, the book project moved forward and came to life. The project was finished and launched in March of 2009 in Panama City, and in mid-April in Bogota at the Gabriel Garcia Marquez Cultural Center (Rodríguez). Alicia Viteri created these wonderful pieces of artwork by putting her pictorial and graphic expertise to the limit by using the services provided by technology. She used computer software to replace brushes, burins, and the sharp point of a pencil. The book won second place both for Best Cover and for Best Art Book in Spanish. The format of the book features a violet silk cover and the image of Alicia as a child, which turns into a delicate object. A translucent-paper sheet precede it as if one was looking through a photo-album (Rodríguez).|$|E
