5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> plutonium dust spread {{into the atmosphere}} {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E

5|$|The {{weight of}} an apothecaries' pound ranged {{generally}} between 300g and 320g, {{slightly less than}} that of a pound in the Roman Empire. An important exception to this rule is that the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was under rule of the Habsburg monarchy 1814–1859 and therefore had the extremely large Habsburg apothecaries' <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> 420g. (See below under Habsburg standard.) E.g. in the large city of Milan the apothecaries' system based on a <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> 326.8g was officially replaced by the metric system as early as 1803, because Milan was part of the Napoleonic Italian Republic. Since the successor of this little state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, fell to Habsburg in 1814 (at a time when even in France the système usuel had been introduced because the metric system was not accepted by the population), an apothecaries' system was officially introduced again, but now based on the Habsburg apothecaries' pound, which weighed almost 30% more.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, the Netherlands reintroduced {{the metric}} system, but used pre-revolutionary names—for example 1centimetre became the duim (thumb), the ons (ounce) became 100g and so on. Certain German states adopted similar systems and in 1852 the German Zollverein (customs union) adopted the zollpfund (customs <b>pound)</b> <b>of</b> 500g for intrastate commerce. In 1872 {{the newly formed}} German Empire adopted the metric system as its {{official}} system of weights and measures and the newly formed Kingdom of Italy likewise, following the lead given by Piedmont, adopted the metric system in 1861.|$|E

2500|$|Food {{often took}} the form of {{crackers}} or hardtack; Southerners sometimes chose cornmeal or pinole rather than wheat flour. [...] Emigrants typically ate rice and beans only at forts stopped at along the way, because boiling water was difficult on the trail, and fuel was not abundant.

5|$|In 18th century France, {{there was}} a {{national}} weight standard, the marc de Paris of 8 ounces.

With 30.6g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under Weight standards named after Troyes.|$|E

According to The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley, it was the focus of a midnight sandwich run by Elvis Presley and his friends. Taking his private jet from Graceland, Presley and his friends purchased 30 of the sandwiches and spent two hours eating them and drinking Perrier and champagne before flying home. The story became legend and the sandwich became the subject of continued media interest and part of numerous cookbooks, typically focused around Presley's love of food.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Bavaria legally {{defined the}} apothecaries' pound as 360.00g (an ounce of 30.00g). In 1815, Nuremberg lost {{its status as}} a free city and became part of Bavaria. From now on the Nuremberg apothecaries' pound was no longer the {{official}} apothecaries' pound in Nuremberg; but the difference was only 0.6%. In 1836 the Greek apothecaries' pound was officially defined by this standard, four years after Otto, the son of the king of Bavaria, became the first king of Greece. But only few German states followed the example of Bavaria, and with a long delay. The apothecaries' <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> 360g was also adopted in Lübeck, where it was official as of 1861.|$|E

5|$|To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 {{introduced}} a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound. To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35g, the proposed system was {{very similar to that}} in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would have doubled the value of the avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk). Therefore, it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{cochineal}} {{was widely}} traded in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In the 15th and 16th centuries, along with grain, timber, and salt, {{it was one}} of Poland's chief exports, mainly to southern Germany and northern Italy as well as to France, England, the Ottoman Empire, and Armenia. In Poland, the cochineal trade was mostly monopolized by Jewish merchants, who bought the dye from peasants in Red Ruthenia and other regions of Poland and Lithuania. The merchants shipped the dye to major Polish cities such as Kraków, Gdańsk (Danzig), and Poznań. From there, the merchandise was exported to wholesalers in Breslau (Wrocław), Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Venice, and other destinations. The Polish cochineal trade was a lucrative business for the intermediaries; according to Marcin of Urzędów (1595), one <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> Polish cochineal cost between four and five Venetian pounds. In terms of quantities, the trade reached its peak in the 1530s. In 1534, 1963 stones (about 30 metric tons) of the dye were sold in Poznań alone.|$|E
5|$|Sets of 1d (one penny) to 4d silver coins {{are known}} {{from the time of}} Charles II onwards. However, as there is no record of any {{denomination}} higher than 1d (then struck for circulation in silver) being used in the Maundy gift before 1731, sets from before then are most likely ordinary circulation strikes. At that time, coins used for the Maundy money distribution were indistinguishable from those struck for circulation. It was not until 1752 that coins not struck for circulation were used for the Maundy distribution. At times when little silver was being struck by the Royal Mint, the coins distributed might bear a previous year's date. To evade statutory prohibitions on the striking of silver coin during the Napoleonic Wars, all Maundy pieces issued from 1800 to 1815 bear the date 1800, though most were struck later. When the date was finally changed in 1816, after the prohibition ended, the size of the coins was slightly reduced, as the Royal Mint increased the amount struck from one troy <b>pound</b> <b>of</b> sterling silver from 62 to 66 shillings of silver coin. The last year in which no Maundy coins were struck was 1821.|$|E
