40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{screening}} of <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries</b> in patients undergoing ultrasound screening of their abdominal aortas was worthwhile. MethodsAll male patients undergoing ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) during the period February 2000 to June 2002 were offered scanning of their <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries.</b> All scans were performed by a single, trained operator using a Sonosite 180. ResultsFour hundred and forty-nine patients underwent screening and thus 898 <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries</b> were assessed. The mean aortic diameter was 2. 1 standard deviations (SD) 0. 5 cm and the upper limit of normal (2 SD) was 2. 7 cm. The mean diameter of the <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries</b> was 0. 74 SD 0. 11 and the upper limit of normal was 0. 96 cm. Thirty patients had aortic diameters greater than 2. 5 cm (ectatic or aneurysmal aortas) but based on a popliteal diameter of 2 cm, no popliteal aneurysms were detected. However, 39 (4. 3 %) <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries</b> measured ≥ 1 cm (>mean+ 2 SD); 3 / 60 (5 %) in the ectatic/AAA subgroup and 36 / 838 (4. 3 %) in the non-AAA subgroup. ConclusionsThis study has shown that, using conventional definitions, the imaging of <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries</b> during screening for AAAs does not detect any popliteal aneurysms and is thus of limited value. However, if a definition of popliteal aneurysm of ≥ 1 cm (based on mean+ 2 SD) is used then 39 / 898 (4. 3 %) of arteries would be regarded as having abnormal diameters and may require surveillance...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveInitial TransAtlantic Inter-Society {{consensus}} (TASC) II classification {{has been}} shown to influence the patency of stented femoral and <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Although several studies have shown the effect of the number of runoff vessels on the durability of infrainguinal angioplasty without stenting, the influence of tibial vessel runoff on the patency of primarily stented femoral and <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries</b> has not been as well defined. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the number of patent tibial vessels affects primary patency after primary stenting of the femoral and <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries.</b> MethodsThe records of all patients undergoing angioplasty and primary nitinol stenting of the femoral and <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries,</b> by or under the supervision of one vascular surgeon, were reviewed. Results were analyzed by both the number of patent tibial vessels documented on periprocedural angiography and by using a modified Society for Vascular Surgery runoff score. TASC II classification was also recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and differences between groups tested by log-rank method. Fisher exact and χ 2 tests were used to compare categoric factors. ResultsDuring a 7 -year period, 289 limbs in 236 patients underwent primary stenting of the femoral and <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Overall primary patency was 70. 3 % at 12 months, 52. 4 % at 24 months, and 39. 1 % at 36 months. Limbs classified as TASC A or B had significantly better patency rates than those classified as TASC C or D (P <. 001). While the number of runoff vessels decreased with worsening of the TASC classification (P =. 024), overall (P =. 355), and within individual TASC classes (P ≥. 092 for each), there was no difference in the primary patency of stented segments with good runoff and those with compromised runoff. Limbs with poor runoff (one or no vessels) were no more likely to fail with occlusion than their counterparts with two or three patent tibial vessels (P =. 383). The number of patent tibial vessels at the time of initial stenting did not impact ultimate limb salvage (P =. 063). ConclusionsThe number of patent tibial vessels does not influence the primary patency of primarily stented femoral and <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries.</b> TASC II classification appears to be significantly more predictive of initial failure after angioplasty and stenting of these vessels...|$|R

500|$|While {{dealing with}} the Hornet's Nest, the South {{suffered}} a serious setback {{with the death of}} their commanding general. Albert Sidney Johnston was mortally wounded at about 2:30p.m. as he led attacks on the Union left through the Widow Bell's cotton field against the Peach Orchard, accompanied by Tennessee governor Isham Harris. Johnston was shot in his right leg, behind the knee. [...] Deeming the wound insignificant (possibly due to a wound he received 25 years earlier that had inflicted permanent nerve damage preventing him from feeling how bad his injury was), Johnston continued on leading the battle. Eventually, Johnston's staff members noticed him slumping in his saddle. [...] Harris asked Johnston if he was wounded, and the general replied [...] "Yes, and I fear seriously." [...] Earlier in the battle, Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and Yankee prisoners, and there was no medical staff at his current location. [...] An aide helped him off his horse and laid him down under a tree, then went to fetch his surgeon, but did not apply a tourniquet to Johnston's wounded leg. Before a doctor could be found, Johnston bled to death from a torn <b>popliteal</b> <b>artery</b> that caused internal bleeding and blood to collect unnoticed in his riding boot. Jefferson Davis considered Johnston to be the most effective general they had (this was two months before Robert E. Lee emerged as the preeminent Confederate general). Johnston was the highest-ranking officer from either side to be killed in combat during the Civil War. Beauregard assumed command, but his position in the rear, where he relied on field reports from his subordinates, may have given him only a vague idea of the disposition of forces at the front. Beauregard ordered Johnston's body shrouded for secrecy to avoid lowering morale and resumed attacks against the Hornet's Nest. This was likely a tactical error, because the Union flanks were slowly pulling back to form a semicircular line around Pittsburg Landing. If Beauregard had concentrated his forces against the flanks, he might have defeated the Union army at the landing, and then reduced the Hornet's Nest position at his leisure.|$|E

40|$|To {{establish}} the optimal conditions for recanalisation of obstructed arteries without damage to vessel walls, a Nd-YAG laser coupled to a 0. 2 mm diameter optic fibre was used on obstructed human cadaver coronary and peripheral <b>arteries</b> and on <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries</b> in amputated limbs.

40|$|Critical limb {{ischaemia}} (CLI), due to atherosclerotic arterial occlusion, affects over 20, 000 {{people per}} year in the United Kingdom with many facing lower limb amputation and early death. A role for endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) in atherosclerosis is well-established and increased circulating and tissue levels of this peptide have been detected in patients with CLI. ET- 1 and its receptors were identified in atherosclerotic <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries</b> obtained from CLI patients undergoing lower limb amputation. In addition, plasma ET- 1 levels were compared with those of non-ischaemic controls. ET- 1 was associated with regions of atherosclerotic plaque, particularly in regions with high macrophage content. This peptide was also associated with endothelial cells lining the main vessel lumen as well as adventitial microvessels. ETA and ETB receptors were located within regions of plaque, adventitial microvessels and perivascular nerves. There was a statistically significant increase (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) in plasma ET- 1 in CLI patients when compared with controls. These results reveal sources of ET- 1 in atherosclerotic <b>popliteal</b> <b>arteries</b> that potentially contribute to increased circulating levels of this peptide.
