Test conditions were representative of an advanced, regenerative-cycle, automotive gas turbine. The test conditions inlet air temperatures from 600 to 1250 K (a vitiated preheater was used), pressures from 170 to 600 kPa, air velocities of 10 to 30 m/sec, equivalence ratios from 0. 3 to 1. 0, mixing lengths from 10 to 60 cm, and residence times of 2 to 100 ms. The fuel was diesel number 2. The duct was insulated {{and had an}} inside diameter of 12 cm. Three different fuel injection systems were used: One was a single simplex <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer,</b> {{and the other two}} were multiple-source injectors. The data obtained with the simplex and one of the multiple-source injectors agreed satisfactorily with the references and correlated with an Arrenhius expression.

The effects of liquid swirling strength, Weber number, gas-to-liquid axial velocity ratio and gas-to-liquid density ratio on the droplet size and velocity distributions of a <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizer</b> are investigated. Results show that model based on maximum entropy formalism works well to predict droplet size and velocity distributions under different spray conditions.

40|$|In pressure-swirl atomizer, a {{swirling}} motion is imparted to the fuel, leading {{it under the}} action of the centrifugal force to spread out {{in the form of a}} hollow cone as soon as it leaves the exit orifice. This kind of atomizer finds its use in gas turbines and liquid propellant rockets. The combustion usually starts at the periphery of spray and the flame front travels towards the center of the spray. The availability of air for combustion therefore decreases as the flame travels towards the center of the spray from <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizer.</b> The newer approach is to develop {{a swirling}} air core in the center of the spray. This approach led to the development of air assisted <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizer.</b> This paper presents the experimental investigations of air assisted <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizer</b> for spray cone angle and penetration length at different injection pressure differential ranging from 3 bar to 18 bar in an increment of 3 bar.

40|$|A low-NOx {{emissions}} combustor {{concept has}} been demonstrated in flame tube tests. A lean-direct injection concept was used where the fuel is injected directly into the flame zone and the overall fuel-air mixture is lean. In this concept the air is swirled upstream of a venturi section and the fuel is injected radially inward into the air stream from the throat section using a plain-orifice injector. Configurations have two-, four-, or six-wall fuel injectors {{and in some cases}} fuel is also injected from an axially located simplex <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer.</b> Various orifice sizes of the plain-orifice injector were evaluated for the effect on NOx. Test conditions were inlet temperatures up to 8 1 OK, inlet pressures up to 2760 kPa, and flame temperatures up to 2100 K. A correlation is developed relating the NOx emissions to inlet temperature, inlet pressure, fuel-air ratio and pressure drop. Assuming that 15 percent of the combustion air would be used for liner cooling and using an advanced engine cycle, for the best configuration, the NOx emissions using the correlation is estimated to be < 75 percent of the 1996 ICAO standard...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} single-step pharmaceutical particle engineering technique able to produce particles within a well-defined particle size range while controlling macroscopic spherical morphology and mesoscopic surface topography. Methods. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) aerosol droplets were generated by spraying a solution via either an electrohydrodynamic atomizer (EHDA) or an air <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer.</b> The highly supersaturated droplets were collected in a suitable nonsolvent of the drug and crystallized by ultrasonication. Suspended particles were filtered, and their physicochemical properties characterized. Results. The SAXS processed particles showed a relatively homogeneous particle size distribution between 1 and 5 mum. Particles were nominally crystalline in structure. The chemical structure of the active ingredient did not apparently alter during processing. Controlling the solute concentration of the air pressure atomized solution provided a means of controlling the degree of sphericity and particle-size characteristics. In comparison to micronized paracetamol particles, SAXS-produced particulates were generally more uniform in shape with increased nanometer surface roughness. Conclusions. The SAXS process provides a novel means of producing crystalline particles in a well-defined particle size range. Furthermore, the method offers a range of opportunities in controlling physical properties including surface topography and particle shape...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to evolve and evaluate a premixing-prevaporizing fuel system {{to be used with}} a catalytic combustor for possible application in an automotive gas turbine. Spatial fuel distribution and degree of vaporization were measured using Jet A fuel. Three types of air blast injectors, an air assist nozzle and a simplex <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer</b> were tested. Air swirlers with vane angles up to 30 deg were used to improve the spatial fuel distribution. The work was done in a 12 -cm (4. 75 -in.) diameter tubular rig. Test conditions were: a pressure of 0. 3 and 0. 5 MPa (3 and 5 atm), inlet air temperatures up to 800 K (980 F), velocity of 20 m/sec (66 ft/sec) and fuel-air ratios of 0. 01 and 0. 025. Uniform spatial fuel distributions that were within plus or minus 10 percent of the mean were obtained. Complete vaporization of the fuel was achieved with air blast configurations at inlet air temperatures of 550 K (530 F) and higher.

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{study on the}} breakup of a conical liquid sheet from a <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizer</b> was conducted by using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. The variation of wavelength, wave speed and amplitude of wave versus liquid pressure was obtained. The {{results indicate that the}} cone half angle increases with liquid pressure. The stripped half wavelength liquid fragment seems to break into a series of drops immediately and no obvious contraction from liquid fragment to ligament is seen. The recorded images also show that both short and long wavelength waves exist simultaneously, and influence the breakup of the conical liquid sheet.

40|$|Recently {{acquired}} {{experimental data}} are presented which reveal that, for Weber number (We) greater than 10. 0, the atomization from simplex <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizers</b> is {{significantly greater than}} would be predicted from previously derived Sauter mean diameter (SMD) correlations. A different SMD correlation is required to accurately predict the experimental data. Below We of about 10. 0, the atomization is dominated by inertial forces and bag-type breakup results. Above We of about 10. 0, shear-type breakup occurs and results in a very fine spray which can accurately be predicted using a quadratic expression in Delta P. The correlation is extended to include fuel property effects, and SMD is found to vary linearly with fuel surface tension, while {{the influence of the}} fuel viscosity is not apparent...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been performed {{to study the}} effect of <b>atomizer</b> <b>pressure</b> dilution of the reducing reagent and the injector position on the efficiency or the NOx reduction by a selective non-catalytic reduction technique using urea as a reducing agent. Experiments were performed with a flow reactor in which flue gas was generated by the combustion of methane in air at stoichiometric amount of oxygen and the desired levels of initial NOx (400 - 450 ppm) were achieved by doping the flame with ammonia. The work was directed to investigate the effect of <b>atomizer</b> <b>pressure,</b> dilution of urea reagent and the injector position. The <b>atomizer</b> <b>pressure</b> was varied from 1 to 3 bar and 20 - 25 % increase in efficiency was observed by decreasing the pressure.

40|$|The {{internal}} flow and the spray formed by a <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer</b> with an orifice diameter of 1 mm and a length to diameter ratio of 10 were studied at injection pressures between 70 and 5000 kPa. Obstructions to flow were also introduced inside the injector {{to examine their}} effect on the injector's performance. Visualization of the flow inside the injector indicated that the obstructions caused the flow to cavitate. However, even without any obstruction, cavitation occurred at injection pressures as low as 170 kPa. These results also showed that cavitation can occur in four different modes, depending on the mass flow rate of fuel through the nozzle {{and the type of}} obstruction. Images of the resulting spray indicated that the cavitation enhances atomization significantly. Single-component phase Doppler particle analysis and laser diffraction particle sizing were conducted 50 mm, 100 mm and 150 mm downstream of the nozzle face to examine the size and velocity distributions of the droplets in the spray. These measurements indicated that for a given liquid flow rate the droplet size was not affected by the structure of the cavitation. Velocity measurements in the spray indicated that the cavitation produces a wider spray cone angle at lower mass flow rates...|$|E
40|$|A spatial {{technique}} providing global {{size and}} velocity data over a two-dimensional region of a spray is often preferred for rapid optical characterization of sprays. The Generalized Scattering Imaging (GSI) approach for droplet sizing, based {{on both the}} Lorenz-Mie theory and the Finely Stratified Sphere Scattering Model {{can be applied to}} both homogenous droplets and inhomogeneous and/or absorbing droplets. A new system has been developed using the GSI approach, with the capability to measure the velocity and size of droplets with non-uniform and/or varying refractive index, even in regions of high particle number density. A windowed FFT based approach was used to identify the presence and location of a droplet oscillation pattern, and an optimized frequency-based algorithm was used to extract the droplet size. A two-frame tracking algorithm was devised to measure the velocity of droplets from the two consecutive image frames. The size range and droplet concentration limits were investigated using simulated out-of-focus images. A maximum measurable diameter range from 10 µm to 600 µm was obtained for the range of magnification and defocus recommended here. The maximum droplet concentration is expected to be about 3000 #/cc. Sizing accuracy was verified using monodisperse droplets and a graded index optical fiber. Results obtained for a swirl type <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer</b> depicted well the near-nozzle spray angle and diameter characteristics {{in various parts of the}} spray structure.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{performances}} of sprays from a <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer</b> (hollow cone) and a twin fluid atomizer are compared using sunflower straight vegetable oil (SVO). The {{study has been}} performed at different liquid temperature and pressure to estimate their effects on the spray characteristics. A Mie Scattering optical set-up, employing a laser light sheet and a charge coupled device (CCD) camera, is used to capture the spray images from which the spray cone angles have been evaluated. The liquid distribution from the spray is measured by a mechanical patternator placed at a definite distance below the atomizer. It is observed from the study that, flow number (FN) remains unchanged with {{the change in the}} flow rate for both the hollow cone and twin fluid atomizers. In case of hollow cone atomizer, FN increases slightly with the increase in oil temperature thereby consuming less power for delivering the fuel. This phenomenon has not been observed in case of twin fluid atomizer. For pressure atomizers the spray cone angle increases with the increase in the flow rate {{as well as with the}} increase in oil temperature. The cone angle of twin fluid atomizer exhibits almost a constant value for the entire operating range of liquid flow rate, but increases with the increase in both air pressure and oil temperature. Symmetrical patternations have been observed in the sprays with more spray areas at higher temperature and liquid pressure for hollow cone atomizer and at higher air pressure for twin fluid atomizer...|$|E
40|$|Water-spray cooling {{of heated}} {{surfaces}} {{is common in}} many industrial applications, notably steelmaking, because of its high heat dissipating ability. Quantitative information regarding the parameters affecting spray cooling is relatively scarce. The objective {{of this research is}} to obtain such information by using a specially developed experimental technique that provides steady-state cooling of a steel surface using a gas-fired burner to introduce heat. The method provides fundamental information on the spray parameters controlling heat transfer from horizontal heated surfaces {{for a wide range of}} mass flux and droplet size and velocity in the film-boiling regime. Measurements are made of the drop sizes and velocities and of the liquid mass flux in the sprays produced by full-cone <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizers.</b> Heat transfer characteristics in the range of surface temperature between 380 K and 1200 K are investigated. Comparisons are made with published data and correlations are developed for heat flux and Nusselt number in the surface temperature range from 800 to 1200 K. It is found that drop size has only a weak effect on heat transfer in these relatively dense sprays. However, droplet velocity is almost as important as mass flux, so that the product of mass flux and velocity, the impinging momentum flux of water, is the dominant parameter...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of droplet evaporation {{in the overall}} fuel-air mixing process in liquid fuel spray flames is examined {{with a series of}} experiments in a simple atmospheric pressure burner burning a range of hydrocarbon fuels. Two types of fuel atomizers were studied—air-assist and pressure jet—which have substantially different operating characteristics. Fuel-air mixing rates were determined from time-average oxygen concentrations measured with overall burner operation stoichiometric. It is shown that with air-assist atomizers, the kinetic energy of the atomizer jet determines the mixing rate intensity for both liquid and gaseous fuels. Since the droplet evaporation time is much less than the mixing time, the details of the evaporation process are not important and the jet length scale and kinetic energy govern the mixing process. With <b>pressure</b> jet <b>atomizers,</b> the characteristic evaporation and mixing times are comparable. The evaporating fuel drops create fuel vapor concentration nonuniformities on a scale much smaller than the fuel jet scale. Mixing rate intensities comparable to those obtained with air-assist atomizers can, therefore, be achieved with much lower turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates. With <b>pressure</b> jet <b>atomizers,</b> both the kinetic energy of the fuel jet and the evaporation characteristics of the fuel droplets control the initial fuel-air mixing rate...|$|R

Trends of SMD and N are shown as a function of distance from the nozzle at all conditions, indicating some of the evaporation characteristics of fuel sprays...|$|R
40|$|Spray coating proccsses are {{characterized}} by their relatively large paint wastage and high energy consumption, especially in car industry. The unavoidable overspray, caused by poor transfer efficiency, has to be removed quickly from the paint booth, {{in order to preserve}} the painting quality on the subject surface. The therefore needed conditioned air stream results in intensive energy requirement for the disposal of the overspray. Against the background of increasing demands on energy-efficient painting processes, a research project has been launched focusing on increasing the efficiency of atomizers in painting processes. This paper summarizes some results of {{the current state of the}} research. The air supported high <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer,</b> also known as AirCoat or AirMix, is basically an airless atomizer with additional air flow for improved atomization and homogenization of the spray cone. Compared to the well-known air spray painting, the spray transfer efficiency of airless and air-assisted atomizers is relatively high, corresponding to a lower overspray. Therefore, air-assist atomizing is used in the present experimental and numerical investigations. Fraunhofer diffraction and Laser-Doppler Anemometry were used to measure droplet size distributions and the integral droplet velocity in spray cone. Furthermore, the film thickness distribution on a flat plat was also measured. A commercial CFD code (ANSYS-FLUENT) was used in the numerical studies. lnfluences of the additional air flow in air-assist gun on the atomization process, the film thickness distribution and the transfer efficiency were studied. The experimental and simulation results delivered the necessary information for understanding the painting process using air-assisted guns and for improving the performance of the atomizer...|$|E
40|$|This project {{focused on}} fuel stream {{preparation}} improvements prior to injection into a solid oxide fuel cell reformer. Each milestone {{and the results}} from each milestone are discussed in detail in this report. The first two milestones were {{the creation of a}} coking formation test rig and various testing performed on this rig. Initial tests indicated that three anti-carbon coatings showed improvement over an uncoated (bare metal) baseline. However, in follow-up 70 hour tests of the down selected coatings, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis revealed that no carbon was generated on the test specimens. These follow-up tests were intended to enable a down selection to a single best anti-carbon coating. Without the formation of carbon it was impossible to draw conclusions as to which anti-carbon coating showed the best performance. The final 70 hour tests did show that AMCX AMC 26 demonstrated the lowest discoloration of the metal out of the three down selected anti-carbon coatings. This discoloration did not relate to carbon but could be a useful result when carbon growth rate is not the only concern. Unplanned variations in the series of tests must be considered and may have altered the results. Reliable conclusions could only be drawn from consistent, repeatable testing beyond the allotted time and funding for this project. Milestones 3 and 4 focused on the creation of a preheating <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer</b> and mixing chamber. A design of experiment test helped identify a configuration of the preheating injector, Build 1, which showed a very uniform fuel spray flow field. This injector was improved upon by the creation of a Build 2 injector. Build 2 of the preheating injector demonstrated promising SMD results with only 22 psi fuel pressure and 0. 7 in H 2 O of Air. It was apparent from testing and CFD that this Build 2 has flow field recirculation zones. These recirculation zones may suggest that this Build 2 atomizer and mixer would require steam injection to reduce the auto ignition potential. It is also important to note that to achieve uniform mixing within a short distance, some recirculation is necessary. Milestone 5 generated CFD and FEA results {{that could be used to}} optimize the preheating injector. CFD results confirmed the recirculation zones seen in test data and confirmed that the flow field would not change when attached to a reformer. The FEA predicted fuel wetted wall temperatures which led to several suggested improvements that could possibly improve nozzle efficiency. Milestone 6 (originally an optional task) took a different approach than the preheating <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer.</b> It focused on creation and optimization of a piezoelectric injector which could perform at extremely low fuel pressures. The piezoelectric atomizer showed acceptable SMD results with fuel pressure less than 1. 0 psig and air pressure less than 1. 0 in H 2 O. These SMD values were enhanced when a few components were changed, and it is expected would improve further still at elevated air temperatures. It was demonstrated that the piezoelectric injector could accomplish the desired task. The addition of phase tracking and a burst mode to the frequency controller increased the usability of the piezoelectric injector. This injector is ready to move on to the next phase of development. Engine Components has met the required program milestones of this project. Some of the Milestones were adjusted to allow Milestone 6 to be completed in parallel with the other Milestones. Because of this, Task 3. 10 and 3. 13 were made optional instead of Milestone 6. Engine Components was extremely grateful for the support that was provided by NETL in support of this work...|$|E
40|$|A curved wall-jet (CWJ) burner was {{employed}} to stabilize turbulent spray flames that utilized a Coanda effect by supplying air as annular-inward jet over a curved surface, surrounding an axisymmetric solid cone fuel spray. The stabilization characteristics and structure of n-heptane/air turbulent flames were investigated with varying fuel and air flow rates and the position of <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizer</b> (L). High-speed planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of OH radicals delineated reaction zone contours and simultaneously stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) quantified the flow field features, involving turbulent mixing within spray, ambient air entrainment and flame-turbulence interaction. High turbulent rms velocities were generated within the recirculation zone, which improved the flame stabilization. OH fluorescence signals revealed a double flame structure near the stabilization edge of lifted flame that consisted of inner partially premixed flame and outer diffusion flame front. The inner reaction zone is highly wrinkled and folded due to significant turbulent mixing between the annular-air jet and the fuel vapor generated from droplets along the contact interface of this air jet with the fuel spray. Larger droplets, having higher momentum are able to penetrate the inner reaction zone and then vaporized in the low-speed hot region bounded by these reaction zones; this supports the outer diffusion flame. Frequent local extinctions in the inner reaction zone were observed at low air flow rate. As flow rate increases, the inner zone is more resistant to local extinction despite of its high wrinkling and corrugation degree. However, the outer reaction zone exhibits stable and mildly wrinkled features irrespective of air flow rate. The liftoff height increases with the {{air mass flow rate}} but decreases with L...|$|E

The flow characteristics within the injection system were quantified {{by means of a}} fuel injection equipment (FIE) one-dimensional model, providing the injection rate and the injection velocity in the presence of hole cavitation, by an in-house three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model providing the detailed flow distribution for various combinations of nozzle hole configurations, and by a fuel atomization model giving estimates of the droplet size very near to the nozzle exit. The overall spray angle relative to the axis of the injector was found to be almost independent of injection and chamber pressure, a significant advantage relative to swirl <b>pressure</b> <b>atomizers.</b> Temporal droplet velocities were found to increase sharply at the start of injection and then to remain unchanged during the main part of injection, before decreasing rapidly towards the end of injection. The spatial droplet velocity profiles were jet-like at all axial locations, with the local velocity maximum found at the centre of the jet. Within the measured range, the effect of injection pressure on droplet size was rather small while the increase in chamber pressure from atmospheric to 12 bar resulted in much smaller droplet velocities, by up to four-fold, and larger droplet sizes by up to 40 per cent...|$|R

Qualitative and quantitative spray measurements have been achieved via the combined diagnostic techniques of high-magnification charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging and phase Doppler anemometry (PDA), which provides useful data {{not only in terms of}} improving the design and performance of <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizers,</b> but also for the validation and refinement of numerical spray models. High-magnification CCD images of the intact near-nozzle liquid sheet reveal a certain degree of helical swirl motion, although laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) results indicate that the tangential swirl motion imparted on the liquid sheet decays rapidly within the first few millimeters of the atomizer orifice to near-negligible levels. Images of the poorly atomized “preswirl spray” formed during the early transient phase of injection also revealed the presence of large, nonspherical liquid masses up to 1 mm in size, even as far as 72 nozzle diameters downstream. The spray-induced gas phase flow, which results in the characteristic toroidal vortex, was found to have a significant influence on droplet trajectories and segregation of the fast-moving large (D 32 between 25 and 30 ?m) and small (1 ? 5 ?m) droplets within the spray.

In general, it is concluded that droplets act as point sources of fuel vapor until evaporation, when the fuel jet length scale may become important in determining nonuniformities of the fuel vapor concentration.

The two-dimensional axisymmetric swirl Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the VOF method is employed for accounting the formation mechanism of the liquid film inside the swirl chamber and the orifice hole of the <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizer.</b> For verification of the code, the numerical results were compared with experimental data for large scale prototype injector with water (Newtonian fluid) as injection fluid in various constant inlet mass flow rate. 1 By using power-law equation to calculate shear stress terms in the Navier-Stokes equations, the code is extended to compute Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid flow inside the atomizer. The time-independent purely viscous power-law fluids flow in pressure-swirl atomizers is simulated. The effects of shear-thinning fluids (0. 5 < n < 1), viscous Newtonian (n = 1) fluids and shear thickening fluids (1 < n < 1. 5) on atomizers performance (discharge coefficient and spray cone angle) were investigated. Results were shown that with increasing the power-law index the spray cone angle decreases and the discharge coefficient increases...|$|R
40|$|The fuel {{injector}} {{has an important}} role in the process for an efficient combustion because it increases the specific surface area of the fuel and it allows one to reach high rates of mixing and evaporation. This paper has focused on the behavior of kerosene Jet A- 1 spray produced by commercial <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizers</b> in terms of mean diameter distributions, velocity component profiles, and cone angle variations over time. The analysis has been carried out experimentally with the aid of the spray has been analyzed also with a fast imaging technique by means of a high-speed charge-coupled device camera. The instantaneous spray cone angle, estimated with a digital image analysis, has shown that the average cone angle roughly equals the one calculated with phase-Doppler anemometer data, and that it is different from its nominal value. A preliminary investigation into the frequency domain has shown two oscillation modes at low frequency around 100 Hz and at high frequency around 1800 Hz. This issue is a key result because spray oscillations affect the flame stability and the resulting combustion efficiency because a change in the local air/fuel mixture ratio is induced...|$|R
40|$|In {{assessing}} {{the suitability of}} jatropha-derived alternative aviation fuels for aircraft engines, evaluation of spray characteristics in relation to those of conventional aviation kerosene (Jet A- 1) is an important step. The test atomizer employed in the present work is a simplex type hollow cone <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizer</b> used in aircraft engines. The experiments are conducted by discharging fuel spray into quiescent atmospheric air in a fuel spray booth to measure spray characteristics such as fuel discharge behavior, spray cone angle, breakup of liquid fuel sheet and drop size distribution. The characteristics of spray cone angle and fuel sheet breakup are obtained by capturing images of spray using photographic techniques. The measurements of spray drop size distribution are obtained using laser diffraction instrument Spraytec. All the measured spray characteristics of the alternative aviation fuels follow the Jet A- 1 both in qualitative and quantitative terms which ensure the drop-in nature of jatropha-derived fuels. The minor differences observed in the comparison of the spray measurements are attributed to the variation in the fuel properties. This claim {{is supported by the}} predictions obtained from the theoretical models in literature for the determination of sheet breakup characteristics and mean drop size for sprays discharging from simplex swirl atomizers.

40|$|Aeroautical gas {{turbines}} need to satisfy growingly stringent demands on pollutant emission. Pollutant emissions {{are directly related}} to the quality of fuel air mixing prior to combustion. Therefore, their reduction relies on a more accurate prediction of spray formation and interaction of the spray with the gaseous turbulent flowfield. Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) seems an adequate numerical tool to predict these mechanisms. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the impact of simplified injection methods on the LES of the evaporating two-phase flow inside a complex geometry. The chosen target configuration is an aeronautical combustor installed on the MERCATO test-rig. The experimental setup includes an air-swirler injection system and a pressureswirl atomizer typical of realistic aeronautic combustors. In a first step, a simplified injection model for <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizers</b> neglecting the impact of liquid disintegration on spray dynamics is presented. The main objective of this model lies in the reproduction of similar injection conditions for Eulerian and Lagrangian representations of the dispersed phase. In a second step, the Lagrangian injection method is combined to a secondary breakup model of the literature to partly account for the liquid disintegration process. The presented LES’s of the evaporating two-phase flow inside the MERCATO geometry consider two different aspects. First, the impact of injection modeling on spray dynamics is assessed. Second, Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange simulations relying on the common simplified injection model are compared...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{metallic}} filters for trapping fine (1 - 20 µm) particulate {{from hot}} (850 ûC) coal combustion exhausts can offer improved toughness and extended life over ceramic filters. Promising yield strength (200 MPa at 850 ûC), ductility, permeability, and corrosion resistance were obtained in porous (70 % dense) samples that were vacuum sintered from tap-densified spherical powders of a Ni-Cr-Al-Fe alloy. To further improve the corrosion/oxidation {{resistance of the}} Ni-Cr-Al-Fe alloy, additional Al was added to enhance formation of the protective Al 2 O 3 scale and to increase the reservoir of Al for extended filter life. Two new Ni-Cr-Al-Fe alloys consisting of up to three times the Al content, relative to the base Ni-Cr-Al-Fe alloy, were developed and tested. The corrosion resistance of these aluminum-enriched alloys was evaluated, in both Òas-receivedÓ and Òpre-oxidizedÓ conditions, utilizing an oxidizing/sulfidizing gas environment designed to simulate a typical pressurized fluidized bed combustion (PFBC) process. An asymmetrical four-point bend (AFPB) {{test was used to}} determine the yield strength of these alloys, in cast form, at room temperature, 600 ° C, and 850 ° C. Based on the results obtained, a Ni-Cr-Al-Fe alloy containing twice the aluminum content as the Ni-Cr-Al-Fe base alloy was selected as a viable filter alloy and was atomized using the Ames Laboratory high <b>pressure</b> gas <b>atomizer</b> for the purpose of furthe...|$|R
40|$|The Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) {{and spray}} cone angle are two {{important}} parameters that characterize spray performance. The {{objective of this}} study is to characterize palm olein/diesel blends spray in terms of spray angle and SMD under different injection pressures using a hollow cone <b>pressure</b> swirl <b>atomizer.</b> The physical properties of five diesel/palm olein blends, namely B 5, B 10, B 15, B 20 and B 25 were measured and their spray characteristics were tested at injection pressures of 0. 8 MPa, 1. 0 MPa, and 1. 2 MPa under ambient atmospheric condition. The results were compared to spray established using petroleum diesel fuel. The SMD was measured using a phase Doppler analyzer (PDA). The spray cone angle was visualized using a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera. The results indicated that petroleum diesel fuel had the widest cone angle followed by B 5, B 10, B 15, B 20 and B 25 under the same injection pressure. Additionally, when the injection pressure increases from 0. 8 MPa to 1. 2 MPa, the spray cone angle widen accordingly. It is concluded that high content of palm olein in the palm biofuel blends increases viscosity and surface tension and hence higher value of SMD and narrower spray cone angle was generated. An increase in injection pressure resulted in smaller droplet SMD and wider spray cone angle...|$|R
