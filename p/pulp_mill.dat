5|$|In 1922, a ground-wood <b>pulp</b> <b>mill,</b> {{owned by}} the American Pulp and Wrapping Paper Co. of Albany, began {{operation}} on the West River {{at the head of}} the Northwest Arm of Sheet Harbour. They had purchased it from Rhodes and Currie, the previous owners who were a lumber company. It produced its first ground-wood pulp on October 5, 1925. It remained in operation until it was destroyed by Hurricane Beth in August 1971.|$|E
5|$|Meråker saw in {{industrial}} boom {{due to the}} railway. There was already a copper mine and smelters at Kopperå, and they saw the railway as a possibility to change from locally produced charcoal to imported coke. A <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> opened in 1887, but burned down in 1912. The most important industry was the carbide factory that opened in Kopperå in 1900—Meraker Smelteverk. Though located close to the hydroelectricity sources in Meråker, the import and export of raw and finished materials {{would not have been}} possible without the railway. A port for the plant was built at Muruvik in 1918.|$|E
5|$|In October 1885, the Halifax Wood Fibre Company {{built the}} first {{sulphide}} <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> in Canada, {{which at the time}} was the Dominion of Canada, at East River, Sheet Harbour. Since the discovery of the sulphite process happened earlier in 1866, the news had traveled to William Chisholm, who was a lumber manufacturer in Halifax. He decided to try the sulphite method out for himself {{at the head of the}} East River. He had 60,000 acres (24,281 hectares, or 242km2) of woodland on the Sheet Harbour rivers. The mill closed in January 1891, due to the high costs of importing sulphide from the United States. The cookhouse which was used at the mill was bought by the residents of Watt Section and was floated down the harbour to the community.|$|E
2500|$|Several of {{the small}} <b>pulp</b> <b>mills</b> in Norway were {{struggling}} through the 1970s. Exports were decimated with the bankruptcy of key British [...] paper mills were combined with small-scale and thus high-cost production. Meanwhile, new environmental restriction required all-new plants. <b>Pulp</b> <b>mills</b> were therefore being closed throughout the country. Several politicians proposed that a new paper machine should be located elsewhere, and locations such as Namsos and Lauvsnes were mentioned as sites, as these had recently lost <b>pulp</b> <b>mills.</b> Norske Skog retained that without placing PM3 at Fiborgtangen the project would lose its profitability.|$|R

5|$|Logging {{remained}} {{a mainstay of}} industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the wood and paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Lumber mills, {{originally}} {{built to}} provide construction-grade materials for homes and business but then expanded to entice and then {{meet the demands}} of the railroad, profited from an increase in demand from railroad expansion and the nation at large. The Bonner mill, owned the NorthernPacific and CopperKing MarcusDaly, became the largest producer of lumber in the northwest. In 1908, Missoula's location as both a major lumber producer and a regional commercial center helped land the city the regional office for the newly establish U.S. Forest Service created to help manage the nation's timber supply. Over the next century, Missoula's various lumber industries was consolidated under various entities such as the Anaconda Company in the 1970s and Champion International Paper through the 1980s until most were under control of Plum Creek Timber, all the while demand in timber dropped. In 2007, a downward spiral of Missoula's lumber industry began with the closure of a plywood plant in Bonner, the closure of Bonner's sawmill in 2008, and the closing of the Smurfit-Stone Container <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{the project}} {{suggested}} that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as aluminum smelting, to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals. The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> on at least a temporary basis to process {{the hundreds of millions}} of board feet of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded. The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction—not including jobs opened during the construction process. Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.|$|E

25|$|The first <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> along Tistaelva was Søndre Skåningsfossen Træsliberi, {{established}} by Christian Anker in 1867. This operated profitably {{and was able}} to capitalize on much of the otherwise low-value refuse from the sawmills. Saugsbrugforeningen started considering the possibility of building its own <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> in 1872. Declining pulp prices from 1874 caused the company to shelve the plans for the meantime. The mechanical <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> opened in 1889 with five grinders and annual production of 11,000 tonnes, employing sixty people. The <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> was the company's until then largest investment, financed through a loan of 1.25 million Norwegian krone.|$|E
25|$|Nokia's history {{dates back}} to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining {{engineer}} Fredrik Idestam established a <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> {{near the town of}} Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia, offering better hydropower resources. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company from it and called it Nokia Ab (Nokia Company being the English equivalent), after the site of the second <b>pulp</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> {{came off}} on a poor start, with declining pulp prices. Most of the pulp was {{exported}} and director Henry Melhuus therefore proposed that Saugbrugsforeningen establish a paper mill. He hoped to reduce the volatility in revenue and that the company would do better in poor times. This resulted in {{a plan for a}} paper mill with two paper machines with a combined capaicty of 10,000 tonnes, a new electrical <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> with an annual capacity of 12,000 tonnes, an expansion of the chemical <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> and an expansion of the power station. Total investments were NOK4 million.|$|E

25|$|By the 1900s {{the company}} had {{challenges}} making ends meet. The company therefore in 1905 initiated a program to totally revamp its operations. The three head saw mills were demolished and replaced with a new, steam-powered head saw mill adjacent to the edger mill. The <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> was expanded to handle 15,000 tones annually, powered by the new Tistedalsfossen Power Station. Finally a new chemical <b>pulp</b> <b>mill</b> was to be built at Kaken. A complicating factor for the power station was that the company only owned {{about two-thirds of the}} waterfall rights. Finally the Tista Canal was built, allowing direct access from Kaken to the port.|$|E
