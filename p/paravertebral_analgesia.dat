40|$|Effective pain {{management}} after esophagectomy {{is essential for}} patient comfort, early recovery, low surgical morbidity, and short hospitalization. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims {{to determine the best}} {{pain management}} modality focusing on the balance between benefits and risks. Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were systematically searched to identify all studies investigating different pain management modalities after esophagectomy in relation to primary outcomes (postoperative pain scores at 24 and 48 hours, technical failure, and opioid consumption), and secondary outcomes (pulmonary complications, nausea and vomiting, hypotension, urinary retention, and length of hospital stay). Ten studies investigating systemic, epidural, intrathecal, intrapleural and <b>paravertebral</b> <b>analgesia</b> involving 891 patients following esophagectomy were included. No significant differences were found in postoperative pain scores between systemic and epidural analgesia at 24 (mean difference (MD) 0. 89; 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 47 - 2. 24) and 48 hours (MD 0. 15; 95 %CI - 0. 60 - 0. 91), nor described for systemic and other regional analgesia. Also, no significant differences in pulmonary complication rates were identified between systemic and epidural analgesia (relative risk (RR) 1. 69; 95 %CI 0. 86 - 3. 29), or between systemic and <b>paravertebral</b> <b>analgesia</b> (RR 1. 49; 95 %CI 0. 31 - 7. 12). Technical failure ranged from 17 % to 22 % for epidural analgesia. Sample sizes were too small to draw inferences on opioid consumption, the risk of nausea and vomiting, hypotension, urinary retention, and length of hospital stay when comparing the different pain management modalities including systemic, epidural, intrathecal, intrapleural, and <b>paravertebral</b> <b>analgesia.</b> This systematic review and meta-analysis shows no differences in postoperative pain scores or pulmonary complications after esophagectomy between systemic and epidural analgesia, and between systemic and <b>paravertebral</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Further randomized controlled trails are warranted to determine the optimal pain management modality after esophagectomy...|$|E

40|$|Thoracic {{paravertebral}} {{block was}} widely practised {{at the beginning}} of the 20 th century. It has enjoyed a renaissance in the past decade. This form of afferent blockade is the technique of injecting local anaesthetic into the thoracic paravertebral space. Thoracic <b>paravertebral</b> <b>analgesia</b> is mostly indicated for unilateral surgical procedures of the thorax and abdomen. Compared to the other available regional techniques such as epidural, intercostal and interpleural, paravertebral blocks offer comparable or better analgesia with less side effects.

40|$|Background Meta-analysis and {{systematic}} reviews of epidural compared with <b>paravertebral</b> blockade <b>analgesia</b> techniques for thoracotomy conclude {{that although the}} <b>analgesia</b> is comparable, <b>paravertebral</b> blockade has a better short-term side-effect profile. However, reduction in major complications including mortality has not been proven. Methods The UK pneumonectomy study was a prospective observational cohort study in which all UK thoracic surgical centres were invited to participate. Data presented here relate to the mode of analgesia and outcome. Data were analysed for 312 patients having pneumonectomy at 24 UK thoracic surgical centres in 2005.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Post-thoracotomy pain {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} the major concerns following the thoracic surgery. Our study was aimed to compare two methods of regional analgesia in development of this syndrome as well as establish the quality of life in both groups. Patients and Methods: 50 patients undergoing thoracotomy were enrolled in the study and were randomized to thoracic <b>paravertebral</b> cathether <b>analgesia</b> group (group TPA; 25 patients) and to thoracic epidural analgesia group (group TEA; 25 patients). Before induction of anaesthesia patients in both groups received 60 μg/kg morphine and local anaesthetic (TEA group: 0. 125 % bupivacaine, TPA group: 0. 5 % bupivacaine according to Bromage scheme). After the procedure TEA group recieved a mixture, composed of morphine 10 mg, bupivacaine 125 mg and clonidine 0. 15 mg/ 100 mL saline; the rate of infusion was 0. 05 mL/kg/h. TPA group received another mixture, composed of morphine 10 mg, bupivacaine 250 mg and clonidine 0. 15 mg/ 100 mL saline; the rate of infusion was the same as already noted above. PCA infusion system was used in both cases. Postthoracotomy pain was assessed in 3 month’s period after the surgery. The quality of life was evaluated with Brief Pain Inventory. Results and Conlusion: Post-thoracotomy pain was experienced in 52, 25 % of all the patients (TPA group 47, 37 %, TEA group 57, 14 %). No differences in assessment of post-thoracotomy pain were observed in TPA group as compared to TEA group. No differences in the quality of life were observed between two groups...|$|R
40|$|Metastatic {{disease is}} the most {{important}} cause of cancer-related death in patients after cancer surgery. † Drugs and techniques used perioperatively may influence outcome. † In vitro and animal study evidence suggests potential mechanisms altered by anaesthetic drugs. † Human studies are limited but regional anaesthesia may be beneficial. † There is a need for large-scale prospective studies. Summary. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for potentially curable solid tumours. Metastatic disease {{is the most}} important cause of cancer-related death in these patients. The likelihood of tumour metastases depends on the balance between the metastatic potential of the tumour and the anti-metastatic host defences, of which cell-mediated immunity, and natural killer cell function in particular, is a critical component. It is increasingly recognized that anaesthetic technique and other perioperative factors have the potential to effect long-term outcome after cancer surgery. Surgery can inhibit important host defences and promote the development of metastases. Anaesthetic technique and drug choice can interact with the cellular immune system and effect long-term outcome. The potential effect of i. v. anaesthetics, volatile agents, local anaesthetic drugs, opiates, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are reviewed here. There is particular interest at present in the effect of regional anaesthesia, which appears to be beneficial. Retrospective analyses have shown an outcome benefit for <b>paravertebral</b> <b>analgesia</b> for breast cancer surgery and epidural analgesia for prostatectomy. Blood transfusion, pain, stress, and hypothermia are other potentially important perioperative factors to consider...|$|E
40|$|Objectives : This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the intrathecal morphine and paravertebral block with bupivacaine given before induction of anesthesia for intra-operative and post-thoracotomy pain relief for 48 hours using patient controlled <b>paravertebral</b> <b>analgesia</b> in post-operative period. Methods : After taken an approval from the ethics committee of the University, 40 patients were randomly assigned to receive either preservative-free intrathecal morphine 0. 3 mg in 3 ml normal saline together with paravertebral block (group I) or paravertebral block alone using bupivacaine (group II) before an induction of anesthesia. No continuous infusion of bupivacaine was started in both groups. Primary outcomes were Visual Analogue Score (VAS) at rest and on coughing. Hemodynamic and respiratory effects, bupivacaine consumption, patient′s satisfaction, and side effects like nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, and itching were considered as secondary outcomes. All patients in both groups received paracetamol 1 gram (gm) IV every 6 hourly for the 1 st 24 hr. Amount of rescue analgesic (pethidine 0. 5 mg/kg IV) in both groups and total bupivacaine cumulative doses in 48 hrs were calculated. Results : VAS at rest and on coughing did not differ significantly between the 2 groups at 0, 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 hours (P=> 0. 1). At 24 hours, VAS increased in both the groups, but the increase in VAS was comparable in both groups. There were insignificant incidences of nausea, purities, and urinary retention in intrathecal group compared with paravertebral group. The other side effects and patient satisfaction did not show any statistical significant difference between 2 groups. Conclusion : Intrathecal morphine 0. 3 mg is safe and effective way to improves pain control for thoracic surgery and was comparable to paravertebral patient control analgesia (PPCA) with bupivacaine for the 1 st 48 hours post-thoracotomy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to enhance}} the {{efficiency}} and safety of anesthesia during thoracic surgical interventions in pediatric cancer surgery, by using general anesthesia in combination with thoracic <b>paravertebral</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Subjects and methods. A prospective, randomized trial was conducted. Intra- and postoperative data were analyzed in 90 patients who had been operated on for lung and thoracic malignancies. There were two patient groups: 1) 50 children who used continuous thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) with ropivacaine 0. 3 % as part of combined balanced anesthesia and 2) 40 children who received epidural block with ropivacaine 0. 2 % as an analgesic component of combined anesthesia. All the patients underwent hemodynamic monitoring; postoperative pain assessment were carried out by a visual analogue scale (VAS) in children above 3 {{years of age and}} by the modified Douleur Aigue du Nouveau-ne (DAN) scale in those below the age of 3 years. Results. The trial has demonstrated that the analgesic effect during continuous PVB in the intra- and postoperative periods is comparable with that of epidural block with ropivacaine 0. 2 %; however, it has a higher hemodynamic stability. Ultrasound guided PVB has sufficient safety. The postoperative complications were  pneumonia  in  2   (4 %)   patients  in  the  PVB  group;  these  were  associated  with  the  baseline  patient  status  in  5 (12. 5 %) children in the epidural analgesia group. Postoperative nausea was found in only 6 % of the patients in the PVB group. Conclusion. The proposed modification of ropivacaine 0. 3 % injection into the paravertebral space under ultrasound guidance can increase the extent of the local anesthetic, thus enhancing the efficiency of PVB. The efficiency of the block is 98. 1 % versus 86 % of the given by foreign authors.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Primary lateral {{sclerosis}} (PLS) {{is a rare}} idiopathic neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper motor neurons and {{characterized by}} spasticity, muscle weakness, and bulbar involvement. It can sometimes mimic early stage of more common and fatal amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Surgical patients {{with a history of}} neurodegenerative disorders, including PLS, may be at increased risk for general anesthesia related ventilatory depression and postoperative respiratory complications, abnormal response to muscle relaxants, and sensitivity to opioids, sedatives, and local anesthetics. We present a case of a patient with PLS and recent diagnosis of breast cancer who underwent a simple mastectomy surgery uneventfully under an ultrasound guided thoracic <b>paravertebral</b> block, multimodal <b>analgesia,</b> and monitored anesthesia care. Patient reported minimal to no pain or discomfort in the postoperative period and received no opioids for pain management before being discharged home. In patients with PLS, thoracic paravertebral block and multimodal analgesia can provide reliable anesthesia and effective analgesia for breast surgery with avoidance of potential risks associated with general anesthesia, muscle paralysis, and opioid use...|$|R
40|$|To {{find out}} the effect of {{diazepam}} and promethazine hydrochloride on respiratory rate, pulse rate, temperature and production of clinical signs in goats and also to compare the effect of 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride and 0. 5 % bupivacaine hydrochloride during <b>paravertebral</b> and epidural <b>analgesia</b> were investigated. A total of 16 apparently healthy Black Bengal goats with body weight of 8 - 12 (median 9. 5 kg) kg were used and allocated in 8 groups. Both diazepam and promethazine, were used as sedatives. Diazepam and promethazine produced significant reduction (P< 0. 01) of respiratory rate and significantly (P< 0. 01) increase of the pulse rate, respectively. But both drugs produced reduction of temperature insignificantly. The important clinical signs recorded using diazepam was movement of legs, neck, salivation and sleepiness whereas with promethazine only a tranquilizing effect was recorded. With 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride the onset of analgesia was rapid compared to 0. 5 bupivacaine hydrochloride. But the duration was significantly longer in 0. 5 % bupivacaine than that of 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride. Muscle relaxation was better with 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride compared to 0. 5 % bupivacaine hydrochloride. This experiment suggested that both diazepam and promethazine are suitable as pre-medicants in goats and bupivacaine seemed to be better for longer duration of analgesia compared to lignocaine which {{may be used for}} shorter and minor surgery in goats...|$|R
40|$|Thoracic {{anesthesia}} offers particular challenge. Thoracic patients {{frequently have}} a painful wound after surgery. So analgesia after thoracic surgery {{is of particular}} significance. In the present study we assessed the efficacy of thoracic paravertebral and epidural blockade on post thoracotomy pain and pulmonary function. Thirty adult ASA I-III patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery were enrolled in this study. they were randomly {{divided into two groups}} : paravertebral and epidural group (15 patients each). Both percutaneous paravertebral and epidural catheters were placed preoperatively. Before chest closure each patient received a bolus dose of bupivacaine (0. 25 %) according to its height. This was followed by postoperative bupivacaine infusion (0. 25 %) 0. 1 ml kg- 1 h ­ 1 in both groups. Also patients were encouraged to take supplementary doses of morphine from a patient controlled analgesia (PCA). Subjective pain relief was assessed on a linear visual analogue scale and pulmonary function was measured by spirometry. Stress responses to noxious stimuli was assessed by plasma levels of cortisol and glucose. Respiratory variables were recorded throughout the study period. Also sensory level of analgesia and performance status were assessed in the two groups. Although we found significantly lower visual analogue pain scores at rest and on maximal coughing in the paravertebral compared to the epidural group, no significant difference in patient controlled morphine requirements was noted between the two groups. Pulmonary function (FVC, FEV 1 and PEFR) was significantly better in the paravertebral group. Meanwhile no significant difference in respiratory variables was recorded between the two groups. Paravertebral block produced significantly diminished stress responses to noxious stimuli as manifested by less increase in plasma cortisol level than in epidural block. Sensory levels of analgesia and performance status was similar in both groups. Side effects as hypotension, urine retention, nausea and difficulty in breathing were troublesome in the epidural group. While nausea and difficulty in breathing were less in paravertebral group. Conclusion : Like epidural <b>analgesia,</b> <b>paravertebral</b> block deserves to be considered for post thoracotomy pain relief...|$|R
40|$|Thoracic {{paravertebral}} block (TPVB) {{consists of}} an injection of local anaesthetic alongside the thoracic vertebra close to where the spinal nerves emerge from the intervertebral foramen. Clinically TPVB can be accomplished either as a single-injection or as a multiple-injection. It {{can also be used}} as a continuous paravertebral infusion through an indwelling catheter for continuous pain relief. However compared to an epidural block, TPVB is less well understood and not commonly used for anaesthesia and or analgesia in anaesthetic practice. I hypothesized that TPVB is effective for producing unilateral segmental thoracic anaesthesia and managing pain of unilateral origin from the thorax. The objective of this thesis was to develop the technique of TPVB so that it becomes a useful technique for anaesthesia and pain management. So to test my hypothesis a series of clinical studies were performed on 416 patients (396 adults and 20 young infants), presenting for anaesthesia and or acute pain management, to evaluate various aspects of TPVB, namely; clinical application, anatomy of the thoracic paravertebral space, technique and safety, and pharmacology of local anaesthetic after TPVB. Also included are 9 published case reports and letters-to-editor (Appendix 1 - 9) based on my research that have provided new insights into the mechanism and applications of TPVB.
