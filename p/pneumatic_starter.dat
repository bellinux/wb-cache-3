2500|$|This {{version of}} the M-17T was {{modified}} {{for use in the}} T-35 heavy tank. The front part of the crankcase was reinforced, the lower cover of the crankcase was removed and it reverted to a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>starter.</b> It had a power of [...]|$|E
2500|$|This {{version was}} adapted {{for use in}} Soviet tanks. It was derated in rpm, used a K-17a carburetor, and an oil coil. Its cooling system was {{improved}} and the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>starter</b> was replaced by an electric starter. It had a power of [...] and a compression ratio of 6.0:1.|$|E

50|$|Electric {{starters}} are {{now almost}} universal for {{small and medium-sized}} engines, while <b>pneumatic</b> <b>starters</b> are used for large engines.|$|R
50|$|Since large trucks {{typically}} use air brakes, {{the system}} does double duty, supplying compressed air to the brake system. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>starters</b> have the advantages of delivering high torque, mechanical simplicity and reliability. They {{eliminate the need for}} oversized, heavy storage batteries in prime mover electrical systems.|$|R

50|$|Triumph Accessory Services - Grand Prairie {{provides}} {{engine and}} airframe accessory services to aviation customers globally. The organization services valves and drive units, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>starters,</b> engine gearboxes, lube system pumps, hydraulic actuators, fuel nozzles, fuel pumps, fuel controls, electric generator products including speed drives and performs bearing and gear inspection.|$|R
50|$|Unlike many {{tactical}} jets {{which required}} ground service equipment, the S-3 {{was equipped with}} an auxiliary power unit (APU) and capable of unassisted starts. The aircraft's original APU could provide only minimal electric power and pressurized air for both aircraft cooling and for the engines' <b>pneumatic</b> <b>starters.</b> A newer, more powerful APU could provide full electrical service to the aircraft. The APU itself was started from a hydraulic accumulator by pulling a mechanical handle in the cockpit. The APU accumulator was fed from the primary hydraulic system, but could also be pumped up manually (with much effort) from the cockpit.|$|R
25|$|Four Kuznetsov NK-86 two-spool with five-stage LP compressors, six-stage HP compressors, annular {{combustor}} cans, single-stage HP turbine and two-stage LP turbine turbofan engines {{power the}} Il-86. The cascade thrust reversers are canted 15° {{in respect to}} the horizontal axis. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>starters</b> start the engines (airborne relights use the windmill effect). The forward-facing ejectors blow away detritus during taxi. International Standard Atmosphere hourly fuel consumption per engine is 7.7t (16,975lb) at maximum continuous rated thrust, 6t/13,230lb at nominal maximum thrust, 5.1t (11,243lb) at 85% thrust, 4.2t/9260lb at 70%, 3.6t (7,937lb) at 60%, 2.45t (5,400lb) at 40% and 1t (2,205lb) at idle. Overall hourly fuel consumption at long-range cruise and 190t (419,000lb) is 9.75t (21,495lb) reducing to 7.79t (17,174lb) at 140t (308,650lb). Outboard engine pylons on the latter two-thirds of all Il-86s are marginally extended to cut drag.|$|R
