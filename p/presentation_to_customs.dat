40|$|Abstract Background Our {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} frequency and determinants of <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care with advanced HIV disease in patients who discover their HIV diagnosis at this stage as well as those with delayed <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care after HIV diagnosis in earlier stages. Methods We collected data on 1, 819 HIV-infected patients in Brussels (Belgium) and Northern France from January 1997 to December 2007. "Advanced HIV disease" was defined as CD 4 count 3 or clinically-defined AIDS at study inclusion and was stratified into two groups: (a) late testing, defined as <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care with advanced HIV disease and HIV diagnosis â‰¤ 6 months before initiation of HIV care; and (b) delayed <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care, defined as <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care with advanced HIV disease and HIV diagnosis > 6 months before initiation of HIV care. We used multinomial logistic regression to determine the factors associated with delayed <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care and late testing. Results Of the 570 patients initiating care with advanced HIV disease, 475 (83. 3 %) were tested late and 95 (16. 7 %) had delayed <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care. Risk factors for delayed <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care were: age 30 - 50 years, injection drug use, and follow-up in Brussels. Risk factors for late testing were: sub-Saharan African origin, male gender, and older age. HIV transmission through heterosexual contact was associated with an increased risk of both delayed <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care and late testing. Patients who initiated HIV care in 2003 - 2007 were less likely to have been tested late or to have a delayed <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care than patients who initiated care before 2003. Conclusion A considerable proportion of HIV-infected patients present to care with advanced HIV disease. Late testing, rather than a delay in initiating care after earlier HIV testing, is the main determinant of <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care with advanced HIV disease. The factors associated with delay <b>presentation</b> <b>to</b> care differ from those associated with late testing. Different strategies should be developed to optimize early access to care in these two groups. </p...|$|R
