The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E

Though {{most of the}} Court's container jurisprudence deals with the search of the container rather than the initial seizure, there existed some general principles. First, the seizure may not take place without a warrant, supported by probable cause, and describing particularly the things to be seized. Second, over time, exceptions to the warrant requirement had evolved, allowing for seizure without probable cause in exigent circumstances not allowing for the time to obtain a warrant.|$|E

And I wanted the color red because it represents the one thing that all <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> common: blood.

I was shocked when I heard of all the work people went through to keep Dogmeat alive to the end – especially the hell that they went through with the force fields in the Military Base." [...] According to Fallout 2 and Fallout: New Vegas designer Chris Avellone, Dogmeat is [...] "arguably the most successful NPC companion ever" [...] for several reasons: [...] "One, he doesn't talk, so the players can project a personality on to him. Two, he's effective in combat ... and three, he's a dog that stays with you through thick-and-thin.

Dean Falk, an evolutionary anthropologist at Florida State University, led the study - which analysed 14 recently discovered photographs - and described the brain: [...] "Although the overall size and asymmetrical shape of Einstein's brain were normal, the prefrontal, somatosensory, primary motor, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices were extraordinary." [...] There was a fourth ridge (apart from the three normal <b>people</b> <b>have)</b> <b>in</b> Einstein's mid-frontal lobe involved in making plans and working memory. [...] The parietal lobes were markedly asymmetrical and a feature in Einstein's primary motor cortex may {{have been associated with}} his musical ability.|$|E

[...] Lampert dismissed his concerns that the smaller company would be at a disadvantage, stating [...] "The focus {{that a lot of}} <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> retail revolves around sales, but sales without profit do not allow a business to be successful in the long term." [...] He began to improve the company's balance sheet by reducing inventory, cutting costs, and closing underperforming stores.

2500|$|Committed, by the 1920s, to {{a highly}} {{personalized}} pacifist socialism, Aderca veered toward the far-left of politics: in Idei și oameni, he chided Romanian reformism, moderate Marxism as personified by Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and the Second International. He decried the exploitation of workers and luxuries such as the casinos of Sinaia. Nonetheless, Crohmălniceanu, a Marxist, noted that Moartea unei republici roșii told little about how [...] "a new society is to be organized". Aderca favored [...] "a nonconformism of a mostly moral and aesthetic kind", where sexual freedom, creative liberty and the celebration Aderca approved of class conflict, with Marxism as a legitimiate tool of the masses: [...] "war is a creation of masters fighting each other for dominance. [...] What can the impoverished <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> common with the polite master? The French worker, what does he stand to gain from this war, other than a more thorough understanding of Marxism?" [...] Aderca's leftist leanings were incompatible with the neoliberalism of his mentor Eugen Lovinescu, something acknowledged by Aderca in his Mic tratat years. In Mărturia unei generații, Aderca challenged Lovinescu to answer on the subject. Lovinescu did so, noting that Sburătoruls celebration of individualism outweighed the neoliberal stance of its leader. In Aderca's work, socialism was doubled by a sarcastic view of traditional authority. Police officers opened a file on him when, in 1927, he mocked King Ferdinand I as a standard of barber shop posters. According to Dumitru Hîncu, although the comment irritated state security, it was not truly [...] "an attack on State institutions or its leaders".|$|E

The propensity to approach a meaning not directly and squarely, but by circuitous styles of expression, seems indeed a born quality of the common people everywhere, evidenced by nick-names, and the inveterate determination of the masses to bestow sub-titles, sometimes ridiculous, sometimes very apt. Always among the soldiers during the secession war, one heard of [...] "Little Mac" [...] (Gen. McClellan), or of [...] "Uncle Billy" [...] (Gen. Sherman.)
