40|$|<b>Private</b> <b>schooling</b> is an {{important}} feature of the educational landscape in Pakistan and is increasingly a topic of public and government discourse. This study uses multiple rounds of national household sample surveys to examine the extent and nature of <b>private</b> <b>school</b> participation at the primary and secondary levels in Pakistan. Today, one-fifth of children [...] or one-third of all students [...] go to <b>private</b> <b>school</b> in Pakistan. <b>Private</b> <b>school</b> students tend to come from urban, wealthier, and more educated households than do government school students and especially out-of-school children. Important differences exist across Pakistan s four provinces {{with respect to the}} characteristics of <b>private</b> <b>school</b> students relative to government school students, {{as well as in the}} composition of <b>private</b> <b>school</b> students. <b>Private</b> <b>schooling</b> is highly concentrated, with a few districts (situated mainly in northern Punjab province) accounting for most of the <b>private</b> <b>school</b> students. <b>Private</b> <b>school</b> participation among children varies largely from one household to another, rather than within households, and to a greater extent than does government school participation. The spatial patterns of <b>private</b> <b>school</b> supply are often strongly correlated with the spatial patterns of <b>private</b> <b>school</b> participation. In the 2000 s, <b>private</b> <b>school</b> participation rates grew in Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces and across socioeconomic subgroups, contributing in particular to the growth in overall school participation rates for boys, children from urban households, and children from households in the highest wealth quintile. Nevertheless, the composition of <b>private</b> <b>school</b> students has become less unequal over time. This trend has been driven mainly by Punjab province, which has seen declines in the shares of <b>private</b> <b>school</b> students from urban households and households in the highest wealth quintile...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} <b>private</b> <b>school</b> choice that incorporates measures of the availability and costs of <b>private</b> <b>schooling,</b> {{as well as the}} quality of existing public schools, in the local market for secondary education. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the 1980 <b>Private</b> High <b>Schools</b> File, I estimate this model on all individuals enrolled in high school in 1979 and all Catholics enrolled in high school in 1979. I find that the availability of a <b>private</b> high <b>school</b> of one’s religious affiliation in one’s county of residence significantly increases the likelihood of <b>private</b> <b>school</b> attendance. Further, per capita educational expenditures in one’s county of residence are inversely related to the likelihood of attending a <b>private</b> high <b>school.</b> Finally, <b>private</b> <b>school</b> enrollment decisions are relatively insensitive to tuition and fees levels. These results provide a link between aggregate models of <b>private</b> <b>school</b> enrollment within educational markets and microdata models of <b>private</b> <b>school</b> choice...|$|R
