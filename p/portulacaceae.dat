50|$|The Anacampserotaceae are {{a family}} of plants {{proposed}} in the February 2010 {{issue of the journal}} Taxon. The family was described by Urs Eggli and Reto Nyffeler in their analysis of the polyphyly in the suborder Portulacineae (order Caryophyllales). The new family and its circumscription was based on molecular and morphological data. The three recognized genera - Anacampseros, Grahamia, and Talinopsis - were formerly placed in the <b>Portulacaceae</b> and comprise a total of 36 known species. This family was accepted in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group's 2009 publication of the APG III system.|$|E
5000|$|Caryophyllales is {{separated}} into 2 sub-orders: Caryophyllineae and Polygonineae. Caryophyllineae contains 21 families and 8,600 species and major families include Aizoaceae, Basellaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Didiereaceae, Phytolaccaceae (including Petiveriaceae), Nyctaginaceae, Molluginaceae, Amaranthaceae (sometimes including Chenopodiaceae), Cactaceae, and <b>Portulacaceae.</b> This roughly constitutes the Caryophyllales as defined before the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group expanded it {{to include the}} plants which can be classified in the Polygonales or Polygonineae (depending on whether they are considered an order or a suborder of Caryophyllales). The Caryophyllineae is sometimes called [...] "core Caryophyllales" [...] and the Polygonineae is sometimes called the [...] "non-core Caryophyllales".|$|E
50|$|The core {{collection}} of hardy plants are grouped in long, narrow, oblong beds by botanical family and ordered {{according to the}} classification system devised by nineteenth century botanists, Bentham and Hooker. The families represented in the Walled Garden include: Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Apocynaceae, Araceae, Aristolochiaceae, Berberidaceae, Boraginaceae, Campanulaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Cistaceae, Commelinaceae, Compositae, Convolvulaceae, Crassulaceae, Cruciferae, Cyperaceae, Dioscoreaceae, Dipsacaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Gentianaceae, Geraniaceae, Gramineae, Hypericaceae, Iridaceae, Juncaceae, Labiatae, Leguminosae, Liliaceae, Linaceae, Loasaceae, Lythraceae, Malvaceae, Onagraceae, Paeoniaceae, Papaveraceae, Phytolaccaceae, Plantaginaceae, Plumbaginaceae, Polemoniaceae, Polygonaceae, <b>Portulacaceae,</b> Primulaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae, Rubiaceae, Rutaceae, Saxifragaceae, Solanaceae, Umbelliferae, Urticaceae, Verbenaceae, Violaceae.|$|E
50|$|Given that {{chaparral}} {{areas can}} be waterlogged in the winter, and arid and desert-like in the summer, native plants in these dry elfin forests have adapted accordingly, and are generally much shorter, smaller, and compact than related plants elsewhere. Diminutive plants {{commonly found in}} Californian elfin forests include <b>Portulacaceae</b> such as Mount Hood pussypaws (Cistanthe umbellata) and Alkali heath (Frankenia salina), and species of Aeonium and bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus). Trees and shrubs, such as chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), manzanita (Arctostaphylos), ceanothus, sumac (Rhus), sage (Salvia officinalis), and scrub-oak (Quercus berberidifolia) rarely grow more than 20 ft (7m) tall in these communities.|$|E
50|$|Lyallia kerguelensis, {{commonly}} called the lyallia cushion (coussin de lyallia in French), is {{a species of}} flowering cushion plant in the monotypic genus Lyallia in the Montiaceae family. It is sometimes placed in the Hectorellaceae or the <b>Portulacaceae.</b> The generic name honours British botanist and naval officer David Lyall who served as assistant surgeon on HMS Terror on the Antarctic exploring expedition led by James Clark Ross from 1839 to 1843. Lyall was a friend and colleague of describer Joseph Dalton Hooker on the expedition when the type material was collected. The specific epithet refers to the type locality.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Portulacaceae</b> are {{a family}} of {{flowering}} plants, comprising 115 species in a single genus Portulaca. Formerly some 20 genera with about 500 species, were placed there, but it is now restricted to encompass only one genus, the other genera being placed elsewhere. The family has been recognised by most taxonomists, and {{is also known as}} the purslane family; it has a cosmopolitan distribution, with the highest diversity in semiarid regions of the Southern Hemisphere in Africa, Australia, and South America, but with a few species also extending north into Arctic regions. The family is very similar to the Caryophyllaceae, differing in the calyx, which has only two sepals.|$|E
