40|$|Purpose: Swine are {{expected}} to be utilized as xenograft donors for both whole organ and cellular transplantation.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the existence of <b>porcine</b> <b>endogenous</b> <b>retrovirus</b> (PERV) in fresh and decellularised porcine tissues. Methods: Porcine tissues (both fresh and decellularised) were analysed using validated assays specific for PERV: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: PERV specific GAG sequences were found in the porcine heart tissue samples using PCR for DNA and RT- PCR for RNA. All tissue samples (both fresh and treated tissues) like aortic valve, pulmonary valve and heart muscle showed the presence of PERV DNA. RT PCR for PERV was positive in all fresh tissues and was found to be negative in decellularised treated tissues.

40|$|Since <b>porcine</b> <b>endogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> (PERVs) can infect cultured human cells, {{they are}} a {{potential}} hazard to xenotransplantation. For this reason, <b>endogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> from the Westran (Westmead Hospital transplantation) inbred line of pigs were analyzed by using consensus primers for the type A and type B viruses to amplify 1. 8 -kb envelope gene fragments. After preliminary analysis with restriction enzymes KpnI and MboI, 31 clones were sequenced. Between types A and B, five recombinant clones were identified.

The maps indicate that modern domesticated swine meat breeds are the closest to the wild type. Meat-and-lard domestic swine breeds are more distant from wild boars, and miniature pigs are diverged the most. The maps showed that microevolution processes associated with PERV carriership frequency had two basic dimensions, or vectors: the vector of fat deposition variation and the “minus” selection vector (determination of commercial traits).
