40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} photoperiod on testicular ac-tivity in wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) captured on Zem-bra Island (North Tunisia) and maintained in experimental pho-toperiodic conditions. Sexually inactive animals were subjected to alternate 3 -mo periods of short days (8 L: 16 D) and long days (16 L: 8 D) for 1 yr. Testicular activity increased significantly and then decreased to levels equivalent to or lower than those mea-sured during sexual quiescence after 1 mo of 8 L: 16 D or 16 L: 8 D, respectively. Eight groups of sexually active animals were also exposed to 8 L: 16 D for 60 days. The light phase was divided into two photofractions (7. 5 and 0. 5 h). The short <b>photofraction</b> interrupted the dark phase 9. 5 – 18. 5 h after {{the beginning of the}} main <b>photofraction.</b> Testicular activity was inhibited if the short <b>photofraction</b> interrupted the dark phase 12. 5 h or more after the beginning of the main <b>photofraction.</b> These results clearly confirm that photoperiod affects reproduction in this species: Short days stimulate reproduction, whereas long days inhibit it. The asymmetric pattern of skeleton photoperiods used demon-strated the existence of a circadian rhythm for photogonadosen-sitivity, with the photosensitive phase beginning 12. 5 h after dawn. In this species, photoperiod length controls both the be-ginning {{and the end of the}} reproductive period. These results differ from those obtained with continental populations of wild rabbits, in which reproduction is inhibited by short day length. This difference may reflect genetic drift linked to the geographic isolation of this population, which is known to have been pre-sent on this small island for more than 2000 yr. environment, male sexual function, seasonal reproduction, ste-roid hormones, testis, testosteron...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Two {{groups of}} 12 adult Ile-de-France rams {{were exposed to}} {{artificial}} 6 -month light cycles in which daily illumination was provided {{in one or two}} <b>photofractions.</b> In Group I, daylength increased linearly from 8 to 16 h in 3 months and decreased similarly from 16 to 8 h. The daily increment or decrement (5. 33 min/day) was constant. In Group II, 8 h of light were given in two parts: the main one, 7 h, began at the time of dawn in Group I and an additional 1 h light pulse was coincident with the last hour of the former group. The onset of the pulse changed therefore each day and the interval between dawn of the first block and dusk of the second block of light increased from 8 to 16 h in 3 months and declined from 16 to 8 h the next 3 months. Testicular weight was estimated by an orchidometer every 2 weeks for 2 (N = 12 /group) or 3 consecutive light cycles (N = 6 /group). The testicular weight variations were identical in both groups. In the 6 rams of each group studied during 3 light cycles, variations of testicular weight were submitted to an harmonic regression analysis according to time and the computed values for the mean, amplitude, period and phase were, respectively, 260 g, 66 g, 185 days and 120 days in Group I and 262 g, 65 g, 181 days and 111 days in Group II. Analysis performed for each ram gave very similar values in all individuals. It is concluded (1) that daylength is not measured by the total duration of light exposure but between two limits represented here by dawn and the pulse of light and (2) that the measurement is not limited to a particular photosensitive phase but is effective throughout the entire light cycle...|$|R

These measurements gave directly the relative photopeak efficiencies thus yielding new information about these CsI crystals. The photopeaks in the 3 " x 3 " CsI(Na) crystal were found to be unexpectedly asymmetric, and we analyzed our spectra from two points of view: (i) referring to the high energy half of the peaks and (ii) referring to the full peaks. The extent of asymmetry was investigated in detail. An important feature in our experimental set-up was the source-holder designed to facilitate accurate adjustments of the crystal-to-source distances (inside the lead chamber) with external manipulations only. We also determined the photofractions of the CsI crystals at 3 and 10 cm (and at 0 and 15 cm by extrapolation) assuming the experimental values of Heath (1964) for the <b>photofraction</b> of a 3 " x 3 " NaI(T 1). In this connection we used the "scaling relations" to compute the absolute detection efficiencies of the CsI crystals from the available information on the NaI crystals. The photofractions were found to be not too sensitively dependent on the crystal-to-source distance. We have compared our <b>photofraction</b> values with the theoretical values of Mller and Snow (1961) for the photofractions of the CsI crystals. Theoretical values were seen to be generally too large. Disagreement with the theoretical values was also seen in the comparison of the ratios of the photofractions of the 3 " x 3 " and the 2 " x 2 " CsI crystals...|$|E

40|$|As small animal PET {{scanners}} are continuously improving {{in their}} performances, one is {{lead to the}} question of how far can spatial resolution go. In this paper we address the limiting effects to spatial resolution and whether the photoelectric interaction, and therefore high Z materials, outperform medium Z scintillators. In particular, with a Monte Carlo simulation, we compare the ultimate performances, in spatial resolution, of three scintillators: BGO, NaI(Tl) and YAP:Ce. BGO is the PET scintillator which has the highest <b>photofraction</b> whereas YAP:Ce has the lowest. NaI(Tl), instead is a relatively high Z but low density scintillator. There are three principle contributions to the degradation of spatial resolution: multiple Compton scattering electron range after a gamma interaction and K-shell fluorescence emission. We present the results of simulations of crystals with different thicknesses, with and without K-shell fluorescence emission and electron transport. We conclude that the effect of multiple scattering, electron range and fluorescence emission to the spatial resolution are smaller for low Z, high density materials like YAP:Ce. The fraction of misplaced events, defined here as F = NWrong/NTot, is F 0. 5 mm = 52 % for BGO in the case of 0. 5 mm binning, increasing to F 0. 1 mm = 80 % for the 0. 1 mm binning. In the case of YAP:Ce, the scatter fractions are respectively F 0. 5 mm = 27 % and F 0. 1 mm = 44 %. We conclude that for ultra high resolution PET detectors, medium Z scintillators, such as YAP:Ce, may outperform high Z materials...|$|E
