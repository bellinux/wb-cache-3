40|$|With {{progression}} of space experience, {{the need of}} more stable and repeatable interfaces definition becomes clear. Especially for satellite platform needs, some electrical interfaces need a more reproducible application frame, to ensure {{at the same time}} the necessary and undisputable quality and reliability needed for institutional and non-institutional missions, and the containment of costs that nowadays is overall requested. The prerequisite to be able to establish a wide and agreed basis for the definition of the <b>power</b> electrical <b>interfaces</b> on <b>board</b> of a spacecraft is the existence of a consolidated reference architecture. Such consolidated reference architecture indeed exists for the power subsystem of ESA satellites: due to a number of practical reasons, the concept of using Latching Current Limiters (or LCLs) for the satellite onboard power distribution has consolidated over many decades. This allowed a global European agreement on the relevant interface definition, which culminated in the drafting, reviewing and publication of the ECSS-EST- 20 - 20 C standard (STD) and of the relevant handbook ECSS-E-HB- 20 - 20 A (HB) ...|$|R
40|$|Wireless sensor {{communication}} can {{evaluate the}} structural integrity {{of a system}} while reducing the danger and cost of installation and maintenance on satellites. This is needed at the International Space Station {{as well as other}} satellites. The objective of this mission is to perform a demonstration using backscatter Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tag technology as a method of wireless communication in extremely low earth orbit. While RFID tag communication has been used on earth for many practical applications the technology has yet to be tested in space. A 3 U Cubesat was selected as the configuration to house the experiment. This project utilizes an electrical <b>power</b> system, an <b>interface</b> <b>board</b> custom built around a microcontroller, and two radio communication systems to run the RFID experiment to be designed by a Georgia Tech engineering team. The RFID tag will be mounted to a carbon fiber boom that can be extended out one meter to incrementally collect data. This satellite will need to be strong enough to pass a series of vibration and heat tests to be qualified for flight. It will be programmed to maintain its own power, take data, and communicate the data back to earth via the Globalstar Network...|$|R

40|$|The project PC/Microcontroller based {{drilling}} machine is an on going project which originally {{began as an}} EN 300 project in semester 2, 2001 at the Department of Engineering, USP. The <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> which is {{a component of the}} {{drilling machine}} was not fully functional at the completion of the EN 300 project. Also, many of the amplifier circuits and feedback circuits were either not fully functional or not done at all. This project report focuses on troubleshooting and improving the existing <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> design so that data can be accurately communicated between the PC or microcontroller and the various hardware associated with the drilling machine. The report also describes how an output from the interfacing card is amplified so that it can energize the solenoids that would hold the work piece in place during drilling. In addition to this, the report also explains how the feedback circuits of the drilling machine are connected to the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board.</b> An <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> prototype has been produced that communicates data accurately between the PC and the various drilling machine hardware. To validate this testing has been carried out using switches, LED’s and laboratory power supplies in the first instance and then via connections to the PC’s parallel port and running test programs from the PC to read and write data from the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board.</b> Final testing has been carried out by integrating the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> {{with the rest of the}} drilling machine components. An amplifier circuit has also been produced that facilitates the correct operation of the clamping solenoids to hold a work piece in place during the drilling process. To validate this testing has also been carried out using laboratory power supplies as well as connecting the amplifier circuit to an output of the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> and running test programs from the PC and eventually testing its performance with the rest of the drilling machine components. The feedback circuits designed for the various limit switches and work piece detector associated with the drilling machine are fully operational and functional. Testing very much similar to that for the amplifier circuit for the clamping solenoids has been carried out to validate this. ...|$|R

50|$|Open {{systems are}} based on a layer model. The {{behavior}} of the single layers (<b>interface</b> <b>board,</b> low level driver, high level driver and API) follows the constraints of the respective operating system manufacturer. Application software is allowed to access operating system APIs, but never should access any level lower. In the context of FireWire cameras, the high level drivers are responsible for the protocol. The low level drivers and the <b>interface</b> <b>boards</b> put the definitions of the standard IEEE 1394 into effect. The advantage of this strategy is the simple realization of application software, which is independent of hardware and specific manufacturers.|$|R
