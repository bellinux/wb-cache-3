The quantification method was developed during a study of an amorphous silica-poly(methyl methacrylate) (SiO 2 -PMMA) hybrid nanocomposite. The efficiency of the method as a quantifying tool for individual phases was demonstrated for samples of SiO 2 -PMMA prepared either by polymerization of methyl methacrylate {{in the presence of}} amorphous SiO 2 or by mechanically mixing known quantities of the individual and pre-prepared SiO 2 and PMMA materials. The weight percentages of amorphous SiO 2 in the nanocomposites as determined by application of the new technique were analogously found to be 29 %, a result that was supported by thermogravimetric analysis and helium <b>picnometry</b> measurements...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the effect of temperature and heating rate on the densification of four leucite-based dental porcelains: two low-fusion (Dentsply–Ceramco and Ivoclar) and two high-fusion commercial porcelains (Dentsply–Ceramco). Porcelain powders were characterized by differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size distribution, helium <b>picnometry,</b> and by scanning electron microscopy. Test specimens were sintered from 600 to 1050 °C, with heating rates of 55 °C/min and 10 °C/min. The bulk density of the specimens was measured by the Archimedes method in water, and microstructures of fracture surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that densification of specimens increased with the increase in temperature. The increase in the heating rate had no effect on the densification of the porcelains studied.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{fabrication}} of extruded foams from polystyrene/thermoplastic starch (PS/TPS) blends. A specially designed twinscrew extrusion process {{is used for}} starch gelatinization, PS incorporation, polymer mixing, and blowing agent incorporation. In-line rheometry is used to monitor the viscosity of the TPS/PS blends and to evaluate the plasticizing effect of 1, 1, 1, 2 tetrafluoroethane (HFC- 134 a) used as blowing agent. Differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, density measurement, and <b>picnometry</b> are {{used to evaluate the}} thermal properties, the blend morphology, and the foam cell structure. Glycerol content in the TPS phase and the TPS content in the overall blend have a strong effect on the blend viscosity and, in turn, on the ability to foam the material. The foams blown with the hydrofluorocarbone alone have large open-cell content and their density cannot be reduced below 170 kg/m 3.

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} offers novel {{opportunities for}} repairing damaged or diseased {{tissues and organs}} by incorporating the patients ’ own healthy cells or donor cells into porous biocompatible materials used as tissue scaffolds. Along with other properties, porous structure of tissue scaffolds is essential to ensure normal cell functioning providing them with nutrients, oxygen and optimal growth conditions and removing waste products. Characterisation of the porous structure of hard implants such as ceramics and composites seems to be lesser of a problem compared to soft polymer hydrogels, for which even the definition of pores is difficult to formulate. With the biomaterials industry booming, standardisation of porous tissue scaffolds becomes a critical issue. In this work we present the results of evaluation of the porous structure of two polymers widely used as implants or scaffolds, an in-house made polycaprolactone (PCL) as a hard material and a commercial collagen hydrogel used for wound healing as a soft material. Advantages and limitations {{of a number of}} physical and physico-chemical techniques, such as mercury porosimetry, helium <b>picnometry,</b> electron microscopy, NMR with freezing out of water, image analysis, diffusion of macromolecules and low molecular markers and electrochemical methods are discussed.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of gamma-LiAlO 2 by coprecipitation and sol-gel synthesis was investigated. Ceramic powders obtained by coprecipitation synthesis were prepared from aqueous solutions of aluminum and lithium nitrates using sodium hydroxide as precipitant agent. By sol-gel synthesis, the ceramic powders were prepared from hydrolysis of aluminum isopropoxide. The materials obtained by two routes of synthesis were dried at 80 ºC and calcined at 550, 750, 950 and 1150 ºC. The characterization {{was done by}} X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, emission and absorption atomic spectrometry, helium <b>picnometry,</b> specific surface area (BET method) and scanning electronic microscopy. Mixtures of crystalline phases were obtained by coprecipitation synthesis: 80 ºC- LiAl 2 (OH) 7. 2 H 2 O + Al(OH) 3; 550 and 750 ºC- alpha-LiAlO 2 + eta-Al 2 O 3; 950 and 1150 ºC- gamma-LiAlO 2 + LiAl 5 O 8. Chemical analysis showed molar ration Al/Li @ 3. Crystalline single-phases were obtained by sol-gel synthesis above 550 ºC: 550 ºC-alpha-LiAlO 2; 750, 950 and 1150 ºC-gamma-LiAlO 2.

40|$|Abstract. Bioactive glass/polymer hybrids are {{promising}} materials for biomedical applications because they combine the bioactivity of these bioceramics with {{the flexibility of}} polymers. In previous work hybrid foams with 80 % bioactive glass and 20 % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were prepared by the sol-gel process for application as scaffold for bone tissue engineering. In this work it was evaluated the effect of increasing the PVA content of the hybrids on structural characteristics and mechanical properties of hybrid foams produced by this method. The hybrids were prepared with inorganic phase composition of 70 %SiO 2 - 30 %CaO and PVA fractions of 20 to 60 % by the sol-gel method. The structural and mechanical characterization of the obtained foams was done by FTIR, SEM, Helium <b>Picnometry,</b> and compression tests. To reduce the acidic character of the hybrids due to the catalysts added, different neutralization solutions were tested. The immersion of hybrids in a calcium acetate solution was the most adequate neutralization method, avoiding calcium loss while maintaining pH nearly 7, 0 and low PVA loss. The foams presented porosity of 60 - 85 % and pore diameters of 100 - 500 µm with interconnected structure. The pore structure varied with the polymer content in the hybrid. The compression tests showed that an increase of PVA fraction in the hybrids improved their mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{activity of}} a series of novel KSrNbO materials was studied using the photooxidation of methylene blue as model reaction. The influence of the calcination time upon the crystalline structure and photoactivity was verified. Characterization was performed by XRD, SEM, FTIR, UV–Vis/DR, Helium <b>picnometry,</b> and N and CO adsorption-desorption isotherms. The diffraction line profile and the refinement of the structural parameters of KSrNbO were obtained from the XRD patterns by the Rietveld method. Data showed that samples were photoactive under UV irradiation, regardless the synthesis conditions. However, the calcination time had a clear influence upon the photocatalytic activity of the samples, being more efficient towards the degradation of the dye those obtained at a lower calcination time. Indeed, the sample calcined for 4 h showed up to 4 times higher photocatalytic activity than commercial TiO. Additionally, a correlation between the photocatalytic activity and the displacement of the Nb ion from the central position in the [NbO] octahedron was found. It is suggested that this fact causes an important polarization of the niobate structure. The apical oxygen in these samples is very reactive and can lead to the formation of superoxoradical anions (O) showing that KSrNbO can be potentially used in photocatalytic reactions under UV irradiation.
