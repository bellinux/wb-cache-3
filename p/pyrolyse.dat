This work investigates thermal conversion of elephant grass to bio-gas, bio-oil and charcoal under two heating rates of 10 and 50 °C/min. The energy required to <b>pyrolyse</b> elephant grass was evaluated using computer aided thermal analysis technique, while composition of the resultant bio-gas and bio-oil products were monitored with gas chromatographic and mass spectroscopic techniques. At 500 °C, the bio-gas compounds consisted primarily of CO 2 and CO with small amounts of methane and higher hydrocarbon compounds. The heat of combustion of the bio-gas compounds {{was estimated to be}} 3. 7 - 7. 4 times higher than the heat required to <b>pyrolyse</b> elephant grass under both heating rates, which confirms that the pyrolysis process can be self-maintained. Faster heating rate was found {{to increase the amount of}} liquid products by 10 %, while charcoal yields remained almost the same at 30 %. The bio-oil mainly consisted of organic acids, phthalate esters, benzene compounds and amides. The amount of organic acids and benzene compounds were significantly reduced at 50 °C/min, while the yields of phthalate esters and naphthalene compounds increased. The difference in bio-oil composition with increased heating rate is believed to be associated with the reduction of the secondary reactions of pyrolysis, which are more pronounced under lower heating rate. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to characterise {{fundamental}} properties of the products of wastewater sludge pyrolysis and determine if the pyrolysis process of this material can be energy neutral. Wastewater sludge samples from different origin, including domestic, commercial and industrial sludges, were applied in the study. All samples were pyrolysed at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a fixed bed reactor. The major gas species of pyrolysis, CO, CO 2, CH 4, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6 and H 2, were monitored with gas chromatograph. Among the released species, hydrocarbons comprised half of the bio-gas fraction (50 %) which suggests high potential for energy recovery through their combustion. Thermal properties of sludge samples were investigated using computer aided thermal analysis technique. The {{results showed that the}} energy required to <b>pyrolyse</b> wastewater sludge samples from room temperature to the carbonisation temperature of 550 °C varies according to the source and origin of the wastewater sludge and ranges from 1180 kJ/kg for the domestic to 730 kJ/kg and 708 kJ/kg for the commercial and industrial sludges, respectively. This study confirmed that in case of the commercial and industrial sludge samples, the recoverable calorific value from stoichiometric combustion of the pyrolysed bio-gas is sufficient enough to self-maintain the pyrolysis process. In case of the sample from domestic origin, the recoverable energy from combustion of the bio-gas compounds was lower than the energy required to heat the sample to the temperature of carbonisation.

40|$|The {{changes in}} the {{structural}} characteristics of biomass residues during pyrolysis and composting were investigated. The biomass residues particles were prepared by <b>pyrolysing</b> at temperatures ranging from 350 to 400. For soilless production of the ornamental plant Anthurium andraeanum, pure sphagnum peat moss (P) has traditionally been used as the growing medium. This use of P must be reduced, however, because P is an expensive and nonrenewable resource. The current study investigated the use of biomass residues as substitutes for P in A. andraeanum production. Plants were grown for 15 months in 10 soilless media that contained different proportions of <b>pyrolysed</b> corn cobs (PC), composted corn cobs (C), <b>pyrolysed</b> garden wastes (PG), and P.

Diese C 5 -Spezies sind Zwischenprodukte beim Abbau von Aromaten und bei der Bildung von Rußpartikeln. Im Rahmen der Arbeit wurden Stoßwellenexperimente bei Temperaturen von 1100 K bis 1600 K und Drücken von 0. 7 bar bis 6 bar durchgeführt. Wasserstoff-, Iod- und Sauerstoffatome sowie Kohlenmonoxidmoleküle wurden mit der UV-Absorptionsspektroskopie detektiert. Die Reaktionen wurden in Gasmischungen, verdünnt mit Argon, durchgeführt und über einen Zeitraum von ca. 1 ms beobachtet. Mit Hilfe von Sensitivitätsanalysen konnten komplexe Reaktionsmechanismen auf wenige wichtige Reaktionspfade reduziert und Geschwindigkeitskoeffizienten der Elementarreaktionen bestimmt werden. Der Geschwindigkeitskoeffizient für den Zerfall von Cyclopentadien in ein Cyclopentadienyl-Radikal und ein Wasserstoffatom wurde bestimmt. Mittels der Fall-off-Analyse wurde der Hochdruckgeschwindigkeitskoeffizient für diese Reaktion berechnet und die Bildungsenthalpie des Cyclopentadienyl-Radikals abgeleitet. Aus der Reaktion von Cyclopentadien mit Wasserstoffatomen wurden die Geschwindigkeitskoeffizienten für zwei {{parallel}} verlaufende Reaktionskanäle ermittelt. Für die Untersuchung des Zerfalls des Cyclopentadienyl-Radikals sowie dessen Reaktion mit Wasserstoffatomen wurde Iodcyclopentadien als Radikalvorläufermolekül eingesetzt. Es wird erläutert, welche Rolle die Cyclopentadienylrekombination bei der Bildung von Naphthalin spielt. Die Oxidation von Cyclopentadien wurde mit molekularem Sauerstoff mit variierenden Sauerstoffanteilen untersucht.

This study describes {{investigations of}} the high temperature pyrolysis and oxidation of cyclopentadiene {{as well as the}} pyrolysis of the cyclopentadienyl radical. These C 5 -species are intermediates in the degradation of aromatics and in soot formation. Shock tube experiments at temperatures ranging from 1100 K up to 1600 K were performed at pressures between 0. 7 bar and 6 bar. UV-absorption-spectroscopy was applied for the detection of atoms of hydrogen, iodine and oxygen and of carbonmonoxide molecules. Reactions were studied in gas mixtures, diluted in Argon, and were observed for a time range of 1 ms. With the help of sensitivity anlayses complex reaction mechanisms could be reduced to the important reaction pathways and reaction rate coefficients for elementary reactions could be determined. The rate coefficient for the decomposition of cyclopentadiene into a cyclopentadienyl radical and a hydrogen atom was measured. By applying the Fall-off-analysis the high pressure rate coefficient was calculated for this reaction and the heat of formation of cyclopentadienyl radical deduced. From the reaction of cyclopentadiene with hydrogen atoms reaction rate coefficients for two parallel reaction channels were determined. Iodocyclopentadiene was used as the radical source for the investigation of the decomposition of the cyclopentadienyl radical and its reaction with hydrogen atoms. The role of the recombination reaction of cyclopentadienyl radicals in naphthalene formation is described.

A simple pyrolysis reactor system has been used to <b>pyrolyse</b> waste HDPE with the objective of optimizing the liquid product yield at a temperature range of 400 ºC to 550 ºC. Results of pyrolysis experiments showed that, at a temperature of 450 ºC and below, the major product of the pyrolysis was oily liquid which became a viscous liquid or waxy solid at temperatures above 475 ºC. The yield of the liquid fraction obtained increased with the residence time for waste HDPE. The liquid fractions obtained were analyzed for composition using FTIR and GC-MS. The physical properties of the pyrolytic oil show the presence of a mixture of different fuel fractions such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel in the oil...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the adsorption characteristics of lead (Pb) from aqueous solution by <b>pyrolysed</b> used bleaching clay. Used bleaching clay, a waste from an edible oil refinery has been treated by pyrolysis in a furnace. The used bleaching clay was <b>pyrolysed</b> at four temperatures which is 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C. The <b>pyrolysed</b> samples were characterized using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) to find the carbon content. The parameter involves in this experiment are contact time, pH of solution, initial concentration and carbonization temperature. The Langmuir sorption isotherm was plotted to describe the equilibrium adsorption and the maximum sorption capacities of the bleaching clay towards Pb. From the adsorption kinetics experiment, it was clearly observed that the concentration of Pb decrease as time increased until it reaches the equilibrium time while the uptake capacity increase as time and initial concentration increased. For the effect of pH of adsorption solution, the highest maximum sorption capacity was determined at pH 6 and the carbonization temperature that yields highest sorption capacity is 600 °C. This experiment was repeated for another adsorbent which is the untreated clay and the natural bleaching clay for comparison...|$|R
40|$|FeCl 3 {{is used as}} a dopant {{of organic}} {{semiconductors}} which have polyconjugated structures (e. g. polyacetylene, polyphenylene), {{as well as for the}} intercalation of graphite. Semiconducting polymers can be also synthesized by the pyrolytic conversion of organic polymers. The influence of FeCl 3 as a dopant for <b>pyrolysed</b> aromatic polymers at different pyrolysis temperatures up to 1000 degrees C on their electrical conductivity, sigma, has been investigated. In the materials poly-p-phenylene, o, m, p-polyphenylenes, novolac resin cured with hexamethylenetetramine, biomass of olive stones, lignin Kraft isolated from this biomass, three regions can be distinguished. The electrical conductivity is low up to 500 degrees C, between 500 and 700 degrees C it increases greatly, and above 700 degrees C it increases at a lower rate. For o, m, p-polyphenylenes, these regions (especially the first and the second) cannot be distinguished. Similar curves are generally obtained after doping of the <b>pyrolysed</b> materials. The ratio of the electrical conductivity of doped, sigma to undoped, sigma(0), <b>pyrolysed</b> materials increases mainly between 500 and 700 degrees C with the exception of o, m, p-polyphenylenes, where the electrical conductivity decreases at all of the pyrolysis temperatures. The electrical conductivity of the materials is more strongly influenced by heating than by doping. The results are interpreted based on the structure of the materials using X-ray diffractograms, weight losses during the pyrolysis, and taking into consideration the reactions occurring during pyrolysis. FeCl 3 is an effective dopant for organic semiconductors affected by charge transfer, but a less effective dopant for <b>pyrolysed</b> polymers and which do not lead to intercalation because of the low order and extension of the carbon layer formed in comparison to graphite...|$|R
40|$|A {{reaction}} of aluminium hydroxide, nickel nitrate and triethanolamine in ethylene glycol provided, in one step, {{a simple and}} effective nickel-aluminium complex precursor for NiAl 2 O 4 spinel. On the basis of 1 H-, 13 C-NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, the possible structure of the complex was proposed as a trimetallic double alkoxide consisting of two four-coordinate TEA-Al (alumatrane) moieties linked via a bridging TEA group enfolding the Ni 2 + cation. Transformation of the nickel-aluminium complex to pure spinel occurred when the complex precursor was <b>pyrolysed</b> at 1000 C for 5 h. The BET surface area of the <b>pyrolysed</b> product {{was found to be}} 31 m 2 /g. In addition, the morphology of the powder product was examined by SEM...|$|R
