40|$|Mobile {{cell phone}} users have {{reported}} experiencing ringing and/or vibrations associated with incoming calls and messages, {{only to find}} that no call or message had actually registered. We believe this phenomenon can be understood as a human signal detection issue, with potentially important influences from psychological attributes. We hypothesized that individuals higher in attachment anxiety would report more frequent <b>phantom</b> <b>cell</b> phone experiences, whereas individuals higher in attachment avoidance would report less frequent experiences. If these experiences are primarily psychologically related to attributes of interpersonal relationships, associations with attachment style should be stronger than for general sensation seeking. We also predicted that certain contexts would interact with attachment style to increase or decrease the likelihood of experiencing <b>phantom</b> <b>cell</b> phone calls and messages. Attachment anxiety directly predicted the frequency of phantom ringing and notification experiences, whereas attachment avoidance and sensation seeking did not directly predict frequency.

Meanwhile, energy efficiency (EE) has been considered a critical design criterion along with the traditional spectral efficiency (SE) metric. In this context, we study power and spectrum allocation for the recently proposed two-tier network architecture known as phantom cellular networks. The optimization framework includes both EE and SE.

For this setting, we propose an algorithm that finds the SE and EE resource allocation strategies. Then, we compare the performance of both design strategies versus number of users, and <b>phantom</b> <b>cells</b> share of the total available resource units (RUs). We aim to investigate the effect of some system parameters to achieve improved SE performance at a non-significant loss in EE performance, or vice versa.

Second, we consider the densely deployed phantom cellular networks and model the EE optimization problem having into consideration the inevitable interference and imperfect channel estimation.

40|$|A new carrier based dynamic channel {{assignment}} for FDMA/TDMA cellular systems, called borrowing with directional carrier locking strategy, is proposed in this paper. When a call {{arrives at a}} cell and finds all voice channels busy, a carrier which consists of multiple voice channels can be borrowed from its neighboring cells for carrying the new call if such borrowing will not violate the cochannel interference constraint. Two analytical models, cell group decoupling analysis and <b>phantom</b> <b>cell</b> analysis, are constructed for evaluating {{the performance of the}} proposed strategy. Using cell group decoupling (CGD) analysis, a cell is decoupled together with its neighbors {{from the rest of the}} network for finding its call blocking probability. Unlike conventional approaches, decoupling enables the analysis to be confined to a local/small problem size and thus efficient solution can be found. For a planar cellular system with three-cell channel reuse pattern, using CGD analysis involves solving of seven-dimensional Markov chains. It becomes less efficient as the number of carriers assigned to each cell increases. To tackle this, we adopt the <b>phantom</b> <b>cell</b> analysis which can simplify the seven-dimensional Markov chain to two three-dimensional Markov chains. Using <b>phantom</b> <b>cell</b> analysis for finding the call blocking probability of a cell, two phantom cells are used to represent its six neighbors. Based on extensive numerical results, we show that the proposed strategy is very efficient in sharing resources among base stations. For low to medium traffic loads and small number of voice channels per carrier, we show that both analytical models provide accurate prediction on the system call blocking probability. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

It is shown that, compared to un-coordinated scheduling, significant performance gains can be realized in ultra dense small cell deployment scenarios under the proposed C 2 -ICIC scheme. This is attributed to the robust interference protection provisioned by the scheme. It is demonstrated that the gains are particularly large for the users experiencing a weak received signal strength. Indeed, for these users, the received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can only be improved by reducing the experienced aggregate co-channel interference. The closed-form expression derived for the downlink success probability is employed to quantify the link level throughput under the proposed scheme.

We introduce a heuristic algorithm suitable for real network operation, that minimizes the energy consumption in the small cell network by selecting the small cell offering the best signal-to-interference-plus- noise ratio (SINR). We apply this heuristic to three energy savings schemes realizable in the PCC architecture. These schemes,based on the macro-assisted user equipment (UE)-small cell connection establishment paradigm, are a downlink (DL) signalling based scheme, an uplink (UL) signalling based scheme and a database-aided scheme. We derive a power consumption model for a representative PCC small cell, which allows to quantify the percentage of energy consumed by a small cell in sleep mode with respect to a fully operational small cell for the three energy savings schemes considered. Furthermore, we characterize the connection latency associated with each scheme and evaluate the impact on system performance. System-level simulations show that, even with the associated connection delays, the macro-assisted energy-saving schemes can yield energy savings of more than 45 % {{while at the same time}} introduce throughput gains of up to 25 %.|$|E

The role of mast cells in wound healing, inflammation, fibrosis and epidermal hyperproliferation has been extensively studied but less is known about their role in CVUs. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of mast in CVUs with specific consideration of the differences between the ulcer base and the skin surrounding the ulcer. Both histochemical and immunohistological methods were used to detect the mast cell marker tryptase in frozen sections of CVU biopsies. Mast cells were counted in the dermis of normal skin, in the ulcer base and in the skin surrounding the ulcer. Double immunofluorescence staining was used to study the location of mast cells in relation to blood vessels. In normal skin few mast cells were seen in the dermis but none in the epidermis. However in CVUs there was a significant increase in intact and degranulated mast cells in the surrounding skin and ulcer edge (184 per field, p< 0. 003) of CVUs and a significant reduction in the ulcer base (20. 5 per field p< 0. 05) in comparison to normal skin (61 per field). In CVUs mast cells showed a characteristic location near the epithelial basement membrane whilst mast <b>cell</b> granules and <b>phantom</b> <b>cells</b> (mast cells devoid of granules) were predominantly seen in the epidermis. In the dermis, mast cells were seen associated with blood vessels. The marked increase in mast cells in the surrounding skin of CVUs and depletion of mast cells in the ulcer base could implicate mast cell mediators in the pathological changes in CVUs particularly in the epidermal and vascular changes occurring in the surrounding skin...|$|R
40|$|Pilomatrixoma is {{a benign}} appendageal tumor derived from hair matrix cells {{which is also}} known as calcifying {{epithelioma}} of Malharbe. It usually appears as a solitary, asymptomatic, firm nodule. It is most common on the face and neck, but is occasionally found somewhere else on the body. It is mostly seen in children and young adults up to 20 years of age. The definite diagnosis is made histopathologically. A 19 -year-old female was referred to dermatology clinic with a two year history of painless subcutaneous nodule in front of her right ear. On examination with otorhinolaryngology deparment a firm subcutaneous nodule was seen and palpated over the right angulus mandibula. The computed tomography imaging study demonstrated 8. 5 x 12 mm subcutaneous mass lesion with calcification. Histopathological examination of the excised material showed the presence of basaloid <b>cells</b> associated with <b>phantom</b> <b>cells,</b> with areas of multinucleated giant cells, pigmented macrophages and widespread dystrophic calcification compatible with pilomatrixoma. In this case, we wished to present a patient who underwent excisional biopsy as a result of computed tomography imaging and whose pathological result was reported to be pilomatrixoma. Pilomatrixoma has long been supposed to be an infrequent tumor, but it may be more common than previously realized, so the clinicians must keep in mind the diagnosis of pilomatrixoma for subcutaneous nodules on the head and neck...|$|R
