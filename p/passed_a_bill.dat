5|$|Both Houses of Congress were majority-Republican, {{but their}} {{solutions}} differed. The House <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> in June 1890 requiring {{the government to}} purchase 4.5 million ounces of silver each month (in addition to the $2– $4 million required to be coined under Bland–Allison). The Senate <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> by Republican Preston B. Plumb of Kansas for free coinage of silver at the legal (16:1) ratio. Sherman voted against Plumb's bill, but {{was appointed to the}} conference committee to produce a compromise bill that, now called the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, passed that July. The Treasury would buy 4.5 million ounces of silver and would issue Treasury Notes to pay for it, which would be redeemable in gold or silver. The law also provided that the Treasury could coin more silver dollars if the Secretary believed it necessary to redeem the new notes. Sherman thought the bill was the least harmful option. Harrison believed it would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E

A similar bill in the House of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. Normally, the bill would become law after being signed by the President. However, it was vetoed by President Benigno Aquino III. The veto did not grant the waling-waling as the second national flower due to the confusion that it would create.|$|E

5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> by the end of the special session.|$|E

In 1789, Vice President John Adams cast the deciding vote in the Senate against {{a bill that would}} have mandated senatorial consent for the removal of Senate-confirmed federal and cabinet appointments. The bill had been sponsored by Pennsylvania Senator William Maclay.|$|E
5|$|During {{planning}} and construction, and {{for about half}} a year after opening, the road had no official name and {{was known as the}} Diagonal Highway, Newark–Jersey City Viaduct, or High-Level Viaduct.

Hejke of Jersey City naming the road the General Casimir Pulaski Memorial Skyway after Casimir Pulaski, the Polish military leader who helped train and lead Continental Army troops in the American Revolutionary War.

5|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

5|$|On January 13, 1855, the Oregon Territorial Legislature <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> {{moving the}} seat of {{government}} from Salem to Corvallis. Governor George Law Curry and many others objected to the move, since public buildings in Salem were already under construction. Curry sent the matter to the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington, D.C., where Secretary James Guthrie declared the move invalid unless acted on by the United States Congress. Thereafter, Curry and Oregon Secretary of State Benjamin Harding moved back to Salem.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 1873, {{the state}} {{legislature}} <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> re-enfranchising ex-Confederates, {{to the delight of}} much of the state population and the concern of the Minstrels. The legislature called a special election in November to replace 33 members, mostly Minstrels, who had left for patronage jobs in the Baxter government. Baxter refused to let the Minstrels manipulate the election, declaring that free, honest elections would be held during his term. With the help of the newly re-enfranchised voters, conservative Democrats swept the election and gained a small majority in the legislature. Baxter was about to erode his Republican base out from under him.|$|E

Dayanand Bandodkar, the leader of MGP and the first Chief Minister of Goa, proclaimed that by voting the MGP into power, the people of Goa had, in effect, voted in favour of merger with Maharashtra. According to them, <b>passing</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> in the state legislature was all that was needed. <b>Passing</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> in the assembly would be easy for the MGP as they had a simple majority.|$|R
5|$|On May22, a {{day after}} the typhoon struck the island, U.S. President Gerald Ford {{declared}} Guam a major disaster area. In September 1976, the United States Senate <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that included aid for the storm victims. Ultimately, the U.S. government provided $200million in aid and reconstruction funding in the two years following the typhoon's passage. This included about $80million to repair Guam's military facilities, which took several years to complete. Following the typhoon's passage and through the 1980s, the island's wooden homes underwent the process of being replaced by safer concrete homes.|$|E

Kitsap Transit, a public transit agency serving Kitsap County with bus service, decided to place a 0.3 percent sales tax increase and motor vehicle excise tax on the November 2003 ballot to fund a passenger-only ferry service to replace the state-run ferries. The ballot measure was rejected by 61 percent of voters, with support mostly coming from Bainbridge Island, downtown Bremerton, and Kingston.|$|E
5|$|The call to open {{a college}} in West Texas began shortly after {{settlers}} arrived {{in the area in}} the 1880s. In 1917, the Texas legislature <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> creating a branch of Texas A to be in Abilene. However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered Governor James E. Ferguson had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new legislation passed in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor Pat Neff vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas.

5|$|The {{conflict}} with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments {{to limit the}} president to a single six-year term and make {{the president and the}} Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill,</b> again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as much as he could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Through 1935, as {{the breakup}} {{legislation}} wound through Congress, and litigation through the courts, Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> for the breakup, Willkie {{made a series}} of speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and a storm of letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress to pass a bill requiring the breakup to take place within three years.|$|E
