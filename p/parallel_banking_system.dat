5000|$|The ICB Report {{rejected}} [...] "narrow banking" [...] in {{part because}} it would lead to more credit (and all credit during times of stress) being provided by a [...] "less regulated sector." [...] In 1993 Jane D'Arista and Tom Schlesinger noted that the [...] "parallel banking system" [...] had grown because it did not incur the regulatory costs of commercial banks. They proposed to equalize the cost by establishing [...] "uniform regulation" [...] of banks and the lenders and investors in the <b>parallel</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> As with Kotlikoff’s [...] "limited purpose banking" [...] proposal, only investment pools funded 100% from equity interests would remain unregulated as banks. Although D’Arista and Schlesinger acknowledged the regulation of banks and of the <b>parallel</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> would end up only being [...] "comparable," [...] their goal was to eliminate so far as possible the competitive advantages of the [...] "parallel" [...] or [...] "shadow" [...] banking market.|$|E

40|$|In {{reforming}} {{the financial sector}} in transition economies, one important debate is whether governments should try to reform existing state-owned banks (the rehabilitation approach) or whether a new private <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> {{should be allowed to}} emerge (a new entry approach). Or should there be a mix of the two approaches, in which the state bank activities are restricted while a <b>parallel</b> private <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> develops? The authors'cross-country comparison of banks'institutional development in 25 transitional economies suggests that progress can be faster under the new entry approach, especiallyrelative to initial conditions. Progress under the rehabilitation approach appears to be inhibited by poor incentives. In most countries, even those with a good banking infrastructure and a large segment of good banks, a two track process has evolved, with differences between weak and strong banks. Weak banks have moved little beyond central planning. Regression estimates suggest that slow progress of weak banks is associated with: cover concentration, government preferential treatment, and limited new banks entry. The causality direction is often unclear. Policies and structural conditions can affect bank quality. The role of banks will remain limited in many transition economies due to weak legal infrastructures, much uncertainty and inside information, and problems associated with highly leveraged financial intermediaries - including fraud, political interference, and implicit guarantees. In the short run, self-finance and intermediation among enterprises and through nonbank financial institutions may prevail.

40|$|An {{important}} {{debate about}} financial reform in transition economies {{is whether or}} not governments should try to rehabilitate existing state-owned banks or allow a new or <b>parallel</b> <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> to emerge. A comparison of institutional development of banks in twenty-five transition countries suggests that more rapid progress can be made with the entry of new banks as opposed to rehabilitation, especially relative to initial conditions. In most countries, however, a cadre of weak banks still exists. Regression estimates suggest that the progress of these weak banks is inhibited by poor troubled-bank intervention, preferential treatment and limited entry.

The structure of the Nigerian <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> is reflected in its historical pattern of growth, ownership, the network branch expansion, assets and liabilities composition and the legal and regulatory framework. The economic performance is reflected in output, profitability and the efficiency with which the banks have met some requirements indeispensable for economic development such as the contribution to saving-investment process and the provision of adequate finance to various sectors of the economy. A <b>banking</b> <b>system,</b> as a service industry, suffers from output measurement problem.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the <b>bank</b> <b>system’s</b> functioning determines the dynamics and stability of the whole economy. Through the diversity {{and complexity of the}} modern <b>bank</b> <b>system’s</b> functions inevitably raises the question how to assess the performance of the <b>banking</b> <b>system,</b> to determine its development potential. For the analysis of the internal potential of the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> it is advisable to use the following categories of objects: central bank, commercial credit resident organizations, governmental and nonprofit resident organizations, resident legal entities, individual persons, non-resident agents. Each element of the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> has its own properties, which can be described by the parameters associated with the main areas of their activities. According to the selected objects within the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> the indicators of its functioning results can be defined. However, the value of these parameters behaves over time in different ways – some increase, others decrease, some reflect a positive trend, and the others reflect a negative trend of the <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, {{there is a need to}} define an integrated assessment, which will comprehensively determine the results of the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> functioning. It is advisable to use an approach based on the adaptation of the potential theory and the scale to determine the integral evaluation of the effectiveness by a range of indicators. Since the potential of the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> isn’t just an indicator that characterizes its status as a category that simultaneously captures the content of the methodological foundations of a set of real processes and phenomena occurring in <b>banking</b> <b>system,</b> it is advisable to use the mathematical tools of the potential functions, specifically volume potential, to calculate potential of the <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> This makes it possible to adequately display not only a particular situation, certain relationships, but also the processes, development trends and, thus, to assess the {{efficiency of}} the whole <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> Using this approach, we can trace the development of <b>banking</b> <b>system,</b> where it’s necessary to use the indicators that reflect the resource capabilities and the results of operations of <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> as the integral indicator for evaluation the level of development of its potential.

Albanian being one of the poorest countries in Europe and a country with a developing economy became a topic of interest since the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> is a major influence in a country’s economy. Analyzing {{the evolution of the}} Albanian <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> will not only provide a historic view on Albania and its <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> but will also provide the necessary knowledge and historical background to be able to conclude why is the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> in Albania shaped this way and why is the economy behaving in such a way. This study in itself will examine the evolution of the Albanian <b>Banking</b> <b>System</b> and the path it followed based on the historical background of Albania. It will lay out the historical facts that shaped the way the Albanian <b>Banking</b> <b>System</b> has changed through time. The study is organized in six different stages. This organization is done with the purpose to recognize the different paths that the Albanian <b>Banking</b> <b>System</b> followed in certain periods of time and to distinguish one from another based on historical and economical factors. During the analysis of the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> importance was given to the ownership of the banks, the type of business these banks engaged and the role they played in the economy. A great emphasis was put on the Albanian central bank and its evolution since it was the most important player in the Albanian <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> for a significant amount of time. The central banks monetary policies throughout the years and its role in the economy are discussed and analyzed. The evolution of the Albanian <b>Banking</b> <b>System</b> is important to study because it does not only provide a historical view of the banks in Albania it also provides the necessary historical background that shaped the image of the Albania <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> Also when this analysis is put in the context of today’s <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> in Albania and its economy it becomes easier for an outsider to really understand why Albania is a developing country, and what the economic situation really is in Albania. Albania being a developing country brings up the idea that it is a good place of investment. Foreign investors who in the future might want to invest in Albania will need to have an understanding of its economy and <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore a further research might analyze only the present status of the Albanian <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> and the economic stability in Albania. Having a clear understanding of the historical facts about the Albanian <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> one can see that the Albanian market has always been open to foreign investors and even though {{there were a lot of}} set backs, Albania is once again open to foreign investment. Therefore a more extensive research on the future of the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> in Albania and its growth might be the next step to analyzing the potential investment opportunities in Albania. And a healthy economic and banking outlook might be the first step to attracting foreign investors in Albania. Once again, this thesis only analyzes the evolution of the Albanian <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> However the knowledge gathered can help understand better the <b>banking</b> <b>system</b> in Albania and maybe conduct a further analysis of Albania’s economy...|$|R
