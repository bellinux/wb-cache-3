40|$|PREMISE: The <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> <b>development</b> of {{suburban}} communities can accomplish three primary housing goals: first, {{the reduction of}} the per unit cost of housing; second, the inclusion of more public open space and; third, the provision of a more rational land use pattern of growth. PRESENTATION: Part one introduces the thesis and describes the present suburban housing problem in perspective. It discusses one particular aspect of the suburban housing problem [...] "the rising cost of land. " Finally, Part one proposes the <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> <b>development</b> as a possible alternative to the rising cost of land and states the criteria for this proposition. Part two proves the proposition by comparing the advantages of the <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> <b>development</b> over the conventional subdivision's uniform zoning to three divergent groups: the developer, the town, and the buyer. Part three concludes the thesis by analyzing the record of the <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> <b>development</b> for solving the suburban housing problem and points up some of the implications which the <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> <b>development</b> has upon suburban form...|$|R

The Community Associations Institute trade association estimated that in 2010, HOAs governed 24.8 million American homes and 62 million residents.|$|E
50|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> <b>developments</b> {{has resulted in}} a cost savings to local governments in two ways. One, by requiring developers to build 'public improvements' such as parks, passing the cost of maintenance of the improvements to the common-interest owners; and two, by planned-unit developments being responsible for the cost of maintaining infrastructures that would normally be maintained by the municipality.|$|E

50|$|Most {{homeowners are}} subject to {{property}} taxation, whether or not said property {{is located in a}} planned unit development governed by a homeowners association. Such taxes are used by local municipalities to maintain roads, street lighting, parks, etc. In addition to municipal property taxes, individuals who own private property located within <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> <b>developments</b> {{are subject to}} association assessments that are used by the development to maintain the private roads, street lighting, landscaping, security, and amenities located within the planned unit development. A non-HOA property owner pays taxes to fund street repairs performed by the city; the HOA property owners pay these same taxes, but without the same benefit, since the local government will not maintain the streets to their homes. Thus the HOA property needs to pay a second time, to privately maintain the street.|$|E
5000|$|Affordable {{housing for}} faculty was a {{priority}} in order to recruit and retain faculty. In December 1986, 65 two- and three-bedroom faculty housing units at West Campus Point were completed. For this and subsequent <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> <b>developments,</b> the university selects qualified buyers who are offered a unit at a price the university determines. The buyer must sell the unit back to the university at a price it sets and it is then offered for sale to another university-determined qualified buyer. [...] The university planned to build more faculty housing at its North Campus. Originally planned in 2004 to be 236 units of faculty and 151 units of family student housing, the California Coastal Commission required modifications {{reducing the number of}} faculty housing to 172 units. A 70-acre parcel of the North Campus land was to be placed in a conservation easement with public access.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, {{the people}} of Cary became {{concerned}} with how its rapid growth was impacting its small-town character. From a city planning perspective, their solution was to utilize <b>Planned</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Developments</b> (PUD). The first PUD was {{the conversion of the}} Kildare Dairy Farm in 1971, which had been suffering economically. The 967-acre project was estimated to accommodate approximately 2,950 families. The PUD model became so popular in Cary that 22 more were created between 1980 and 1992. Another method to preserve the small town feel of Cary was the formation of the Community Appearance Commission in 1972, which focused on regulating the look of downtown through sign ordinances. Additionally, through the Land Dedication Ordinance of 1974, more green space was protected by requiring developers to set aside one acre of green space for every 35 housing units constructed. During the 1980s, Cary created Industrial Performance Districts, which increased the town's tax base by encouraging businesses to build within the town's limits.|$|E

5000|$|Baltimore, Marylandâ€™s port came {{in danger}} of {{withering}} into obscurity due to practically unrestrained development of the waterfront by commercial and residential developers. The development of Harbor Place on the Downtown Baltimore waterfront in 1980 near the then vacant Inner Harbor steamship docks was the harbinger of commercial and residential waterfront development on industrial lands in Baltimore. The 1990s and 2000s lead to rapid development and reuse of industrial buildings, including Tide Point, the reuse of a soap manufacturer into offices and Silo Point, which converted an unused grain silo into a high rise condominium development These projects were important {{in the development of}} the Marine Industrial Overlay District (MIZOD) in 2004 to limit the use of land in the district to uses served by the deep water ports. This included forbidding <b>Planned</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Developments</b> (PUD), the reuse of industrial properties to mixed use developments and disallowed office and hotel uses from conditional use in the zoning laws.

5000|$|Strata management, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} [...] "body corporate management", is a specialist area of property management involving the day-to-day {{operation and management}} of a property that is jointly owned and comprises multiple units, common areas and common facilities. It is derived from an Australian concept of property law called strata title applied to the administration of common ownership in apartment buildings on multiple levels, or strata. Emerging markets in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, the Philippines and India have adopted the Australian system. It {{is one of the}} fastest growing forms of housing in the United States today, similar to common-interest development (CID), a category that includes <b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> <b>developments</b> of single-family homes, known as homeowner associations (HOAs), condominiums, and cooperative apartments. Federally-subsidized financing provided by two government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac via uniform financial instrumentsâ€”mortgages that oblige the borrower to honor covenant restrictions of the collective-property regime with PUD or condo riders. Such provisions however are only enforceable where statutes recognize their validity. Common expense liabilities are often subordinated as junior liens in bankruptcy courts, with the bank retaining senior title.|$|E
50|$|Floating-zone codes. Floating {{zones are}} most often written to {{facilitate}} master-planned suburban communities and are called PUDs (<b>planned</b> <b>unit</b> <b>developments).</b> However, floating-zone codes are now being written as form-based codes to facilitate urban development. A floating-zone form-based code does not contain a regulating plan but includes instructions and standards for developers to follow when they prepare a regulating plan for their property (e.g. maximum block dimensions, street types, building types, open space accessibility, sidewalk widths.) This distinguishes floating-zone codes from the other two approaches-developers rather than the local government create the regulating plans and the urban designs that they facilitate, but the local government sets the standards. Floating-zone codes allow local governments to establish urban form standards for development without incurring the expense of developing urban design and regulating plans. Developers are given the freedom, within clear parameters, to prepare regulating plans for their property {{that are likely to}} meet government approval. A developer submits his or her regulating plan for approval through the rezoning process. Upon rezoning, the floating zone replaces the prior zoning for that property and the regulating plan becomes binding.|$|E

This paper considers some of the spatial, socioeconomic, and planning implications created by private roads in the Canadian context. While private streets provide a useful tool for achieving design and density objectives, and for transferring the burden of development costs to those who benefit from growth, they exacerbate social segregation and spatial fragmentation of the urban landscape. ...|$|E

40|$|Euclidean {{land use}} {{regulations}} that segregate {{different kinds of}} uses from one another can present significant barriers to achieving the land use-related principles of New Urbanism on a foundational level. This research evaluated the zoning ordinance {{of the city of}} Lincoln, Nebraska, with a special focus on the Community Unit Plan and Planned Unit Development processes, in order to determine its openness to mixed housing and mixed uses, using a combination of policy analysis and Geographic Information System (GIS). It was found that a number of Lincolnâ€™s zoning districts as well as a significant amount of land are restricted in creating mixed uses and/or housing within the zones. The Community Unit Plans and <b>Planned</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Developments</b> have produced some developments with a mix of land uses, but because the regulations for the processes are extremely flexible, they have not consistently produced high levels of land use diversity. Based on the specific zoning barriers to land use mix that were identified, a phased set of changes were recommended that were thought to be particularly suitable for Lincoln.
