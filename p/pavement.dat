5|$|After the war, {{construction}} and reconstruction work resumed on the A3 motorway. The battle damage {{was the first}} to be addressed, along with removal of the trenches excavated in the flyover embankments. Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway had to be removed by minesweepers. The motorway <b>pavement</b> was seriously deteriorated, as evidenced by extensive ruts and cracks incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs made to the viaducts and flyovers, mine clearance and <b>pavement</b> reconstruction took considerably more time to perform.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{a symbol}} of the Punic-Phoenician goddess Tanit, all <b>pavement</b> motifs are {{typically}} Hellenistic Greek in origin, although some <b>pavement</b> mortars used with tesserae designs betray some Italian influence. Although the three major ethnic groups of Delos included Greeks (largely of Athenian origin), Syrians/Phoenicians, and Italians/Romans, it is very likely that many of these Italians were Italiotes, Greek-speaking natives of Magna Graecia in what is now southern Italy. Delian inhabitants of either Greek, Italian, and Syrian origins owned mosaics in their private households, but Vincent J. Bruno asserts that the designs of their mosaic artworks were indebted entirely to Greek artistic traditions.|$|E

50|$|Rigid <b>pavements</b> are {{generally}} used in constructing airports and major highways, {{such as those}} in the interstate highway system. In addition, they commonly serve as heavy-duty industrial floor slabs, port and harbor yard <b>pavements,</b> and heavy-vehicle park or terminal <b>pavements.</b> Like flexible <b>pavements,</b> rigid highway <b>pavements</b> are designed as all-weather, long-lasting structures to serve modern day high-speed traffic. Offering high quality riding surfaces for safe vehicular travel, they function as structural layers to distribute vehicular wheel loads in such a manner that the induced stresses transmitted to the subgrade soil are of acceptable magnitudes.|$|R

40|$|The heat island {{phenomenon}} {{becomes one}} of the environmental problems. As countermeasures {{in the field of}} road engineering, cool <b>pavements</b> such as water retaining <b>pavements</b> and solar radiation reflective <b>pavements</b> have been developed to reduce the surface temperature of asphalt <b>pavements</b> in the hot summer climate in Japan. The authors have studied on the water retaining <b>pavements</b> with cement–based grouting materials. The cement–based grouting materials consist of cement, ceramic waste powder, and natural zeolite. The ceramic waste powder is collected through the recycling process of electric porcelain insulators. In this study, mixing ratio between the ceramic waste powder and the natural zeolite and a type of cement for the cement–based grouting materials is investigated to measure the surface temperature of asphalt <b>pavements</b> in the outdoor. All of the developed cement–based grouting materials were confirmed to effectively reduce the surface temperature of the asphalt <b>pavements.</b> Especially, the cement–based grouting material using the ultra–rapid hardening cement with the mixing ratio of 0. 7 : 0. 3 between the ceramic waste powder and the natural zeolite reduced mostly the surface temperature by 20 °C and more...|$|R

5|$|Labels such as Matador Records, Merge Records, and Dischord, and indie rockers like <b>Pavement,</b> Superchunk, Fugazi, and Sleater-Kinney {{dominated}} the American indie scene {{for most of}} the 1990s.

By 1992, <b>Pavement,</b> Guided by Voices and Sebadoh became popular lo-fi cult acts in the United States, while subsequently artists like Beck and Liz Phair brought the aesthetic to mainstream audiences.

40|$|Ruttings are {{the most}} {{essential}} damge of asphalt <b>pavements</b> at the time. Up to now the only measure to avoid ruttings is to use asphalt material with high resistance against permanent deformations. A first try to calculate the danger potential of several <b>pavements</b> referring ruttings in consideration of the stress-strain behaviour is the content of this presentation. First results demonstrate that especially <b>pavements</b> with thick asphalt layers and <b>pavements</b> with base courses with high stiffness have a high danger potential referring ruttings. But a background to judge the calculated strains is not known. So for these <b>pavements</b> we are only able to point at asphalt material with high resistance against permanent deformations again. But the presented reflections demonstrate the necessity of further investigations. (orig.)
