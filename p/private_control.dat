The U. S.

40|$|<b>Private</b> {{inference}} <b>control</b> enables simultaneous {{enforcement of}} inference control {{and protection of}} users’ query privacy. <b>Private</b> inference <b>control</b> is {{a useful tool for}} database applications, especially when users are increasingly concerned about individual privacy nowadays. However, protection of query privacy on top of inference control is a double-edged sword: without letting the database server know the content of user queries, users can easily launch DoS attacks. To assuage DoS attacks in <b>private</b> inference <b>control,</b> we propose the concept of self-enforcing <b>private</b> inference <b>control,</b> whose intuition is to force users to only make inference-free queries by enforcing inference control themselves; otherwise, penalty will inflict upon the violating users. Towards instantiating the concept, we formalize a model on self- enforcing <b>private</b> inference <b>control,</b> and propose a concrete provably secure scheme, based on Woodruff and Staddon’s work. In our construction, “penalty” is instantiated to be a deprivation of users’ access privilege: so long as a user makes an inference-enabling query, his access privilege is forfeited and he is rejected to query the database any further. We also discuss several important issues that complement and enhance the basic scheme...|$|R

25|$|The {{investment}} {{strategies of}} private equity firms differ {{to those of}} hedge funds. Typically, private equity investment groups are geared towards long-hold, multiple-year investment strategies in illiquid assets (whole companies, large-scale real estate projects, or other tangibles not easily converted to cash) where they have more control and influence over operations or asset management to influence their long-term returns. Hedge funds usually focus on short or medium term liquid securities which are more quickly convertible to cash, {{and they do not}} have direct control over the business or asset in which they are investing. Both private equity firms and hedge funds often specialize in specific types of investments and transactions. Private equity specialization is usually in specific industry sector asset management while hedge fund specialization is in industry sector risk capital management. Private equity strategies can include wholesale purchase of a privately held company or set of assets, mezzanine financing for start-up projects, growth capital investments in existing businesses or leveraged buyout of a publicly held asset converting it to <b>private</b> <b>control.</b> Finally, private equity firms only take long positions, for short selling is not possible in this asset class.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader in}} the fight to end <b>private</b> <b>control</b> of the water supply was Fred Eaton. Eaton {{proposed}} that tax revenues would enable the city of Los Angeles to provide water to its residents without charging them {{for the use of}} water directly. Eaton’s views were especially powerful because of his distinguished record of achievement in both the private and public sector. During Eaton’s nine-year term as the superintending engineer of the Los Angeles City Water Company, he headed a large expansion of the company’s water system. Eaton left his position in 1886 when he was elected City Engineer. In his new public position, Eaton devoted his time to updating and expanding the sewer system. Eaton felt that the Los Angeles City Water Company was not serving the citizens of Los Angeles well because of high rates, and because the company frequently paid dividends to its stockholders instead of improving the water system. In early 1897, city engineers began creating plans for an updated water system while the city council informed the Los Angeles City Water Company that its lease would not be renewed beyond its expiration date, July 21, 1898. In early 1898, the city began talks with the Los Angeles City Water Company about taking over the company’s current water system.|$|E

We estimate PBC using the voting premium between shares with differential voting rights. We use two measures of the intensity of product market competition: an external competition measure based on industry-level import penetration, and an internal measure derived from domestic product market regulations. Using data for publicly-traded firms in 19 countries for which information on dual class shares is available we find that PMC is strongly negatively correlated with PBC. The evidence indicates that the effect is particularly strong for firms in industries {{that are likely to}} be concentrated and in countries with poor legal environments. We further examine the channels through which PMC enhances governance. We find evidence indicating that improvements in the availability of industry information and the higher default probability associated with tougher competition are two important forces in reducing the estimated price gap between dual class shares. Using exchange rates and terms of trade as instruments for import penetration, we find that the link between competition in product markets and <b>private</b> benefits of <b>control</b> is not spurious.
