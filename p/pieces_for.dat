5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous <b>pieces</b> <b>for</b> the instrument., and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.|$|E

The title changed for {{the first part of the}} US tour to Eclipse (A <b>Piece</b> <b>for</b> Assorted Lunatics) during April and May before reverting to Dark Side of the Moon - A <b>Piece</b> <b>for</b> Assorted Lunatics in September for the second part of the US tour and finally released in 1973 under the title of Dark Side of the Moon.|$|R

5|$|BBC News {{reported}} {{that some of}} the costumes for the tour were designed by Sunderland University fashion graduate Dayne Henderson. He had been chosen by one of Gaga's stylists after seeing his tweet to the singer with a photo of his design which included clothing inspired by fetish fashion.

5|$|Bakshi {{received}} a pay raise, {{but was not}} as satisfied with his career advancement as he had anticipated; Rasinski had died in 1965, Bakshi did not have creative control over The Mighty Heroes, and he was unhappy {{with the quality of}} the animation, writing, timing and voice acting. Although the series' first 20 segments were successful, Bakshi wanted to leave Terrytoons to form his own company. In 1967, he drew up presentation <b>pieces</b> <b>for</b> a fantasy series called Tee-Witt, with help from Anzilotti, Johnnie Zago and Bill Foucht.|$|E
5|$|Born in Cologne, {{the son of}} {{a synagogue}} cantor, Offenbach showed early musical talent. At the age of 14, he was {{accepted}} as a student at the Paris Conservatoire but found academic study unfulfilling and left after a year. From 1835 to 1855 he earned his living as a cellist, achieving international fame, and as a conductor. His ambition, however, was to compose comic <b>pieces</b> <b>for</b> the musical theatre. Finding the management of Paris' Opéra-Comique company uninterested in staging his works, in 1855 he leased a small theatre in the Champs-Élysées. There he presented a series of his own small-scale pieces, many of which became popular.|$|E

To provide for his family, he also composed music that he termed functional, such as the Warsaw Suite (written to accompany a silent film depicting the city's reconstruction), sets of Polish Carols, and the study <b>pieces</b> <b>for</b> piano, Melodie Ludowe ("Folk Melodies").|$|E
5|$|From the 12th century on, the {{crossbow}} (called , tzangra in Greek) {{became increasingly}} important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon available until {{the advent of}} fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery. The Byzantines made infrequent use of the weapon, chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles. Cannons were introduced {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only had a few artillery <b>pieces</b> <b>for</b> the defence of the land walls of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there is no indication that the Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.|$|E
5|$|Gunpowder weapons {{had begun}} to be {{introduced}} into England in the early 14th century, initially being used as offensive siege weapons but rapidly being adapted for defensive purposes during the 1360s. Although they were expensive, by the 1380s their potential value in defending castles and city walls was well understood and specialised facilities {{had begun to}} be built. Norwich had acquired gunpowder weapons {{and a team of}} gunners by 1355, and by 1385 had fifty gunpowder <b>pieces</b> <b>for</b> use along its city walls. Typically, these would have been small guns called hand cannons, rather than the heavier pieces termed bombards.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{proposed}} that the U.S. dollar should have fractional coins using decimals, rather than eighths like the Spanish coinage. This innovation was originally suggested by Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris, with whom Hamilton corresponded after examining one of Morris's Nova Constellatio coins in 1783. He also desired the minting of small value coins, such as silver ten-cent and copper cent and half-cent <b>pieces,</b> <b>for</b> reducing {{the cost of living}} for the poor. One of his main objectives was for the general public to become accustomed to handling money on a frequent basis.|$|E
5|$|He {{took this}} {{development}} {{to a new}} level with his 1953 orchestral work Réveil des oiseaux—its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the Jura. From this period onwards, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into all of his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter (for example the collection of thirteen <b>pieces</b> <b>for</b> piano Catalogue d'oiseaux completed in 1958, and La fauvette des jardins of 1971). Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.|$|E

In 1952, Vonnegut's first novel, Player Piano, was published by Scribner's. The novel has a post-Third World War setting, in which factory workers {{have been replaced by}} machines.|$|E
