5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube,</b> every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E
5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
25|$|The <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> is an {{extremely}} sensitive detector of light, which uses the photoelectric effect and secondary emission, rather than thermionic emission, to generate and amplify electrical signals. Nuclear medicine imaging equipment and liquid scintillation counters use <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> arrays to detect low-intensity scintillation due to ionizing radiation.|$|E

25|$|Currently {{available}} scanners typically use {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) or {{contact image sensor}} (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> as the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} {{of the interaction between}} the gamma ray and the crystal can be determined by processing the voltage signals from the photomultipliers; in simple terms, the location can be found by weighting the position of each <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> by the strength of its signal, and then calculating a mean position from the weighted positions. The total sum of the voltages from each photomultiplier, measured by a pulse height analyzer is proportional to the energy of the gamma ray interaction, thus allowing discrimination between different isotopes or between scattered and direct photons.|$|E

2500|$|Convinced {{that the}} system was {{workable}} with further development, Woodland left Drexel, moved into his father's apartment in Florida, and continued working on the system. His next inspiration came from Morse code, and he formed his first barcode from sand on the beach. [...] "I just extended the dots and dashes downwards and made narrow lines and wide lines out of them." [...] To read them, he adapted technology from optical soundtracks in movies, using a 500-watt incandescent light bulb shining through the paper onto an RCA935 <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> (from a movie projector) on the far side. He later decided {{that the system}} would work better if it were printed as a circle instead of a line, allowing it to be scanned in any direction.|$|E
2500|$|The typical FCS setup {{consists}} of a laser line (wavelengths ranging typically from 405–633nm (cw), and from 690–1100nm (pulsed)), which is reflected into a microscope objective by a dichroic mirror. The laser beam is focused in the sample, which contains fluorescent particles (molecules) in such high dilution, {{that only a few}} are within the focal spot (usually 1–100 molecules in one fL). When the particles cross the focal volume, they fluoresce. This light is collected by the same objective and, because it is red-shifted with respect to the excitation light it passes the dichroic mirror reaching a detector, typically a <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube,</b> an avalanche photodiode detector or a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector. [...] The resulting electronic signal can be stored either directly as an intensity versus time trace to be analyzed at a later point, or computed to generate the autocorrelation directly (which requires special acquisition cards). The FCS curve by itself only represents a time-spectrum. Conclusions on physical phenomena have to be extracted from there with appropriate models. The parameters of interest are found after fitting the autocorrelation curve to modeled functional forms.|$|E
2500|$|The goal of WALTA {{is to set}} up {{detectors}} {{at least}} 32 sites in the Seattle area, covering an area of 200 square kilometers. [...] This area would be large enough to detect events above the GZK cutoff. [...] The program hopes to fill in gaps in this area as the project matures. [...] Each location has four scintillation detectors which emit light when hit by charged particles. [...] Each paddle detectors is about an inch thick and covers approximately one square meter. [...] Each site would ideally put the detectors in a star formation with one detector in the middle and three surrounding it on a circle of 10m2 radius. [...] With this geometry, each site could detect 1015eV events. [...] Each site will attempt this layout as best possible given the site's own geography. [...] Each detector has a <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tube</b> which multiplies the emitted light into a large electrical signal. [...] The signal from each detector paddle goes into a data acquisition card (DAQ) which is set to record an event based on a certain coincidence. [...] The DAQ card also has a GPS input. [...] The output of this card connects to a computer using a serial port and software counts the data with a GPS location and time stamp. [...] A site can upload the data to the WALTA server and data can be compared to see if events happen from the same shower. [...] The timing of events and the area covered tells the energy and location where the cosmic ray hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

2500|$|Since then, various {{detection}} {{methods have been}} used. Super Kamiokande is a large volume of water surrounded by <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes</b> that watch for the Cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an electron or muon in the water. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is similar, but uses heavy water as the detecting medium, which uses the same effects, but also allows the additional reaction any-flavor neutrino photo-dissociation of deuterium, resulting in a free neutron which is then detected from gamma radiation after chlorine-capture. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically checked for excesses of argon or germanium, respectively, which are created by electron-neutrinos interacting with the original substance. MINOS used a solid plastic scintillator coupled to <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes,</b> while Borexino uses a liquid pseudocumene scintillator also watched by <b>photomultiplier</b> <b>tubes</b> and the NOνA detector uses liquid scintillator watched by avalanche photodiodes.
