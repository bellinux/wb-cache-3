Much of this data is encoded in text, which is noisy, unstructured, and sparse; yet recent developments in natural language processing now permit us to analyze text and connect it to real-world measurable phenomena through statistical models. We propose text-driven forecasting as a challenge for natural language processing and machine learning: Given a body of text T pertinent to a social phenomenon, make a concrete prediction about a measurement M of that phenomenon, obtainable only in the future, that rivals the best-known methods for forecasting M. We seek methods that work in many settings, for many kinds of text and many kinds of measurements. Accurate text-driven forecasting will be of use to the intelligence community, policymakers, and businesses. The use of statistical models is the norm of natural language processing methods, making it straightforward to develop models that provide posterior probabilities over measurements. Evaluation and comparison of forecasting algorithms is straightforward and inexpensive. We present encouraging recent results across several domains, emphasizing that a broad suite of forecasting problems and text sources will best support progress on this task. Further, advances in text-driven forecasting will have broad impact in natural language processing, giving a concrete, theory-independent platform that encourages exploration of new ideas for tackling various aspects of text-oriented computational intelligence.

40|$|The Supreme Court was {{unanimously}} {{wrong in}} Rumsfeld v. FAIR. Though rare, it 2 ̆ 7 s {{not the first}} time the Court has been unanimously wrong. Its most notorious such decisions have come, like FAIR, in cases where the Court conspicuously failed even to appreciate the importance of the constitutional freedoms under attack from legislative majorities. In these cases, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s very rhetoric exposed its myopic vision in ways that now seem embarrassing. Does FAIR, so obviously correct to so many <b>people</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> await the same ignominy decades away? FAIR was wrong in tone, a dismissive vox populi, adopted by a Court reflecting and reinforcing popular reactions to the case. But most importantly FAIR was wrong in rationale, which is worse than getting a single result wrong. Not very much of practical significance for the whole country ordinarily hinges on the result in a single case settling the claim of a single litigant or group of litigants. Whether law schools may exclude military recruiters who, following federal 2 ̆ 2 Don 2 ̆ 7 t Ask, Don 2 ̆ 7 t Tell 2 ̆ 2 (DADT) policy, discriminate against gay law students, doesn 2 ̆ 7 t matter that much to most people. But the rationale justifying the result in a single case can have significant consequences because it can affect decisions in the future. In FAIR, the Supreme Court botched several doctrines in its ordinarily libertarian free-speech jurisprudence, including the foundational question of what counts as protected speech, and it botched them all in a way that could constrict liberty. Whether FAIR has harmful long-term effects for speech awaits future decisions, but Chief Justice John Roberts 2 ̆ 7 first major constitutional decision gives us some reason to worry. The fact of unanimity - it was 8 - 0 and likely would have been 9 - 0 if Justice Samuel Alito had participated - does not make the decision less wrong. If it is indeed wrong, unanimity only makes its wrongness more egregious, putting in very stark relief the failure of even a single justice on the current Court to overcome the passions of the moment in order to safeguard constitutional freedoms. Instead of defending liberty, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s conservatives apparently saw a chance to defend military honor against law-school elites. Its liberals apparently saw a chance to defend government power while proving they can be cold-eyed realists on matters of national security. In Part I, I briefly describe some relevant background about the Solomon Amendment and the litigation challenging it. The Solomon Amendment began modestly, involving only Defense Department funds, but quickly metastasized. In Part II, I discuss the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, an important issue raised by the Solomon Amendment and likely to figure prominently in the future of liberty and federalism but one that is left mostly untouched by FAIR. In Part III, I analyze the Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of free speech and the freedom of association. On free speech, the Court unsuccessfully distinguished its compelled-speech cases and seemingly narrowed the reach of its third-party speech cases. It also minted a test for expressive conduct based on 2 ̆ 2 inherent expressiveness 2 ̆ 2 that is either completely unworkable or extremely narrow. On the freedom of association, the Court narrowed its jurisprudence largely to concerns about membership and seemingly dropped any deference to an association 2 ̆ 7 s own judgment about whether compliance with state regulation would significantly impair its message. Both of these holdings are a break with the Court 2 ̆ 7 s precedents...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} By {{the numbers}} 	 45 % of all Australians will experience {{a mental health}} problem {{over the course of}} their lives; 1 in 5 will do so in any given year. 	 75 % of mental health problems first appear before the age of 25, yet more than 70 % of young women and 80 % of young men who need help and support don’t get it. 	Poor mental health in young people costs Australia at least $ 6. 29 billion per annum, including $ 1. 3 billion in direct health costs and $ 1. 2 billion in unemployment and disability payments. If we continue to use only traditional service delivery approaches, a further $ 9 billion (in salaries alone) would be required over the next 15 years to double the number of people receiving help. Despite intense effort and increased investment in mental health service delivery in Australia there continues to be significant unmet need for mental health services. Left untreated, mental health problems can worsen, leading to significant negative impacts on every aspect of a person’s life. There are also substantial economic impacts, with the World Economic Forum forecasting that {{over the next two decades}} the global economic cost of mental illness will exceed that of cancer, diabetes and respiratory ailments combined. More help must be made available to more people, more quickly Australia’s National Mental Health Commission has recently completed a wide-ranging review of the country’s entire mental health system, examining the efficiency and effectiveness of existing programs and services. Complicating the picture, however, is the fact that health expenditure in Australia is growing rapidly (rising by 74 % in the last decade alone), 2 with the recent Intergenerational Report showing that government has limited, and steadily reducing capacity to provide the level of investment required to fully meet Australia’s current and future health needs. We need to undertake the long-term reform required to redesign and resource the mental health system while also providing more help, to more <b>people,</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> We cannot afford to deny another generation access to mental health care and support. The opportunity As Australia undertakes the complex and long-term work required to reform and grow its mental health system we can take action now, with minimal investment to immediately improve the wellbeing of individuals and reduce the broader social costs associated with poor mental health. First, we must embrace and promote scalable online interventions as the “first line of defence” in a system of mental health stepped care. Based on our literature review and a range of online services, we know that doing so will: 	significantly boost the overall capacity of the mental health system, so that more people get help 	deliver this additional capacity at least five years sooner than it would take to build capacity in the health workforce, so that many more people can get help sooner 	become less costly to deliver per person as more people take up the services, as opposed to face-to-face services which become more costly Australia has been a world leader in the design, development, delivery and evaluation of e-mental health interventions; the task now is to fully realise their benefits. To make the most of the potential of e-mental health, it is time to integrate online services into the broader mental health system, promote their use to health professionals and consumers and provide ongoing, sustainable funding. Second, we must intervene early to prevent the development and progression of mental illness, especially among young people. Evidence shows that a concerted prevention/early intervention effort in Australia can deliver significant benefits by preventing individuals from experiencing the effects of poor mental health, and avoiding financial costs to the individual, government and community. Scenario testing outcome: 	A school-based prevention program, delivered online, would represent a very cost-effective intervention approach by international standards. 	An early intervention treatment program, delivered online, could help more than 78, 000 young people recover from their depression and/or anxiety, avoiding more than $ 350 million in costs to the Australian economy. Early intervention through low-cost, widely available e-mental health services should be a top priority for mental health service reform, and increased government investment would improve the mental health of the community while reducing costs. A way forward Reform of the existing mental health system is likely to be complex and to take time. But we cannot afford to risk losing another generation to the lifelong effects of poor mental health. Smart, small investments made now could save hundreds of thousands of people from the crippling effects of a lifetime of poor mental health. These investments – along with the promotion and use of existing e-mental health services – will enable us to start providing immediate help to people who currently struggle alone...|$|E
