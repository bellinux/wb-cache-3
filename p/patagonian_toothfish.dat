5|$|Type D was {{identified}} based on photographs of a 1955 mass stranding in New Zealand and six at-sea sightings since 2004. The first video record {{of this type}} in life happened between the Kerguelen and Crozet Islands in 2014. It is immediately recognizable by its extremely small white eye patch, narrower and shorter than usual dorsal fin, bulbous head (similar to a pilot whale), and smaller teeth. Its geographic range appears to be circumglobal in subantarctic waters between latitudes 40°S and 60°S. And although nothing {{is known about the}} type D diet, it is suspected to include fish because groups have been photographed around longline vessels, where they reportedly prey on <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides).|$|E
5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{passing of}} the Antarctic Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several {{restrictions}} to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays {{a large role in}} the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000tonnes (35,300short tons) in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International {{and their}} partners, {{who run the}} Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some of these techniques in the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the South Georgia {{government}} was {{cited by the}} Marine Stewardship Council for its sustainable <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> fishery, certifying that South Georgia met the MSC's environmental standards. The certificate places limits on the timing and quantity of <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> that may be caught.|$|E
25|$|Between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999, {{fisheries}} landed 119,898 tonnes, {{of which}} 85% consisted of krill and 14% of <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish.</b> International agreements came into force in late 1999 to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, {{which in the}} 1998–99 season landed five to six times more <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> than the regulated fishery.|$|E
25|$|Another {{on-going}} {{concern is}} overfishing of the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> and the albatross population is monitored. The {{waters of the}} Crozet Islands are patrolled by the French government.|$|E
25|$|Deepwater benthopelagic {{fish are}} robust, muscular {{swimmers}} that actively cruise the bottom searching for prey. They often live around features, such as seamounts, which have strong currents. Commercial examples are the orange roughy and <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish.</b>|$|E
25|$|In October 1997, the Anzac {{conducted}} Operation Dirk {{supported by}} HMAS Westralia targeting illegal fishing {{vessels in the}} Southern Ocean catching the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> around Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Australian Fisheries Zone with the Salvora and the Aliza Glacial apprehended boarded by Clearance divers.|$|E
25|$|Robust benthopelagic {{fish are}} muscular {{swimmers}} that actively cruise the bottom searching for prey. They may live around features, such as seamounts, which have strong currents. Examples are the orange roughy and <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish.</b> Because these fish were once abundant, and because their robust bodies are good to eat, these fish have been commercially harvested.|$|E
25|$|Increased solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation {{resulting from the}} Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) {{by as much as}} 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{takes place}} around South Georgia and in {{adjacent}} waters in some {{months of the}} year, with fishing licences sold by the territory for <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish,</b> cod icefish and krill. Fishing licences bring in millions of pounds a year, most of which is spent on fishery protection and research. All fisheries are regulated and managed {{in accordance with the}} Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) system.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Te Kaha pursued <b>Patagonian</b> <b>Toothfish</b> poachers in the Ross Dependency, {{participated in}} the INTERFET {{multinational}} deployment to East Timor, and operated {{as part of the}} Multinational Interception Force in the Persian Gulf. The New Zealand frigates served periods as guardship at the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara during 2000 and 2001. In 2002, Te Kaha returned to the Persian Gulf, this time as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, after a four-month flag-showing deployment in Asian waters. The frigate was replaced in the Gulf by Te Mana in early 2003.|$|E
25|$|Many {{deep sea}} fish are at risk, such as orange roughy, <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish,</b> and sablefish. The deep sea is almost {{completely}} dark, near freezing and has little food. Deep sea fish grow slowly because of limited food, have slow metabolisms, low reproductive rates, and many don't reach breeding maturity for 30 to 40 years. A fillet of orange roughy {{at the store}} is probably at least 50 years old. Most deep sea fish are in international waters, {{where there are no}} legal protections. Most of these fish are caught by deep trawlers near seamounts, where they congregate because of food. Flash freezing allows the trawlers to work for days at a time, and modern fishfinders target the fish with ease.|$|E
500|$|On 12 April 2001, an SASR troop {{conducted}} a boarding {{of the fishing}} vessel South Tomi using two RHIBs launched from the South African Navy vessel SAS Protea in international waters [...] south of Cape Agulhas, South Africa. On 29 March, the Togo registered South Tomi fled the AFMA fisheries patrol vessel Southern Supporter after being detected poaching <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> near Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Southern Ocean. The South Tomi fled towards Africa with the South African government agreeing to a request to provide a South African Navy vessel for an intercept. The SASR troop was flown on a commercial flight to South Africa. South Tomi was boarded after a pursuit of [...] by the Southern Supporter. In August 2001, the SASR {{was involved in the}} Tampa affair when its counter-terrorist squadron was ordered to Christmas Island and to board the MV Tampa once it illegally entered Australian waters.

Less controversial was the SASR's involvement in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the MV Pong Su—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off Newcastle on 20 April 2003 [...]|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two species}} from the Dissostichus genus, the Antarctic {{toothfish}} (Dissostichus mawsoni) and the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides). These two species {{live on the}} seafloor [...] deep, and can grow to around [...] long weighing up to , living up to 45 years. The Antarctic toothfish lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish</b> lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Due to the low water temperatures around the mainland, the Antarctic toothfish has antifreeze proteins in its blood and tissues. Toothfish are commercially fished, and overfishing has reduced toothfish populations.|$|E
2500|$|The world's largest invertebrate, {{the colossal}} squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni), roams the deep {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean where it is {{believed}} to be an ambush predator of prey such as chaetognatha, large fish such as the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>toothfish,</b> and other squid. It is thought to have a slow metabolic rate, needing only around [...] of prey daily. [...] A single 5kg Antarctic toothfish provides enough nourishment for a 500kg colossal squid to survive for 200 days. [...] These estimates of its energetic demands suggest it is a slow-moving ambush predator which uses its large eyes primarily for predator detection rather than active hunting.|$|E
