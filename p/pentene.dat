5000|$|A {{schematic}} {{drawing of the}} binding of sumatriptan to 5-HT1D receptor {{can be seen in}} figure 4. One study [...] showed that sumatriptan fits better in the binding site of the receptor when the side chain with the protonated nitrogen atom is folded back over the indole structure. This alignment contributes to the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen in the sulfonamine and the Ser138 in the binding site. It is also favorable to the formation of the hydrogen bond between the oxygen of the sulfonamine and Thr202. Other binding in the pocket of the binding site occurs with the nitrogen atom in the <b>pentene</b> ring of the indole structure of the triptan and the amino acid Ser352. This energetically favorable position of the agonist makes it possible for additional binding of the ligand to other Ser in the binding site, along with additional anchoring between Phe in the pocket of the binding site and the indole of the agonist. The binding of Phe and the triptan is caused by π stacking interactions of the indole and amino acid and an additional effect on this interaction is because of dispersive effect of amino acid leucine (Leu; not shown in figure 4). The amino acids Trp343 and Tyr346 both have electron rich π-systems in their aromatic structures. With their position in the binding site they create a sort of aromatic cage around the protonated nitrogen atom of the side chain on position C3 on the triptans (this nitrogen atom is protonated at physiological condition), and thereby stabilizes the ion bond the nitrogen atom has formed with a carboxylate on aspartic acid. Side chains of the surrounding amino acids can {{have an effect on the}} binding of the nitrogen atom, mainly three Phe can affect the methyl groups bound to the nitrogen atom (not shown in figure 4).|$|E

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of trans- 2 -pentene, cis- 2 -pentene, and 1 -pentene on Pd(111) and Pd/Al 2 O 3 model catalysts {{has been}} studied using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). Each molecule reacts in an identical manner on the Pd(111) surface. Three distinct molecular adsorption states are observed, which have been assigned to multilayer, -bonded <b>pentene</b> and interchanging di-sigma-bonded pentene/pentyl groups. The latter species undergo coverage-dependent stepwise dehydrogenation. For trans- 2 -pentene on D 2 preadsorbed Pd(111), a H–D exchange reaction occurs, resulting in D-substituted <b>pentene,</b> which molecularly desorbs or dehydrogenates on heating similar to nonexchanged <b>pentene.</b> Pentane is not formed as a hydrogenation product on Pd(111). On Pd nanoparticles, dehydrogenation proceeds more readily than on Pd(111). In addition, {{the extent of the}} H–D exchange reaction is considerably greater on particles. In contrast to Pd(111), the hydrogenation reaction occurs on the Pd particles. Data show that di-sigma-bonded <b>pentene</b> is the precursor for both the H–D exchange reaction and the pentane formation, with each occurring via a pentyl group. This pentyl group reacts either by beta-H elimination to form <b>pentene</b> or by reductive elimination to form pentane. The results for pentenes are compared with those for ethene. We have found that, under the low-pressure conditions studied, alkene hydrogenation only occurs in the presence of subsurface hydrogen. The accessibility of the subsurface hydrogen atoms is enhanced on the particles, due to the nanoscale dimensions, relative to that on crystals. The results are rationalized {{on the basis of a}} model of overlapping desorption states, which may predict both the feasibility of alkene hydrogenation on Pd catalysts and the active species involved in the reaction...|$|E

40|$|Tertiary ethers {{are formed}} in a {{reaction}} between alcohols and alkenes. They {{are used in}} gasoline to enhance its burning and to reduce harmful exhaust emissions. They also have high octane rating, which is beneficial for gasoline blending. Regulations in regard to fuel composition and exhaust emissions are tightening and new, cleaner burning high octane gasoline components are of wide interest. This work concerns the etherification of C 8 -alkenes. Several C 8 -alkenes were screened for their reactivity. Study of {{the properties of the}} resulting ethers showed that some of them are potential for gasoline blending. 2, 4, 4 -Trimethyl <b>pentenes</b> were chosen for more detailed study in view of the availability of the feed stock in industrial scale and the promising properties of the resulting ether. The reactivity of 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl <b>pentenes</b> was tested with various alcohols. The marked effect of the alcohol on the reaction rate was attributed primarily to the polarity of the alcohol, which affects the adsorption of the components and the catalyst. Compared with the ethers currently in commercial production, the C 8 -alkenes are etherified rather slowly. A new catalyst was sought to enhance the reaction rate. Traditionally, etherification is catalysed by strong cation exchange resin beads, such as Amberlyst resins, but a novel fibrous Smopex- 101 catalyst was found to be more active in the etherification of 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl <b>pentenes</b> with methanol, evidently because diffusional limitations were less. A kinetic model was developed for the etherification of 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl <b>pentenes</b> with methanol for purposes of reactor design. Kinetic experiments were performed with Smopex- 101 as catalyst. Before the kinetic studies, thermodynamic parameters were derived for the etherification reactions and for the isomerisation reaction between 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 1 -pentene and 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 2 -pentene. The results of the kinetic modelling indicated that the adsorption of the alkenes was minor. The best models to describe the data were the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type model where the adsorption of alkenes is assumed to be negligible compared to other reactive components and the Eley-Rideal type model where alkenes are not adsorbed. Adsorption behaviour was different on the fibrous catalyst than on the ion exchange resins: ether was better adsorbed than alcohol on the fibrous catalyst, whereas alcohol is known to better adsorb than ether on the traditional ion exchange resin catalyst. The better adsorption of ether on the fibrous catalyst was attributed to the greater hydrophobicity of this catalyst. reviewe...|$|R

Growth on 1 <b>pentene</b> as sole carbon source was obtained {{after a lengthy}} adaptation period, during which cells were repeatedly subcultured {{with the addition of}} yeast extract at the intermediate stages. Batch production of the bio catalyst was optimised, resulting in a culture density of 0. 63 gdw / L with 19 % of the sealed flask occupied by broth (1 <b>pentene</b> is gaseous at 30 Deg C), using an initial 1 <b>pentene</b> concentration of 0. 1 % (v/v). The biomass yield on 1 <b>pentene</b> was 0. 49 Ceq/Ceq. Problems associated with the toxicity of the epoxides towards the cells and also with the low solubility and instability of epoxides in water were solved by implementing a two phase biotransformation system, consisting of phosphate buffer containing the freely suspended cells, and a biocompatible organic substrate reservoir (iso-octane or n-dodecane). A maximum specific 1, 2 apoxyhexane conversion rate of 25 nmol / min mg protein was attained when cells harvested from a batch fermentation in the late exponential phase were used. In this biphasic system, the epoxide conversion capacity of the whole cells was limited, even in the presence of co-substrates. Substitution of the buffer by mineral medium resulted in growth of the strain (using the epoxide as carbon and energy source) and in a enhanced epoxide conversion capacity of the system.

40|$|Olefin/Paraffin separation, {{traditionally}} {{carried out}} by cryogenic distillation, is difficult to achieve due to the similar size and volatility of the components. Recently, many studies have explored membrane separation methods that utilize a metal ion to facilitate preferential olefin transport across the membrane. However, much of this work focuses on smaller molecules, C 2 -C 3, which are gaseous at room temperature, while little {{work has been done}} studying separation of larger molecules, C 5 and greater, which are generally liquid at room temperature. The processes developed to separate small molecules are not necessarily directly applicable to separate larger molecules. A polymer electrolyte membrane consisting of an active layer of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and silver tetrafluoroborate (AgBF 4) has shown high selectivity for separating gaseous olefin/paraffin mixtures. The current project investigates the feasibility of applying this membrane to the separation of <b>pentene</b> and pentane (liquid C 5 olefin and paraffin). Process variables investigated are the: pure component permeability ratio, equilibrium sorption uptakes, pure component diffusivities, and stable membrane lifetime. Permeation tests on individual species (n-pentane and 1 -pentene) were performed in two operating modes with membranes of varying silver concentrations: direct liquid contact to the membrane, and vapour contact to the membrane. The vapour contact mode showed improved membrane stability in comparison to the liquid contact mode. The olefin/paraffin permeability ratio increases with increasing silver content in the membrane, however, the membrane selectivity is much lower than that achieved with smaller olefin/paraffin pairs. Selective chemical interactions between <b>pentene</b> and the membrane were observed, as the <b>pentene</b> sorption uptake is higher than that of pentane. In addition, a residual fraction is observed – a fraction of the <b>pentene</b> does not desorb from the membrane at ambient conditions – indicating a permanent or semi-permanent interaction. Desorption of pentane is determined to follow a Fickian diffusion model, while desorption of <b>pentene</b> appears to be governed by pseudo-second order kinetics. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (DSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Commercial polyolefins degrade {{under the}} {{influence}} of light, heat, chemical and mechanical factors. They are therefore stabilised to ensure that they maintain performance characteristics during their service life. Degradation results in changes in the molar mass, molar mass distribution, chemical composition and chemical composition distribution. Classical analytical techniques only provide averaged values of these properties. Much information is available in the open literature on the changes in molar mass, molar mass distribution and chemical composition of polypropylene upon degradation, but no information was available on the changes in chemical composition distribution (CCD) during degradation. This study describes the use of the following analytical techniques to study this: temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF), crystallisation analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF) and coupled size exclusion chromatography-Fourier transform infrared analysis (SEC-FTIR). The CRYSTAF results complimented those obtained by classical techniques: there was a broadening of the crystallisation peak (CCD), an increase in the soluble fraction and a decrease in crystallisation temperatures. SEC-FTIR analysis showed that most of the degraded products were concentrated in the low molar mass regions. TREF analysis was used to separate a degraded sample into fractions of different degrees of degradation. It was then possible to study the spatial heterogeneity in a thick, degraded polypropylene sample using SEC, FTIR and CRYSTAF. The degradation behaviour of selected Sasol propylene- 1 -pentene random copolymers was investigated. CRYSTAF, SEC-FTIR and TREF analyses provided information on the thermo-oxidative degradation behaviour differences between unstabilised polypropylene homopolymers and these propylene- 1 -pentene copolymers.

Os 3 (CO) 12 was a catalyst for H-D exchange between C 6 H 6 and D 2 at 195 ° but the ruthenium congener was inactive at temperatures below 175 °, a temperature where ruthenium metal formed at an appreciable rate. Deuterium incorporation in the benzene was a single-step process. Ir 4 (CO) 12 was an effective catalyst for the conversion of cyclohexadiene to cyclohexene and benzene. A similar reaction occurred with cyclohexene but the rate was extremely low at 160 °. The ruthenium and osmium clusters catalyzed the isomerization of linear hexenes, with the former the more active. Relative rates for the hexenes were 1 > 2 > 3. At high temperatures, the osmium and iridium clusters catalyzed skeletal reactions of 2 -hexene, as evidenced by the formation of <b>pentenes,</b> heptenes, heptanes, and small amounts of propane...|$|R
40|$|The {{activation}} of n-pentane {{in the presence}} of oxygen has been studied over two magnesium-vanadium oxides, magnesium pyrovanadate, Mg 2 V 2 O 7, and magnesium orthovanadate, Mg 3 V 2 O 8, prepared by the citrate method. The catalytic behavior of mixtures consisting of magnesium vanadate and antimony oxide, 50 - 50 % wt, was also investigated. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the vanadates have shown that they were of high purity, while XPS measurements revealed a slight surface enrichment in magnesium. At 350 - 500 degrees C and atmospheric pressure, similar total n-pentane conversions were achieved with the two magnesium vanadate phases; the main products were linear unsaturated C- 5 hydrocarbons, i. e. <b>pentenes</b> and pentadienes, and carbon oxides. Magnesium orthovanadate was more selective than the pyrovanadate towards the pure dehydrogenation reaction in comparison with the combustion one, and its selectivity was in general increased by the addition of Sb 2 O 4 The latter had little effect on the behavior of the pyrovanadate phase. Decreasing the oxygen to alkane ratio in the feed led to a decrease in total conversion and an increase in selectivity, while the C- 5 hydrocarbon product distributions were not influenced appreciably. The extent of the homogeneous reaction between pentane and oxygen was negligible for oxygen to alkane ratios in the feed equal to 0. 5 and 1. 0, but increased dramatically when the ratio was raised to 2. 0...|$|R
40|$|A proton transfer-reaction mass {{spectrometer}} (PTR-MS) onboard a mobile laboratory {{was used to}} conduct emission measurements at eight gas stations in Beijing during the CAREBeijing 2008 campaign. Benzene, toluene, C 8 -, C 9 -aromatics, methanol, MTBE, butenes and <b>pentenes</b> were the major volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected during the measurements. An inter-comparison between the PTR-MS and an on-line GC/MS/FID system was also conducted and the result showed good agreement between the two instruments (Interception 0. 92). A Gaussian point source plume model was applied to evaluate the VOCs emission rates. The results showed that on average about 4. 5 mt of gasoline were emitted from gas stations in Beijing per day. The estimated emission factor (EF) for gas stations due to refueling processes was about 0. 5 kg t − 1, which was significantly lower than a value of 2. 49 kg t − 1 obtained in 2002, indicating a successful implementation of vapor recovery system in the gas stations of Beijing. On average, about 18 ppbv of benzene has been detected at one gas station, {{twice as much as}} the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommended safe chronic exposure level and implying a potential public health concern. MTBE and aromatics were found to be the major antiknocking additives used in gasoline supplied in Beijing. Our results reveal that emissions from gas stations represent an important source for VOCs in megacity Beijing and need to be properly included in emission inventories to assess their roles in photochemical ozone production and secondary organic aerosol formation. Furthermore, promoting methanol-blended fuel in Beijing can be an effective way to reduce toxic air pollutants emission...|$|R
