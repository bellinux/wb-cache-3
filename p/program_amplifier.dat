30|$|In {{conclusion}} we {{have shown}} how to design an all-optical device {{that is capable of}} supervised learning from input data, by describing how tunable gain amplifiers with signal/bias isolation can be constructed from nonlinear resonators and subsequently combined with self-oscillating resonators to encode the <b>programmed</b> <b>amplifier</b> gain in their oscillation phase. By considering a few additional nonlinear devices for thresholding and all-optical switching we then show how to construct a perceptron, including the perceptron feedback rule. To our knowledge this is the first end-to-end description of an all-optical circuit capable of learning from data. We have furthermore demonstrated that despite optical shot-noise it nearly attains the performance of the optimal software algorithm for the classification task that we considered. Finally, we have discussed the relevant time-scales and pointed out how to scale the circuit up to large input dimensions while retaining the signal processing bandwidth and a low power consumption per input.|$|R

Their implementation and use is chal-lenged by the second order effects that dominate the MOSFET operations with reduction in the technology size and scale. The ability to <b>program</b> the <b>amplifiers</b> once fabricated becomes an even more challenging problem as it warrants the use of multiple circuit components that lowers cir-cuit performance and in turn outweighs the advantages of generalisation abilities.

40|$|Industry is {{continuously}} researching {{techniques to}} reduce power requirements, while increasing speed, {{to meet the}} demands of today’s low (battery) powered wireless systems. The operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is a fundamental building block in analog (mixed-signal) design and its performance characteristics are the foundation of system level characteristics. Improving the performance of the fundamental amplifier structure, while avoiding costly silicon area and static power increases, is critical to improving system performance. The application of Local Common Mode Feedback (LCMFB) to the conventional OTA structure provides significant increases in gain-bandwidth and slew rate performance without an increase in static power and limited additional silicon area.

40|$|Abstract—We {{report the}} design of an ultra-low-power 32 -channel neural-recording {{integrated}} circuit (chip) in a 0. 18 m CMOS technology. The chip consists of eight neural recording modules where each module contains four neural amplifiers, an analog multiplexer, an A/D converter, and a serial <b>programming</b> interface. Each <b>amplifier</b> can be <b>programmed</b> to record either spikes or LFPs with a programmable gain from 49 – 66 dB. To min-imize the total power consumption, an adaptive-biasing scheme is utilized to adjust each amplifier’s input-referred noise to suit the background noise at the recording site. The amplifier’s input-re-ferred noise can be adjusted from 11. 2 (total power of 5. 4 W) down to 5. 4 (total power of 20 W) in the spike-recording setting. The ADC in each recording module digi-tizes the a. c. signal input to each amplifier at 8 -bit precision with a sampling rate of 31. 25 kS/s per channel, with an average power consumption of 483 nW per channel, and, because of a. c. coupling, allows d. c. operation over a wide dynamic range. It achieves an ENOB of 7. 65, resulting in a net efficiency of 77 fJ/State, {{making it one of}} the most energy-efficient designs for neural recording applications. The presented chip was successfully tested in an in vivo wireless recording experiment from a behaving primate with an average power dissipation per channel of 10. 1 W. The neural amplifier and the ADC occupy areas of 0. 03 mm and 0. 02 mm respectively, making our design simultaneously area efficient and power efficient, thus enabling scaling to high channel-count systems.

40|$|In modern {{communication}} links amplifiers play {{a crucial}} role. However the necessity of cost- and power efficient solutions result in amplifiers being used outside their most linear region of operation. When a modulated signal is inserted into a nonlinear element such as an amplifier, the output {{will be subject to}} a phenomena referred to as spectral regrowth. The spectral regrowth will contribute to adjacent channel interference if the regrowth from the modulated signal is spread into an adjacent channel. The aim of this thesis is to create a model that can predict the amount of adjacent channel interference generated due to spectral regrowth, when an modulated signal is fed into an amplifier. The investigation include the common mobile communication standards GSM, UMTS and LTE. To develop a model, both simulations and measurements has been performed. MATLAB, Agilent’s ADS and AWR VSS have all been used during the simulations for cross verification. The measure used to quantify spectral regrowth is adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR). In logarithmic scale, ACPR was confirmed to depend on IIP 3 with a factor of 2 dB/dBm while the dependence on input power is a factor of - 2 dB/dBm. The model can predict the ACPR for different channel setups with a maximum deviation of 2. 3 dB compared to measurements, {{for the majority of the}} frequency interval of interest. The deviation depend upon the type of signal, channel setup and simulation <b>program.</b> The only <b>amplifier</b> characteristic inserted into the model is IIP 3 which is a figure of merit that is not constant. As the IIP 3 of an amplifier will vary, the use of this input variable result in uncertanties in the prediction of ACPR. However, the model can give a rough estimation of the ACPR in short time, using easily obtainable input parameters...|$|R
40|$|To make a {{automatic}} recording DTA apparatus, PID <b>program</b> controller, DC <b>amplifier,</b> recorder, etc. were assembled. The schematic {{arrangement of}} the appartus is shown in Fig. 7. The accuracy of the apparatus is within ± 5 ℃ in comparison with melting points of standard metals, such as zinc, antimony and aluminium. The DTA of the apparatus was tentatively carried out on behavior of transition, decomposition, and congruent, eutectic and solid solution melting on such sulfide minerals as cubanite, chalcocite, monoclinic pyrrhotite, stibnite, cuprobismuthite CuBiS_ 2 and horobetsuite BiSbS_ 3. The specimen and inert material (alumina) are severally sealed in evacuated silica glass tubes which are able to insert chromel-alumel thermo-couples into their bottoms. The DTA curve (Fig. 12) of chalcocite shows large and small endothermic reactions at 105 ℃ and 485 ℃ which are transitions from orthorhombic to hexagonal form and from hexagonal to cubic form respectively. Cubanite (Figs. 11 and 12) is also found to transform from low temperature form to high temperature form by the DTA curve showing a distinct endothermic peak beginning at 258 ℃. The DTA curve (Fig. 12) of monoclinic pyrrhotite also represents a transition from monoclinic form to hexagonal form at 325 ℃. Both stibnite and bismuth (Fig. 13) are shown to melt congruently at temperatures of 545 ℃ and 273 ℃ respectively. The DTA curve (Fig. 12) of cuprobismuthite shows three endothermic reactions at 487 ℃, 528 ℃ and 615 ℃.
