500|$|Winning {{the first}} and third Tests of the 1964–65 series, the West Indians took the trophy to the Caribbean for the first time. [...] The {{following}} three series were all won by Australia, with the 1975–76 series ending 5–1. [...] The West Indies sole Test victory in the latter series, at the WACA Ground in Perth, was by an innings and 87 runs. [...] It featured an explosive innings from West Indian batsman Roy Fredericks who struck 169 from 145 deliveries and was described by former batsman Lindsay Hassett as the [...] "greatest innings I've seen in Australia". [...] The 1977–78 series saw the beginning of fifteen years of West Indian dominance in the trophy, but it was not without controversy. [...] The first two Tests of that series were completed within three days, the second being notable for Graham Yallop becoming the first batsman to wear a helmet at the crease. [...] With the West Indies team departing to join Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket as the World Series Cricket West Indies XI, Australia managed a victory against the second-string team in the third Test but were beaten by 198 runs in the fourth. [...] The final Test saw the West Indies eight wickets down with more than 100 runs needed when Vanburn Holder was dismissed. [...] Although the decision was legitimate, Holder's reaction {{on the way back to}} the <b>pavillion</b> was interpreted otherwise, and the Jamaican crowds began to riot. [...] The match was abandoned, and with two of the three umpires refusing to consider a sixth day's play, the result was declared a draw. The 1981–82 series was drawn overall, with one victory each and one draw, thus the West Indies retained the trophy.|$|E

He was one of those few spirits who live in advance of their age, and who permitted his reason to be enlightened and cheered by his imagination, though it was never dazzled by it. As he and his friend Alonzo de Quintanilla, after quitting Columbus as already related, walked toward the royal <b>pavillion,</b> they conversed freely together concerning the man, his vast conceptions, the treatment he had received, and the shame that would alight on Spain in consequence, were he suffered thus to depart forever. Blunt of speech, the receiver of the ecclesiastical revenues did not measure his terms, every syllable of which found an echo {{in the heart of the}} accountant-general, who was an old and fast friend of the navigator. In short, by the time they reached the pavilion, they had come to the resolution to make one manly effort to induce the queen to yield to Columbus' terms and to recall him to her presence.|$|E

50|$|In 2015 a {{sale was}} agreed {{for the house}} and 10 acres to a developer, to be {{completed}} by the end of 2016. On 17 September 2016 an auction was held, in preparation for the house sale, of 1,000-plus lots of motor vehicle remains and spare parts that occupied the house and grounds. The developers aim to restore the property, including the seventy-foot towers which originally stood on the east and west sides. They plan to put a glass roof on the inner courtyard as well as adding a new low level extension. It will then be used as an events venue holding weddings, corporate events and exhibitions with twenty bedrooms on the upper floors. To make the development more financially viable, there are also plans to include four residential <b>pavillions</b> and seven 4 bedroom villas.|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} of the {{preceding}} summer, while the Spanish forces lay before the town, and Isabella, with her children, were anxious witnesses of the progress of events, an accident occurred that had well nigh proved fatal to the royal family, and brought destruction on the Christian arms. The <b>pavillion</b> of the queen took fire, and was consumed, placing the whole encampment in the utmost jeopardy. Many of the tents of the nobles were also destroyed, and much treasure, in the shape of jewelry and plate, was lost, though the injury went no further. In order to guard against the recurrence of such an accident, and probably viewing the subjection of Granada as the great act of their mutual reign--for, as yet, Time threw his veil around the future, and but one human eye foresaw the greatest of all the events of the period, which was still in reserve--the sovereigns resolved on attempting a work that, of itself, would render this siege memorable. The plan of a regular town was made, and laborers set about the construction of good substantial edifices, in which to lodge the army; thus converting the warfare into that of something like city against city. In three months this stupendous work was completed, with its avenues, streets, and squares, and received the name of Santa Fé, or Holy Faith--an appellation quite as well suited to the zeal which could achieve such a work, in the heat of a campaign, as to that general reliance on the providence of God which animated the Christians in carrying on the war. The construction of this place struck terror into the hearts of the Moors, for they considered it a proof that their enemies intended to give up the conflict only with their lives; and it is highly probable that it had a direct and immediate influence on the submission of Boabdil, the King of Granada, who yielded the Alhambra {{a few weeks after the}} Spaniards had taken possession of their new abodes.|$|E

50|$|Pionirski Grad covers {{an area of}} 36.5 ha and is a non-residential {{settlement}} completely {{surrounded by}} the woods of Košutnjak. There are 9 pavilions with a total area of 200 m2. Oldest among them were built in 1941/42. They were organized as the Pionirski Grad in 1947 and, as the name says, were intended to be the children’s recreational center. Objects in the settlement include restaurant “Ozon”, two bungalows which serve as the kindergarten and outdoor terrains for basketball, futsal, handball, tennis, athletics and jogging. In the concrete hall there are indoor courts for futsal and squash, {{the first and only}} in Belgrade. Major building has an area of 6,000 m2 and contains restaurant, cabinets, classrooms, disco and artistic ateliers. Within the building there is also an amphitheatre with 600 seats which was rented for the Veliki Brat, Serbian version of the reality show Big Brother, talent show Operacija Trijumf and for the “I love Serbia” quiz show, Serbian version of the I Love My Country. In its heyday Pionirski Grad had an attendance of 100,000 per year but it lost its recreational function when the refugees from the Yugoslav Wars were settled in seven <b>pavillions</b> from 1990s to 2010s.

My point was {{not to make a}} {{composition}} or objects which would cut capers too much. I have placed the most of the required functions in the original entrance building. The function of both the tropical and cold greenhouse was preserved. A visitor entering the garden is given a choice of two paths where to go to the Floral garden. He may either use the original one which goes through the yard of honour to the boundary of the flower garden and garden nursery or he may go via the information room towards the dutch garden. Then it goes through the colonnade connected with the yard of honour by a clear gate-way between the entrance building and the tropical greenhouse. The colonnade heads towards a caffé and a visitor going here walks through two <b>pavillions</b> where there are some information pannels with detailed information about the garden development. This path ends in the caffé where there is an area for some exhibitions as well. The caffé is situated by the north-west wall of the allotment and it contains a library, a study and a separated bathroom as well. External walls of this object consist of repeating pillars (1, 2 meter long) and free space (2 meters long) where there is always a table. There are sash glass pannels in the two layer pillars in summer. These gaps are closed in winter. There is a rabbit hill replica in the agricultural area of the garden and there are some children slides and playground and the greenhouse pair...|$|R

5000|$|Thomas Whiting, Chester Herald, {{has left}} a {{detailed}} account of the events: on 24 July 1476 the bodies were exhumed, that of the Duke, [...] "garbed in an ermine furred mantle and cap of maintenance, covered with a cloth of gold" [...] lay in state under a hearse blazing with candles, guarded by an angel of silver, bearing a crown of gold as a reminder that by right the Duke had been a king. On its journey, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, with other lords and officers of arms, all dressed in mourning, followed the funeral chariot, drawn by six horses, with trappings of black, charged with the arms of France and England and preceded by a knight bearing the banner of the ducal arms. Fotheringhay was reached on 29 July, where members of the college and other ecclesiastics went forth to meet the cortege. At the entrance to the churchyard, King Edward waited, together with the Duke of Clarence, the Marquis of Dorset, Earl Rivers, Lord Hastings and other noblemen. Upon its arrival the King 'made obeisance to the body right humbly and {{put his hand on the}} body and kissed it, crying all the time.' The procession moved into the church where two hearses were waiting, one in the choir for the body of the Duke and one in the Lady Chapel for that of the Earl of Rutland, and after the King had retired to his 'closet' and the princes and officers of arms had stationed themselves around the hearses, masses were sung and the King's chamberlain offered for him seven pieces of cloth of gold 'which were laid in a cross on the body.' The next day three masses were sung, the Bishop of Lincoln preached a 'very noble sermon' and offerings were made by the Duke of Gloucester and other lords, of 'The Duke of York's coat of arms, of his shield, his sword, his helmet and his coursers on which rode Lord Ferrers in full armour, holding in his hand an axe reversed.' When the funeral was over, the people were admitted into the church and it is said that before the coffins were placed in the vault which had been built under the chancel, five thousand persons came to receive the alms, while four times that number partook of the dinner, served partly in the castle and partly in the King's tents and <b>pavillions.</b> The menu included capons, cygnets, herons, rabbits and so many good things that the bills for it amounted to more than three hundred pounds.In 1495 the body of Cecily Neville, Duchess of York was laid to rest beside that of her husband the Duke of York, as her will directed. She bequeathed to the College a square canopy, crymson cloth of gold, a chasuble, and two tunicles, and three copes of blue velvet, bordered, with three albs, three mass books, three grails and seven processioners.|$|R
60|$|The most charming {{thing at}} Poitiers {{is simply the}} Promenade de Blossac, - a small public garden {{at one end of}} the flat top of the hill. It has a happy look of the last century (having been {{arranged}} at that period), and a beautiful sweep of view over the sur- rounding country, and especially of the course of the little river Clain, which winds about a part of the base of the big mound of Poitiers. The limit of this dear little garden is formed, on the side that turns away from the town, by the rampart erected in the fourteenth century, and by its big semicircular bastions. This rampart, of great length, has a low parapet; you look over it at the charming little vegetable-gardens with which the base of the hill appears exclusively to be garnished. The whole prospect is delightful, especially the details of the part just under the walls, at the end of the walk. Here the river makes a shining twist, which a painter might have invented, and the side of the hill is terraced into several ledges, - a sort of tangle of small blooming patches and little <b>pavillions</b> with peaked roofs and green shutters. It is idle to attempt to reproduce all this in words; it should be reproduced only in water-colors. The reader, how- ever, will already have remarked that disparity in these ineffectual pages, which are pervaded by the attempt to sketch without a palette or brushes. He will doubtless, also, be struck with the grovelling vision which, on such a spot as the ramparts of Poitiers, peoples itself with carrots and cabbages rather than with images of the Black Prince and the captive king. I am not sure that in looking out from the Promenade de Blossac you command the old battle-field; it is enough that it was not far off, and that the great rout of Frenchmen poured into the walls of Poitiers, leav- ing on the ground a number of the fallen equal to the little army (eight thousand) of the invader. I did think of the battle. I wondered, rather helplessly, where it had taken place; and I came away (as the reader will see from the preceding sentence) without finding out. This indifference, however, was a result rather of a general dread of military topography than of a want of admiration of this particular victory, which I have always supposed to be one of the most brilliant on record. Indeed, I should be almost ashamed, and very much at a loss, to say what light it was that this glorious day seemed to me to have left forever on the horizon, and why the very name of the place had always caused my blood gently to tingle. It is carrying the feeling of race to quite inscrutable lengths when a vague American permits himself an emotion because more than five centuries ago, on French soil, one rapacious Frenchman got the better of another. Edward was a Frenchman as well as John, and French were the cries that urged each of the hosts to the fight. French is the beautiful motto graven round the image of the Black Prince, as he lies forever at rest in the choir of Canterbury: a la mort ne pensai-je mye. Nevertheless, the victory of Poitiers declines to lose itself in these considerations; the sense of it is a part of our heritage, the joy of it a part of our imagination, and it filters down through centuries and migrations till it titillates a New Yorker who forgets in his elation that he happens at that moment to be enjoying the hospitality of France. It was something done, I know not how justly, for Eng- land; and what was done in the fourteenth century for England was done also for New York.|$|R
