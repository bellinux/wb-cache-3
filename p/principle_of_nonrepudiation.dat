40|$|Abstract. Chameleon {{signatures}} simultaneously {{provide the}} properties <b>of</b> <b>nonrepudiation</b> and non-transferability for the signed message. However, the initial constructions of chameleon signatures {{suffer from the}} problem of key exposure. This creates a strong disincentive for the recipient to forge signatures, partially undermining the concept of non-transferability. Recently, some specific constructions of discrete logarithm based chameleon hashing and signatures without key exposure are presented, while {{in the setting of}} gap Diffile-Hellman groups with pairings. In this paper, we propose the first key-exposure free chameleon hash and signature scheme based on discrete logarithm systems, without using the gap Diffile-Hellman groups. This provides more flexible constructions of efficient key-exposure free chameleon hash and signature schemes. Moreover, one distinguishing advantage of the resulting chameleon signature scheme is that the property of “message hiding ” or “message recovery ” can be achieved freely by the signer, i. e., the signer can efficiently prove which message was the original one if he desires. Key words: Chameleon hashing, Gap Diffie-Hellman group, Key exposure. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} sources of {{law has been}} a matter of {{considerable}} attention not only in legal theory and philosophy but also in positive law disciplines. Sources of law are commonly divided into substantive, formal and value-based sources. Depending on classifications suggested by different authors, general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> law may fall into all three categories of sources <b>of</b> law. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> domestic law are rules covering a vast number of specific situations which are subsequently used as grounds for generating numerous norms regulating these situations in more detail. In international law, there are general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> international law as well as legal principles recognized by civilized nations. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the European Union law {{are an integral part of}} the positive EU legislation, which clearly differentiates them from similar sets of general goals, objectives, values, agenda postulates, and the like. The general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are have their origins in the Founding Treaties, the legal systems of the Member States and the case law of the EU Court of Justice. Considering their content and legal nature, the general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are divided into: compulsory or axiomatic principles, regulatory or structural principles (which all national laws of the Member States have in common), and the general principles inherent to the EU legal order. Some of the most important general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are: the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> supremacy of EU law over the national law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> direct effect of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> autonomy of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> full effect of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> State liability for damage, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legality, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legal certainty, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith and fair dealing, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> fair hearing, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> subsidiarity, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> proportionality, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> non-discrimination, etc...|$|R
