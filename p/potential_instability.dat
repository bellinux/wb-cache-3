40|$|Abstract: The use {{of market}} {{mechanisms}} to determine generation dispatch, {{and the natural}} tendency to seek improved economic efficiency through rapid market updates, raises a critical issue. As the frequency of market based dispatch updates increases, there will inevitably be interaction between the dynamics of markets determining the generator dispatch commands, and the physical response of generators and network interconnections. This paper examines questions of stability in such coupled systems through numeric tests using various market update models, with detailed generator/turbine/governor dynamics, in the New England 39 bus test system. The results presented highlight the nature of <b>potential</b> <b>instabilities</b> and show the participation of physical and market quantities through eigen-analysis. Understanding of <b>potential</b> modes of <b>instability</b> in such coupled systems is of crucial importance both in designing suitable rules for power markets, and for designing physical generator controls that are complementary to market-based dispatch...|$|R

50|$|Even {{before the}} {{breakout}} {{of the financial}} crisis, the key policy objective of the FSS was to stabilize the financial market and enhance the health and soundness of Korea’s financial institutions. During the recent period of credit expansion, the FSS took a series of strengthened measures of prudency such as Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Debt-to-Income DTI regulations in March 2006 and the 30% rule restricting savings banks’ project finance (PF) loans in August 2006. From August 2007, when the sub-prime mortgage crisis emerged in the United States, the FSS established and operated a comprehensive monitoring system to track new market developments.In September 2008, amid rising distress in global financial markets {{in the wake of}} the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the FSS committed itself to market stabilization to ensure an early recovery from the crisis. It operated a round-the-clock monitoring system that was linked with its offices overseas, government agencies, and financial institutions, while closely coordinating policies with the relevant organizations to promptly deal with <b>potential</b> <b>instability</b> factors. The FSS also established a contingency examination system that required its examination competence to focus on preventing systemic risks; its on-site general examination functions were deferred to accommodate the screening of potential risks.In October 2008, the FSS set up the Foreign Debt Service Guarantee Task Force, thereby working to quickly recover the finance sector’s intermediary role by improving banks’ liquidity ratio and helping to ease the domestic and foreign liquidity crunch faced by local companies. To prevent bad loans from accumulating, the FSS urged banks to maintain a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) ratio of 12% or higher and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9% or higher as of end of 2008.The financial crisis was also an opportunity to crack down on unsound business practices that contributed to increased volatility in the foreign currency and stock markets. To ward off unwarranted concerns that served to undermine market confidence, the FSS regularly organized conference calls and issue briefings for domestic and international institutional investors and analysts, as well as briefings for the foreign press.|$|E
