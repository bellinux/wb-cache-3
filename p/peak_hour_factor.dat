50|$|In the HCM {{delay is}} used to {{estimate}} the level of service (LOS) for intersections. However, there are distinct differences between the way microsimulation programs and the HCM define delay. The HCM bases its delay on adjusted flow using mean control delay for the highest 15 minute period within the hour. The distinction between total delay and control delay is important. Control delay is when a signal control causes a group to slow down or stop. It’s important {{to look at the}} software’s documentation to understand how it calculates delay. In order to use microsimulation outputs to find LOS, the delay must be accumulated over 15 minute intervals and averaged over several runs with different random seeds. Because the HCM uses adjusted flow, another way to compare delay is divide the simulation input’s 15 minute peak volume by the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>factor</b> (PHF) to increase the simulation’s volume.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{alternative}} methodologies for travel demand modeling has become important {{in recent years}} {{due to the lack}} of resources for small and medium communities to adopt conventional four step travel models. Many researchers have proposed alternative tools of travel demand modeling for these communities. But majority of them still require large amount of data and technical sophistication. In this study, the Path Flow Estimator (PFE) is used to estimate the network traffic of Cache County. PFE estimations are based on the collected traffic counts, vehicle production and attractions of zones estimated using Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates. The daily trips of the four step model are converted into peak hour trips using a common <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>factor.</b> The PFE estimations are then compared with the estimations of the four-step model. The differences in vehicle trip production and attraction estimates by both models are due to the use of a common <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>factor</b> to reduce the daily trips of the four step model to peak hour trips. These differences got dis-aggregated spatially in the trip table estimations, leading to similar trip table estimations. The trip length frequency distributions of both models accounting for congestion have similar distribution. The average trip length estimated by PFE is 2. 36 minutes more than the four-step model. Further, PFE has estimated link flows better than the four step model on the links having ground counts due the traffic counts constraint in PFE 2 ̆ 7 s formulation. Low percentage root mean square errors between PFE and the four step model estimated link flows show that PFE has replicated the link flows satisfactorily. The four-step model has overestimated the link flows on Main Street due to the use of daily trips V-C ratio in the zones with high demand due to the slight overestimation of trips by ITE trip generation rates for those zones. On the screenlines identified in the original four step model also PFE has performed better than the four step model. The results of this study show that Path Flow Estimator can be a useful tool in traffic demand modeling for small and medium communities. But PFE should not be used for large communities because of the difficulty in arriving proper trip generation rate for complex land uses. PFE does not distinguish between an internal zone and an external zone...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{stochastic}} {{analysis of}} transit segment hourly passenger load factor variation for transit capacity {{and quality of}} service (QoS) analysis using Automatic Fare Collection data for a premium radial bus route in Brisbane, Australia. It compares stochastic analysis to traditional <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>factor</b> (PHF) analysis to gain further insight into variability of transit route segments’ passenger loading during a study hour. It demonstrates that hourly design load factor is a useful method of modeling a route segment’s capacity and QoS time history across the study weekday. This analysis method is readily adaptable to different passenger load standards by adjusting design percentile, reflecting either a more relaxed or more stringent condition. This paper also considers hourly coefficient of variation of load factor as a capacity and QoS assessment measure, in particular through its relationships with hourly average and design load factors. Smaller value reflects uniform passenger loading, which is generally indicative of well dispersed passenger boarding demands and good schedule maintenance. Conversely, higher value may be indicative of pulsed or uneven passenger boarding demands, poor schedule maintenance, and/or bus bunching. An assessment table based on hourly coefficient of variation of load factor is developed and applied to this case study.

40|$|Traffic {{signal timing}} plans are {{typically}} developed {{on the basis}} of turning movement traffic and pedestrian volume counts aggregated to 15 -minute intervals and obtained over a 4 or 8 hour period on a single day. These data are used to identify the peak hour and to compute the peak hour turning movement traffic volumes. They may also be used to compute the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>factor</b> (PHF). These values are then used as input to the analysis methods defined in the Highway Capacity Manual or within popular signal timing optimization software to estimate signal performance in terms of expected average vehicle delay. Delay estimation methods explicitly consider several sources of variability (e. g. an assumed distribution of individual vehicle headways in the arrival traffic stream). However, these methods do not consider the day-to-day variability that exists within key delay estimation parameters such as the PHF and peak hour traffic volume. The lack of consideration of this variability may be because (a) it is assumed that the impact of the variability is small; and/or (b) methods have not been developed by which the variability can be considered.

40|$|This paper investigates {{quality of}} service and {{resource}} productivity implications of transit route passenger loading and travel distance. Weekday Automatic Fare Collection data for a premium radial bus route in Brisbane, Australia, is used to investigate correlation between load factor and distance factor. Relationships between boardings and transit work indicate that distance factor generally increases with load factor. Time series analysis is then presented by examining each direction on an hour by hour basis. Inbound correlation is medium to strong across the entire span of service and strong for daytime services up to 19 : 30, while outbound correlation is strong across the entire span. Passengers tend to be making longer distance, peak direction commuter trips under the least comfortable conditions under stretched peak schedules than off-peak. Therefore productivity gains may be possible by adjusting fleet utilization during off-peak times. Weekday profiles by direction are established for a composite load-distance factor. A threshold corresponding to standing passengers on the Maximum Load Segment reveals that on-board loading and travel distance combined are more severe during the morning inbound peak than evening outbound peak, although the sharpness of the former suggests that encouraging shoulder peak travel during the morning {{would be more effective}} than evening peak. Further research suggested includes: consideration of travel duration factor, relating noise within hour to <b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>Factor,</b> profiling load-distance factor across a range of case studies, and relating load-distance factor threshold to line length...|$|E
30|$|This study {{employed}} weekday, weekend, road type, type of {{car that}} is taxi or private car variables to explain their effect on peak hour travels. In this section, we explain the similarities of variable choice with others studies and state how our study is different from other studies. Van Wee et al. [35] stated in their study the importance of temporal factors on travel behavior, emphasizing that there are opportunities available depending {{on the time of}} day chosen. This goes to explain the relevance of weekday, weekend and time of day factors in analyzing travel patterns. Yu et al. [36] used weekday peak hour, weekday non-peak hour and weekend non-peak hour to investigate different crash rate circumstances. Even though this was used to investigate crash rates, whereas our study uses it for vehicular movement, it still serves as valuable variables for peak hour traffic studies. Loudon et al. [37] argued in their research the need to specifically model peak hour travels instead of the traditional way of making assumptions with percentages based on twenty-four-hour estimates. They used 6  am to 9  am peak period and 3  pm to 6  pm off-peak period travel for their research. Our research descriptive statistics, however, confirmed the 6  am to 9  am morning peak period but had a 4  pm to 7  pm evening peak period instead. Chen et al. [38] also employed peak and off-peak hour variables to investigate the influence of congestion and passenger load on bus emissions compared with passenger cars but they only collected data for weekdays. Chiou, Fu [39],Seedam et al. [6] only used 7  am to 9  am morning peak period variable in their study but the former used it to study behaviors of drivers with respect to congestion charges while the latter used it to investigate motorcycles impact on fuel consumption and emissions. Holguin-Veras et al. [40] in their study to report the results of a project that evaluated the effects of a pricing initiative on the behavior of passengers, used variables of weekday and weekend peak and off-peak period travels, and also employed a morning peak period of 6  am to 9  am and evening peak period of 4  pm to 7  pm. Their study was however focused on passenger behavioral changes. Ben-Elia, Ettema [41], also used peak periods in their research but used it to investigate a reward system for not commuting during peak hours of 6.30  am to 9.30  am. Yazici et al. [42] analyzed temporal travel variances between urban roads and highways and concluded that there is a variability of travel time patterns between urban roads and highways. They also used different vehicles for their analysis but did not specifically conclude on the relationship between these vehicle types and peak or off-peak hour travels. These previous studies have used only one or two road types in their investigations whereas our paper employs the choice of four (4) road types (secondary, primary, tertiary and motorway). Tarko, Perez-Cartagena [43] utilized temporal and spatial variables for their investigation on <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>factor</b> but used site to site analysis instead of the type of road we are using for the analysis. They concluded on the significance of spatial factor on <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>factor</b> variability, thus further endorsing the importance of our choice for road type as a variable for peak hour investigations.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} delay model for signalized intersections that is {{suitable}} for variable demand conditions. The model is applicable to {{the entire range of}} expected operations, including highly oversaturated conditions with initial queues {{at the start of the}} analysis period. The proposed model clarifies several issues related to the determination of the peak flow period, as well as the periods immediately preceding and following the peak. Separate formulas are provided for estimating delay in each of the designated flow periods as well as in the total flow period. Formulas are also provided to estimate the duration of the oversaturation period where applicable. The strength of the model lies in the use of simple rules for determining flow rates within and outside the peak, using the peak flow factor, a generalization of the well-known <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>factor</b> parameter. Simple rules are also provided for the identification of the location and duration of the peak flow period from observations of the demand profile. Such information is considered vital from an intersection design and evaluation viewpoint. Application of the model to a variety of operating conditions indicates that the estimated delay for vehicles arriving in the peak flow period is an acceptable predictor of the average delay incurred during the total flow period, even when oversaturation persists beyond the total flow period. On the other hand, the use of the average degree of saturation with no consideration of peaking can lead to significant underestimation of delay, particularly when operating at or near capacity conditions. These findings were confirmed by comparing the model results with other models found in the literature. The significant contribution of this work is not simply in the development of improved delay estimates, but, more important, in providing an integrated framework for an estimation process that incorporates (a) the peaking characteristics in the demand flow pattern, (b) the designation of flow-specific periods within the total flow period in accordance with the observed peaking and (c) the estimation of performance parameters associated within each flow period and in combination with other periods. A revised delay formula for the U. S. Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) is proposed. The revised formula has no constraints on the peak flow period degree of saturation, unlike the current HCM formula. It is also recommended that a simple formula for estimating the duration of oversaturation be used in conjunction with the revised delay formula. ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{farms and}} {{agricultural}} operations in rural Saskatchewan obtain water from rural water pipelines. These pipelines serve {{a small number}} of users spread over a large area, which results in large hydraulic residence times (HRT). The magnitude of the HRTs are a concern because of the degradation of water quality over time and the potential for biofilms to form in the pipeline. Biofilms have been reported to form even {{in the presence of a}} substantial chlorine residual, given time and substrate. The danger for users of these systems is that mature biofilms often have a diverse population of bacteria, some of which are reportedly opportunistic pathogens. Despite the widespread use of rural water pipelines, little is known about the hydraulic patterns and water quality variations in these systems. This study investigated both hydraulic and water quality variations and sampled sections of the two pipelines studied for the presence of biofilms. Of the two pipelines studied, one conveyed raw water, while the other was supplied treated water from a regional water treatment plant. The data collected over a period of approximately 16 months showed that average demand was highest in the winter months when many farmsteads were wintering cattle. However, peak hourly flow rates occurred in the late summer, typically August. The peak factors determined from the data showed a peak day factor of 1. 97 and a <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>factor</b> of 4. 53. Pressures in the extremities of the two networks studied were highly variable, sometimes reaching unacceptably low values during periods of high demand as a result of activity elsewhere in the network. Peak concentrations of organic carbon and epifluorescent bacteria and high chlorine decay typically coincided with the peak temperatures, occurring in August and September of each year. The recommended threshold values for biofilm control (BDOC 0. 1 mg/L, and temperature < 15 °C) were breached for only a portion of this period. The ground temperature, which varies throughout the year, is believed to greatly mitigate biofilm formation as water temperature in these branch networks rarely exceeded the threshold value and few viable organisms were recovered from the pipe samples during biofilm analysis. Hydraulic modelling was conducted to determine the HRT of the treated system and determine the chlorine decay coefficients (k). HRT values varied from 43 hours near the head of the branch network up to 241 hours at the Farpoint monitoring site. The model also showed another user (not part of the study) at an endpoint of the system may see HRTs as high as 585 hours. Average values of chlorine decay coefficients determined in the study for the sites monitored varied from 0. 3 /d to 0. 12 /d for residence times of 2. 2 days and 7. 8 days, respectively. The highest individual decay coefficient value coincided with peak temperatures and DOC concentrations. This value was calculated to be 0. 42 /d for an HRT of 2. 1 days. A mathematical relationship between DOC, temperature and chlorine decay coefficient could not be determined within the scope of this project...|$|E

To reduce congestion frequent car drivers are given a financial reward for reducing the proportion of trips that they make during <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> on a specific motorway section. Although previous studies show that employers are not eager to support mobility management measures, employers are nevertheless an important stakeholder. They can provide their employees with alternatives such as other travel times, work locations or travel modes and encourage their use. This paper investigates the attitudes of Dutch employers towards <b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> Avoidance. Exploring the factors that influence these attitudes may help to fully utilise employer support. The data from 103 employers were collected through a web questionnaire. A structural equation model on the employer support for <b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> Avoidance was estimated. The results demonstrate that the size of the organisation and sector only have an indirect effect on the support for <b>Peak</b> <b>Hour</b> Avoidance.
