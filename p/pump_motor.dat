25|$|A closed {{collection}} system has a barrier or diaphragm {{that separates the}} pump tubing from the horn. In this design, the suction of the <b>pump</b> <b>motor</b> lifts the diaphragm to create a vacuum within the collection system to extract milk. An open system allows for the free passage of air/suction. Bacteria and viral filters may be present to prevent any contamination or overflow into <b>pump</b> <b>motor.</b> The pump mechanism motor's suction is directly passed to the mothers breast versus indirectly with closed diaphragm systems.|$|E
25|$|When an open {{collection}} system is used, the pump’s suction can cause milk to overflow {{it into the}} {{collection system}} tubing, which may lead to milk particles being drawn into the <b>pump</b> <b>motor.</b> If milk leaks into the pump's tubing, the tubes should be washed, sterilized and air-dried prior to using the pump again. Failure to thoroughly clean collection tubing may lead to mold growth within the tubing. Some models of pumps have bacteria and overflow filters which prevent milk from entering the tubing.|$|E
2500|$|Hundreds {{of solar}} water pumping {{stations}} in Sudan fulfil a similar role, involving various applications of different systems for pumping and storage. Over the past 10 years approximately. 250 photovoltaic water pumps have been installed in Sudan. Considerable {{progress has been}} made and the present generation of systems appear to be reliable and cost–effective under certain conditions. A photovoltaic pumping system to pump 25 cubic metres per day requires a solar array of approx. 800 Wp. Such a pump would cost US$6000, since the total system comprises the cost of modules, <b>pump,</b> <b>motor,</b> pipework, wiring, control system and array support structure. PV water pumping has been promoted successfully in Kordofan state in Sudan. It shows favorable economics as compared to diesel pumps, and is free from the need to maintain a regular supply of fuel. The only maintenance problems with PV pumping [...] due to the breakdown of pumps and not the failure of the PV devices.|$|E

2500|$|The {{diaphragm}} in {{a closed}} system eliminates the possibility of milk being able to overflow into the pump tubing. Because milk is not exposed to the <b>pump</b> <b>motor,</b> closed collection systems are marketed as [...] more hygienic than open collection systems. It is important to clean the diaphragm as condensation or milk may reach this part causing bacterial contamination. If the diaphragm is contaminated this may defeat {{the purpose of the}} closed system. The barrier {{in a closed}} collection system breast pump is marketed as preventing outside air from contaminating the expressed breastmilk in the collection bottle, which preserves the milk’s purity. The diaphragm may limit the amount of air/suction {{that can be used to}} extract milk from the breast. It may also not be able to compensate for larger shield sizes as well. There are no studies comparing the open versus closed system design. Most information is marketing materials without studies to back them up.|$|E

5000|$|In {{hydraulic}} elevator systems, {{emergency power}} will lower the elevators {{to the lowest}} landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit. The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch. Typically, due to the high current draw when starting the <b>pump</b> <b>motor,</b> hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems. Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, {{the increasing use of}} current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as [...] "soft-start" [...] contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the <b>pump</b> <b>motor</b> is less of a limiting concern.|$|E

50|$|A {{hydrostatic}} drive {{consists of a}} hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor. Since positive displacement <b>pumps</b> and <b>motors</b> are used, one revolution of the <b>pump</b> or <b>motor</b> corresponds to a set volume of fluid flow that {{is determined by the}} displacement regardless of speed or torque. Speed is regulated by regulating the fluid flow with a valve or by changing the displacement of the <b>pump</b> or <b>motor.</b> Many different design variations have been used. A swash plate drive employs an axial piston <b>pump</b> and/or <b>motor</b> in which the swash plate angle can be changed to adjust the displacement and thus adjust the speed.|$|R

50|$|In {{most current}} top-loading washers, if the motor spins in one direction, the gearbox drives the {{agitator}}; if the motor spins the other way, the gearbox locks the agitator and spins {{the basket and}} agitator together.

50|$|On {{aircraft}} {{equipped with}} an auxiliary hydraulic pump, the hydraulic pump switch located at the lower centre of the instrument panel activates the auxiliary hydraulic pump to provide in-flight standby hydraulic pressure. A pressure switch will energize the pump if hydraulic pressure falls below a preset level and de-energize the pump when pressure returns to normal. A duty cycle of 3 minutes on and a cooling period of 20 minutes off is required to avoid overheating the <b>pump</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
