5000|$|As {{the firing}} order on an {{ordinary}} flat-four boxer engine [...] on 'L'eft and 'R'ight banks are LLRR or RRLL with each ignition (and thus exhaust) being 180 degrees apart. By counting two characters (2 x 180 =360) {{to the right}} of each 'L' or 'R', the cylinders that fire with 360 degree crankshaft rotational angle offset are shown to be located on opposite banks. If the exhaust manifold is designed to merge two exhaust ports on a bank into one exit as was common in the designs in the past, the <b>pulse</b> <b>spacing</b> becomes irregular, which causes uneven filling of intake into cylinders and the characteristic 'burble' of exhaust note on older flat-four engines. Subaru developed an [...] "equal lengths, even pulse spacing" [...] exhaust system with exhaust pipes connecting {{the left and the right}} banks for WRC competition in the 1990s, and incorporated this design into production Legacys in 2003, Foresters in 2005 and Imprezas in 2007. As a result, most Subaru flat-four engines no longer have the [...] "flat-four burble". The Impreza WRX and WRX STI still have unequal length exhaust pipes to feed the turbo sitting in the corner of the engine bay, and still have the characteristic burble. This was changed for the 2015 WRX which feeds a centrally mounted turbo, but the STI retained unequal length headers. They are, however, a somewhat popular aftermarket modification.|$|E
50|$|The cross-plane or two-plane {{crankshaft}} is {{the configuration}} used in most V8 road cars. The {{first and last}} of the four crank pins are at 180° with {{respect to each other}} as are the second and third, with each pair at 90° to the other, so that viewed from the end the crankshaft forms a cross. The cross-plane have half as strong (and twice as frequent) secondary vibration than flat-plane, but requires heavy counterweights on the crankshaft to counter Rocking Vibration caused by plane imbalances (See Engine balance for details). With the Secondary Vibration advantage, the cross-plane V8 can be scaled up to large displacements without causing destructive vibration. However, the use of heavy counterweights makes the cross-plane V8 a slow-revving engine that cannot speed up or slow down quickly compared to flat-plane because of the greater rotating mass. While the firing of the cross-plane V8 is evenly spaced overall, the firings on the 'L'eft and 'R'ight banks are LRLLRLRR or RLRRLRLL, resulting in uneven intake and exhaust <b>pulse</b> <b>spacing</b> for each bank. In stock cars with exhaust manifolds merging four exhaust ports into one exit, this results in uneven filling/scavenging of intake/exhaust gas in the cylinders (that prevents uniform combustion across cylinders) causing the typical V8 burble sound that many people have come to associate with American V8s. In all-out racing cars it leads to the need to connect exhaust pipes between the two banks to design an optimal exhaust system, resulting in the long exhaust pipes that resemble a bundle of snakes as in the Ford GT40. This complex and encumbering exhaust system has been a major problem for single-seater racing car designers, so they tended to use stub exhaust pipes in the 1950s, or place exhaust ports {{on the inside of the}} V angle as on the 4.2 L Ford Indy engine in Lotus 38.|$|E

40|$|Proton NMR {{relaxation}} rates (R 1 and R 2) {{were measured}} in aqueous solutions of sucrose, D-glucose and Dfructose with increasing concentration. The measurements {{were carried out}} using Bruker PC 20 NMR Process Analyzer. Inversion recovery and CPMG pulse sequences are used for the measurement of relaxation rates. Results show that the values of relaxation rate increase as the concentration of the sugar is increased. The relaxation rate appears to be higher for sucrose solutions as compared to glucose or D-fructose solutions. These results were discussed {{on the basis of}} molecular association between sugar and water molecules through hydrogen bonding. The water self diffusion coefficient was measured in these sugar solutions by using pulse field gradient NMR method. As expected, the water self-diffusion coefficient was reduced with increased sugar concentrations. The results of translational mobility exhibited a higher mobility for fructose than glucose or sucrose in aqueous solutions. The dependence of R 2 on the inter-pulse delay of the CPMG sequence gives information on the proton exchange mechanism involved. The mechanism of exchange was studied using R 2 with increasing inter pulse delay of 0. 05 – 2. 0 ms in aqueous solutions of 10 %, 20 % and 35 % (w/v) of the above sugar solutions. From the plots of relaxation rates (R 2) versus the 90 – 180 <b>pulse</b> <b>spacing</b> it was possible to calculate the proton exchange rate (kb) of the different sugar solutions.

Three characteristic parameters of two-dimensional solitary wave pattern, namely, inception length, primary <b>pulse</b> <b>spacing,</b> and propagation velocity, are examined, which are significant in engineering applications for estimation of heat and mass transfer on film flow. The present experimental data are well {{in agreement with the}} Koizumi correlations, the deviation from which is limited to 20 % and 15 %, respectively, for primary <b>pulse</b> <b>spacing</b> and propagation velocity.
