40|$|The {{significance}} of operator variation and {{the angle of}} illumination in acquired imagery is analyzed for lineament analysis. Five operators analyzed a LANDSAT image and four photographs of a <b>plastic</b> <b>relief</b> <b>map</b> illuminated at a low angle from varying directions of the Prescott, Arizona region. Significant {{differences were found in}} both number and length of the lineaments recognized by the different investigators for the images. The actual coincidence of lineaments recognized by the investigators for the same image is exceptionally low. Even the directional data on lineament orientation is significantly different from operator to operator and from image to image. Cluster analysis of the orientation data displays a clustering by operators rather than by images. It is recommended that extreme caution be taken before attempting to compare different investigators' results in lineament analysis...|$|E
25|$|Near the {{entrance}} to the crypt is a museum containing many relics gathered from the battle fields of the Asiago plateau, as well as related documents and photographs from the time period of the war. The museum has a <b>plastic</b> model <b>relief</b> <b>map</b> of the Asiago plateau providing a visual depiction of the events that unfolded there. The left side of the museum focuses on the events of {{the first two years of}} the war, 1915-1916, and the right side documents the happenings of 1917-1918. The museum also houses a small cinema hall, and video-documentaries may be viewed there upon request.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 ﻿This project {{presents}} a new, and more versatile, method for performing <b>Relief</b> <b>Mapping</b> (also known as Parallax Occlusion Mapping), utilizing rates {{of change in}} texture coordinates across a polygon surface to calculate the texture sampling offsets used in the ray-tracing portion of the <b>Relief</b> <b>Mapping</b> algorithm. This new technique relies solely upon the texture-coordinates, vertex-coordinates, and a depth-map texture, allowing <b>Relief</b> <b>Mapping</b> to be utilized on complex meshes {{without the need for}} additional per-polygon information such as texture-aligned tangents or normal maps...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{improves}} per-pixel displacement mapping algorithms. First {{we review}} the previous work including bump, parallax, and <b>relief</b> <b>mapping,</b> and also sphere tracing. Then we propose a new iterative algorithm based on parallax mapping, which {{takes into account}} the surface slope represented by the stored normal vector. We show that the new method is much better than parallax mapping, however a little poorer than <b>relief</b> <b>mapping,</b> in terms of image quality. However, it is much faster than <b>relief</b> <b>mapping,</b> and is thus a good candidate for implementation in games. Displacement mapping, GPU, texture map-Keywords: ping...|$|R
40|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>maps</b> are {{three-dimensional}} {{representations of}} the Earth’s surface. In contrast to traditional 2 D <b>maps,</b> where the <b>relief</b> is represented indirectly, the <b>relief</b> <b>maps</b> are intended for direct representation of the relief. Such way of relief presentation is simpler and easier to understand for ordinary users. In the article, {{the preparation of the}} editorial plan is described and the possible methods of elaboration of <b>relief</b> <b>maps</b> are presented. The method described has been used for elaboration of an insert of a <b>relief</b> <b>map</b> of the Pomurje region at horizontal scale 1 : 30, 000 and at vertical scale 1 : 15, 000. The work process is divided into four phases, following in time and building one upon another: elaboration of a convex aluminium mould, thermo-vacuum process of reproduction, printing, and composition of basic elements...|$|R
40|$|Relief impostors {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a compact and high-quality representation for high-frequency detail in 3 D models. In this paper we propose an algorithm to represent a complex object through {{the combination of a}} reduced set of <b>relief</b> <b>maps.</b> These <b>relief</b> <b>maps</b> can be rendered with very few artifacts and no apparent deformation from any view direction. We present an efficient algorithm to optimize the set of viewing planes supporting the <b>relief</b> <b>maps,</b> and an image-space metric to select a sufficient subset of <b>relief</b> <b>maps</b> for each view direction. Selected maps (typically three) are rendered based on the well-known ray-height-field intersection algorithm implemented on the GPU. We discuss several strategies to merge overlapping <b>relief</b> <b>maps</b> while minimizing sampling artifacts and to reduce extra texture requirements. We show that our representation can maintain the geometry and the silhouette of a large class of complex shapes with no limit in the viewing direction. Since the rendering cost is output sensitive, our representation can be used to build a hierarchical model of a 3 D scene. Postprint (published version...|$|R
