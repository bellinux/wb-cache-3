30|$|Rate-limiting {{processes}} {{and the degree}} of disequilibrium of a metamorphic reaction are crucial factors in the devolatilization and/or hydration of the Earth’s crust. The release and consumption of fluids, such as water-rich fluids and melts, have a critical influence on the evolution of mountain building and the transport of energy and materials in the crust. Many studies have assessed the rate-limiting processes for metamorphic reactions (e.g., Ague and Carlson 2013, Walther and Wood 1984). The following three types of rate-limiting processes have been recognized (e.g., Fisher 1978): 1) interface-controlled, 2) diffusion-controlled, and 3) heat-flow-controlled. The formation of garnet {{is one of the most}} common devolatilization reactions in the crust (e.g., Ague and Carlson 2013), and diffusion-controlled processes are widely applied to garnet-forming reactions, including the nucleation and growth of the garnet (e.g., Carlson 1989) and Ostwald ripening (Miyazaki 1991, 1996). Although Carlson (1989) and Miyazaki (1991) both assumed a diffusion-controlled process, the degree of disequilibrium differed in their models. In particular, the degree of disequilibrium for the nucleation and growth model is much higher than that for Ostwald ripening. Even if the rate-limiting processes were governed by diffusion, the degree of disequilibrium should directly affect the reaction rate and the patterns of metamorphic textures. The growth of a metamorphic mineral at a low degree of disequilibrium (i.e., a system close to equilibrium, implying a small overstep from the equilibrium temperature and a low degree of supersaturation for the metamorphic reaction) may result in an equigranular metamorphic texture because interfacial energy becomes an important control on crystal morphology and size. On the other hand, growth at a high degree of disequilibrium with a limited number of nuclei may result in a <b>porphyroblastic</b> <b>texture.</b> However, diffusion-controlled growth of a mineral at a high degree of disequilibrium is likely to involve diffusional instability and may lead to highly irregular and branched morphologies. In this paper, I examine the diffusional instability of garnet porphyroblasts (Tsukuba metamorphic rocks, central Japan) that grew in a diffusion-controlled regime.|$|E
40|$|Rocks {{associated}} with an orogenic gold system in the Paleoproterozoic Granites/Tanami Inlier of northern Australia exhibit strong natural remanent magnetism, identifiable in regional aeromagnetic data. Petrographical analysis indicates the two dominant magnetic minerals in the rocks of this region are multidomain magnetite and monoclinic pyrrhotite. Chemical analysis using an electron microprobe has determined that the magnetite and pyrrhotite are stoichiometrically pure, without significant elemental substitution. Alternating field demagnetization, Curie Temperature, and hysteresis analysis indicates that the remanently magnetized phase is monoclinic pyrrhotite with low magnetic susceptibility. In contrast, multidomain magnetites lack remanence and have high magnetic susceptibilities. Pyrrhotite is preserved in the rock mass along with other sulfide minerals as millimeter-scale veins parallel to regionally developed, penetrative mylonitic shear bands (c-planes) formed during sulfide remobilization in the waning, cooling stages of hydrothermal Au deposition. In contrast, magnetite grains exhibit <b>porphyroblastic</b> <b>textures,</b> consistent with formation during prograde to peak metamorphism, indicating formation prior to pyrrhotite, earlier in the orogenic cycle. Because of the low Curie Temperature (ca. 325 °C) of pyrrhotite, it is therefore likely that remanent magnetization effects observed in aeromagnetic images of the Tanami Inlier, are {{associated with}} structures intimately related to the late stages of Au mineralization during retrograde greenschist metamorphism after the peak thermal point of the orogenic cycle.

40|$|The tectono-metamorphic {{evolution}} of the Hercynian intermediate–upper crust outcropping in eastern Sila (Calabria, Italy) has been reconstructed, integrating microstructural analysis, P–T pseudosections, mineral isopleths and geochronological data. The studied rocks belong to a nearly complete crustal section that comprises granulite facies metamorphic rocks at the base and granitoids in the intermediate levels. Clockwise P–T paths have been constrained for metapelites of the basal level of the intermediate– upper crust (Umbriatico area). These rocks show noticeable <b>porphyroblastic</b> <b>textures</b> documenting the progressive change from medium-P metamorphic assemblages (garnet- and staurolite-bearing assem- blages) towards low-P ⁄ high-T metamorphic assemblages (fibrolite- and cordierite-bearing assemblages). Peak-metamorphic conditions of ∼ 590 °C and 0. 35 GPa are estimated by integrating microstructural observations with P–T pseudosections calculated for bulk-rock and reaction-domain compositions. The top level of the intermediate–upper crust (Campana area) recorded only the major heating phase at low- P (∼ 550 °C and 0. 25 GPa), as documented by the static growth of biotite spots and of cordierite and andalusite porphyroblasts in metapelites. In situ U–Th–Pb dating of monazite from schists containing low-P ⁄ high-T metamorphic assemblages gave a weighted mean U–Pb concordia age of 299 ± 3 Ma, which has been interpreted as the timing of peak metamorphism. In {{the framework of the}} whole Hercynian crustal section the peak of low-P ⁄ high-T metamorphism in the intermediate-to-upper crust took place concurrently with granulite facies metamorphism in the lower crust and with emplacement of the granitoids in the intermediate levels. In addition, decompression is a distinctive trait of the P–T evolution both in the lower and upper crust. It is proposed that post–collisional extension, together with exhumation, is the most suitable tectonic setting in which magmatic and metamorphic processes can be active simultaneously in different levels of the continental crust...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{trace element}} data for {{minerals}} in the Zhimafang lherzolite and Xugou harzburgites from the Donghai {{area of the}} Sulu UHP terrane are presented. The Zhimafang lherzolite and the Xugou harzburgite have <b>porphyroblastic</b> and equigranular <b>textures</b> respectively, and consist of olivine (Fo 90. 6 – 92. 4), enstatite (En 92. 0 – 92. 7), garnet (Prp 63. 2 – 87. 1) and diopside (Mg# 90. 8 – 95. 7) with additional minor phlogopite. Garnets from both peridotites have low LREE and show negative Ce anomalies, but Zhimafang garnet has higher HREE abundance ((HREE) n = 8 –l 5) than Xugou garnet ((HREE) n = 2 – 6). Diopsides from both peridotites have low abundances of Yb, Y and Ti, and low Ti/Eu (517 – 1158), but high and variable Sr/Nd (4800 – 22, 000) and (La/Yb) n (40 – 100). The petrographic and geochemical characteristics suggest that the Donghai garnet peridotites were subjected to metasomatism caused by silicate-rich melts with both carbonate and hydrous components. Several episodes of metasomatism may have occurred, given the complex evolution these bodies must have undergone in the mantle and crust. The differences in mineral chemistry (such as the Ni content and Mg# of olivine, and the Y, Al, HREE, Nd/Y and Sc/Y of garnet) between Zhimafang and Xugou peridotites suggest that they are derived from a heterogeneous mantle, and the Zhimafang lherzolite was less depleted than the Xugou harzburgite. Probably {{they have had a}} different evolutionary history prior to insert into the subducted continental slab. 17 page(s...|$|R
