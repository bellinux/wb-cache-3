40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Kisiju-Pwani village, Mkuranga District in Tanzania. It was conducted from the on-going project on sustainable energy system for the provision of rural electrification services under PITRO. This project is a min grid photovoltaic system, producing and distributing solar electricity to around 68 households and lighting the village streets with street lights. The study aimed at analysing the contribution and effectiveness of PV solar electricity on rural livelihood transformation, together with <b>people</b> <b>s</b> sense of project ownership, perceptions and attitude over the effectiveness of PV solar electricity on their livelihood transformation. It went further to establishing the grounds at which <b>people</b> <b>s</b> attitude over the project was based. From this study, it was found that Photovoltaic solar electricity project had impacted <b>people</b> <b>s</b> lives in Kisiju-Pwani in terms of creating opportunities for the entire population in the village, education and health improvement, women conditions improvement, security improvement and employment to mention but a few. The {{study was conducted}} and analysed in the light of Amartya Sen s Capability Approach focusing on <b>people</b> <b>s</b> capability and freedom expansion to live a good life.

If completely true, this hypothesis would have radical implications for tax, transfer, and entitlements policy. For example, unless modified by other information, it would suggest replacing the income tax with a consumption tax, establishing lifetime income averaging, viewing Social Security as irrelevant other than as a system for transferring lifetime resources between individuals, and dramatically changing welfare law to base aid purely on <b>people</b> <b>s</b> lifetime income, as distinct from their current circumstances. However, incomplete markets and departures from rational behavior, by shortening <b>people</b> <b>s</b> planning horizons, weaken some of permanent income s implications and refute others...|$|R

40|$|Gene-based {{vaccines}} as {{typified by}} plasmid DNA vaccines and recombinant viral-vectored vaccines are expected as promising solutions against infectious diseases {{for which no}} effective prophylactic vaccines exist such as HIV, dengue virus, Ebola virus and malaria, and for which more improved vaccines are needed such as tuberculosis and influenza virus. Although many preclinical and clinical trials have been conducted to date, no DNA vaccines or recombinant viral-vectored vaccines expressing heterologous antigens for human use have yet been licensed in the U. <b>S.,</b> <b>Europe</b> or Japan. In this research, we describe the current regulatory context for gene-based prophylactic vaccines against infectious disease in the U. <b>S.,</b> <b>Europe,</b> and Japan. We identify the important considerations, in particular, on the preclinical assessments that would allow these vaccines to proceed to clinical trials, and the differences on the regulatory pathway for the marketing authorization in each region...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} how the {{business}} and interest rate cycles in developed countries affect FDI to developing countries. After aggregating flows into three big source areas (the U. <b>S.,</b> <b>Europe</b> and Japan), we find FDI flows to be countercyclical with respect to both output and interest rate cycles in the first two, whereas in Japan they display either no cyclical behavior or mild procyclical behavior. This {{finding is consistent with}} the fact that FDI outflows and local investment tend to move in opposite directions during the cycles in the U. <b>S.</b> and <b>Europe,</b> reflecting investors' arbitrage among different investment opportunities. In sum, and contrary to what is usually claimed, we conclude that recessions in industrial countries are likely to increase FDI flows, particularly to those countries with close ties with the U. <b>S.</b> and <b>Europe...</b>|$|R
