40|$|OBJECTIVE — There {{is limited}} {{information}} from large-scale prospective studies regarding {{the prediction of}} type 1 diabetes by specific types of pancreatic islet autoantibodies, either alone or in combination. Thus, we studied {{the extent to which}} specific autoantibodies are <b>predictive</b> of <b>type</b> 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Two cohorts were derived from the first screening for islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) in the Diabetes Prevention Trial–Type 1 (DPT- 1). Autoantibodies to GAD 65 (GAD 65), insulinoma-associated antigen- 2 (ICA 512), and insulin (micro-IAA [mIAA]) were also measured. Participants were followed for the occurrence of type 1 diabetes. One cohort (Questionnaire) included those who did not enter the DPT- 1 trials, but responded to questionnaires (n � 28, 507, 2. 4 % ICA �). The other cohort (Trials) included DPT- 1 participants (n � 528, 83. 3 % ICA �). RESULTS — In both cohorts autoantibody number was highly <b>predictive</b> of <b>type</b> 1 diabetes (P � 0. 001). The Questionnaire cohort was used to assess prediction according to the type of autoantibody.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new speaker-dependent coding {{algorithm}} to efficiently compress a large speech database for corpus-based concatenative text-to-speech (TTS) engines while maintaining high fidelity. To achieve a high compression ratio {{and meet the}} fundamental requirements of concatenative TTS synthesizers, such as partial segment decoding and random access capability, we adopt a nonpredictive analysis-by-synthesis scheme for speaker-dependent parameter estimation and quantization. The spectral coefficients are quantized by using a memoryless split vector quantization (VQ) approach that does not use frame correlation. Considering that excitation signals of a specific speaker show low intra-variation especially in the voiced regions, the conventional adaptive codebook for pitch prediction {{is replaced by a}} speaker-dependent pitch-pulse codebook trained by a corpus of single-speaker speech signals.

In this way the large group of non-English-speaking disabled citi-zens will be supported in living a more independent and self determined life. ...|$|E
40|$|Periodical {{stimulation}} of the otoliths during linear horizontal displacement leads not only to motion and displacement perception {{but also to the}} “Hilltop Illusion”, which is the perception of being transported not on an earth-horizontal path, but over a small hill. This phenomenon is explained by the partial reinterpretation of the linear acceleration to a tilt of the gravitational vertical. The dynamics of the illusion and its role in the perception of spatial orientation were investigated for eight frequencies. The subjects were exposed to sinusoidal linear acceleration and had to dynamically adjust a luminous line display to their subjective vertical. This served as a quantitative indicator of the amount of perceived tilt with respect to gravity. The high fre-quency part (0. 1 - 0. 33 Hz) of the experiment was performed on a conventional linear accelera-tion device (sled), the low frequency part (0. 0083 - 0. 05 Hz) on the sled centrifuge (a rotating sled). The amplitude ratio of the settings of the subjective vertical were found to be similar to that of a lowpass with a 15 s time constant. However, the phase shifts never exceeded a 40 ° lag, which together with other experimental results led to the conclusion that a non-linear, possibly <b>predictive</b> <b>type</b> of information processing must be at work.

The collocation-based module exploits this kind of topical/semantic relatedness by relying on statistics about the co-occurrence of words within a large window of text in the training corpus.

40|$|Mobile {{devices such}} as cell phones and PDAs present unique {{challenges}} and opportunities. The challenge is that user interaction is limited by small screens and keyboards (if the device has them at all!). Naive transfer of applications from full-size computers often fails because the interaction becomes too cumbersome for the user. The opportunity is that, because the device is carried by the user at all times and used in a much wider range of situations than a desk-bound computer, new possibilities emerge to provide intelligent and appropriate assistance to the user in a just-in-time fashion. We aim to address these challenges and opportunities by giving portable devices Commonsense Knowledge [...] a large collection of simple facts about people and everyday life. Common Sense can {{reduce the need for}} explicit user input because the machine can make better guesses about what the user might want in a particular situation than could a conventional application.

30|$|The {{optimization}} {{approach can}} be elaborated to consider additional characteristics of keyboard function. For example, a popular approach is to enable <b>predictive</b> <b>typing,</b> where the keyboard monitors what is typed and presents a list of options and the user can select a full word after entering the first few letters. Such a feature carries {{both positive and negative}} aspects for users of switch keyboards. On the positive side, it may require entering fewer characters to type common words and thereby it may speed communication. On the negative side, navigating to the list of choices requires the user to guide the cursor to the list (either with a linear cursor path or in a hierarchical structure). There is, of course, a risk of a selection error when trying to reach an item in the prediction list, and an error in that context may alter the list and thereby render the system rather difficult to work with. If a prediction system is part of a keyboard, then {{there is a need to}} optimize its design within the keyboard, and the approach we have presented here can be modified to provide such optimization. Similarly, it is important to consider how users would correct errors with a switch keyboard. Error correction with a switch keyboard using a delete or undo command can only be initiated by the user guiding the cursor to an appropriate action key. To correct past text, switch keyboards have action keys that move a marker in the text (e.g., up a line or down a page). Some switch keyboards also allow for control of mouse actions (movement, hold, drag, select, stop, click, and double-click commands), which can be used to fix errors, among other things. Such command keys should also be optimized according to their frequency of use for a given user.|$|E

To use acceleration signals {{there are at least}} two approaches: direct use in a feedback loop to improve the tracking error, and indirect use by an observer to improve the estimates of position and speed. Several proposals for the use of the acceleration in a feedback loop, resulting in slightly different controllers, are discussed. The design of the controllers for the experimental system, a flexible multiple degrees-of-freedom XY-table, uses a simplified two degrees-of-freedom model. The observer is of the <b>predictive</b> <b>type</b> to compensate for the time delay in the implementation, and its design is based in part on Kalman filter theory. Simulations and experiments show that both acceleration feedback and an acceleration assisted observer can improve the performance of the control system, but the robustness does not change significantly. A combination of both approaches did not give any improvement in the experiments, but some in the simulations. Disturbances in the acceleration signal (especially motor torque ripple), phase lag introduced by the signal processing equipment, time delay caused by the sampled data implementation of the controller and observer, and the non-colocated position and acceleration sensors are believed to be limitations for the usefulness of the acceleration signal. A performance improvement up to a factor of 1. 5 was possible in the author's application, so to consider the use of acceleration measurements in tracking control is recommended...|$|R

40|$|Navigation and {{guidance}} of autonomous vehicles {{is a fundamental}} problem in robotics, which has attracted intensive research in recent decades. This report is mainly concerned with provable collision avoidance of multiple autonomous vehicles operating in unknown cluttered environments, using reactive decentralized navigation laws, where obstacle information is supplied by some sensor system. Recently, robust and decentralized variants of model predictive control based navigation systems have been applied to vehicle navigation problems. Properties such as provable collision avoidance under disturbance and provable convergence to a target have been shown; however these often require significant computational and communicative capabilities, and don't consider sensor constraints, making real time use somewhat difficult. There {{also seems to be}} opportunity to develop a better trade-off between tractability, optimality, and robustness. The main contributions of this work are as follows; firstly, the integration of the robust model predictive control concept with reactive navigation strategies based on local path planning, which is applied to both holonomic and unicycle vehicle models subjected to acceleration bounds and disturbance; secondly, the extension of model <b>predictive</b> control <b>type</b> methods to situations where the information about the obstacle is limited to a discrete ray-based sensor model, for which provably safe, convergent boundary following can be shown; and thirdly the development of novel constraints allowing decentralized coordination of multiple vehicles using a robust model <b>predictive</b> control <b>type</b> approach, where a single communication exchange is used per control update, vehicles are allowed to perform planning simultaneously, and coherency objectives are avoided.
