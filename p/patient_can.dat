5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having trouble breathing, but ensuring that the airway is patent so that the <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> breathe is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open airway and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure the airway, {{may be used to}} bypass a disruption in the airway in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the trachea may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) laryngoscopy may threaten the airway, so alternative techniques to visualize the airway, such as fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy, may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper trachea is injured, an incision can be made in the trachea (tracheotomy) or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open airway. However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the trachea is lacerated below the site of the artificial airway. Tracheotomy is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the trachea and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient airway, or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be used—blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E

40|$|Already {{before the}} {{occurrence}} of pathological symptoms {{in the development of}} severe diseases changes in the proteome pattern in the plasma of <b>patients</b> <b>can</b> be observed. Therefore, to follow these pathological changes, plasma samples from several time points should be analysed before clinical symptoms arise. Future <b>patients</b> <b>can</b> be statistically expected within the pool of periodical blood donors.

25|$|In elderly {{patients}} with displaced or intracapsular fractures many surgeons prefer {{to undertake a}} hemiarthroplasty, replacing the broken part of the bone with a metal implant. The advantage is that the <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> mobilize without having to wait for healing.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} using a {{specific}} collagen type II biomarker from {{the breakdown of}} articular cartilage is {{that the amount of}} cartilage is reduced (worn away) over time with progression of the disease so a <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> eventually have very advanced osteoarthritis with none of this biomarker detectable in their urine. Another problem with a systemic biomarker is that a <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> have osteoarthritis in multiple joints at different stages of disease at the same time, so the biomarker source cannot be determined. Some other collagen breakdown products in the synovial fluid correlated with each other after acute injuries (a known cause of secondary osteoarthritis) but did not correlate with the severity of the injury.|$|E
50|$|Infantile Refsum {{disease is}} a {{developmental}} brain disorder. In addition, <b>patients</b> <b>can</b> show a reduction in central nervous system (CNS) myelin (particularly cerebral), which {{is referred to as}} (hypomyelination).

50|$|The {{standard}} of care for mucinous adenocarcinoma with clinical condition PMP involves cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), by surgical oncologists who specialize in treating PMP. Some surgeons also apply early post-operative intraperitonial chemotherapy (EPIC), adjunct to surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC. In situations where surgery is not required immediately, <b>patients</b> <b>can</b> be monitored via CT scans, tumor marker laboratory tests, and physical symptoms, to determine when, and if, surgery is warranted. Although some surgical procedures may be rather extensive, <b>patients</b> <b>can</b> and do recover from surgery, {{and the majority of}} these <b>patients</b> <b>can</b> and do live productive lives.|$|R

25|$|For the {{treatment}} of trauma patients every minute counts. Patients with severe bleedings after car accidents, explosions, gunshot wounds or aortic dissections, etc. need immediate care due to the life-threatening blood loss. In a hybrid operating room both open and endovascular treatment of the <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> be performed. For example, {{the tension in the}} brain due to a severe haemorrhage can be relieved and the aneurysm can be coiled. The concept of placing the emergency patient on an operating table as soon as he/she enters the hospital, if stable perform a trauma scan in the CT or if instable immediate procedure in the hybrid operating room without having to reposition the <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> save valuable time and reduce risk of further injury.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{intravenous}} preparation available, {{but it is}} irritant to veins, causing phlebitis. Most people {{absorb the}} drug extremely well after taking it orally, so, if a <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> swallow, {{there is not much}} need to administer it intravenously, even if used to treat endocarditis (infection of the heart chambers).|$|E
25|$|Utilizing Space and Position - Hypnosis {{and therapy}} are {{experienced}} subjectively by the patient, and {{any part of}} their total experience {{can be used to}} reinforce an idea.

25|$|Care in {{choice of}} {{medicine}} by the prescribing physician, along with {{and the provision}} of greater information to the <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> improve compliance. For example, patients taking typical antipsychotics tend to experience more severe side-effects, and also receive less information about their illness, medicines and side-effects. They were naturally more likely to be non-compliant than those receiving atypicals.|$|E
25|$|In {{most states}} in the US, a {{judicial}} order following a formal hearing is needed before a <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> be forced to undergo involuntary ECT. However, ECT can also be involuntarily administered in situations with less immediate danger. Suicidal intent is a common justification for its involuntary use, especially when other treatments are ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Opioids are {{contraindicated}} as a first-line {{treatment for}} headache because they impair alertness, bring risk of dependence, {{and increase the}} risk that episodic headaches will become chronic. Opioids can also cause heightened sensitivity to headache pain. When other treatments fail or are unavailable, opioids may be appropriate for treating headache if the <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> be monitored to prevent the development of chronic headache.|$|E

25|$|If the <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> be led {{to accept}} one suggestion, they will more readily accept others. With {{resistant}} patients, it becomes necessary to find a suggestion that they can accept. Resistance is always important, and should always be respected, so if the resistance itself is encouraged, the patient is made to feel more comfortable, {{because they know that}} they are allowed to respond however they wish.|$|E
25|$|The {{recovery}} {{after the}} surgery typically requires only mild pain relief. Post-operatively, a surgical dressing is required for several days and compression vest for a month following the procedure. A check-up appointment is carried out after a week for puncture of seroma. If the surgery has minimal complications, the <b>patient</b> <b>can</b> resume normal activities quickly, returning to work after 15 days and participating in any sporting activities after three months.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{problem with}} antidepressants {{is the chance}} of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with bipolar disorder.

Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20–40% of bipolar patients. For bipolar depression, antidepressants (most frequently SSRIs) can exacerbate or trigger symptoms of hypomania and mania.|$|E
