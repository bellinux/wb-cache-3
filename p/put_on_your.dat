500|$|The {{trend in}} {{improved}} graphics continued {{well into the}} next release, Age of Empires III, much to the delight of reviewers. IGN stated, [...] "After seeing the screenshots, our jaws hit the floor at the amount of detail." [...] 1UP.com described Age of Empires III as [...] "one of the most beautiful games you will <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> computer for the foreseeable future." [...] GameSpy agreed, stating, [...] "Age IIIs graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre." [...] Age of Empires III builds on and introduces new features to the prior release, Age of Mythology, such as the inclusion of the award-winning Havok physics simulation middleware game engine for the Windows version and PhysX for the Mac OS X. The innovative result is that pre-created animations are avoided; instead events are calculated according to the physics engine. Consequently, views of events like building destruction and tree felling are not pre-recorded. GameSpot also admired the graphics in the fourth release but complained about [...] "the awkward unit behavior." [...] Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E
