40|$|Abstract: The project “Company Network Architecture ” is a {{scenario}} {{of a company}} which has its branches spread across India. Through this project we have configured five branches of a company with their respective headquarters. In the North region we have configured two branches i. e. Delhi and Chandigarh with their headquarters named, the North Headquarter. In the South region we have configured three branches i. e. Bangalore, Chennai and Pune with their headquarters named, the South Headquarter. Sub Netting has been done across all the branches which relieve us if purchasing new IP addresses for all the branches. This will help in the reduction of cost. All the branches are divided into three departments that are: Marketing, Sales and Finance. Virtual Private Network (VPN) connectivity is applied in order to conduct private data communication which uses the public network like the Internet rather than rely on <b>private</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines.</b> We have also configured the Virtual LAN as a security measure. VLAN (Virtual LAN) will allow only the same departments of different branches {{to communicate with each}} other. It makes sure that no person from one department accesses the other department, thus providing security. We have also configured the Access Control List (ACL) which denies the services mentioned in the list...|$|R

50|$|Network {{providers}} commonly implement Frame Relay for voice (VoFR) {{and data}} as an encapsulation technique used between local area networks (LANs) {{over a wide}} area network (WAN). Each end-user gets a <b>private</b> <b>line</b> (or <b>leased</b> <b>line)</b> to a Frame Relay node. The Frame Relay network handles the transmission over a frequently changing path transparent to all end-user extensively used WAN protocols. It is less expensive than <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> {{and that is one}} reason for its popularity. The extreme simplicity of configuring user equipment in a Frame Relay network offers another reason for Frame Relay's popularity.|$|R
40|$|An Internet-based virtual {{private network}} uses the open, {{distributed}} infrastructure of the Internet to transmit data between corporate sites. VPNs using the Internet {{have the potential to}} solve many of the business networking problems. Virtual Private Networks provide an economical yet secure way to connect sites together and to provide network access to remote users. Virtual Private Networks provide attractive solution. A VPN uses the Internet infrastructure to interconnect sites and provide connectivity for remote dial-up users. The nearly universal coverage of the Internet eliminates the need for <b>private</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> and modem pools, and it eliminates long distance telephone charges remote, dial-up users. VPNs are less costly than conventional wide area networks. A VPN operates by passing data over the Internet or corporate intranet through “tunnels” which are secure, encrypted virtual connections that use the Internet (or corporate intranet) as the connection medium. The VPN establishes tunnels between servers in a site-to-site VPN, and between clients and servers in a client-to site VPN. The VPN encrypts and encapsulates each IP (or IPX) packet before passing it through a tunnel. The encapsulated packet includes authentication information to ensure the authenticity of the data and its source. The VPN also uses the authentication information to check that the original data has not been corrupted during transmission, ensuring the integrity of the data...|$|R
25|$|The Internet allows {{computer}} users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, {{depending on the}} requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, but the cost of <b>private</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps {{on the other side of}} the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Business have {{traditionally}} relied on <b>private</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> to link remote office {{together so that}} distant workers could share information over a Wide Area Network (WAN). However, while providing {{a high degree of}} privacy, <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> are expensive to set up and maintain. The Internet is fast becoming a requirement for supporting business operations in the global economy. The major concern in using a public network, like the Internet, for data exchange is the lack of security. The Internet was designed to be an "open" network, accessible to anyone with low or none security consideration. Virtual Private Networks (VPN) using Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) has emerged as a relatively inexpensive way to solve this problem. The primary objective of this dissertation is to evaluate validity and accuracy issues in electronic commerce using VPN as a secure medium for data communication and transport over the Internet. The inherent control features of PPTP were mapped to data communication control objectives and the control models show how these address validity, completeness and accuracy. After analysing and evaluating the inherent control features of PPTP, the overall result is that: PPTP enables a valid communication link to be established with restricted access (validity); the PPTP communication link remains private for the full time of the connection (validity); data can be sent accurately and completely over the PPTP connection and remains accurate during transmission (accuracy); and all data sent is completely received by the receiver (accuracy). By deploying a Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol for virtual private networking, management can mitigate the risk of transmitting private company and business data over the Internet. The PPTP analysis and evaluation models developed intend to give the auditor a control framework to apply in practice. If the auditor needs to perform a data communication review and finds that a virtual private network has been established using PPTP, the control models can assist in providing knowledge and audit evidence regarding validity and accuracy issues. The auditor should however, not review PPTP in isolation. Validity and accuracy control features inherent to TCP/IP and PPP should also be considered as well as controls on higher levels, e. g. built-in application controls...|$|R
40|$|Many large {{companies}} and governmental agencies transmit a large quantity of long distance communications between facilities. Most {{of these organizations}} reduce the expense of transmitting these communications by <b>leasing</b> <b>private</b> telephone <b>lines</b> instead of using commercial long distance. The monthly expense of <b>leasing</b> telephone <b>lines</b> between two facilities depends upon the number of <b>lines</b> <b>leased</b> and the air miles between facilities; it is independent of usage. For this analysis, the number of <b>lines</b> <b>leased</b> between two facilities is called a link, and the aggregate of all the links leased by an organization is called a network. This paper presents a technique to determine the optimal number of <b>lines</b> to be <b>leased</b> on each link, subject to a limit on the network expense.

50|$|The ANX Network is {{a secure}} private network that uses standard, open Internet {{protocols}} but carries all traffic over <b>private</b> <b>lines</b> <b>leased</b> from various carriers. Through IPsec and end-to-end encryption, the ANX Network provides secure service to its customers {{like that of}} a typical VPN. Where it’s different from a typical VPN is that the routers that make up the network check every packet to make sure it comes from an IP address on the private network. Thus, nobody but customers can get into the network. Triple DES encryption protects a customer’s data from the potential malicious behavior of another customer.|$|R

40|$|Wireline {{backbone}} {{networks have}} evolved to support many different end-user bandwidth services, including <b>private</b> <b>leased</b> <b>lines,</b> packet voice, high-definition packet video, virtual private networks (VPN), etc. From a functional perspective, these networks are usually comprised of different technology layers and segmented into multiple domains, each managed by its own authority and operating under its own policy. However, as business/mission-critical demands and stringencies continue to grow, there is a pressing need to improve network/service survivability (reliability) across multiple operating domains. Indeed, {{this is a very}} challenging problem owing to the obvious scalability and confidentiality limitations across domain boundaries. As a result, multidomain survivability schemes must be able to operate in a distributed, decentralized manner. In addition, new recovery provisions are also needed to handle large-scale “catastrophic” events causing multiple correlated failures, e. g., natural disasters, power outages, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks. Overall, a wide range of survivability solutions have been developed over the years, albeit mostly focusing on single domain settings. Broadly, these schemes can be classified as pre-provisioned protection and post-fault restoration type strategies. Namely, the former types offer fast recovery and single-failure resiliency guarantees via the pre-allocation of backup resources. Meanwhile, the latter offer more latent nondeterministic recovery via post-fault path re-routing. In general, both of these strategies can be extended across domain boundaries to achieve multi-domain service recovery. However, most existing proposals in this space only study protection-based approaches and do not incorporate end-to-end resource efficiency or backup diversity concerns. Further treatments for multi-failure recovery are also lacking. In light of the above, this dissertation proposes a range of solutions to improve distributed multi-domain survivability. First, a new protection scheme is proposed to achieve improved end-to-end path pair diversity (resiliency) with reduced routing overheads. This solution is then augmented with probabilistic considerations to handle more challenging multi-failure scenarios, i. e., as arising during catastrophic events. In particular, this solution incorporates both resource efficiency and failure risk mitigation concerns. Finally, a novel post-fault restoration scheme is proposed to achieve multidomain failure recovery using joint intra-/inter-domain crankback signaling. The performance of all of these proposed solutions is also evaluated using discrete event simulation and appropriate comparisons made versus existing strategies.

Hospitals send RODS data from clinical encounters over virtual <b>private</b> networks and <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> using the Health Level 7 (HL 7) message protocol. The data are sent in real time. RODS automatically classifies the registration chief complaint from the visit into one of seven syndrome categories using Bayesian classifiers. It stores the data in a relational database, aggregates the data for analysis using data warehousing techniques, applies univariate and multivariate statistical detection algorithms to the data, and alerts users of when the algorithms identify anomalous patterns in the syndrome counts. RODS also has a Web-based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses. RODS processes sales of over-the-counter health care products in a similar manner but receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis.

40|$|Abstract. If {{your company}} is like most {{businesses}}, you lease equipment. A U. S. Department of Commerce report states that 80 % of all businesses lease equipment. Leasing {{is one of}} many financial tools available to businesses whether they are publicly traded corporations or family owned <b>private</b> companies. <b>Leased</b> assets include the full range of equipment necessary for a company to conduct business. Our research indicates that there are three areas in which all companies can improve their leasing processes, decrease total financing costs and save time. To accomplish this, companies need to understand the language of leasing, improve their lease negotiation skills and develop more detailed RFPs that include enhanced lease requirement sections. Very large organizations with extensive annual leasing needs should consider a RFP that is entirely dedicated to leasing. This RFP is separate from the equipment request and only deals with the financing. Many municipalities, corporations, service businesses and not-for-profits seek out a <b>lease</b> <b>line</b> of credit that will cover all equipment acquired during a specific period of time, usually a calendar or fiscal year. The <b>lease</b> <b>line</b> of credit may be renewed annually if both parties are satisfied with the working relationship. Using a <b>lease</b> <b>line</b> of credit means a company negotiates a Master Lease document only once, saving valuable staff and legal time investments.

40|$|Security {{decisions}} {{are based on}} a number of foundational assumptions. The effectiveness of any decision depends on the soundness of the underlying assumptions. To ensure that security is adequate and will work, these assumptions need to be examined. Any time we hear that "A" is secure (or insecure) because of "B", we need to ask some questions. Why that is true? How do we know? What do we know about "B" that makes "A" secure or not? This questioning must be done without bias and without assuming that the conclusion is known in advance. One assumption frequently heard is that a wide area network (WAN) is secure because its sites are linked using dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines.</b> Many people believe that these lines are inherently secure. Some providers of these lines certainly advertise them as secure. It is unsound to assume without question that dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> are secure. This paper examines the properties of <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> and the reality about their security. The main focus is the risk of loss of secrecy of information transmitted on dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines.</b> (The discussion of other aspects of security of dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines,</b> such as the analysis and risk-mitigation related to loss of service, will be left to others.)
