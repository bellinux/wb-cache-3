2500|$|The base (standard and CE) and S trims are {{available}} with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, while the LE (unlike the previous generation) and XLE are automatic only.

2500|$|The 1988 Fiero {{brought a}} new {{suspension}} design, thought by many to have {{a striking resemblance to}} those designed by Lotus, which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though; it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with [...] by [...] wide wheels up front and [...] by [...] wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>unit,</b> the same design later found on the GM EV1, was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production — one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and balance shaft. A [...] "Formula" [...] option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the [...] speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. During the Fiero's final model year (on August 16, 1988) the last window sticker was placed on the last Fiero to roll off the Pontiac, Michigan plant line. The 1988 Fiero is the most desired by automotive collectors because of the improvements made to the 1988 model year, and this being the last year of production.

50|$|The BvS 10 {{is similar}} to, but {{distinct}} from, the Bv 206 or Bv 206S. It {{is a much}} larger and fully amphibious armoured vehicle based upon the characteristic twin-cab, articulated steering system typical of Hägglunds all-terrain vehicles. The main differences from the older Bv206s are a more powerful Cummins 5.9 litre diesel engine, improved ground clearance, and newly developed chassis, <b>power</b> train and <b>steering</b> <b>units</b> that give the vehicle considerably enhanced speed (from previous 51.5 km/h on road) and comfort on road and in terrain, as well as greater load-carrying capability (up to 5 tons), {{and the ability to}} add various modular sub-systems such as add-on armour, weapon mounts, a load-changer and cargo platforms.|$|R

50|$|The {{cam track}} {{is not a}} regular helix but varies in pitch angle and depth.

5000|$|As is {{evidenced}} from the marginalia of his schoolbooks, James Booth developed a precocious flair for automotive design {{at an early}} age. By his twentieth fourth birthday, he had engineered and built his first car, the Bi-Autogo. It was designed to travel on two large wheels at speeds above 20 mph; at lower speeds a pair of smaller wheels could be lowered to balance the machine. Booth intended the car to be a limited production vehicle that would appeal to wealthy young men with a sporting character. Because of the tremendous engineering challenges that his design presented, however, Booth was obliged to delay construction of the prototype. In May 1913, he finally produced a vehicle that incorporated many innovative features: it had the first V-8 engine ever built in Detroit, possessed a compressed air self-starter, had a four-speed transmission, and even boasted a retractable arm rest. The engine cowling and body panels were built of aluminum, and the top speed of the car, Booth stated, was 75 mph (120 km/h). Nonetheless, lacking a <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>unit,</b> the [...] "Bi-Autogo" [...] was extremely hard to turn at low speeds. After the prototype was fashioned and {{a complete set of}} parts were fabricated, funding for the vehicle ceased. Consequently, the [...] "Bi-Autogo" [...] never came to market.|$|E

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (HPS) uses {{hydraulic pressure}} supplied by an engine-driven pump {{to assist the}} motion of turning the <b>steering</b> wheel. Electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (EPS) is more efficient than hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> since the electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|R
