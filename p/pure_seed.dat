60|$|The common {{carnation}} {{is strongly}} proterandrous, and therefore depends {{to a large}} extent upon insects for fertilisation. I have seen only humble-bees visiting the flowers, but I dare say other insects likewise do so. It is notorious that if <b>pure</b> <b>seed</b> is desired, the greatest care is necessary to prevent the varieties which grow in the same garden from intercrossing. (4/10. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1847 page 268.) The pollen is generally shed and lost before the two stigmas in the same flower diverge and are ready to be fertilised. I was therefore often forced to use for self-fertilisation pollen from the same plant instead of from the same flower. But on two occasions, when I attended to this point, I was not able to detect any marked difference in the number of seeds produced by these two forms of self-fertilisation.|$|E

Horticulturists do not commonly distinguish between the effects of variability and intercrossing; but I have collected evidence on the natural crossing of varieties of the tulip, hyacinth, anemone, ranunculus, strawberry, Leptosiphon androsaceus, orange, rhododendron and rhubarb, all of which plants I believe to be self-fertile. (10/38. With respect to tulips and some other flowers, see Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page 252. For anemones 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1859 page 98. For strawberries see Herbert in 'Transactions of the Horticultural Society' volume 4 page 17. The same observer elsewhere speaks of the spontaneous crossing of rhododendrons. Gallesio makes the same statement with respect to oranges. I have myself known extensive crossing to occur with the common rhubarb. For Leptosiphon, Verlot 'Des Varieties' 1865 page 20. I have not included in my list the Carnation, Nemophila, or Antirrhinum, the varieties of which are known to cross freely, because these plants are not always self-fertile. I know nothing about the self-fertility of Trollius Lecoq 'De la Fecondation' 1862 page 93, Mahonia, and Crinum, in which genera the species intercross largely. With respect to Mahonia it is now scarcely possible to procure in this country pure specimens of M. aquifolium or repens; and the various species of Crinum sent by Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' page 32, to Calcutta, crossed there so freely that <b>pure</b> <b>seed</b> could not be saved.)

Seeds, from Telêmaco Borba, PR, were purchased at Klabin Paraná Papéis. Two experiments were performed in the Seed Improvement Laboratory of the Pontific Catholic University of Parana (PUCPR). The first experiment was performed to determine the ideal amount of sample matter for the germination test. It had five treatments and four replications. The five treatments were different sample matters (365, 730, 1. 095, 1. 460 and 1. 825  mg) from the lot, which corresponded to 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mg of <b>pure</b> <b>seeds.</b> The number of germinated seeds per gram of the samples was evaluated after 14 days.

40|$|Premise of the study: Several {{barriers}} against hybrid formation exist, {{and their}} combined action {{can affect the}} evolutionary outcomes of hybridization. To explain the asymmetrical introgression observed between two bumblebee-pollinated plant species (Rhinanthus angustifolius and R. minor), we focused on post-pollination barriers and ethological isolation of hybrids. • Methods: We studied pollen competition in conspecific and heterospecific crosses on both species and analyzed germination rates of hybrid and <b>pure</b> <b>seeds.</b> We also measured bumblebee visitation rates to hybrids relative to their parents using potted Rhinanthus placed in populations of each parental species. • Key results: In mixed pollinations, there was a conspecific siring advantage in both species, but no difference in pollen tube growth rates in either cross type. F 1 seeds with a R. angustifolius maternal plant germinated poorly, while those with R. minor as the maternal parent germinated better than <b>pure</b> <b>seeds.</b> Interestingly, bumblebees treated hybrids almost as equal to the background species and more often rejected the nonresident Rhinanthus. In a R. angustifolius background, bumblebees preferred R. angustifolius, but visited hybrids more often than R. minor. In contrast, visitation rates were similar on a R. minor background. • Conclusions: Our results suggest that hybridization rates in Rhinanthus remain low because of several leaky barriers that make R. minor the maternal parent of most F 1 offspring. Preference for R. angustifolius and the equal treatment of F 1 and background species by bumblebees induce a visitation pattern that directs gene flow toward R. angustifolius when this species predominates...|$|R
