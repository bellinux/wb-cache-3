40|$|In {{this work}} {{the problem of}} Single Event Upset (SEU) is {{considered}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> recent analog technology: The Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs). Some FPAA models are based on SRAM memory cells to implement the user programmability, which makes this kind of device vulnerable to SEU when employed in applications susceptible to the incidence of radiation. In the former part of this work some fault injection experiments are made in order to investigate the effects of SEU in the SRAM blocks of a commercial FPAA. For this purpose, single bit inversions are injected <b>in</b> the FPAA <b>programming</b> bitstream, when an oscillator module is <b>programmed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> second <b>moment,</b> <b>a</b> self-checking scheme using the studied FPAA is proposed. This scheme, which is built from the FPAA programming resources, is able to restore the original programming data if an error is detected. Fault injection is also performed to investigate {{the reliability of the}} proposed scheme when the bitstream section which controls the checker blocks is corrupted due to a SEU...|$|R
2500|$|Kahuta's Blueprint: Kahuta is {{the site}} of the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), Pakistan's main nuclear weapons {{laboratory}} as well as an emerging centre for long-range missile development. The primary Pakistani missile-material production facility is located at Kahuta, employing gas centrifuge enrichment technology to produce Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU). R first confirmed Pakistan's nuclear programs by analysing the hair samples snatched from the floor of barber shops near KRL; which showed that Pakistan had developed the ability to enrich uranium to weapons-grade quality. RAW agents knew of Kahuta Research Laboratories from at least early 1978, when the then Indian Prime Minister, Morarji Desai, accidentally thwarted R's operations on Pakistan's covert nuclear weapons <b>program.</b> <b>In</b> <b>an</b> indiscreet <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> telephone conversation one day, Morarji Desai informed the then Pakistan President, Zia-ul-Haq, that India was aware of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. According to later reports, acting on this [...] "tip-off", Pakistani Intelligence eliminated RAW's sources on Kahuta, leaving India in the dark about Pakistan's nuclear weapons program from then on.|$|R
