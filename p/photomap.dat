40|$|In {{order to}} {{appraise}} fixed property, local governments in Japan annually investigate taxable buildings on January 1, but {{the efficiency of}} the investigation is an issue. With this context, change extraction methods of buildings have been studied using various data. However, labor and time optimization for change extraction methods remains an issue. With this in mind, the authors have concentrated on developing a change extraction method for buildings that uses only <b>photomaps</b> of two separate times. This paper describes the extraction method using color and texture, which can be obtained from <b>photomaps.</b> In order to evaluate effectiveness, the proposed method was investigated using <b>photomaps</b> of two separate times on various locations. It was confirmed that the proposed method extracted the changed buildings. It was also verified that the change of buildings cannot be extracted by color information only; rather, the change extraction of buildings was accomplished by using both color and texture. It should be noted that all changed buildings include extracted regions so that the change extraction of buildings is effectively performed without oversights. The proposed method could extract all changed buildings. In conclusion, the proposed method can reduce over-extraction of changed buildings by intensively visually checking extracted regions that have changes in color or texture rather than by visually checking all regions of <b>photomaps.</b> It is concluded that the proposed method has the ability to effectively extract changed buildings by using only <b>photomaps...</b>|$|R

50|$|A unique {{exclusive}} {{process of}} imagery capturing, processing and publishing is used. Traditionally, high resolution aerial imagery {{has to be}} captured by a low altitude flying aircraft, then the data is manually processed and stitched together digitally to create a <b>PhotoMap,</b> a slow process which can take months to complete. Nearmap speeds up this process by using their own engineered camera capture equipment, named a 'HyperPod', which is attached to Cessna 210 light aircraft, which fly at a high altitude, enabling entire cities to be captured {{in a day or}} two. Once the imagery is captured, it is processed through super computers which run software known as 'HyperVision' which automatically processes and stitches together the many individual photographs captured into one virtually seamless <b>PhotoMap.</b> These PhotoMaps are then hosted on Nearmap's end user web portal, known as 'MapBrowser'. Along with traditional top-down photography, the HyperPod is also able to capture oblique aerial photographs from 4 different angles and digital elevation model data at the same time.|$|E

50|$|USAFE {{acquired}} an RB-17 Flying Fortress from a photo-mapping unit, Detachment A of the 10th Reconnaissance Group at Fürth Airfield, Germany. These aircraft were in Europe {{as part of}} Project Casey Jones, an attempt to <b>photomap</b> {{as much of the}} world as possible to create maps and charts for use in future contingencies, and installed Electronic Countermeasures equipment in it. The B-17 was flown carefully along the border near where the C-47s had been shot down, making sure it did not infringe Yugoslav airspace. By luck, on the very first mission, the Yugoslavs cooperated and turned on their radar and began tracking it. The equipment picked up the familiar signals from a German Würzburg radar on about 560 MHz and took bearings, dozens of them, all of which cut at the same point. Where the bearings crossed there had been a German radar school during the war. Obviously the Yugoslavs had put into service {{one or more of the}} old German radars.|$|E
50|$|Fairchild {{wanted to}} expand the {{capabilities}} of his cameras for map making and aerial surveying. In 1921, he formed Fairchild Aerial Surveys and bought a surplus World War I Fokker D.VII biplane to take his aerial photographs. Shortly afterward, Fairchild landed a contract to make a <b>photomap</b> of Newark, New Jersey, {{which would be the}} first aerial mapping of a major city. In 1923, Fairchild formed Fairchild Aerial Surveys of Canada, Limited after he was asked by the chief forester of the Laurentide Paper Company to perform aerial surveys of Canada. Back in the United States he made an aerial map of Manhattan Island which {{went on to become a}} commercial success and was implemented by several New York businesses. Other cities began using aerial mapping, as they found it was faster and less expensive than the ground surveys of the time. Aerial photography proved to be a successful commercial venture. To accommodate this growing commercial demand for aerial surveys; Fairchild established Fairchild Aerial Surveys in the United States. In 1965 Fairchild sold Fairchild Aerial Surveys to Aero Services, Inc., which decided to keep only the more recent photographs and dispose of the others. A former Fairchild employee learned of this plan and was able to get the older material to three Southern California Institutions; Whittier College, UCLA, and California State University at Northridge, where he knew professors who would put the material to good use. Whittier College closed access to the photographs in 2010. In 2012, the collection was put up for sale. The University of California Santa Barbara acquired the collection in December, 2012.|$|E

Results show that this methodology is useful, accessible and valid, in terms of cartographic accuracy in order to register and quantifying changes In the extension of urban areas with a virtually flat relief, it was found that some sectors of the area under evaluation presented a substantial growth, particularly in Lomas de Cristo and Lomas de San Esteban, which showed an accumulated growth percentage of 346 % during the 1970 - 1997...|$|R

40|$|Digital oblique {{aerial camera}} (hereinafter called “oblique cameras”) is an {{assembly}} of medium format digital cameras capable of shooting digital aerial photographs in five directions i. e. nadir view and oblique views (forward and backward, {{left and right}} views) simultaneously and it is used for shooting digital aerial photographs efficiently for generating 3 D models in a wide area. For aerial photogrammetry of public survey in Japan, it is required to use large format cameras, like DMC and UltraCam series, to ensure aerial photogrammetric accuracy. Although oblique cameras are intended to generate 3 D models, digital aerial photographs in 5 directions taken with them should {{not be limited to}} 3 D model production but they may also be allowed for digital mapping and <b>photomaps</b> of required public survey accuracy in Japan. In order to verify the potency of using oblique cameras for aerial photogrammetry (simultaneous adjustment, digital mapping and <b>photomaps),</b> (1) a viewer was developed to interpret digital aerial photographs taken with oblique cameras, (2) digital aerial photographs were shot with an oblique camera owned by us, a Penta DigiCAM of IGI mbH, and (3) accuracy of 3 D measurements was verified...|$|R
