25|$|VAM {{originally}} intended the Rally SST to include as standard equipment only the same accessories as the 1981 Rally GT and the optional equipment {{list of the}} 1981 Rally AMX except for its own share of exclusive and not available accessories. However, the same story as the 1980 Rally GT repeated itself for the 1981 Rally SST. The need to stress differences between not just the three-version Rally line but also the new Spirit-based Lerma model forced VAM to act any way it could. Once again, the company's sales department determined that virtually all Rally SST units included all optional convenience accessories available in the Rally line from the factory. The final list of equipment for the Rally SST consisted of a tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, electric antenna, full light group including reading dome light, AM-FM stereo radio, quartz clock, center console with compartment and armrest with rear ashtray, lighted vanity mirror, side armrest safety reflectors, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, leather wrapped sports steering wheel, inside hood release, air conditioning, <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, dual remote-controlled mirrors, reclining bucket seats, retractable seatbelts, and removable trunk cover.|$|E

40|$|For {{almost thirty}} years bast fibers such as flax, hemp, kenaf, sisal and jute {{have been used as}} {{reinforcing}} material in the molding process of both thermoplastic and thermoset matrices. The main application areas of these natural fiber reinforced composites in Europe are limited almost exclusively to the passenger car range. Typical components are door panels, rear <b>parcel</b> <b>shelves,</b> instrument boards and trunk linings. Natural fiber reinforced composites have become prevalent due to their good mechanical properties and their low production costs. The main advantage in applying natural fibers as reinforcement in composite materials is the price. Nowadays this argument becomes more and more important due to the scarcity of synthetic raw materials and consequently, their rising prices. Additionally the low density (approx. 1. 5 g/cm³) of natural fibers confers them a very good lightweight potential. Other advantageous features of natural fiber composites include very good processing and acoustic properties. Further benefits such as good life cycle assessment and easier processability compared to glass fiber material should also be taken into account. Disadvantages of natural fibers are unevenness of the fiber quality and varying fiber characteristics due to differences in soil, climate and fiber separation and their low heat resistance (at temperatures exceeding 220 °C, some fiber components start thermal degradation). Another disadvantage of natural fiber reinforced materials is that with some matrices (mostly thermoplastic polymers) a sufficient impregnation of the fibers can only be achieved if the fiber content in the composite is kept low, usually below 50 wt. -...|$|R

Like the American GFS, the engine changed from the 258 six to the 282 cu in unit and the 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio. Like the American ECD, it shared the column-mounted gearshift and high-trim-upholstered bench seats (fold down rear unit) and special side panels.

40|$|Scattered {{through the}} main space of the gallery, {{self-contained}} sculptures and wall based works form a constellation that generates a veil of playful alchemy, connecting the natural and architectonic elements. In Westwood’s work the recognizable embraces the abstract and solidifies the familiar strangeness of the quotidian. For example, in the wall based series ‘Boneus’, a car parcel-shelf is cast into polyester resin and juxtaposed with a cast of a puff-pastry twist. Taken from a hatchback car, the parcel-shelf is superfluous to the car’s mechanical workings. Whilst the hatchback is {{at the low end}} of the spectrum of cars as status symbols, as much mobility as luxury or status, these parcel-shelves no longer connect to that mobility, nor to the luxury that the car may embody. Rather they hang on the wall waiting for the dreams the machine never fulfilled. Typical for Westwood’s practice and artistic research is the analysis of the object as a product of economic exchange. As such he focuses on casting objects that rest on the edges of mainstream economy, yet are closely interlinked with it: car <b>parcel</b> <b>shelves</b> and head rests, waiting-room courtesy mints, charity donation boxes and air-fresheners. Quotidian objects that have been rendered unrecognizable become estranged familiarities. In ‘Pere and Terre hang out in Bistro RePeTerre’, two ceramic extrusions stand solidly on a rectangular walnut-veneered plinth, covered by dark smoked glass. The corporate atmosphere of the plinth is contrasted to – yet cohabits with – the organically appearing ceramic extrusions, whose surfaces are compacted and sandy, as if they could dissolve at any moment.

40|$|International audienceIn situ {{measurements}} obtained {{during the}} 2010 COUPLING cruise were analyzed {{in order to}} fully characterize the velocity structure of the coastal Bransfield Current. An idealized two-layer shallow-water model was used to investigate the various instability processes of the realistic current along the coastal shelf. Particularly studied is how the topographic parameter To (ratio between the shelf slope and the isopycnal slope of the surface current) impacts the growth and the wavelength of the unstable perturbations. For small bottom slopes, when {{the evolution of the}} coastal current is controlled by the baroclinic instability, the increase of the topographic parameter To yields a selection of smaller unstable wavelengths. The growth rates increase with small values of To. For larger values of To (To greater than or similar to 10, which is relevant for the coastal Bransfield Current), the baroclinic instability is strongly dampened and the horizontal shear instability becomes the dominant one. In this steep shelf regime, the unstable growth rate and the wavelength selection of the baroclinic coastal current remains almost constant and weakly affected by the amplitude of the bottom velocity or the exact value of the shelf slope. Hence, the linear stability analysis of an idealized Bransfield Current predicts a typical growth time of 7. 7 days and an alongshore scale of 47 km all along the South Shetland Island shelf. The fact that these large growth times are identical to the typical transit time of water <b>parcels</b> along the <b>shelf</b> may explain why the current does not exhibit any unstable meanders...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe coastal ocean may {{experience}} periods of fluctuating along-shelf wind direction, causing shifts between upwelling and downwelling conditions with responses {{that are not}} symmetric. We seek to understand these asymmetries and their implications on the Eulerian and Lagrangian flows. We use a two-dimensional (variations across-shelf and with depth; uniformity along-shelf) primitive equation numerical model to study shelf flows {{in the presence of}} periodic, zero-mean wind stress forcing. The model bathymetry and initial stratification is typical of the broad, shallow shelf off Duck, NC during summer. After an initial transient adjustment, the response of the Eulerian fields is nearly periodic. Despite the symmetric wind stress forcing, there exist both mean Eulerian and Lagrangian flows. The mean Lagrangian displacement of <b>parcels</b> on the <b>shelf</b> depends both on their initial location and on the initial phase of the forcing. Eulerian mean velocities, in contrast, have almost no dependence on initial phase. In an experiment with sinusoidal wind stress forcing of maximum amplitude 0. 1 Nm and period of 6 days, the mean Lagrangian across-shelf displacements are largest in the surface and bottom boundary layers. Parcels that originate near the coast in the top 15 m experience complicated across-shelf and vertical motion that does not display a clear pattern. Offshore of this region in the top 10 m a rotating cell feature exists with offshore displacement near the surface and onshore displacement below. A mapping technique is used to help identify the qualitative characteristics of the Lagrangian motion and to clarify the long time nature of the parcel displacements. The complexity of the Lagrangian motion in a region near the coast and the existence of a clear boundary separating this region from a more regular surface cell feature offshore are quantified by a calculation from the map of the largest Lyapunov exponent...|$|R

The most unusual looking of these models in contrast with AMC's versions was the GFS model as it incorporated the flip-open rear side opera windows and the targa band used in the 1977 AMC Hornet AMX models (the same treatment used in the Hornet-based 1977 VAM American GFS). The optional equipment list on these models included air conditioning system with heavy duty cooling (seven-blade flexible fan, three-line radiator, fan shroud, coolant recovery tank and 55 amp alternator), reading dome light, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, and rear defroster.|$|E
2500|$|For 1973, VAM {{sought to}} {{standardize}} and consolidate as much parts and components {{as possible to}} cut costs.

This new engine shared the same crankshaft as VAM's also new 282 cu in six introduced two years before in the VAM Javelin model, allowing VAM to optimize resources and reduce costs. With the engine came a change in the rear differential gear ratio from 3.54:1 to 3.31:1. Aside from the revised taillights, the first set of high-back bucket seats became present, which were shared with the second-generation VAM Javelin. Strangely, unlike all previous models, they were not available with reclining mechanism. New side panel designs accompanied a now standard <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> incorporating both courtesy lights. The front end was completely updated as in the standard Rambler American models except for the unique characteristic of the blackout grille.

This meant a mid-range model between the standard basic units and the GFS/ECD/DL ones. This created for the first time an automatic base wagon that was not a DL. However, despite this change, VAM did not create any designation or distinction for the new better-equipped base models. In 1981 and 1982 there were four versions of the station wagon model: base manual, base automatic, basic DL, and equipped DL.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the turmoil}} of 1982, Renault de México took over VAM from the Mexican {{government}} in February 1983. As with AMC, Renault was most interested in the Jeep line, VAM's production facilities, and its established dealer network. As soon as the agreement was finalized, Renault ordered the termination of VAM's passenger car line so it would not compete with its own products. VAM's 1983 models existed mainly to use up the highest possible amount of existing inventories as well as fulfilling previous agreements with sourcing companies. The American line for 1983 soldiered on in a very limited form. The American GFS and American ECD models were virtually not produced for the final year. Both sedan models existed as the base manual and semi-equipped automatics units. Cars with manual transmissions had a <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> as standard equipment while the units with automatic transmission featured aluminum road wheels, the same door panels and seat designs as the previous GFS and ECD models along with their respective door armrest safety reflectors. The two-door automatic models had a reclining mechanism for their front seats. Regardless of the transmission, standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, and dual remote mirrors. The American DL station wagon model was virtually the only high-trim American model to be available. For 1983, the base automatic and the basic DL were merged into a single version alongside the equipped DL and the base manual, creating three versions for the year unlike the four {{of the last two}} years. The mid-range version had the same equipment as the sedan models with automatic transmission of the year, it was also called [...] "American DL" [...] and carried the same woodgrain panels and moldings that were never seen in the base automatics of the previous two years. The differences between the mid-range DL and the top-of-the-line DL are the presence of the AM/FM stereo radio, reading dome light, lighted vanity mirror, intermittent wipers and air conditioning in the latter model. The only optional accessories available were the AM/FM stereo tape player radio, remote-controlled door mirrors and electric antenna. Only the top-of-the-line DL carried the [...] I6 while the rest had the [...] Cars equipped with air conditioning included the larger 282 engine.

5000|$|Deck lights (or <b>Parcel</b> <b>Shelf</b> lights) - Rear-facing {{equivalents}} of the Dash Lights {{which are}} placed on the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Shelf</b> of the vehicle. These {{can be used in}} both overt and covert vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Designed by Opel Stylist Erhard Schnell, the Opel GT was a fastback, {{that had}} neither an {{externally}} accessible trunk nor a conventional hatchback. There was a <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> behind the seats {{that could only}} be accessed through the main doors. Behind the <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> was a fold-up panel that concealed a spare tire and jack.|$|E
50|$|The Series II was {{released}} in May 1960. The most notable external difference was the hidden boot and bonnet hinges. Interior storage was improved with the fitting of a full width <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> directly beneath the fascia.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after, in February 2008, a restyled Modus and new the Grand Modus were launched. Also that year, the Grand Modus {{replaced}} the Modus in Spain. The Grand Modus has an extended length of 4034 mm and a boot volume of 410 litres (...) below the <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{its normal}} {{interior}} configuration (with the back seats {{up and the}} <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> in place) the rear cargo area does have a noticeably small opening (52 cm by 82 cm) and an elevated lip necessitating the lifting of luggage quite high {{before it can be}} placed inside. However the boot (trunk) is relatively deep and spacious. In addition the rear seats fold down and both the <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf</b> and the rear divider panel (usually in place behind the back seats) can be completely removed, in essence turning the entire rear half of the car into a cargo area. As such the Toyota Sera has a large amount of available storage space for its size. The space-saving spare tire and changing kit are contained in a small compartment below the boot floor.|$|E
50|$|Dead {{spots are}} a result of the maximum {{overshoot}} requirement from above. The power delivered to the internal LF antennas has to be tuned to give best performance i.e. minimum dead spots and maximum average overshoot. Dead spots are usually near the extremities of the vehicle e.g. the rear <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf.</b>|$|E
5000|$|April 1974: Introduction of the R5 LS, {{same as the}} R5 TL {{but with}} a larger 1.3 engine, {{different}} design steel wheels, H4 iodine headlights, electric windscreen washers, fully carpeted floor ahead of the front seats, carpeted rear <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> electronic rev counter, daily totalizer, two-speed ventilation system, rear wiper, and illuminated ashtray with cigarette lighter.|$|E
5000|$|... 6-seater version. Three rows of seats: fixed {{front bench}} seat for driver and passenger, plus four single rear seats in two rows. The rear seats could be {{individually}} folded flat to the floor, allowing for a reconfigurable cargo area with an even loading surface. With all six seats up storage space was reduced to the rear <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf.</b> Original price on the Italian market: 743,000 Lire.|$|E
50|$|August 1985 saw {{the arrival}} of the 1.3 City and 1.3 City X. The 1.3 City was similar to the {{previous}} 1.3 base model. The 1.3 City X added full carpeting, cloth upholstery, head restraints, a rear <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> a radio and a manually operated choke. These models also did without the plastic bumpers, having more conventional steel bumpers with plastic end caps similar to the Maestro van.|$|E
50|$|As a {{variation}} of the luxurious 250 GT, the 250 GT Lusso had a spacious interior, made possible by the forward position of the engine; this was an unusual design choice at the time for Ferrari, known for their sports cars which emphasized even front/rear weight distribution. As the car was only a two-seater, there was a fairly capacious boot space with a <b>parcel</b> <b>shelf,</b> covered in quilted leather.|$|E
