40|$|This work {{involves}} {{the development and}} analysis of a new <b>pump</b> <b>packing</b> material, which utilizes coal washery refuse (CWR) as a raw material, for strata control in underground coal mining operations. A review {{on the state of}} the of <b>pump</b> <b>packing</b> systems is presented, together with an analysis of the cost effectiveness of the new <b>pump</b> <b>packing</b> material as compared to other commercial <b>pump</b> <b>packing</b> materials. A method is proposed for use in the design of cement and coal washery refuse (CCWR) material mixes to give a required early strength and degree of workability when incorporating CWR. The usefulness of the method is shown by comparison of the results from a large number of tests on CCWR specimens with previously published results. It is shown that the relationship between the strength and curing time of a mix can be accurately described by a simple equation. The effects of the compositions on the strength within the experimental regions are discussed. As expected an increase in the strength of CCWR materials can be obtained either by decreasing the water content or increasing the quantity of OPC used in the mixtures. This study also investigated the influence of moisture content on the mechanical properties of CCWR material. The unconfined compressive strength, Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, indirect tensile strength, triaxial strength and drying shrinkage were the primary properties investigated. Results indicate that the moisture content has a significant effect on both the strength and elasticity of CCWR material at all curing times. It is evident from the tests that the drying shrinkage of wet mixes is larger than that of dry mixes. In general, moisture content affects the shrinkage of CCWR material as it reduces the volume of the restraining CWR. An empirical criterion is proposed for predicting the strength and yield characteristics of CCWR materials. A numerical procedure has been developed to determine the parameters contained in the proposed yield function. It has been demonstrated that the proposed logarithmic yield function can accurately predict the strength and yield characteristics of CCWR materials. Preliminary tests have also been conducted to determine the influence of moisture content on the flow properties of CWR. The test results indicate that the presence of very fine grains in CWR enhances its flow ability remarkably. Further work investigated the effect of specimen geometry on the strength and elasticity of CCWR material. CCWR models were tested, simulating underground monolithic pack support with different widths in a coal seam of uniform height. The study also investigated the load deformation characteristics of CCWR models under the tests conditions. It is shown that geometry has a significant effect on both the mechanical properties and load deformation characteristics of CCWR models. A yield pillar technique analysed by the finite element method appears suitable for simulation of excavation of roadways under different virgin stress conditions. Comparison of stability of yield and conventional pillars in several examples substantiates the feasibility of the technique and indicates that yield pillars are practical when the factor k, the ratio of horiwntal to vertical stress exceeds 1. 6...|$|E

50|$|The {{formation}} of a shell requires certain biological machinery.

50|$|The shell {{formation}} requires certain biological machinery. The {{shell is}} deposited within a small compartment, the extrapallial space, which is sealed {{from the environment}} by the periostracum, a leathery outer layer around {{the rim of the}} shell, where growth occurs. This caps off the extrapallial space, which is bounded on its other surfaces by the existing shell and the mantle. The periostracum acts as a framework from which the outer layer of carbonate can be suspended, but also, in sealing the compartment, allows the accumulation of ions in concentrations sufficient for crystallization to occur. The accumulation of ions is driven by ion <b>pumps</b> <b>packed</b> within the calcifying epithelium. Calcium ions are obtained from the organism's environment through the gills, gut and epithelium, transported by the haemolymph ("blood") to the calcifying epithelium, and stored as granules within or in-between cells ready to be dissolved and pumped into the extrapallial space when they are required. The organic matrix forms the scaffold that directs crystallization, and the deposition and rate of crystals is also controlled by hormones produced by the mollusc. Because the extrapallial space is supersaturated, the matrix could be thought of as impeding, rather than encouraging, carbonate deposition; although it does act as a nucleating point for the crystals and controls their shape, orientation and polymorph, it also terminates their growth once they reach the necessary size. Nucleation is endoepithelial in Neopilina and Nautilus, but exoepithelial in the bivalves and gastropods.|$|R

Application of a one-dimensional advection–dispersion flow model, that included two empirical kinetic terms to account for particle retention in the porous media, produced data fits that followed the general trend of the data, but did not truly capture the concentration maxima in the data sets.

50|$|A gland is {{a general}} type of {{stuffing}} box, used to seal a rotating or reciprocating shaft against a fluid. The most common example is in {{the head of a}} tap (faucet) where the gland is usually packed with string which has been soaked in tallow or similar grease.

40|$|Equipment leak {{standards}} {{are designed to}} control emissions of VOCs and VHAPs from regulated equipment {{through the application of}} work practices and equipment practices. The work practice most commonly applied to control equipment leaks is the LDAR program, which is discussed in detail in Section 2. 2. 4. 2. Subsequent chapters address the monitoring, recordkeeping. and reporting requirements of implementing a LDAR program under NSPS or NESHAP standards. In this chapter, regulated equipment is reviewed to illustrate how monitoring programs are applied to specific pieces of equipment action, and special canned-motor and diaphragm pumps (US. �PA, 1990). Chemicals transferred by pumps can leak at the point of contact between the moving shaft and stationary casing. To isolate the pump's interior from the atmosphere. all pumps, except the seal-less type (canned-motor and diaphragm), require a seal {{at the point where the}} shaft penetrates the housing. The most commonly used seals in these <b>pumps</b> are <b>packed</b> and mechanical (US. EPA. 1980 a). Equipment practices include the use of specific types of components, equipment design standards or specifications, and operational standards for certain types of equipment. Equipment practices are evaluated using performance standards that provide a basis for monitoring or substantiating the effectiveness of such control practices. Equipment practices, briefty summarized in Section 2. 2. 4. 3, are addressed in greater detail in this chapter. A general set of equipment is covered by all of the equipment leak standards. Some equipment is covered only by specific standards. For example, product accumulator vessels are covered only by the equipment leak standards for benzene. Also, the vinyl chloride fugitive emission standards cover additional sources (loading and unloading lines, agitators, slip gauges, opening of equipment. and inprocess wastewater). Except for agitaton, however, the emissions from these sources generally are not considered "equipment leaks.

6000|$|Disko {{kept them}} busy {{fiddling}} with the sails; and when those were flattened like a racing yacht's, Dan had to wait on the big topsail, which was put over by hand every time she went about. In spare moments they <b>pumped,</b> for the <b>packed</b> fish dripped brine, which does not improve a cargo. But {{since there was no}} fishing, Harvey had time to look at the sea from another point of view. The low-sided schooner was naturally on most intimate terms with her surroundings. They saw little of the horizon save when she topped a swell; and usually she was elbowing, fidgeting, and coaxing her steadfast way through grey, grey-blue, or black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam; or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger water-hill. It was as if she said: [...] "You wouldn't hurt me, surely? I'm only the little 'We're Here'." [...] Then she would slide away chuckling softly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle. The dullest of folk cannot see this kind of thing hour after hour through long days without noticing it; and Harvey, being anything but dull, began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wave-tops turning over with a sound of incessant tearing; the hurry of the winds working across open spaces and herding the purple-blue cloud-shadows; the splendid upheaval of the red sunrise; the folding and packing away of the morning mists, wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors; the salty glare and blaze of noon; the kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead, flat square miles; the chilly blackening of everything at the day's end; and the million wrinkles of the sea under the moonlight, when the jib-boom solemnly poked at the low stars, and Harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook.|$|R
5000|$|Piston-driven {{metering}} pumps commonly work as follows: There is a piston (sometimes called plunger), typically cylindrical, which {{can go in}} and out of a correspondingly shaped chamber in the pump head. The inlet and outlet lines are joined to the piston chamber. There are two check valves, often ball check valves, attached to the pump head, one at the inlet line and the other at the outlet line. The inlet valve allows flow from the inlet line to the piston chamber, but not in the reverse direction. The outlet valve allows flow from the chamber to the outlet line, but not in reverse. The motor repeatedly moves the piston into and out of the piston chamber, causing the volume of the chamber to repeatedly become smaller and larger. When the piston moves out, a vacuum is created. Low pressure in the chamber causes liquid to enter and fill the chamber through the inlet check valve, but higher pressure at the outlet causes the outlet valve to shut. Then when the piston moves in, it pressurizes the liquid in the chamber. High pressure in the chamber causes the inlet valve to shut and forces the outlet valve to open, forcing liquid out at the outlet. These alternating suction and discharge strokes are repeated over and over to meter the liquid. In back of the chamber, there is packing around the piston or a doughnut-shaped seal with a toroid-shaped sphincter-like spring inside compressing the seal around the piston. This holds the fluid pressure when the piston slides in and out and makes the <b>pump</b> leak-tight. The <b>packing</b> or seals can wear out after prolonged use and can be replaced. The metering rate can be adjusted by varying the strokelength by which the piston moves back and forth or varying the speed of the piston motion.|$|R
40|$|Ultra-deepwater {{reservoirs}} {{are important}} unconventional reservoirs {{that hold the}} potential to produce billions of barrels of hydrocarbons, but also present major challenges. This type of reservoir is usually high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) and has a relatively high permeability. Hydraulic fracturing high permeability reservoirs {{are different from the}} hydraulic fracturing technology used in low permeability formations. The main purpose of hydraulic fracturing in low permeability reservoirs is to create a long, highly conductive path, whereas in high permeability formations hydraulic fracturing is used predominantly to bypass near wellbore formation damage, control sand production and reduce near wellbore pressure drop. Hydraulically fracturing these types of wells requires short fractures packed with high proppant concentrations. In addition, fracturing in high permeability reservoirs aims at achieving enough fracture length to increase productivity, especially when the viscosity of the reservoir fluid is high. In order to pump such a job and ensure long term productivity from the fracture, understanding the behavior of the fracture fluid and proppant is critical. A series of laboratory experiments have been conducted to study conductivity and fracture width with high proppant loading, high temperature and high pressure. Proppant was manually placed in the fracture and fracture fluid was <b>pumped</b> through the <b>pack.</b> Conductivity was measured by pumping oil to simulate reservoir conditions. Proppant performance and fracture fluids, which carry the proppant into the fracture, and their subsequent clean-up during production, were studied. High strength proppant is ideal for deep fracture stimulations and in this study different proppant loadings at different stresses were tested to see the impact of crushing and fracture width reduction on fracture conductivity. The preliminary test results indicated that oil at reservoir conditions improves clean-up of fracture fluid left in the proppant pack compared with using water at ambient temperature. Increasing the proppant concentration in the fracture showed higher conductivity values in some cases even at high closure stress. The increase in effective closure stress with high temperature resulted in a significant loss in conductivity. Additionally, the fracture width decreased with time and increased effective closure stress. Tests were also run to study the effect of cyclic loading which is expected to further decrease conductivity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStand up paddleboarding (SUP) {{became a}} rising {{sporting}} activity {{over the last}} decade. The main categories of the sport can be distinguished into: Leisure, Fitness, Race, Wave, Yoga and River/Touring. Especially the categories Fitness, Race and Wave require high performance SUPs for sportive success. In here the term “high performance” refers to “high bending stiffness” and “precise shape” of the surfboard/SUP. SUPs have a length of about 8 to 14 feet, which causes plenty of inconvenience while travelling with the equipment. A solution to the travelling problem {{can be found in}} inflatable SUPs (iSUPs). ISUPs use the so-called Dropstitch technology, invented by the U. S. military. However the fabric did not work sufficiently to keep their boats stiff enough [1]. Dropstitch is a three-dimensional fabric; fibers connect an upper and lower layer, which leads to a flat shape when inflating the object. The Dropstitch material does solve the transportation problem, but the technology is not suitable for high performance SUPs due to the insufficient possibility of forming any camber line. Further, as the fibers, which connect the upper and lower layer, are perpendicular to these layers, the Dropstitch material is not providing high enough bending stiffness. Thirdly iSUPs in Dropstitch construction have one air chamber only, thus buoyancy cannot be guaranteed when the iSUP is damaged. This can lead to dangerous situations for the sportsman. The VacuuAir-technology (patent pending, [2]) presented in this manuscript solves all previous described problems for iSUPs. The technology is characterized by a two-chamber system: A high-pressure chamber defines the shape and a vacuum-chamber increases the stiffness and guarantees buoyancy. The tubular high-pressure chambers enable the desired high performance shape. The vacuum chambers surround these tubes and are filled with granule. When applying the vacuum the granule is compressed and hard regions are formed, which increases the stiffness. Because of the floating property of the granule, buoyancy can be guaranteed even if both chambers are punctured. In this manuscript, we will explain the structure of the VacuuAir technology and the Dropstitch technology as well as the consequences regarding shape, safety, <b>pumping</b> effort and <b>packing</b> size. We show a comparison of the bending stiffness of iSUPs in a Dropstitch construction versus iSUPs in a VacuuAir construction...|$|R
