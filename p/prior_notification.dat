Although most account holders say they did not receive any notification prior their accounts being frozen, Bank of America insists that they do not freeze any account without <b>prior</b> <b>notification.</b> When it was reported that Bank of America was closing the accounts of Iranians living in the U.S. and Iranian-Americans, there was speculation that the bank did so on the basis of discriminatory ideology, since Bank of America did not give these individuals any reason why their accounts were being closed. The bank responded to these accusations, arguing that it was only following the rules put forth by the U.S. federal government regarding economic relations between the U.S. and Iran.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rules of}} natural justice require that persons {{liable to be}} {{directly}} affected by the outcome of any decision must be given <b>prior</b> <b>notification</b> of the action proposed to be taken, {{of the time and}} place of any hearing that is to be conducted, and of the charge or case they will be called upon to meet. There is also a necessary implication that notice must not only be given, but that it must be sufficient and accurate, to enable parties to understand the cases they have to meet and to prepare their answers and their own cases. Furthermore, natural justice is concerned with procedural fairness prior to and during adjudication by courts or administrative tribunals. Therefore, when the cases speak of [...] "notice", they refer to prior notice of the offence, the charges that will be preferred and the hearing at which a decision will be made. The requirement of notice {{does not mean that the}} accused or the person affected is also entitled to notice of the final decision of the court or tribunal if they choose to absent themselves from the proceedings and then omit to make any inquiries. Since the pronouncement of disqualification is made in open court, there is no further need to notify the accused of the order of the court.|$|E

40|$|Subject {{recruitment}} for epidemiologic {{studies is}} associated with major challenges due to privacy laws now common in many countries. Privacy policies regarding recruitment methods vary tremendously across institutions, partly because of a paucity of information about what methods are acceptable to potential subjects. The authors report the utility of an opt-out method without <b>prior</b> physician <b>notification</b> for recruiting community-dwelling US women aged 65 years or older with incident breast cancer in 2003. Participants (n = 3, 083) and possibly eligible nonparticipants (n = 2, 664) were compared using characteristics derived from billing claims. Participation for persons with traceable contact information was 70 % initially (2005 – 2006) and remained over 90 % for 3 follow-up surveys (2006 – 2008). Older subjects and those living in New York State {{were less likely to}} participate, but participation did not differ on the basis of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, underlying health, or type of cancer treatment. Few privacy concerns were raised by potential subjects, and no complaints were lodged. Using opt-out methods without <b>prior</b> physician <b>notification,</b> a population-based cohort of older breast cancer subjects was successfully recruited. This strategy may be applicable to population-based studies of other diseases and is relevant to privacy boards making decisions about recruitment strategies acceptable to the public...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between prior chlamydia and gonorrhoea infections and adverse obstetric outcomes. Methods: Records of women resident in New South Wales, Australia with a singleton first birth during 1999 - 2008 were linked to chlamydia and gonorrhoea notifications using probabilistic linkage. Obstetric outcomes and potential confounders were ascertained from the birth record. Logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounders was used to estimate {{the association between}} a disease <b>notification</b> <b>prior</b> to the birth and adverse birth outcomes: spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB), small for gestational age (SGA) and stillbirth. Results: Among 354217 women, 1. 0 % (n= 3658) had a prior chlamydia notification; 0. 06 % (n= 196) had a <b>prior</b> gonorrhoea <b>notification.</b> The majority of notifications (> 80 %) occurred before the estimated conception date. 4. 1 % of women had a SPTB, 12. 1 % had a SGA baby and 0. 6 % of women had a stillbirth. Among women with a <b>prior</b> chlamydia <b>notification,</b> the risk of SPTB and stillbirth was increased, aOR 1. 17 (95 %CI 1. 01, 1. 37) and aOR 1. 42 (95 %CI 1. 02, 1. 99) respectively {{but there was no}} association with SGA, aOR 0. 99 (95 %CI 0. 89, 1. 09). For women with gonorrhoea the risks for SPTB, stillbirth and SGA were respectively aOR 2. 50 (95 %CI 1. 39 - 4. 50), 2. 26 (95 %CI 0. 55 - 9. 26) and 0. 98 (95 %CI 0. 57 - 1. 67). Among women with a prior chlamydia diagnosis, the risk of SPTB did not differ between women diagnosed > 1 year prior to conception, within the year prior to conception or during the pregnancy, (p= 0. 9). Conclusions: Sexually transmissible infections in pregnancy and the pre-conception period may be important in predicting pregnancy outcomes...|$|R
