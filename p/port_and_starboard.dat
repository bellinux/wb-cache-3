5|$|Although the Vietnam Service Medal is a {{personal}} service award, it is permissible and customary under Coast Guard regulations for cutters to display service awards on the <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> bridge wings. Squadron One cutters were entitled to display the VSM by virtue of having served in Vietnam for more than thirty days during the eligibility period of 15 November 1961 to 30 April 1975.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnam Campaign Medal was {{an award}} of South Vietnam for those {{individuals}} who served in Vietnam {{for a period of}} at least six months. Although it was a personal award, Coast Guard regulations permitted its display on a cutter's <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> bridge wings since Squadron One's cutters served during the eligibility period of 1 March 1961 to 28 March 1973.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E
50|$|Fins with {{self-adjusting}} camber {{offer the}} improved qualities in both <b>port</b> side <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> side sailing directions.|$|R
50|$|During January and February 2016, Loch Portain {{was fitted}} with a {{passenger}} lift and 2 MES evacuation systems, 1 <b>port</b> <b>and</b> 1 <b>starboard,</b> whilst dry docking in Birkenhead.|$|R
60|$|The wind returned, and the PYRENEES, her deck {{smoking and}} shimmering {{in the bright}} gray light, ran off dead to leeward. Then she worked back, <b>port</b> tack <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> tack, crisscrossing her track, combing the sea for the Acteon Islands, which the {{masthead}} lookouts failed to sight.|$|R
5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard.</b> The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E
25|$|The {{electric}} power {{produced by the}} main engines and generators was transformed into propeller thrust by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline propulsion motor, located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500hp motors while the <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> propulsion motors, located side-by-side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.|$|E
25|$|One level {{down was}} Pont Promenade, the main Tourist Class deck. The main lounges and rooms here were the , , , and {{orchestra}} {{level of the}} theatre. Like the Pont Veranda, Pont Promenade also had a glass-enclosed promenade along the <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> sides of the ship, though the windows did not run full height, nor were the spaces as long.|$|E
50|$|The {{number and}} shape of the wings varies widely on {{different}} types. A given wing plane may be full-span or divided by a central fuselage into <b>port</b> (left) <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> (right) wings. Occasionally even more wings have been used, with the three-winged triplane achieving some fame in WWI. The four-winged quadruplane and other multiplane designs have had little success.|$|R
500|$|Gothenburg was {{commissioned}} in 1855 following her construction at Lungley's building yards in Millwall, London. She was a 501-ton, [...] vessel, with a , coal-burning engine. She was rigged as barquentine, with her funnel set well aft between the main and mizzen masts. She was fitted with four lifeboats, two <b>port</b> <b>and</b> two <b>starboard.</b>|$|R

Occasionally even more wings have been used, with the three-winged triplane achieving some fame in WWI. The four-winged quadruplane and other Multiplane (aeronautics) designs have had little success.|$|R
25|$|The {{choice of}} annular {{radiators}} for engine cooling on the Ju 88, which placed these radiators immediately forward of each engine and directly behind each propeller, allowed the cooling lines for the engine coolant and oil-cooling radiators (integrated within the annular design) {{to be as}} short as possible, with integral <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> air intakes for cooling the exhaust headers, the starboard inlet also supplying the inlet air for the supercharger.|$|E
25|$|Armament was {{increased}} over the previous classes, {{with a pair of}} QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I - IV guns, with one gun mounted on a small shelter forward and another on the quarterdeck and five QF 3 inch 12 pounder guns mounted staggered to <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard.</b> The number of torpedoes was initially three in unreloadable tubes; but this was quickly changed to two in reloadable tubes in operational service.|$|E
25|$|The Be-103 is a mid-wing monoplane, {{making use}} of the {{modified}} wing roots as water-displacing sponsons. It features an all-moving slab tail and retractable tricycle landing gear for land operations. Its hallmark and most distinguishing design feature is the water-displacing wing, an unusual feature for a seaplane, with three aquaplaning implements (planing step, <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> wing trailing edges) which substantially enhance the aircraft's on-the-water stability and seaworthiness.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the power consumed by the radar, the thrusters which propel the vessel are electric and require substantial power. The maximum speed is approximately 8 kn. To support this and all other electrical equipment, the vessel currently has six 3.6-megawatt generators (12-cylinder Caterpillar diesels). The generators are in two compartments, one <b>port</b> <b>and</b> one <b>starboard.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Deck C (lower deck): has 22 D-category cabins between 5 and 7m²: 12 outside cabins (6 on <b>port</b> <b>and</b> 6 on <b>starboard),</b> <b>and</b> 10 inside cabins with between 2 - 4 {{beds and}} a sink (a washroom/shower is {{found on the}} floor); ...|$|R
50|$|On 3 January 1957, the {{ice pack}} had loosened; and enabled Northwind {{to lead the}} {{battered}} Arneb into port. After unloading the cargo, the crew repaired the cracks and split seams by listing the ship alternately to <b>port</b> <b>and</b> to <b>starboard.</b> Although having suffered a bent rudder post and a broken propeller blade, Arneb was able to continue the operation.|$|R
25|$|Later {{production}} was Hitachi's standard Type-M steam ship modified (Type-MA) to carry twelve Toku-Daihatsu class landing craft. The landing craft were launched from rails which {{ran along the}} main deck (between <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> funnels for those carried forward of the superstructure) down to the waterline through large hinged doors at the stern. Settsu Maru survived {{for use as a}} repatriation ship, but her sister-ships were sunk in air raids on Japanese ports.|$|E
25|$|Until 2011 the Fremantle Football Club {{used the}} anchor symbol {{as the basis}} for all of their {{guernsey}}s. The home guernsey was purple, with a white anchor on the front separating the chest area into two panels, which were coloured red and green to represent the traditional maritime <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> colours. The away or clash guernsey was all white with a purple anchor. Since the end of the 2010 home and away season the home jumper is purple with 3 white chevrons and the away jumper is white with 3 purple chevrons.|$|E
25|$|Having {{learned from}} attacks in Canadian waters {{during the early}} weeks of the Battle of the St. Lawrence, a series of armed {{military}} ships escorted the convoy at various times during its short journey. The corvette Arrowhead, with the escort commander, Commander E.G. Skinner aboard and the minesweeper Truro were positioned <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> respectively of the lead merchant vessel. The motor launch Q-083 was situated {{in front of the}} convoy while Q-065 was positioned astern of the last merchant ship. Further to the naval escort, three Hudson light bombers operating from the airfield at Mont-Joli provided air cover during daylight hours.|$|E
50|$|A brace on a square-rigged ship is a rope (line) used {{to rotate}} a yard around the mast, {{to allow the}} ship to sail at {{different}} angles to the wind. Braces are always used in pairs, one {{at each end of}} a yard (yardarm), termed <b>port</b> brace <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> brace of a given yard or sail (e.g., the starboard main-brace is the brace fixed to the right end of the yard of the main sail).|$|R
50|$|These cruisers were {{initially}} converted into all-missile warships with no naval guns, but later on, two open-mount Mk 24 5-inch 38 calibre guns {{were added to}} the <b>port</b> side <b>and</b> the <b>starboard</b> side, near their aft exhaust stacks.|$|R
50|$|Although Uckers {{is often}} {{played on a}} Ludo board a true Uckers board is a mirror image so the red and green squares are {{presented}} to the player facing them in the correct Naval manner, ie red to <b>port</b> <b>and</b> green to <b>starboard.</b>|$|R
25|$|While during normal icebreaking {{operations}} each {{main generator}} fed its dedicated double-armature electric motor, the diesel generator supplying the forward propulsion motor {{could also be}} switched to supply electricity to either of the stern motors. In addition, the current {{from any of the}} main generators could be split between the <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> propulsion motors with the control of both motors remaining independent from each other. While the stern propulsion motors were built for double torque to overcome the additional loads from propeller-ice interaction, the electric motor driving the forward-facing propeller was dimensioned for a three-fold torque to keep the propeller turning in difficult ice conditions. The nominal speeds of the propulsion motors were 140 rpm in the stern and 160 rpm in the bow.|$|E
25|$|Back home at Little Creek, Virginia, Tucumcari {{continued}} its mission of demonstrating hydrofoil technology. Deployments included coastal surveillance with the U.S. Coast Guard out of Woods Hole, Massachusetts and further V.I.P. demonstrations at Annapolis, Maryland and Washington, D.C. On 16 November 1972, Tucumcari suffered a serious accident. While participating in simulated combat operations with other amphibious forces off Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, she unexpectedly ran aground. Hitting a coral reef at 40+ knots, Tucumcari was stopped dead within {{the length of}} her hull, forcing the front strut aft and shearing off the <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> foils. Several crewmen were injured and two crewmen had to be air lifted by helicopter from the grounded vessel. Fortunately, all the crewmen recovered from their injuries.|$|E

5000|$|In September 1979 after fires {{broke out}} in the <b>port</b> engine room <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> engine room [...] {{assisted}} in towing the boat to Gibraltar. The boat was in serious trouble as she also suffered from battery depletion that was performed at the time the fires broke out leaving the boat with 10% battery power.|$|R
50|$|The {{class was}} {{designed}} {{with a very}} small length to beam ratio, it being {{thought at the time}} that this would increase fuel economy. This {{turned out not to be}} the case, and also and quite unexpectedly produced the need for a large amount of helm to be applied, sometimes to <b>port</b> <b>and</b> sometimes <b>starboard,</b> to keep the ship on a straight course. It is reported that on one occasion Agamemnon, with her helm amidships, turned a complete circle in 9 minutes and 10 seconds.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} lanes to <b>port</b> <b>and</b> two to <b>starboard</b> {{of the central}} casing. A {{hydraulically}} operated mezzanine deck along each side can be raised or lowered according to traffic requirements. Two stairways from the car deck bring passengers out in the entrance square on deck 4, where the passenger gangways enter.|$|R
25|$|The First Class cabins also showcased {{design and}} art, {{especially}} in the Appartements de Grand Luxe. There were two aboard the France, amidships, on the <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> sides, on Pont Supérieur. Each had a salon, dining room, two bedrooms, and three bathrooms. The Appartement de Grand Luxe Île de France held a painting, La place de la Concorde, by Bernard Lamotte, as well as one, Parc de Versailles, by Jean Carzou, who also designed the suite's main salon. Slightly less expensive were the Appartements de Luxe, of which there were 12, as the Appartement de Luxe Flandres with a painting of Jean Dries. Each of these was decorated by artists, including the bathrooms where mosaic artwork adorned the walls around tubs and showers. Some of the mosaics were by the sculptor Jacques Zwobada.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally a boat is {{organized}} so that alternate rowers row on <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> (or strokeside and bowside), with stroke on port side (having their blade {{to their own}} right) (strokeside). This is sometimes reversed, so that stroke {{is on the other}} side (having their blade to their own left); such a boat is usually described as 'bow rigged'. This is often on the basis of the abilities of the available personnel, to allow putting an experienced starboard side (bowside) rower in the stroke seat, for example but it is the norm for UK coastal rowers where racing is done clockwise around buoys. The eight in the illustration at the top of this article is rigged strokeside. If the eight were bow rigged, the oar for the stroke (number 8) rower would be on the other side of the boat (bowside/starboard).|$|E
25|$|The largest gun was a minion cannon {{which was}} brass, weighed about 1,200 pounds (545 kg), and could shoot a 3.5 pound (1.6 kg) {{cannonball}} almost a mile (1,600 m). The Mayflower also had {{on board a}} saker cannon of about 800 pounds (360 kg), and two base cannons that weighed about 200 pounds (90 kg) which shot a 3 to 5 ounce ball (85–140 g). She carried at least ten pieces of ordnance on the <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> sides of her gun deck: seven cannons for long range purposes, and three smaller guns often fired from the stern at close quarters that were filled with musket balls. Later at New Plymouth, Mayflower Master Jones unloaded four of the pieces to help fortify the colony against invaders, {{and would not have}} done so unless he was comfortable with the armament that he still had on board.|$|E
50|$|In a below deck-level overview, from bow to stern, the LBK had a <b>port</b> <b>and</b> a <b>{{starboard}}</b> coal bunker, <b>and</b> then, on the portside, a ratings’ washroom. To starboard {{were two}} toilets or heads which, having no lower venting to the sea, required emptying by the crew. In the after {{section of the}} hull the two Chrysler 65 bhp “Royal” six-cylinder marine petrol engines gave the LBK a maximum speed of 6-7 knots. The estimated endurance was 300 miles at 5 knots on 600 gallons of petrol carried in tanks fitted in the after peak.|$|R
50|$|Masts were fitted on the {{centerline}} of {{the vessel}} between hatches Nos. 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 4 and 5, to which cargo booms were rigged. Two king posts, one <b>port</b> <b>and</b> one <b>starboard,</b> were fitted at both the forward and after ends of the deck house. Hatches Nos. 1 and 5 were provided with two 5-ton booms and two winches each. Nos. 2, 3 and 4 hatches were provided with four 5-ton booms and four winches each. The cargo winches were driven by 50-horsepower electric motors, all installed on the main deck.|$|R
25|$|The traffic light, {{also known}} as traffic signal, is a {{signaling}} device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location. Its purpose is to indicate, using a series of colors, the correct moment to stop, drive, ride or walk, using a universal color code. The color of the traffic lights representing stop and go are likely derived from those used to identify <b>port</b> (red) <b>and</b> <b>starboard</b> (green) in maritime rules governing right of way, where the vessel on the left must stop for the one crossing on the right. In Salt Lake City, Utah, policeman Lester Wire invented the first red-green electric traffic lights.|$|R
