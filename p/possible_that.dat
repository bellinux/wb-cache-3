5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> {{she was only}} his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. Although {{there is a possibility}} that Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, it is also <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> {{settlements}} {{have existed}} {{in the area around}} Rivington since the Bronze Age. Arrowheads, a flint knife, scrapers and the remains of cremations were excavated from a Bronze Age cairn at Noon Hill in 1958 and 1963–64. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the name Coblowe on the eastern bank of the Lower Rivington Reservoir derives from the Old English hlaw, a hill, which denoted an ancient barrow or burial place. Evidence for the existence of a settlement here in Anglo-Saxon times is found in the Rivington and Coblowe names.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} a facade {{in front of the}} chamber, as is evident at other {{chambered}} tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and Wayland's Smithy.

Many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Æthelberht was {{converted}} to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. Æthelberht's {{wife was a}} Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, Æthelberht died in 618, this {{would be consistent with}} his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E
