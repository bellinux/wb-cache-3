It {{is designed to provide}} accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500km from its boundary, which is its primary service area. IRNSS will provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS) and is expected to provide a <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> of better than 20m in the primary service area. It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation, which is under total control of Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO initially planned to launch the constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly 2 years.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the ambient environmental temperature effect on the <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> of a periodically-moving carrier. The moving carrier was operated in an environmental chamber in which the operational temperature could be controlled by an air conditioning system. Different operational temperature modes, including a stable environment, a rise in temperature, a decline in temperature, summer daytime hours, and winter nighttime hours in terms of seasonal climate change in Taiwan, were generated within the environmental chamber by an air conditioning system to investigate the operational temperature’s effect on <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy.</b> From the experimental measurements of a periodically-moving carrier, {{it is found that}} the operational temperature conditions can significantly affect the <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the moving carrier, {{especially in the case of}} an operational temperature decline.

30|$|As can {{be noticed}} in two figures, the <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> for three PPP {{solutions}} is highly correlated to the session length. The <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> improves as the session length gets longer. In the BeiDou-only PPP solutions, it takes generally 2.7  h {{for the standard}} PPP solution to get converged to a 3 D accuracy of 10  cm, in contrast, only 32  min {{is required for the}} two ECMWF-augmented PPP solutions, representing a remarkable advancement of 80.6 %. After a 2.7 -h session length required for the standard PPP solution to get converged, the <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> for the two ECMWF-augmented PPP results are 6.6  cm, corresponding to an improvement of 34 %. In addition, the 3 D <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> for the two ECMWF-augmented PPP solutions are comparable in different session length. Regarding the BeiDou/GPS PPP results displayed in Fig.  4, higher <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> and shorter convergence time are attained in the BeiDou/GPS PPP solutions in contrast to the BeiDou-only PPP solutions, due to the increased satellites from an additional constellation. Nonetheless, the improvements in <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> brought by the introduced augmented method in the BeiDou/GPS PPP results do not reveal as dramatic as that in the BeiDou-only PPP solutions. Enhancements of over 10 % on 3 D <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> are obtained by the introduced augmented approaches in the BeiDou/GPS PPP solutions, compared to over 30 % in the BeiDou-only PPP case. The increased number of visible GNSS satellites and stronger satellite geometry strength are mainly responsible for this.

US banks on atmospheric model to assess frequency error and it has to update this model {{from time to time to}} assess the exact error. In India's case, the actual delay is assessed by measuring the difference in delay of dual frequency (S and L bands).

40|$|Localization {{systems for}} indoor areas have {{recently}} been suggested that make use of existing {{wireless local area network}} (WLAN) infrastructure and location fingerprinting approach. However, most existing research work ignores channel interference between wireless infrastructures and this could affect accurate and precise positioning. A better understanding of the properties of channel interference could assist in improving the <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> while saving significant amounts of resources in the location-aware infrastructure. This paper investigates to what extent the <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> is affected by channel interference between access points. Two sets of experiments compare how the <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> is affected in three different channel assignment schemes: ad-hoc, sequential, and orthogonal data is analyzed to understand what features of channel interference affect <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The results show that choosing an appropriate channel assignment scheme could make localization 10 % more accurate and reduce the number of access points that are required by 15 %.
