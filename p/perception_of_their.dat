5|$|Modern Ethiopian historiography was {{developed}} locally by native Ethiopians {{as well as}} by foreign historians, most notably Hiob Ludolf (1624–1704), the German orientalist who British historian Edward Ullendorff (1920–2011) considered the founder of Ethiopian Studies. The late 19th and early 20th centuries marked a period where Western historiographic methods were introduced and synthesized with traditionalist practices, embodied by works such as those by Heruy Wolde Selassie (1878–1938). The discipline has since developed new approaches in studying the nation's past and offered criticism of some traditional Semitic-dominated views that have been prevalent, sometimes at the expense of Ethiopia's traditional ties with the Middle East. Marxist historiography and African studies have also played significant roles in developing the discipline. Since the 20th century, historians have given greater consideration to issues of class, gender, and ethnicity. Traditions pertaining mainly to other Afroasiatic-speaking populations have also been accorded more importance, with literary, linguistic, and archaeological analyses reshaping the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> roles in historical Ethiopian society. Historiography of the 20th century focused largely on the Abyssinian Crisis of 1935 and the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, whereas the Ethiopian victory over the Kingdom of Italy in the 1896 Battle of Adwa {{played a major role in}} the historiographic literature of these two countries immediately following the First Italo-Ethiopian War.|$|E

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record (10026. 1 / 2769) on 03. 01. 2017 by CS (TIS) This research examines {{the quality of}} work life in a selection of pharmaceutical companies in Egypt. It aims to test {{the relationships between the}} employees' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quality <b>of</b> work life and; <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the degree of participation in decisionmaking available to them, <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> level <b>of</b> job satisfaction, <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> level <b>of</b> affective, continuance, and normative commitment, and the ownership form of the company. It uses a sample of 1270 employees in three different ownership forms; public, private, and multinational pharmaceutical companies in Egypt. The total sample size is proportionately distributed (i. e. the actual 'sample size has been distributed between the three ownership forms based on the percentage of employees in each ownership form to the total size of the population) among', the three, forms Of ownership (public companies 889, private companies = 165, and multinational companies = 216 employee). The number of employees surveyed in each company has also been proportionately distributed. The <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the targeted employees are surveyed using a questionnaire that contains 81 items. The collected data are analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) programme. The findings of the study indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between the employees' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quality <b>of</b> work life and; <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the degree of participation in decision-making available to them, and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> level <b>of</b> job satisfaction. A significant positive and partial relationship is found between the employees' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quality <b>of</b> work life and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> III <b>their</b> level <b>of</b> affective, continuance, and normative commitment, as it is expected, by the researcher, that the employees' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quality <b>of</b> work life may positively affect <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> level <b>of</b> affective, continuance, and normative commitment through affecting <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> level <b>of</b> job satisfaction. A significant relationship is found between the employees' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quality <b>of</b> work life and the ownership form of the company. The results also indicate that employees perceive <b>their</b> quality <b>of</b> work life to be greater or better in the multinational pharmaceutical companies than are the employees' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quality <b>of</b> work life in both the private and public pharmaceutical companies in Egypt. Furthermore, the results indicate that the employees' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quality <b>of</b> work life in the private phan-naceutical companies are better than the employees' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quality <b>of</b> work life in the public phan-naceutical companies in Egypt. A set of quality of work life criteria that seems important to employees in the pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, and which might therefore be productively addressed by employers/organisations has been identified. In addition, some implications for HR practices in Egypt have been raised and discussed. Finally, a set of models that could clarify the interactive relationship between the variables that have been investigated in this research in the Egyptian context has been developed. It is suggested that the set of quality of work life criteria as well as the models might fon-n the basis for future researches of this type...|$|R

Self-determination theory provides a theoretical framework for understanding the relations between students' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> relationship with their teacher and classroom experiences to student motivation by identifying factors that support students' needs to feel related, competent, and autonomous within the context <b>of</b> <b>their</b> classroom. Research confirms the developmental and motivational importance of each of these factors and has identified specific teacher behaviors and classroom practices that support and/or undermine students' experiencing of these needs, yet relatively little research examines these relationships during children's early school experiences. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop and validate a new instrument, Primary Students' <b>Perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Their</b> Classroom Experiences (PSPCE), to assess first- and second-grade students' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> teacher involvement and support for students' reading competence and autonomy and then to examine the relationships among these variables and students' reading motivation. Observational data and interviews with 108 first- and second-grade students indicate first- and second-grade students' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> classroom experiences can be validly assessed. Teacher Interest in Students and Teacher Support for Students' Reading Competence emerged as two factors worth considering as predictors of students' reading motivation. Students' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> teacher's interest in them predicted <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> reading competence controlling for reading achievement; however, neither students' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> teacher interest in them nor <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> teacher support for their reading competence predicted students' reading enjoyment. The PSPCE shows promise for providing educators and researchers with an instrument for assessing first- and second-grade students' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> classroom experiences. When supported with student interviews and classroom observations, the instrument has the potential for assessing the general classroom climate and identifying students at risk for developing negative <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> reading competence. Research in more diverse classrooms is needed to strengthen the validity of the findings and generalizability to other populations and contexts. Further studies may also identify personal and contextual variables affecting students' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> classroom experiences, the stability <b>of</b> students' <b>perceptions</b> over time, and the relative influence <b>of</b> students' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> experiences on other outcomes...|$|R

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the binding problem and multisensory perception {{can be thought of}} as a question – the binding problem, and potential solution – multisensory perception. The binding problem stemmed from unanswered questions about how mammals (particularly higher primates) generate a unified, coherent <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> surroundings from the cacophony of electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations that forms the physical basis of the world around us. It was investigated initially in the visual domain (colour, motion, depth, and form), then in the auditory domain, and recently in the multisensory areas. It can be said therefore, that the binding problem is central to multisensory perception.|$|E
25|$|State {{policy of}} social classes: The State enforces a rigidly {{stratified}} society with entrenched patterns of official discrimination. A citizen's potential success {{in life and}} the level of services provided by the State are predetermined by a State-assigned social class (songbun). Each individual's and family's designation is decided according to the apparatus' <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ideological loyalty to the regime. Discrimination applies to geographic segregation, occupation, criminal punishment, and access to food, housing, health care, and education. Applying intergenerational responsibility and collective punishment, a family's social class (songbun) is passed down to its children and grandchildren. Each individual's status is recorded in a registration system, inaccessible to him or her. The lowest songbun was given to groups including former wealthy industrialists, alleged spies, Catholics, Buddhists, and South Korean prisoners of war.|$|E

Moreover, we tested whether clients' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the working alliance and the real relationship mediated the relationship between clients' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> psychotherapists' MCO and psychological functioning. The results showed that clients' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> psychotherapists' MCO were positively related to working alliance, real relationship, and psychological functioning. Only clients' ratings of the working alliance mediated the relationship between clients' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> psychotherapists' MCO and psychological functioning. Thus, because clients perceive their psychotherapists as being more oriented toward cultural issues, they may view the therapist as being more credible and may gain a sense of comfort in the therapeutic process.

25|$|Seniors’ {{subjective}} health remains {{relatively stable}} while objective health worsens with age. Furthermore, {{it seems that}} the perceived health improves with age when objective health is controlled in the equation. This phenomenon is known as the paradox of ageing. People's expectations concerning health co-evolve with the health norms surrounding one's age. Elderly people often associate their functional and physical decline with the normal ageing process. The elderly may actually enhance their <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own health through social comparison; for instance, the older people get, the more they may consider themselves in better health than their same-aged peers. Hence, the older a person becomes and the more their actual health declines, the greater the potential role is for social comparison processes to create a gap between a person's objective and subjective health.|$|E
25|$|Zeffirelli filmed his Romeo and Juliet {{shortly after}} {{completing}} {{work on his}} 1967 film The Taming of the Shrew, and had learned from his experience on that project {{that it was better}} not to include speeches made redundant by his vivid images. He played around 35% of Shakespeare's script, enhancing the focus on the two central characters and making them more sympathetic, while simplifying their roles to make them less tricky for his young leads to play. He tellingly juxtaposes the betrothal of Juliet and Paris with the Capulets' crumbling marriage. Yet the film is often noted for its zest for life and for love: the former epitomised by John McEnery's Mercutio, the latter by Leonard Whiting's Romeo. In contrast to Renato Castellani's 1954 version, Zeffirelli highlighted Romeo's positive relationships with the Friar, Balthazar and Mercutio. The way in which Mercutio physically collapses onto Romeo after the Queen Mab speech, and again when mortally wounded, has been credited with introducing homosexual overtones into the public <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> relationship.|$|E

Virtually no investigations have been reported into the learning environment of the secondary mathematics classroom. The study reported in this thesis focusses on the <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> 490 grade 9 mathematics students in 23 classrooms in 14 schools in Adelaide, South Australia.
