6000|$|... § VI. Now, it also happens, {{from its}} place in buildings, that the {{sectional}} roof over a narrow space {{will need to be}} considered before we come to the expanded roof over a broad one. For when a wall has been gathered, as above explained, into piers, that it may better bear vertical pressure, it is generally necessary that it should be expanded again at the top into a continuous wall before it carries the true roof. Arches or lintels are, therefore, thrown from <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> <b>pier,</b> and a level preparation for carrying the real roof is made above them. After we have examined the structure of piers, therefore, we shall have to see how lintels or arches are thrown from <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> <b>pier,</b> and the whole prepared for the superincumbent roof; this arrangement being universal in all good architecture prepared for vertical pressures: and we shall then examine the condition of the great roof itself. And because the structure of the roof very often introduces certain lateral pressures which {{have much to do with}} the placing of buttresses, it will be well to do all this before we examine the nature of buttresses, and, therefore, between parts (B) and (C) of the above plan, § IV. So now we shall have to study: (A) the construction of walls; (B) that of piers; (C) that of lintels or arches prepared for roofing; (D) that of roofs proper; and (E) that of buttresses.|$|E

5|$|On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the {{southern}} {{side of the}} pier, causing four shops {{and part of the}} deck to collapse onto the beach below. Several columns were also dislodged, and the ship's bowsprit hit the pier entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto the <b>pier.</b> Damage <b>to</b> the <b>pier</b> was estimated <b>to</b> be £5,000 and was promptly repaired.|$|R
40|$|The most {{existing}} pier-scour equations mainly apply <b>to</b> uniformly shaped <b>piers.</b> However, pier footings {{may often}} project above the streambed because of scour. This {{may be caused}} by either long-term bed degradation or local scour. In such cases, the computation of the local bridge scour depth becomes complicated because of the difficulty in choosing an appropriate <b>pier</b> dimension. Referring <b>to</b> <b>piers</b> founded on piles, in previous papers some outcomes were achieved, mainly on the quasi-equilibrium scour depth. Based on additional experiments, this paper would like {{to come up with a}} deepening of the previous findings and provide new insights on the temporal evolution of the river-bed morphology around the complex pier-plinth-piles...|$|R

For instance, {{the unhappy}} {{alterations}} which have lately {{taken place in}} the town of Lucerne have still spared two of its ancient bridges; both of which, being long covered walks, appear, in past times, to have been to the population of the town what the Mall was to London, or the Gardens of the Tuileries are to Paris. For the continual contemplation of those who sauntered from <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> <b>pier,</b> pictures were painted on the woodwork of the roof. These pictures, in the one bridge, represent all the important Swiss battles and victories; in the other they are the well-known series of which Longfellow has made so beautiful a use in the Golden Legend, the Dance of Death.|$|E

50|$|The bridge {{builders}} erected (spliced) seven ferroconcrete supports {{into the}} foundations of the former cutwaters and constructed two new abutments. The installation of 100 metres long trusses between the piers was carried out by the balanced cantilever method — from <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> <b>pier</b> — with the use of cranes passing through the top and inside of the trusses.|$|E
50|$|For a port to {{efficiently}} {{send and}} receive cargo, it requires infrastructure: docks, bollards, pilings, cranes, bulk cargo handling equipment, and so on - equipment and organization supporting {{the role of the}} facilities. From <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> <b>pier</b> these may differ, one dock handling intermodal transport needs (container-ships linked to rail by cranes); another bulk handling capabilities (such as conveyors, elevators, tanks, pumps) for loading and unloading bulk cargoes like grain, coal, or fuels. Others may be outfitted as passenger terminals or for mixed mode operations. Generally, Harbors, seaports and marinas all host watercraft, and consist of components such as piers, wharfs, docks and roadsteads.|$|E

25|$|Workers {{repeat the}} entire process three more times until the ice pier is {{approximately}} 6.7m (22ft) thick. Wooden utility poles drilled about four deep into the final ice pier support electrical and telephone service <b>to</b> the <b>pier.</b> Moreover, during the final construction phase, personnel mount shorter poles in the ice edge to serve as bollards <b>to</b> secure the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> the shore at McMurdo. A 15–20cm (6–8in) layer of volcanic gravel tops off the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> provide a non-slip surface and to insulate the ice from the summer sun.|$|R
50|$|In July 2006, Hastings Borough Council, upon {{discovering}} {{that part of}} the pier's structure was unsafe, promptly closed the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> the general public. Protracted legal wranglings between the pier's owners, Ravenclaw Investments, and Hastings Borough Council followed. Finally, Stylus Sports, a pier tenant who operated the gaming attractions, in conjunction with Hastings Borough Council, funded much of the needed £300,000 of repairs, which enabled the court order closing the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> be lifted. This financial infusion enabled the majority of the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> reopen on 4 July 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} of the coal tipple is {{constructed}} from ten concrete piers that define three bays on the longer sides and two on the shorter. The bays are composed of arches running from <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> <b>pier.</b> Some bays are entirely open, while others are filled with a concrete panel. A wide horizontal concrete belt course above the arches defines the base of the structure's second level. This level has bays aligned with those on the first story, with all containing recessed rectangular planes without windows. This level originally contained coal storage. The wider central bay continues upward to form a third story with a gabled concrete roof.|$|E
5000|$|A {{detailed}} {{survey of the}} upper surface of the reef was made in 1871, by Mr. William Preass, assisted by Mr. F. Sylvester. They took more than sixteen thousand soundings, each separately located, by means of instruments, from the shore. Great pains were taken to delineate exactly {{the surface of the}} rocks. The appropriation of 1871 was two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, — just one-half the amount asked for by Gen. Newton, who regretted that the beginning of operations on the Gridiron was thus prevented, as he considered this rock more dangerous to the navigation of large vessels than Hallett's-Point Reef. For the next year he asked six hundred thousand dollars, but got less than half that sum. About the middle of November, 1873, work was suspended for want of funds; {{at the end of the}} fiscal year, June 30, 1874, it was found, that, for the four months and a half during which operations had been carried on, 896 linear feet of tunnels had been opened, and 4,648 cubic yards of rock removed. The total length of tunnels and galleries then amounted to 6,780.67 feet. The excavation now being nearly finished, the manner of finally blowing up the whole mine began to exercise the minds of the engineers. Gen. Newton finally suggested his own plan for blowing up the reef at Hallett's Point, which was to perforate each pier with drill-holes entirely or partly through its mass, a sufficient number of these being provided to complete the destruction of the pier when fully charged. The charges in the different holes of the same pier were to be connected together; and a fuse, composed of a quick explosive, would connect the system of charges in each pier with those of the neighboring piers. By this mode, the communication of heat or the electric spark to a few centres of explosion would suffice to propagate it through the whole system, because the explosion of the connecting fuse would advance more rapidly than the demolition of the rock. Gen. Newton's plan was adopted, with few slight changes, principally suggested by himself. Instead of depending on explosives to convey fire from <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> <b>pier</b> throughout the mine, an electric spark was sent directly to every centre, insuring the simultaneous explosion of the whole mine. It was decided that the minimum amount of explosives could be determined by placing one charge in each square pier and two in each oblong pier but this mode would make the lines of least resistance the maximum, and thus increase the shock, which would be propagated through the reef to the dwellings upon the land. It was therefore determined to decrease the lines of least resistance, which would multiply the number of blasts, and increase the quantity of explosives, but would, at the same time, reduce to a minimum the vibrating influence through the reef. It was, therefore, calculated that the exterior effect, except an agitation of water, would be small.|$|E
50|$|In August 2010, Anglesey County Council {{approved}} {{plans for}} the refurbishment of the <b>pier,</b> <b>to</b> include: reinstatement of the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> its former width (doubling its 1960s width); complete replacement of the decking; refurbishment of the kiosk and shelters; provision of a moveable landing pontoon, allowing its preservation during the winter storms.|$|R

50|$|The final {{redesign}} of the Main street bridge {{was of the}} piers. The original design called for two 'V-piers', formed by the convergence of the main arch and the secondary arches on either side. This design proved to be nearly impossible to make structurally sound forcing engineers <b>to</b> simplify the <b>piers.</b> <b>To</b> do so they created a 'crescent pier' shape, which removes the two smaller arches on either end and creates a larger <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> provide better support.|$|R
