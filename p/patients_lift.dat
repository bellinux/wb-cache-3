50|$|Most of the {{literature}} published on homework in psychotherapy to date focuses on homework use during CBT, which involves changing patients' thoughts and behaviors to reduce the symptoms of the mental disorders from which they are suffering. A variety of homework assignments exist in CBT. These tasks can range from scheduling a daily exercise routine to practicing progressive muscle relaxation {{five times a day}} to monitoring and recording one's negative automatic thoughts throughout the day. In practice, these homework assignments are meant to help <b>patients</b> <b>lift</b> their mood, practice and master skills they developed in therapy, and progressively improve between treatment sessions. Research has found that homework compliance positively predicts successful outcomes in therapy, and therapists are now looking for better ways to implement homework, so that more individuals may receive its benefits.|$|E
40|$|There is {{controversy}} over whether leg lifting in full extension following {{anterior cruciate ligament}} reconstruction (ACLR) will threaten the graft. We reviewed published biomechanical studies of normal knees which suggest that while full passive extension of the knee joint will not strain the graft, an active leg lift will subject the ACL graft to strain. There is, however, evidence that ACL strain is greater at 20 - 30 ° flexion than near full extension. We therefore recommend that if ACLR <b>patients</b> <b>lift</b> their recently operated leg, provided there is no limitation of passive extension, they should do so with the knee joint near full extension rather than in 20 - 30 ° flexion...|$|E

40|$|This field study, {{conducted}} at an acute care hospital, evaluated a participatory ergonomics (PE) intervention {{to implement a}} safe <b>patient</b> <b>lifting</b> program. Participatory ergonomics is a method that actively involves employees in developing and implementing ergonomic improvements for their workplace to increase acceptance and effectiveness of workplace changes (Imada, 2002). Although professional guidelines recommend employee participation {{as a component of}} safe <b>patient</b> <b>lifting</b> programs, PE is not consistently applied in practice and not yet well validated as an intervention in the research literature. The goal of the PE intervention {{in the present study was}} to encourage usage of <b>patient</b> <b>lifting</b> equipment in order to decrease the incidence, severity, and cost of injuries to nurses and aides. With management support, representative employees in teams provided program suggestions that were implemented including lifting equipment purchases, storage locations, and a patient mobility assessment process. ^ Four primary sources of data were used to evaluate the intervention; PE process measures, objective usage frequency, employee surveys, and workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation records. After assessing pre and post lifting equipment usage patterns via researcher observations, it was concluded that usage frequency increased after the intervention, as hypothesized. Additional post intervention measures of usage including employee interviews provided convergent support for this finding. As expected, results from a pre and post survey indicated improved employee perceptions of involvement in decisions about <b>patient</b> <b>lifting</b> work procedures, with an increase in perceived management support by employees. Employee support for safer <b>patient</b> <b>lifting</b> as well as co-worker support remained high on both the pre and post survey.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} behavioural patterns in relation to physical strain among nurses in their work environment. In doing this we are conducting participant observations on Amager Hospital and Hvidovre Hospital, consisting of 53 hours of observation in total. The study has an explorative approach and emphasis the use of hypothesis and critical rationalism to reach new knowledge. Thereby the study reach one overarching hypothesis: Nurses make more systemat-ic errors in <b>patient</b> <b>lifting</b> and movement in stressed situations compared to non-stressed situations. A further analysis of the hypothesis involves a deeper look into the psychology of stress and cogni-tive biases which courses systematic errors of judgement and behaviour. Also, the experience of pain is explored in relation to another hypothesis about how the expectation of having to hurry, when patients are {{in a lot of}} pain, may be uncalled for. At last, a discussion of the role of technolog-ical devices for <b>patient</b> <b>lifting</b> and movement, and of rushing to solutions, leads to further hypothe-sis’ for future work, and to a design for a workshop aimed to create solutions. ...|$|R

50|$|As in the United Kingdom, slips, {{trips and}} falls are common and account for 20-40% of {{disabling}} occupational injuries. Often these accidents {{result in a}} back injury that can persist to a permanent disability. In the United States, {{a high risk of}} back injuries occurs in the health care industry. 25% of reported injuries in health care workers in the state of Pennsylvania are for back pain. Among nurses, the prevalence of lower back pain may be as high as 72% mostly as a result of transferring patients. Fortunately, some of these injuries can be prevented with the availability of <b>patient</b> <b>lifts,</b> improved worker training, and allocation of more time to perform work procedures. Another common type of injury is carpal tunnel syndrome associated with overuse of the hands and wrists. Studies on a cohort of newly hired workers have thus far identified forceful gripping, repetitive lifting of > 1 kg, and using vibrating power tools as high risk work activities.|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the physiological demands and low back neuromuscular fatigue patterns following a daytime work shift of 21 female nurses working in geriatric wards. Subjects' heart rate (HR) at work was monitored for 8 h and surface electromyogram (EMG) of their back muscle was recorded during a 1 -minute horizontal trunk holding test {{before and after}} work. Results showed that the nurses had heart rates exceeding 90 beats/min in 57 % and 110 beats/min in 19 % of their working hours. The EMG revealed a significant drop in initial median frequency (MF) (p= 0. 04) and increase in negative slope of the MF/time plot (p< 0. 001) of the back muscle after work. These suggest that the muscles were fatigued after work. The nurses rated <b>patient</b> <b>lifting,</b> transfer and turning as most physically demanding, and these corresponded to the highest heart rates recorded. The physiological and neuromuscular strain on the nurses indicated that extreme care should be exercised at work, particularly {{towards the end of}} a work shift when the muscles have become fatigued.

40|$|Background: Patient {{handling}} is a {{major risk}} factor for work-related injuries among nurses. Inadequate and inappropriate safe patient handling practices contribute to increased work-related injuries, lost/restricted work days, and hospital costs. Purpose: The focus {{of this study was}} to increase the use of mechanical lift equipment and Lift Team to reduce the incidence of work-related injuries among nursing staff involved in patient handling activities on the Medical-Cardiac IICU. Methodology: The theoretical framework employed for this project was Lippitt’s change theory. Pre-and post-survey self-report evaluations were conducted prior to and following the implementation of the Bedside Mobility Assessment Tool (BMAT) and unit specific Equipment Options Tool to measure the effectiveness of the intervention. Results: A comparison of the pre- and post- survey RN results indicated that the greatest percent change (> 10 %) increase included: understanding that injuries can be avoided with proper lifting and transferring of patients (18. 3 %), utilization of <b>patient</b> <b>lifting</b> and transferring devices whenever possible (14. 6 %), understanding how to select appropriate lifting equipment based o...|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{is a large}} gap in {{research}} with regard to back pain (BP) among home care nursing personnel (HCNP); only seven {{studies have been conducted}} worldwide. There is a need to identify the magnitude of and risk factors for BP that are unique to Hong Kong (HK) HCNP. Methods: A total population sampling technique was employed in this cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. Hierarchical multiple logistic regression analyses were used to control for potentially confounding variables. Results: The 12 -month prevalence of upper and lower BP was 71. 2 % (n = 265). Three predictors were identified: physical risk factors in the office (OR = 3. 57, 95 % CI = 1. 55 - 8. 24), static postures (OR = 1. 41, 95 % CI = 1. 04 - 1. 90), and psychological job demands (OR = 1. 11, 95 % CI = 1. 01 - 1. 22). Conclusion: HCNP in HK have a high prevalence of BP. BP in HK HCNP is independently attributable to physical work factors in the office, static postures, and psychological job demands, and is not primarily associated with <b>patient</b> <b>lifting</b> and transferring which are traditionally identified as risk factors for BP in hospital nursing personnel.

40|$|This paper {{takes as}} its focus {{one of the}} Edwardian period’s most {{dramatic}} and little-understood paintings of a medical examination: George Washington Lambert’s Chesham Street (1910). The painting shows an upper-class male <b>patient</b> <b>lifting</b> his shirt to reveal a muscular torso for examination by the doctor in the scene and the viewers outside it. The subject of a medical examination, I argue, legitimised the scrutiny of exposed male flesh and offered an opportunity for sensual pleasure between men. By way of a comparison with other portraits of the artist from around the same period, I interpret Chesham Street as a patient self-portrait, which reveals the artist’s dual personalities of bohemian artist and Australian boxer: two personae that did not combine seamlessly, as revealed by the composite nature of the patient in Chesham Street. From {{a discussion of the}} artist as patient, I move to an analysis of other self-portraits by Lambert in which the artist is shown flexing his muscles, especially in the context of his passion for boxing. I consider how these portraits serve as complex inscriptions of illness and health and how this relates to the experience of living and working as an Australian expatriate artist in London in the early twentieth century...|$|R
