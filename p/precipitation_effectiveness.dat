5|$|The {{moisture}} classification includes climatic {{classes with}} descriptors such as hyperhumid, humid, subhumid, subarid, semi-arid (values of −20 to −40), and arid (values below −40). Humid regions experience more precipitation than evaporation each year, while arid regions experience greater evaporation than precipitation {{on an annual}} basis. A total of 33percent of the Earth's landmass is considered either arid or semi-arid, including southwest North America, southwest South America, most of northern and {{a small part of}} southern Africa, southwest and portions of eastern Asia, as well as much of Australia. Studies suggest that <b>precipitation</b> <b>effectiveness</b> (PE) within the Thornthwaite moisture index is overestimated in the summer and underestimated in the winter. This index can be effectively used to determine the number of herbivore and mammal species numbers within a given area. The index is also used in studies of climate change.|$|E

In this section we employ indices or models to analyze the impacts associated with these scenarios on the thermal climate (growing degree days), the moisture climate (<b>precipitation</b> <b>effectiveness),</b> the combined thermal-moisture effects (climatic index of agricultural potential which reflects biomass potential), and on drought frequency...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>precipitation</b> <b>effectiveness</b> on the yield of Irish potato in Jos-Plateau, Nigeria. Rainfall data for 20 years (1989 – 2008) was {{collected}} from National Root Crop Research Institute (NRCRI), Vom, Plateau state. <b>Precipitation</b> <b>effectiveness</b> indices including dry spell or drought, onset dates of rains, and hydrologic ratio were derived from and used together with total annual rainfall data to assess their effects on yields of Irish potato. The indices were subjected to various descriptive and inferential statistical techniques, including correlation and regression analysis. While the correlation analysis was employed to determine the degree of relationship between yields and the indices, the regression technique was adopted to identify the factors that are critical in influencing yields. Results reveal that while rainfall total correlates positively with yields, dry spell, onset dates of rains and hydrologic ratio exhibit negative correlation with yields. The correlation between onset dates of rains and yields {{was found to be}} statistically significant at 5 % while others are insignificant. Step-wise regression analysis identifies onset dates of rains as the most critical factor affecting Irish potato in the area. The coefficient of determination of r 2 = 0. 219 shows that the index contributes about 22 % to variations in the yields of Irish potato on the Plateau. It was recommended that further studies should consider combine effects of climate and other factors like farming practices, soil factors and cultural practices of the farmers so as to generate comprehensive information for better agricultural planning and development in the area...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} rainfall variability {{and its implications}} for wheat production risk in northeast Germany. The hedging effectiveness of rainfall options and the role of geographical basis risk are analyzed using a daily precipitation model. Simpler pricing methods such as the burn analysis and the index value simulation serve as benchmarks for comparison. It is found that the choice of statistical approach may lead to considerable differences in the estimation results. Daily precipitation models should be used with some caution in the context of derivative pricing because they tend to underestimate rainfall variability. This is unexpected, because daily simulation models are usually preferred in the context of temperature-based weather indexes.

40|$|The {{impact of}} climate change on six <b>precipitation</b> <b>effectiveness</b> indices in {{northern}} Nigeria was examined using rainfall data of three decades (1976 - 2005). The six derived indices are: onset, cessation and length of rainy season, hydrologic ratio, seasonality index and occurrence of pentad dry spells. The derived indices were subjected to time series analysis. Results of the analysis showed that the rains now start late but end early as a result length of rainy season is decreasing. Northern Nigeria is becoming drier as the rainy season is now spread within fewer months. Frequency of dry spells of 5 days is decreasing, however, dry spells of 10, 15 or more days are on the increase. This is diminutive to agriculture and water resources {{as well as the}} biodiversity of the region. It is a threat to food security and sustainable development. There is therefore, the urgent need for the Nigerian government {{to come up with a}} concrete action plan to face this reality {{of climate change}}...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of climate on forest stand composition, development and growth is undeniable. Many studies {{have tried to}} quantify the effect of climatic variables on forest growth and yield. These works become especially important {{because there is a}} need to predict the effects of climate change on the development of forest ecosystems. One of the ways of facing this problem is the inclusion of climatic variables into the classic empirical growth models. The work has a double objective: (i) to identify the indicators which best describe the effect of climate on Pinus halepensis growth and (ii) to quantify such effect in several scenarios of rainfall decrease which are likely to occur in the Mediterranean area. A growth mixed model for P. halepensis including climatic variables is presented in this work. Growth estimates are based on data from the Spanish National Forest Inventory (SNFI). The best results are obtained for the indices including rainfall, or rainfall and temperature together, with annual precipitation, <b>precipitation</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> Emberger?s index or free bioclimatic intensity standing out among them. The final model includes Emberger?s index, free bioclimatic intensity and interactions between competition and climate indices. The results obtained show that a rainfall decrease about 5 % leads to a decrease in volume growth of 5. 5 ? 7. 5 % depending on site quality...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to rapid}} growth of population, massive {{deforestation}} and anthropogenic activities, noticeable change in climate conditions is being observed in Pakistan. Increased aridity due to climate change is a growing environmental problem of the agricultural country like Pakistan. It is essential to assess and monitor aridity to combat the probable land degradation and drought desertification. Identification of arid and semi arid regions on climatic basis is the first essential step in any project of land reclamation for agricultural and other purposes. A geographic information system is used in this paper {{for the assessment of}} aridity in Pakistan from long term climatic data of fifty years (1960 - 2009) collected from fifty four stations situated in the country. In the delineation of climatic zones and delimitation of their boundaries, five well known aridity models viz. De Martonne Aridity index, Erinc Aridity index, Thornthwaite <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Effectiveness</b> index, UNESCO Aridity index and Thornthwaite Moisture index are utilized for this purpose. The study shows that southern parts of the country are dry and more vulnerable to drought while the northern parts have variable types of climate. Almost 75 to 85 % of the total area of the country is arid in which most part lies in the south while less than 10 % area is humid lies in the north of the country. This study will be a good predicator for agricultural scientist, agronomist and hydrologist to plan according the climate of the region.

40|$|Although {{the annual}} {{diameter}} growth of trees {{is vital for}} assessing site suitability in terms of potential timber yield, the effects of climatic and topographic factors on this variable are poorly understood. The main objective {{of this study was}} to develop a tree-level radial growth model incorporating topographic and climatic factors for four major temperate tree species [red pine (Pinus densiflora), oak (Quercus spp.), Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi), and Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) ] in South Korea. The model was developed and then validated using increment cores sampled from permanent plots in the Korean National Forest Inventory country wide. The Standard Growth (SG) of each increment core, which eliminated the effect of tree age on radial growth, was derived using a SG model. Spatial autocorrelation was detected for the SGs of every species, but not for the original radial growth data. The results showed that using the SG model to standardize radial growth for age was successful for explaining the impact of topographic and climatic factors on radial growth. The influence of climatic (warmth index and <b>precipitation</b> <b>effectiveness</b> index) and topographic (topographic wetness index) factors on the SG of each species was evaluated by the estimated SG (eSG) model. Results show that for all species each variable was correlated to SG. The mean R 2 of the final radial growth model for red pine, oak, Japanese larch, and Korean pine during 2001 – 2009 were estimated to be 0. 71, 0. 73, 0. 67, and 0. 65, respectively. In addition, for every tree species the time sequence of estimated annual radial growth exhibited similar characteristics to that of the observed annual radial growth on an individual tree scale. Thus, this growth model can contribute to an understanding of the impacts of topographic and climatic factors on tree radial growth and predict the annual growth changes of major tree species in South Korea, given climate change...|$|E
40|$|Savannah-type {{ecosystems}} {{account for}} 26 – 30 % of global gross primary productivity GPP with water {{being one of}} the major driving factors. In Europe, savannah-type woodlands cover an area of about 1. 5 million ha. Here, the recent past has shown a significant 5 decrease of precipitation P in winter and spring as well as decrease of total annual precipitation. Strong effects on local water balance and carbon sink strength have thus been reported due to changes in precipitation regime. The objective {{of this study is to}} quantify the impact of the extreme drought event in 2012 on the water balance, gross primary productivity and carbon sink strength of 10 a typical Portuguese cork-oak woodland (montado) compared to the wet year 2011. Physiological responses of the dominant tree species Quercus suber (L.) are disentangled, employing combined photosynthesis and stomatal conductance modelling. <b>Precipitation</b> <b>effectiveness</b> ET/P increased from 86 % in 2011 to 122 % in the dry year 2012 due to deep soil or ground water access of the Q. suber trees leaving no 15 water for ground water replenishment. Understorey and overstorey GPP were strongly reduced by 53 % and 28 %, respectively, in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the late onset of the autumn rains in 2011 and an additional severe winter/spring drought. However, the ecosystem was still a carbon sink in both years but with a 38 % reduced sink strength under extreme drought in 2012 compared to 2011. The combined 20 photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model yielded best results if it was allowed to adjust photosynthetic and stomatal parameters simultaneously. If stomatal response was modelled with the Leuning approach, which allows for a different sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit, the stomatal model parameters were highly coupled. A change in either of the parameters needed to be compensated by the other to guarantee a sta 25 ble sensitivity of stomatal conductance to assimilation, independently from variations in vapour pressure deficit. The Q. suber trees showed a 31 % reduced stomatal conductance during the drought period 2012 compared to 2011 due to water supply limitations. In response to reduced leaf internal CO 2 availability, the trees strongly reduced appar-ent maximum carboxylation rate by 39 % in 2012 compared to 2011. Unexpectedly, the optimum temperature Topt of maximum electron transport rate decreased during the drought period, enhancing the susceptibility of the trees to high temperature stress during the summer. 5 Our results suggest that, if the trend of decreasing annual precipitation and changed precipitation pattern on the Iberian Peninsula continues, sustained effects on local ground water reservoirs, understorey species composition and tree mortality have to be expected in the long term. To successfully model the effect of drought on the montado ecosystem, variable apparent maximum carboxylation rate Vc,max, stomatal con 10 ductance parameter m and vapor pressure deficit sensitivity parameter D 0 need to be incorporated in photosynthesis-stomatal conductance modelling...|$|E
40|$|Salinity of {{brackish}} groundwater in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) {{is typically}} {{in the range}} of about 3, 000 - 30, 000 mg/L total dissolved solids (TDS) In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the potential use of membrane desalination technology for reducing the salinity SJV brackish water. Membrane desalination of SJV brackish water would have to be carried out at relatively high water recovery {{in order to reduce the}} volume of generated RO concentrate. However, at high water recoveries the concentration of mineral salt ions on the feed-side of the membrane may increase to levels that exceed the solubility limits of various sparingly water-soluble mineral salts (e. g., calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, and barium sulfate). The ensuing crystallization of these minerals results in scale build-up that leads to permeate flux decline, shortening of membrane life, and thus a reduction in process efficiency and increased operational cost. Therefore, process strategies must be designed to enhance product water recovery, while reducing the potential for mineral salt scaling. Accordingly, the principal objective of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of RO desalting of SJV brackish water. The present project focused on a systematic evaluation of: (a) the recovery limits for RO desalination of SJV AD water that are imposed by mineral salt scaling, and (b) the integration of accelerated precipitation (AP) of mineral salts with RO desalting to mitigate scaling and enable high RO recovery. AP treatment would serve to demineralize and desupersaturate the RO primary or secondary feed with respect to mineral salt scalants. In the first phase of the project, a systematic analysis based on multi-electrolyte thermodynamic solubility calculations was carried to determine the recovery limits due to mineral scaling. Subsequently, a detailed theoretical analysis and laboratory bench-scale studies were carried out with field water samples to assess mineral scaling propensity for a number of specific SJV water sources. In the second phase of the study, the integration of accelerated precipitation with RO desalting was investigated as a potential approach to lowering source water scaling propensity to enable enhanced water product water recovery. Analysis of historical water quality data and of recently obtained water field samples, from various locations in the San Joaquin Valley, demonstrated a significant variability of water salinity and scaling propensity with respect to calcite, gypsum, barite, and silica. The above analysis and experimental RO scaling tests suggested that the expected range of product water recovery by RO desalting across the SJV can be {{in the range of}} 50 %- 70 % for most of the sites, with the exception of the ERR site for which a much higher recovery was estimated (in excess of 90 %). The integration of accelerated precipitation with RO desalting was shown to be technically feasible for the range of brackish water quality in the San Joaquin Valley. In this process, the concentrate from primary RO (PRO) desalting would be treated by accelerated precipitation softening (i. e., chemical demineralization) or desupersaturated to lower the scaling propensity of this stream, followed by secondary RO (SRO) desalting. Overall recovery of up to ~ 90 %- 95 % could be achieved at an estimated cost of $ 0. 56 -$ 0. 98 per m 3 product water, with the ACP process accounting for about 15 %- 25 % of the overall water production cost. The present study demonstrated provided a framework for assessing RO recovery limits and thus identifying potential hurdles that should be addressed in pilot studies and ultimately in the design and implementation of large-scale RO desalting processes. It is expected that, the methods developed in the present study for scale characterization, evaluation of accelerated <b>precipitation</b> <b>effectiveness</b> and RO process performance analysis will significantly advance the knowledge base needed to arrive at optimal design and deployment of future RO brackish water desalination strategies for the San Joaquin Valley...|$|E
