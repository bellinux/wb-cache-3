5|$|More than 300 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} in the area, making Hengistbury Head an important migratory point. The Balearic shearwater, considered critically endangered with extinction by the IUCN and seldom sighted in the UK, has {{been seen in the}} area. Other rare birds spotted here include the purple heron, the <b>pink-footed</b> <b>goose,</b> the European honey buzzard and the melodious warbler. The fields and reserved areas near the car park provide an ideal spot to watch and listen to a significant population of skylarks during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, <b>pink-footed</b> <b>goose,</b> barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E

5|$|The {{vegetation}} on {{both sides}} of the fjord is High Arctic steppe, which is characterized by grasses. It is caused by extremely low precipitation, basic earth with salt deposits in the surface, and large areas of exposed mineral earth. The area around the fjord has a unique vegetation, which has not preserved in other areas of Svalbard. Along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs, it is the most exclusive flora in Svalbard. There are several unique species in the national park, including , which is featured in the national park's logo and for which Svalbard is the only known location in Europe, Puccinellia svalbardensis, Gentianella tenella and Kobresia simpliciuscula. There is breeding ground for <b>pink-footed</b> <b>goose</b> within the park, although Svalbard ptarmigan can also be found. Animals that can be found in the park include polar bear, Svalbard reindeer and Arctic fox.|$|E
500|$|The typical {{image of}} {{migration}} is of northern landbirds, such as swallows (Hirundinidae) and birds of prey, making long flights to the tropics. However, many Holarctic wildfowl and finch (Fringillidae) species {{winter in the}} North Temperate Zone, in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the <b>pink-footed</b> <b>goose</b> migrates from Iceland to Britain and neighbouring countries, whilst the dark-eyed junco migrates from subarctic and arctic climates to the contiguous United States and the American goldfinch [...] from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward to Western Oregon. Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents. [...] Some ducks, such as the garganey Anas querquedula, move completely or partially into the tropics. The European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca also follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.|$|E
2500|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{declared}} a Ramsar site and a Special Protection Area (SPA). In summer the salt marsh supports large numbers of breeding birds including black-headed gull, European herring gull, lesser black-backed gull, common tern and common redshank. Skylark, meadow pipit and linnet nest in significant numbers on the grazing marsh. [...] Management of the site involves grazing the salt marsh with cattle to maintain the short sward on which wintering wildfowl (especially Eurasian wigeon and the <b>pink-footed</b> <b>goose)</b> depend. The main area of salt marsh is grazed by approximately 800 cattle from May to October, forming {{one of the largest}} single herds of cattle in the UK. Wildfowling takes place on much of the reserve and improved management has contributed to {{the increase in the number}} of birds visiting the site. A group of volunteers led by the local Wildfowlers Association carries out much of the valuable maintenance work on the reserve.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a multidisciplinary study of a negotiation process between farmers and wildlife authorities which led to an agricultural subsidy scheme to alleviate conflicts between agriculture and geese in Norway. The Svalbard-breeding population of <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese</b> Anser brachyrhynchus has increased considerably over the last decades and conflicts with farmers have escalated, especially at stopover sites in spring when geese feed on newly sprouted pasture grass. In Vesterålen, an important stopover site for geese in North Norway, farmers deployed scaring of geese at varying intensity dependent {{on the level of}} conflict during 1988 – 2012. We assessed the efficiency of a subsidy scheme established in 2006, in terms of its conflict mitigation, reflected in a near discontinuation of scaring activities. The presence of <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese</b> was analysed in relation to scaring intensity, the total goose population size and the increasing occurrence of another goose species, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis. Scaring significantly affected the number of geese staging in Vesterålen, both in absolute and relative terms (controlling for total population size). The geese responded immediately to an increased, and reduced, level of scaring. Despite the establishment of the subsidy scheme, the number of <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese</b> has recently declined which is probably caused by the increasing number of barnacle geese. For the farmers, the subsidy scheme provides funding that reduces the economic costs caused by the geese. Sustaining a low level of conflict will require close monitoring, dialogue and adaptation of the subsidy scheme to cater for changes in goose populatio...|$|R
40|$|Six {{adult male}} <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese</b> (Anser brachyrhynchus), tagged with {{satellite}} transmitters, were tracked in Svalbard {{during the period}} of June–September in 2003 and 2004. The {{purpose of the study was}} to describe the movements and staging periods of individual geese during the post-breeding period to investigate a possible moult migration among <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese</b> in Svalbard. All geese moved about 200 km east from their potential breeding (summering) areas in western Spitsbergen. The preferred moulting area was the island of Edgeøya, where four geese staged prior to a southward autumn migration. Five geese left potential breeding areas between 11 and 30 June, and remained for more than 25 days in eastern areas during most of July, which we interpret as the moult migration of either failed or non-breeders. Geese left moulting areas in mid-August, using an average of 1. 4 staging areas before the autumn migration, suggesting that moult sites support pre-migration hyperphagia. Only one goose remained at the suspected breeding site from early June to early September. Mean monthly temperatures in the summering and moulting ranges of the geese were calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. The mean June moult range temperature (− 0. 9 °C) was significantly lower than that of the summering ranges (4. 6 °C). The July mean moult range temperature did not differ significantly from that in June on the summering ranges. We contend that failed or non-breeding <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese</b> move eastward in Svalbard to exploit the early stages of summer plant growth as a result of the delayed thaw compared with central and southern Spitsbergen...|$|R
40|$|NorwayFor huntable waterbird species, {{the autumn}} {{migration}} strategy {{may be important}} for their fitness, as their behaviour and environmental factors may influence their exposure to hunting mortality. Hunting activity may also reduce the access to food resources which may be limited in the wintering areas, thereby affecting winter survival. In this study we assessed the possible influence of food resources, weather conditions, inter-specific competition and hunting intensity (as a measure of possible disturbance) on abundance and distribution of <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese</b> Anser brachyrhynchus at their main autumn stopover site in Norway. The results show that food resources in term of spilt cereal grain were abundant, even {{by the time the}} geese had moved on. Snow cover did not limit the food availability during the main migratory period. Inter-specific competition with greylag geese Anser anser reduced food supplies locally and appeared to be increasing. Goose hunting intensity varied among sites and our data indicate a negative relationship between hunting intensity and the rate at which geese consumed the food resources. Collectively, our results suggest that the majority of <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese</b> leave the stopover area earlier than they would otherwise, when hunting intensities are high. In the case of <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese,</b> population consequences of disturbance is not a concern at present; however, an international species management plan calls for 1) keeping disturbance low in areas where geese do not cause conflicts with agriculture to prevent them being pushed to areas with problems, and 2) increased harvest to reduce and stabilise the population size. Both objectives can be met by reducing hunting disturbance in mid-Norway and it is recommended that a better local organisation of hunting is implemented...|$|R

40|$|This {{study shows}} how the feeding {{behaviour}} of {{the increasing number of}} geese impacts their fragile breeding grounds in the Arctic region of Svalbard and, ultimately, may affect the geese themselves.   On arrival in their breeding grounds in spring, <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese,</b> in common with other goose species, forage for below-ground plant parts.   This grubbing behaviour disturbs tundra ecosystems.   This thesis investigates the extent and distribution of grubbing on Svalbard, its impact on tundra ecosystems and feedbacks to the goose population in the long term. Grubbing geese reduce the abundance of plants, including moss, in tundra vegetation and cause the loss of substantial quantities of soil carbon.   A multi-habitat field manipulation experiment demonstrated that the impact of grubbing varies between communities; wetter communities with high moss cover are less negatively affected, but these {{are more likely to be}} grubbed by geese, particularly in valley bases and low lying coastal areas.   Using data collected in this project, the long-term effect of geese on tundra was simulated.   This resulted in predictions that geese will cause substantial degradation of their habitat if the population increases by another 50 % to 75, 000. Due to the negative effect of grubbing on vegetation, the long-term sustainable size of the population of <b>pink-footed</b> <b>geese</b> breeding on Svalband is estimated to be 95, 000, less than 30 % of the number expected based on the tundra’s productivity.   <b>Pink-footed</b> <b>geese</b> are therefore “ecosystem engineers” of the tundra, as they affect resource availability and “carrying capacity engineers”, as by degrading their own habitat they reduce the size of the goose population that it can support.
