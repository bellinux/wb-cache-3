40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] In many Asian societies, the shift from {{traditional}} agriculture toward an industrial, export-based economy has brought about {{dramatic changes in the}} lives of young people. <b>Prolonged</b> <b>schooling,</b> employment opportunities outside the home, and delayed marriage have created a population of "young singles" unheard-of a few decades ago. Increasingly urban, educated, affluent, and exposed to mass media, will young people in Southeast Asia experience similar health and behavioral problems as their counterparts in the West? The question is particularly important today because the recent shift from high to low fertility has produced a temporary, but significant "youth bulge" in the region. Between 1970 and 1990, the population age 15 - 24 in Southeast Asia rose from 43 to 72 million. This age group is projected to increase to 92 million by 2025.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that more educated women have {{their first child}} at later age compared to less educated women. The causality of this relationship and the mechanisms behind it however are another matter. In this paper we use a regression discontinuity design to infer the causal effect of <b>prolonged</b> <b>schooling</b> on {{the timing of the}} first child as well as the drivers of the effect. We tracked and interviewed 375 young Burundian women who took part in their countries ‘Concours Nationale’, a nationwide test taken at age 15. 5 on average that decides whether or not someone can continue their education. Failure or success in this test strongly affects age at first child. As a lot of girls manage to circumvent the test score cut-off point set by the Ministry of Education, we employ a fuzzy method whereby the assignment into treatment serves as an instrumental variable for effective treatment. We find an ITT of - 13 and a LATE of - 54 percentage points on the probability to have had a pregnancy four years after the test and of - 27 before age 20. An additional year of secondary school reduces the probability to become pregnant by 8 percentage points. We also find evidence for several channels raised in the literature to explain the finding (incarceration, knowledge and modernization). The results are robust to alternative specifications. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

The tests were carried out in six different virus laboratories located in Newcastle upon Tyne (England), Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Turku (Finland), and Vienna; laboratories in Lisbon and Paris {{participated in the study}} for shorter periods. The specimens were collected from infants and children less than 6 years of age who had been admitted to hospital with an acute respiratory infection. Standardized techniques and quality controlled reagents were used.

40|$|Panel Inequalities and multi-governance {{levels in}} {{education}} public policies in Africa, mod. Muriel Gomez-Perez, Hélène Charton, Marie-Christine Deleigne, Hamidou Dia [URL] my presentation I will {{introduce you to}} the day-to-day functioning of a remote village school in Benin. Using the examples of the competence approach {{and the politics of}} class repetition I will describe the application of pedagogical tools on the ground, which differs tremendously from the concepts that nurtured the introduction of these policies in Beninese primary schools. The competence approach was introduced in a number of sub-Saharan African countries in the 1990 s. In Benin the approach was implemented in 2001 and has ever since been contested by teachers who feel that this approach exceeds their competencies. Corrective measures have been introduced and teacher training sessions have been carried out. However, what one can observe in Beninese classrooms is often far from being learner-centred and based on pupils' competencies: Group work is reduced to a seating arrangement, and the self-evaluation of pupils' new acquired competencies is performed as an ever repeating ritual. The ability to speak French, which is the language of instruction but not the pupils' mother tongue, remains very low. Despite the government's initiative to reduce repetition rates between sub-cycles in primary schools, class repetition rates are high, especially in areas with insufficient teachers to offer the full six-grade-cycle. Pupils who have to repeat one class are thus obliged to repeat two years, as their school follows a biennial enrolment system. This leads to a long schooling rate for some pupils and to an early drop-out for others whose parents become frustrated with their children's <b>prolonged</b> <b>schooling...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{circumstances}} in which children grow up today are totally unlike the nineteenth century. The differences are numerous. Today's children spend much longer in school. They consequently spend less time on the streets, and their first experience of work comes increasingly late in life. During the nineteenth century, school assumed duties {{that had previously been}} the responsibility of the family. The development of school was affected by the reduced need for child labour, making it necessary to <b>prolong</b> <b>school</b> attendance. It was also influenced by a concern for the working-class family; the way the working class rear their children has always been a problem for those in power in society. There are indications of a deliberate aspiration to get children into school and out of what were considered harmful settings [...] the working class home and the streets. This paper deals with a period when the discussion about children included concern for the way - and where - they ought to spend their formative years. I shall examine the background to the 1881 ordinance on child labour in industry. The aim is to present a political and institutional context which will allow us to understand the authorities' interest in legislative regulation of child labour.

40|$|School closures, {{while an}} {{effective}} measure against {{the spread of}} disease during a pandemic, may carry unintended social and economic consequences for students and families. We evaluated these costs and consequences following a 4 -day school closure in Mississippi's Harrison County School District (HCSD). In a survey of all households with students enrolled in HCSD, we collected information on difficulties related to the school closure, including interruption of employment and pay, loss of access to subsidized school meals, and arrangement of alternative childcare. We analyzed this information {{in the context of}} certain demographic characteristics of the survey respondents and households, such as race, level of education, and income. We also estimated the average number of lost work days and documented the childcare alternatives chosen by households affected by the school closure. We received 2, 229 (28. 4 %) completed surveys from an estimated 7, 851 households eligible to participate. About half (1, 082 [48. 5 %]) of the households experienced at least some difficulty during the closure, primarily in three areas: uncertainty about duration of the closure, lost income, and the effort of arranging alternate childcare. Adults working outside the home, particularly the major wage earner in the household, were more likely to suffer lost income while schools were closed, an effect mitigated by paid leave benefits. Difficulty arranging childcare was reported most frequently by respondents with lower levels of education and households with younger children. Beyond the top three concerns expressed by households in HCSD, the survey also shed light on the issue of food insecurity when subsidized school meals are not available. Reported by 17. 9 % of households participating in the subsidized school lunch program, difficulty providing meals during the closure was associated with higher numbers of dependent children, selection of "other" as the race of the household respondent, and lower levels of education. To help prevent undue financial hardship in families of school children, public health authorities and school administrators should provide recommendations for childcare alternatives and paid leave or remote work options during <b>prolonged</b> <b>school</b> closures, particularly to households in which all adults work outside of the home...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we study some of the {{overlooked}} mechanisms of how social origin affects an individual’s occupational success at labour market entry. The empirical analysis draws on four Dutch retrospective life-course surveys. The analytical sample consists of 6, 416 respondents born in the period 1931 – 80. The results show intergenerational transmission of occupational status, but the effect of father’s occupation on his child’s first job has declined over time. Part of the decreased impact of social origin {{is related to the}} increased age at first job. Educational expansion <b>prolonged</b> the <b>school</b> career of individuals and increased the age at which they first enter the labour market, when parental control and influence matter less. The effect of level of education has decreased over time too, at an even faster rate. Because of that, a trend from ascription to achievement cannot be confirmed. Furthermore, we found evidence of a weaker impact of social origin on occu-pational status attainment for the higher educated. The labour market for higher levels of education is more meritocratic, as employers use the degree to which various educational programmes at these levels provide occupation-specific skills to evaluate the labour pro-ductivity of potential workers...|$|R

We then proceed to estimate the impact of the reform on earnings later in life and to calculate the returns to various qualifications. For this purpose we use the variation in educational achievements, induced by the social experiment. We compare the results from this quasi-experimental approach to those obtained when we use simple OLS and when we use OLS but controlling for a set of detailed ability indicators collected before the reform was effective. Our findings show that while ability bias may be present, using observed ability indicators gives very similar (but more precise) results to those obtained by using the variation induced by the {{implementation of}} the social experiment.

40|$|Cardiovascular drift {{can occur}} during {{prolonged}} exercise and {{is characterized by}} a gradual decrease in stroke volume (SV) and a corresponding increase in heart rate (HR) over time, despite the maintenance of a constant level of work; cardiac output (CO) usually is unchanged. A number of factors may cause cardiovascular drift to occur, including increases in peripheral blood flow, decreases in plasma volume, increases in circulating catecholamines, and metabolic acidosis. These physiological events may be influenced by the relationship of the exercise intensity to ventilatory threshold (VT). Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the cardiovascular responses during prolonged exercise in boys and men at an intensity set relative to VT. Eight boys (10 - 13 yrs.) and 10 men (18 - 25 yrs.) completed an orientation trial, a graded maximal exercise test, and a 40 minute submaximal exercise bout at an intensity equal to the V 02 at VT. During the 40 minute exercise bout, V 02 increased significantly over time (P_ 0. 05). Heart rate was higher and SV was lower in the boys compared to the men (P 0. 05). Men exhibited a greater decrease in plasma volume from 0 to 40 minutes. There was no group difference in perceived exertion (RPE) between the boys and the men, although the boys exhibited a greater increase in RPE over time than the men (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, the cardiovascular responses during prolonged exercise are similar in boys and men, although there is a tendency for the magnitude of cardiovascular drift to be greater in the men. In addition, due to the fact that these results are similar to previous studies not accounting for individual differences in VT, it would seem that these differences in VT should not be of concern when studying the cardiovascular responses during <b>prolonged</b> exercise. <b>School</b> of Physical EducationThesis (M.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to analyze}} aggregate consequences of market imperfections. In particular, it {{is interested in}} the effects of capital market imperfections and contracting constraints on the efficiency of the allocation and, subsequently, the prospects for growth. In the first chapter, lotteries are introduced into the framework of Galor and Zeira (1993). This is a growth model with imperfect capital markets and indivisible investment permitting an individual poverty trap. Allowing for lotteries leads to a quite remarkable overturn of the original result: more severe capital market imperfections may increase aggregate consumption in finite time. Intuitively, whenever lotteries dominate an imperfect capital market as a means of capital allocation, increasing the relative attractiveness of lotteries also increases allocative efficiency. The second chapter of this dissertation analyzes the effects of intra-firm bargaining on the formation of firms under imperfect capital markets and contracting constraints. In equilibrium, wealth inequality induces a heterogenous distribution of firm sizes allowing for firms both too small and too large in terms of technical efficiency. The findings connect well to empirical facts as the missing middle of size distributions in less developed countries. The model is able to encompass a non-monotonic relationship between inequality and aggregate wealth, providing a theoretical framework for policy analysis of foreign aid and investment. The last chapter finds that non-transferabilities of utility in markets, caused by e. g. contracting constraints, may induce inefficient incentives for non-contractible investments taking place prior to markets. The timing of markets with respect to the investment affects their efficiency. Applying this results to a model of education choice and labor markets we find that markets opening only after agents have invested may exhibit inefficient over-education whereas markets that open only prior to investment do not. Hence, enforcing ex post markets by e. g. <b>prolonging</b> compulsory <b>schooling,</b> may lead to over-education and inefficient labor market allocations...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{changes in}} brain {{structure}} and function during adolescence are well characterized, but {{the extent to which}} experience modulates adolescent neurodevelopment are not. Musical experience provides an ideal case for examining this question because the influence of music training begun early in life is well known. We investigated the effects of in-school music training, previously shown to enhance auditory skills, versus another in-school training program that did not focus on development of auditory skills (active control). We tested adolescents on neural responses to sound and language skills before they entered high school (pre-training) and again three years later. Here we show that in-school music training begun in high <b>school</b> <b>prolongs</b> the stability of subcortical sound processing and accelerates maturation of cortical auditory responses. Although phonological processing improved in both the music training and active control groups, the enhancement was greater in adolescents who underwent music training. Thus, music training initiated as late as adolescence can enhance neural processing of sound and confer benefits for language skills. These results establish the potential for experience-driven brain plasticity during adolescence, and demonstrate that in-school programs can engender these changes...|$|R

A week after the storm, almost 150,000 customers of the state's two utilities had not yet had power restored.

40|$|School refusal is an {{attendance}} problem {{characterized by}} a young person’s difficulty in going to school, accompanied by emotional distress {{on the part of}} the young person and parental attempts to return the young person to regular <b>school</b> attendance. <b>Prolonged</b> absence from <b>school</b> has serious short- and long-term consequences for young people, their families, and schools. Therefore, effective treatment of school refusal is essential. Numerous treatment outcome studies provide evidence for the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for school refusal. Previous research has however indicated that adolescent school refusers may be particularly disturbed and harder to treat. An existing treatment for school-refusing children and adolescents was modified to better account for the impact of developmental variables on engagement in treatment. The studies presented in this dissertation describe the preparation, implementation, and evaluation of the resulting developmentally-appropriate CBT for adolescent school refusal. The treatment was associated with increased school attendance, reduced emotional symptoms, and increased adolescent and parental self-efficacy. Exploratory analyses revealed that several developmental factors were related to treatment outcomes, namely clinician developmental appropriateness, insight, and autonomy. Recommendations for research and clinical practice are made on the basis of these findings, and on the methodological strengths and limitations of the current research. Promotoren: P. M.

In this population-based study, {{the aim was to}} identify children who had experienced an episode of disabling fatigue and examine the clinical and demographic differences between those individuals who fulfilled a narrow definition of disabling fatigue and those who fulfilled broader definitions of disabling fatigue. METHODS: Participants (aged 8 - 17 years) were identified from a population-based twin register. Parent report was used to identify children who had ever experienced a period of disabling fatigue. Standardised telephone interviews were then conducted with the parents of these affected children. Data on clinical and demographic characteristics, including age of onset, gender, days per week affected, hours per day spent resting, absence from school, comorbidity with depression and a global measure of impairment due to the fatigue, were examined. A narrow definition was defined as a minimum of 6 months disabling fatigue plus at least 4 associated symptoms, which is comparable to the operational criteria for CFS in adults. Broader definitions included those with at least 3 months of disabling fatigue and 4 or more of the associated symptoms and those with simply a minimum of 3 months of disabling fatigue.

Neuropsychological functions were measured using the Spanish version of the Wechsler scale, as well as the following tests: Spreen-Benton, ITPA and TALE scales, Yuste Memory Test, Thurstone Attention Test, and the Rey Complex Figure. In addition to a progressive decline found in the full scale intelligence quotient in children irradiated for intracranial tumors, variance analysis showed that these patients deteriorate mainly in visual attention and memory, but also significantly in verbal fluency and in the Performance Intelligence Quotient and all its subtests, when compared to the control groups. Visual attention and the Wechsler Picture Arrangement and Block Designs, were the tests whose decline correlated with the total radiation administered.

The responses to the questionnaires, were qualified using a numeric scale that ranged from 0 to 10 points. A higher score indicated a better habit. Results: Percentile 25 (p 25 th) PA score was 4 and 3 in elementary and high school children respectively and the p 25 th for DI were 5. 7 and 4. 3, respectively. No differences in DI scores, according to the type of school, were observed. However, physical activity scores were significantly lower in children and adolescents from ME schools than from PE schools. Sixty percent of ME schools had ¡ess than 2 hours per week of programmed physical activity compared to more than 3 hours, in 70 % of PE schools. Elementary school children and high school adolescents expended 8 and 11 hours per day, respectively, in minimum expenditure activities. Conclusions: There is a greater deterioration of PA than DI among school age children and adolescents. Those attending ME schools have the worst physical activity scores. This fact must be addressed in future healthy lifestyle encouragement policies (RevMéd Chile 2008; 136 : 53 - 63...|$|R

40|$|Children spend over 60 % {{of their}} school day sitting; much of this occurs in the classroom. Emerging {{research}} has examined the impact of environmental interventions on classroom sitting. While this research is promising, it has predominantly focused on the primary school setting. This study examined the impact and feasibility of height-adjustable desks on time spent sitting/standing during classroom lessons in a secondary school. Traditional desks in a Melbourne secondary school classroom were replaced with 27 height-adjustable desks (intervention classroom). Forty-three adolescents (51 % male; mean age 13. 7 ± 1. 4 years) from Grades 7, 9 and 10 wore an inclinometer and accelerometer for schooldays and completed a survey after using the desks during lessons for seven weeks. Ten teachers (50 % male) completed a survey. Time spent sitting, standing, {{and the length of}} sitting bouts were compared between periods when adolescents were in the intervention classroom versus traditional classrooms (matched on teacher and subject). Compared to the traditional classroom, adolescents spent 25 % less time sitting and 24 % more time standing in the intervention classroom (effect size > 0. 8), and had a greater frequency of short sitting bouts and fewer longer bouts. The majority of teachers (71 %) and students (70 %) reported wanting to continue to use the height-adjustable desks. When standing during lessons, adolescents reported working well (69 %); however, a third reported difficulties paying attention (28 %) and becoming distracted (36 %). Few teachers reported negative influences on adolescents’ ability to work (14 %) and concentrate (14 %). Half the adolescents reported leg, or back pain with standing. Introducing height-adjustable desks resulted in lower levels of sitting compared with traditional classrooms, was acceptable and had some adverse effects on concentration and discomfort. The study provides preliminary evidence that height-adjustable desks may help reduce <b>prolonged</b> sitting in <b>school</b> among adolescents. Future research should incorporate a control group and explore behavioural and academic outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Disabling fatigue is {{the main}} illness related reason for <b>prolonged</b> absence from <b>school.</b> Although there are {{accepted}} criteria for diagnosing chronic fatigue in adults, it remains uncertain as to how best to define disabling fatigue and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) in children and adolescents. In this population-based study, {{the aim was to}} identify children who had experienced an episode of disabling fatigue and examine the clinical and demographic differences between those individuals who fulfilled a narrow definition of disabling fatigue and those who fulfilled broader definitions of disabling fatigue. Methods Participants (aged 8 – 17 years) were identified from a population-based twin register. Parent report was used to identify children who had ever experienced a period of disabling fatigue. Standardised telephone interviews were then conducted with the parents of these affected children. Data on clinical and demographic characteristics, including age of onset, gender, days per week affected, hours per day spent resting, absence from school, comorbidity with depression and a global measure of impairment due to the fatigue, were examined. A narrow definition was defined as a minimum of 6 months disabling fatigue plus at least 4 associated symptoms, which is comparable to the operational criteria for CFS in adults. Broader definitions included those with at least 3 months of disabling fatigue and 4 or more of the associated symptoms and those with simply a minimum of 3 months of disabling fatigue. Groups were mutually exclusive. Results Questionnaires were returned by 1468 families (65 % response rate) and telephone interviews were completed on 99 of the 129 participants (77 %) who had experienced fatigue. There {{were no significant differences in}} demographic and clinical characteristics or levels of impairment between those who fulfilled the narrower definition and those who fulfilled the broader definitions. The only exception was the reported number of days per week that the child was affected by the fatigue. All groups demonstrated evidence of substantial impairment associated with the fatigue. Conclusion Children and adolescents who do not fulfil the current narrow definition of CFS but do suffer from disabling fatigue show comparable and substantial impairment. In primary care settings, a broader definition of disabling fatigue would improve the identification of impaired children and adolescents who require support. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this project, aims to describe, {{analyze and}} discuss how the {{implementation}} of the new reform, affecting the Danish Elementary School, under Act 409, has affected the teacher’s' working condi-tions. The new reform will <b>prolong</b> the student’s <b>school</b> day, as active movement, homework work-shops and academic immersion will be incorporated. This is an attempt to create diverse teaching, with the aim of lifting the Danish School to a higher academic level, to perform better, compared to international results. Act 409 has affected how the teacher's working day is planned. In particular, the work hour regulations, has had an enormous impact on the teachers, as the new rules requires them to stay at the school, throughout the entire day. This means less flexibility and self-administration of how the teacher’s use their preparation time. To gain more knowledge of the challenges that may appear with {{the implementation of}} the new reform, under Act 409, there has been collected empirical data, in the form of observations and in-terviews. Both of which have been made at a public school in Frederikssund Kommune. The project begins with a presentation of key elements and changes that have appeared alongside the lockout in 2013, {{the implementation of the}} new reform and Act 409. In addition there will be analyzed on how the implementation under Act 409 affects the teachers at Frederikssund School. This is done through Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition, Rasmus Willig’s theory of legal inca-pacity and his concept of resilience. These theories support our studies of the processes that the teachers are going through, with the reform and Act 409. Furthermore, the project is constructed around the normative ideal that 'the good life is free from violation experiences'. Finally, it will be discussed how the reform of the Danish School under Act 409, can be seen as an instrument of streamlining and efficiency, that follows the concept of New Public Management. Additionally it is discussed how the general individual must learn how to behave and perform in the public sector, when the values of the Danish society are steadily growing more neoliberal. As the teachers lack recognition, are being declared incapable of managing their critique and thus must try to achieve resilience, it is clear how the implementation of the reform under Act 409, has had a ma-jor impact on the teacher’s work and approach to their subject area...|$|R
