It was the first successful photomechanical process fully able to reproduce the delicate halftones of photographs. It produced true middle values and did not make use of a screen or other image deconstruction method. It was often considered the most perfect, most beautiful photomechanical process and inspired a number of books, magazines, and special edition printings between 1864 and 1910. When {{attempts were made to}} adopt Woodburytype to rotary printing, the process could not compete with the quickly developing collotype and halftone <b>photomechanical</b> <b>processes</b> that almost completely replaced Woodburytype {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{continuous}} wave photoexposures and excimer laser exposures have different effects on polymer surfaces (e. g. the photosensitivity of inorganic resists) and new photochemistry is observed on excimer laser irradiation. This report describes the non-linear phenomena observed on polymer surfaces, caused by excimer laser exposures, e. g. increased hydrophilicity of polymer surfaces, imagewise wetting and metallization, and the new metal compounds formed on laser-exposed polymer films. Because these phenomena are limited to polymer films with a high glass transition temperature, such as polyimides and poly(phenylquinoxaline), the effects may be induced by <b>photomechanical</b> <b>processes.</b> In some cases, new interfacial reactions occur between the exposed polymer surfaces and the deposited metal films.

40|$|From {{the day of}} its existence, {{photography}} {{was perceived}} as a medium of inherent objectivity. With the invention and practice of <b>photomechanical</b> <b>processes</b> for preparing printing plates in the Russian Turkestan, it soon began to replace drawings and lithographs in books and magazines. It was the medium of choice to bring the foreign and exotic to the parlors of the emerging Russian bourgeoisie that quickly recognized it and turned the medium to serve its interests. A small but influential group of the early amateur photographers {{was made up of}} the military elite from the Russian imperial technical departments who went to explore non-Slavic cultures and architectural antiquities. This unorthodox combination of documentary photography, art and science marks the abrupt beginning of a new discipline in Central Asia: architectural photography. What do these records of architecture from a distant time and place tell present-day viewers? Can we speak of a specific synergy that was so apparent at the early days of photographic invention between the photographic medium and painting technique in relation to Central Asian photography? Or, of the cultural impact of the Russian Empire on its distant and youngest colony along with the ongoing insecurities of the Russian cultural politics in conflict with an ancient Muslim culture?

40|$|THERECOGNITION OF CHILDREN’S {{literature}} {{as a legitimate}} field of study and the popular interest in nostalgia have created a demand for quality reproductions of early children’s books and related materials. Facsimiles {{have made it possible}} for libraries with limited budgets to support scholarly research in children’s literature by providing access to these books, many of which are rare, often unusual and sometimes unique, “their devastating little owners having secured that eminence for them. ”l Previously, the only solution was to buy an original. The cost and scarcity of original works limit their usefulness primarily to collectors, but facsimiles have made it possible for “anyone interested in the development of writing and publishing for children to get a clearer idea of what the books were actually like. ” 2 While publishers ’ catalogs and bibliographies of early children’s book collections are valuable tools for the study of historical children’s literature, they provide a fragmented approach to a work rather than the opportunity “to consider each book as a whole or gauge the total impact it must have had when it first appeared. ’’* Printing of facsimiles is but one type of reprint publishing, and is defined here as an exact reproduction in its entirety of the text of a work.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} imagery in the {{illustrated}} newspapers of colonial Australia over the period of their publication, 1853 - 1896. The distinguishing feature of these papers was that the illustrations were printed from engraved woodblocks. The thesis is pioneering in the sense that whilst historians have regularly used images from the papers to illustrate books {{on a wide variety of}} topics, no one has researched the illustrated newspapers as a primary source in their own right. This has led to the thesis also being a study of the printing technology that was associated with producing the papers and how this influenced the range of imagery they contain. It has also involved researching the evolution of illustrated newspapers in colonial Australia. It will be argued that the key to success with the publication of illustrated newspapers in colonial Australia was to change from weekly issue to monthly issue in the early 1860 s. Monthly issue was more suited to the demographics of colonial Australia as well as for sending papers to Great Britain by the monthly Royal Mail service. With regard to printing technology, the invention of photographic processes had considerable impact on the production of imagery in the illustrated newspapers. It lead to both the producers and readers of illustrated newspapers gradually reconsidering their ideas about the authenticity of news illustration. This occurred most obviously in terms of the photographer challenging the illustrator with regard to on-the-spot recording of news at a visual level. It also occurred more subtly in terms of photomechanical image reproduction challenging the craft of wood engraving in the faithful reproduction of images regardless of the original medium in which they were produced: photographic print, sketch or oil painting. The argument, in this context, is that in the same way photography confronted art in the nineteenth century in terms of truth to nature, so too did the development of <b>photomechanical</b> <b>processes</b> confront wood engraving in relation to image reproduction. Finally, a content analysis methodology has been used to approach in a systematic way the image subject matter of the papers. Illustrations were then grouped into three brackets: MATERIAL PROGRESS which included imagery of buildings, streetscapes, panoramas, manufacturing, exhibitions and maritime affairs; THE CULTURE OF PROGRESS which was concerned with imagery depicting military affairs, civic occasions, the arts and leisure; and PROGRESS AND THE FRONTIER which comprised imagery relating to the landscape, mining, the wool industry, Aborigines and natural history. The changes in the subject matter of these various categories of imagery reflected very closely the progress of Australia in the second half of the provided their readers with the visual representation of progress in colonial Australia; indeed, they were Chronicles of Progress...|$|E
40|$|The {{researchers}} at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR) have been reappraising 19 th Century print processes for {{the last fifteen years}} and Hoskins has published on the continuous tone properties of Woodburytype and its relation to other 19 thC processes such as photo-ceramics in previous papers to the IS&T PICT (1) and EI in 2003 (2). Since the invention of Walter Bentley Woodbury’s ‘Woodburytype process in 1865 (3), it has been possible to autographically print a true continuous tone black and white photographic image. New research at CFPR builds upon previous research to combining 19 th Century Photomechanical techniques with digital technology to reappraise the potential of these processes CNC milled relief printing blocks from which casts are taken will enable a physical and tactile surface quality that more closely resembles the autographic surface of the Woodburytype and the three colour carbon printing processes. Therefore this latest research aims to explore the potential of creating coloured pictorial imagery from a continuous tone relief surface. The specific context for the research is to create a surface quality and visual appearance that retains the character of the earlier autographic processes, such as letterpress and screen printing, which are undergoing a revival, This is happening for two reasons, one, for their hand crafted content, and secondly, because they create a physical and tactile surface that has a subjective quality, hard to define using standard testing methodologies. To prove the potential the research team have been using CNC milled images where the height of the relief image is dictated by creating a tone curve and then milling this curve into a series of relief blocks from which the image is cast in a silicone ink. A translucent image is cast from each of the colour matrices and each colour is assembled - one on top of another - resulting is a colour continuous tone print, where colour tone is created by physical depth of colour. A number of factors have come together to enable a reappraisal of continuous tone printing. Software is now readily available that will split a photographic image into a bump map image where the Z-axis corresponds to a set of height steps on a tonal step wedge from black to white. This software is easily transcribed to either a DXF for processing in G Code to CNC (Computer Numeric control) in order mill an image. In addition new silicone materials have become more readily available that can be precisely coloured. The aim is to create a digitally initiated, physical tactile surface that retains the qualities of arlier autographic process which is capable of being transferred to a range of substrates and demonstrates the potential for future research into new methods of continuous tone printing. This research {{is part of a larger}} parallel research project to investigate the potential of creating a physically printed relief surface that better represents the autographic mark making requirements of visual artists and designers.

It is desirable, therefore, to not only help students develop technical skills necessary for teaching but also give them practical teaching ability by which they can develop a proactive approach in developing educational materials and instructional methods pertaining to the acquired skills. This study aims to explore how effectively one can provide practical teaching ability to help students achieve readiness for teaching, while helping them improve technical skills required for printing expressions as they teach in art classes.

Lavishly furnished album is now kept in the Strossmayer Galery of Old Masters of Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Even though it is not the case of author’s artistic expression, but of luxuriously bind choice of commercial photographs, the album is interesting as product of the last fashion of its time. In professional and wider cultural public, the album is almost forgotten, it is rarely put on display, and in seldom known mentions, it is wrongly identified as album of greeting cards, album of chromolitographies or album of colourised photographs. 	Dalmatian associations with cultural and educational purpose of the nineteenth century have been mostly discussed in scholarship {{within the context of the}} so called “national renaissance” in Dalmatia, and their agency was primarily analysed through optics of agitation and mobilisation potential in the content between autonomist and annexing forces for gaining as wide support of the population as possible. The People’s Education Society of Split grew up at the end of the nineteenth century in the circle of proponents of Croatian national identity in Dalmatia, and many of the members of the Society, besides their activity on political plane, contributed to the work of more important and much older cultural and educational societies, in which shadow the People’s Education Society remained and consequently stayed outside of the focus of interest of the researchers. Because of that, besides the initial plan of providing professional analysis of the album presented by the members of the Society to Bishop Strossmayer, this article felt need to add at least elementary information on its foundation, composition of its members and its mission and in that manner delineate the context of this valuable present.
