5|$|In graph algorithms, {{the widest}} path <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{the problem of}} finding a path between two {{designated}} vertices in a weighted graph, maximizing {{the weight of the}} minimum-weight edge in the path. The widest path <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> also known as the bottleneck shortest path problem or the maximum capacity path problem. It is possible to adapt most shortest path algorithms to compute widest paths, by modifying them to use the bottleneck distance instead of path length. However, in many cases even faster algorithms are possible.|$|E

5|$|Most {{versions}} of the clique problem are hard. The clique decision <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> NP-complete (one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems). The problem of finding the maximum clique is both fixed-parameter intractable and hard to approximate. And, listing all maximal cliques may require exponential time as there exist graphs with exponentially many maximal cliques. Therefore, much of the theory about the clique <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational difficulty of the general problem in various models of computation.|$|E
