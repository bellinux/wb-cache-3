5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, <b>psychological</b> <b>support</b> is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{analysed}} the learning outcomes and <b>psychological</b> need <b>support</b> of Estonian 6 th grade students (N = 43) in collaborative, peer-supported and individual learning contexts. The study compared the three learning contexts {{in terms of}} knowledge construction and <b>psychological</b> need <b>support</b> as well as analysed the relationship between knowledge construction, work performance and <b>psychological</b> need <b>support</b> across the learning contexts. The study was experimental and {{was designed as a}} problem-based history lesson, where students were asked to complete a problem-based worksheet either collaboratively (N = 23), individually (N = 9) or with peer support (N = 10). Students were also asked to fill in a pre-test and post-test questionnaire to measure their knowledge and self-reported <b>psychological</b> need <b>support</b> or thwarting. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} students’ psychological needs are most supported in peer learning contexts. It was also found that learning outcomes are connected to <b>psychological</b> need <b>support</b> and good work performance does not necessarily predict high quality knowledge construction. The study found collaborative learning to be the learning context where students create best-quality products and peer learning to result in the highest quality of constructed knowledge. While the empirical findings of this study supported the theory and the posed hypotheses, additional research could confirm and elaborate these results.

They could have trouble sleeping, experience {{changes in their}} appetite, or develop full-blown emotional problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, substance abuse, or dependence. Individuals who have experienced sexual assault {{are at risk for}} other day-to-day problems, including arguing with family members and having problems at work. Lack of medical <b>psychological</b> <b>support</b> resources also puts victims of war rape at further disadvantage. Refugee women are also at a disadvantage of receiving adequate assistance to deal with the psychological consequences of war rape - not only do they lack legal representation, they also may lack protection from the perpetrators of the violent act. Furthermore, there is an increase in dislike of refugees and asylum seekers which is another obstacle in the psychological healing process of victims seeking assistance outside of their countries that may still be under civil strife. <b>Psychological</b> <b>support</b> and counseling sessions given by individuals not part of the ethnic, linguistic, and/or community may incite difficulties in communication between patient and care giver. As a result, adequate emotional and <b>psychological</b> <b>support</b> to the victims is not fully developed, affecting the long-term healing potential for the patient.|$|E

40|$|Delayed gastric {{emptying}} {{is frequently}} observed {{in patients with}} long-standing type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and potentially impacts on upper gastrointestinal symptoms, glycaemic control, nutrition and oral drug absorption. The pathogenesis remains unclear and management strategies are currently suboptimal. Therapeutic strategies focus on accelerating gastric emptying, controlling symptoms and improving glycaemic control. The potential adverse effects of hyperglycaemia on gastric emptying and upper gut symptoms indicate the importance of normalising blood glucose if possible. Nutritional and <b>psychological</b> <b>supports</b> are also important, but often neglected. A number of recent pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies show promise, including gastric electrical stimulation. As with all chronic illnesses, a multidisciplinary approach to management is recommended, but there are few data regarding long-term outcomes.

Third, the most difficult assessment as supports of hikikomori was investigated. Forth, it was examined the methodology of <b>psychological</b> <b>supports</b> for the identified person through their family. Finally, it was suggested that the family association would become more important in the future for hikikomori. Therefore I proposed that the useful construction of psychological clinical service would be set up for family association. Accordingly, clinical psychologists who support hikikomori must have the new identity for providing adaptable service of various patterns differing from traditional them who provide service of a single pattern...|$|R

40|$|Hearing {{impaired}} clients {{tend not}} to participate in psychotherapy, and those who do often aren't fully understood their psychic world. Particularly in Japan, there are insufficient <b>psychological</b> <b>supports</b> and few clinical psychological studies have been performed for the hearing impaired. Generally people who have lost their hearing {{at some point in their}} life can communicate somewhat using vocal language, but hearing impaired from birth can't. Psychotherapy in latter group is thought to be impossible. It may initially seem that they can't communicate with clinicians, but mutual exchange may occur if clinicians are able to use sign language. People with hearing impairment have the right to receive sufficient communications, and clinicians should be aware of the necessity of sign language. Ideally, we can use sign language, but it may take long time to master. Therefore, we must at least recognize that it is important to involve interpreters with sign language, but they tend to be troubled with many points between clients and therapists...|$|R

In 1998, volunteers began assisting in surgeries in Freetown to help with an increasing number of amputees, and collecting statistics on civilians (men, women and children) being attacked by large groups of men claiming to represent ECOMOG.
