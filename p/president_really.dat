Talleyrand he come round to Hundred and Eighteen {{in a day or two}} to thank Toby for his kindness. I didn't mention the dice-playing, but I could see that Red Jacket's doings had made Talleyrand highly curious about Indians--though he would call him the Huron. Toby, as you may believe, was all holds full of knowledge concerning their manners and habits. He only needed a listener. The Brethren don't study Indians much till they join the Church, but Toby knew 'em wild. So evening after evening Talleyrand crossed his sound leg over his game one and Toby poured forth. Having been adopted into the Senecas I, naturally, kept still, but Toby 'ud call on me to back up some of his remarks, and by that means, and a habit he had of drawing you on in talk, Talleyrand saw I knew something of his noble savages too. Then he tried a trick. Coming back from an emigre party he turns into his little shop and puts it to me, laughing like, that I'd gone with the two chiefs on their visit to Big Hand. I hadn't told. Red Jacket hadn't told, and Toby, of course, didn't know. 'Twas just Talleyrand's guess. [...] "Now," [...] he says, [...] "my English and Red Jacket's French was so bad that I am not sure I got the rights of what the <b>President</b> <b>really</b> said to the unsophisticated Huron. Do me the favour of telling it again." [...] I told him every word Red Jacket had told him and not one word more. I had my suspicions, having just come from an emigre party where the Marquise was hating and praising him as usual.|$|E

50|$|When senior Francesca Facchini (Mischa Barton) solicits Bobby's help {{tracking}} down {{the set of}} stolen SATs, Funke uncovers a story. He sets {{on a large scale}} investigation and links Paul Moore to the crime. He writes an article pointing the finger at Paul. Kirkpatrick forces Paul to open his locker and the SATs fall out. As a result of his sleuthing, Funke becomes {{one of the most popular}} kids at St. Donovan's. Clara decides to submit Funke's article to Northwestern which earns Bobby a scholarship to the summer program. Funke wins the respect of everyone from Principal Kirkpatrick to the kid that farts on him in Spanish class and Francesca takes Funke to homecoming. As Funke's popularity grows so do his suspicions. Paul confronts Bobby, proclaiming his innocence, stating that he got into Cornell but decided to take the test again to see if he could get a better score.

40|$|The {{ideas and}} {{thoughts}} of college and university presidents are most frequently and primarily known through their public roles and rhetoric. Over {{the past few years}} nearly three dozen college and university presidents have written diaries for public view as part of the Journal of College and Character. These presidential reflections provide a unique and rare opportunity to gain a behind-the-scenes view of the contemporary presidency, and of the leadership and values of presidents. This article is based on research of the words and impressions of these presidents in these public diaries. Using the perspectives revealed by the presidents, the article assesses, analyzes, and compares and contrasts the major themes which emerge and the content of their reflections. This assessment contributes additional understanding of the presidency by developing an inside picture of presidential thought about the issues with which they regularly grapple. The diaries are an important lens presenting a significant set of accounts and vantage points about what presidents contemplate. We are able to obtain provisional answers to questions such as: What things create and cause unavoidable and sometimes constant tensions and pressures? What do we know about what <b>presidents</b> <b>really</b> think? What do we know about their private reflections about the curses and blessings of the great weight of responsibility they bear in leading colleges and universities? What are the things which concern these presidents as leaders and individuals? How are they trying to exert leadership to the nation 2 ̆ 7 s campuses? The reflections in these diaries are of interest because they provide a glimpse of the internal journeys and musings of presidents. These presidents have used this medium to share thinking about the broader implications of what they are doing, how they are leading, what leadership itself is all about and what is required of the leader, not to mention the simple, routine things presidents face in day-to-day life. We also view a picture of remarkable moments and instances, revealing significant candor and disclosure in the stories of their leadership and aspects of presidential leadership much more from 2 ̆ 2 inside 2 ̆ 2 the ivory tower than that commonly and normally observable. The presidents thus contribute significantly to understandings of the office they hold, of the importance which the presidency continues to bear for the hopes and aspirations of our colleges and universities, and {{of the way in which}} presidents of today will shape the future of the college and university presidency itself...|$|R

5000|$|July 16 and 17, Sunday and Monday, Byrnes {{had several}} setbacks. One was Flynn's concern about losing black votes in case Byrnes got the nomination. The other, more serious, was the {{increasing}} opposition against Byrnes from labor, in particular Hillman. On Monday evening the party leaders telephoned Roosevelt, saying that labor {{would not accept}} Byrnes and mentioned Flynn's concern as well. Roosevelt concurred {{and told them to}} [...] "go all out for Truman". Now, when the <b>president</b> had <b>really</b> decided on Truman, the leader's next step was to convince Truman that he was Roosevelt's pick. They let Byrnes's friend Leo Crowley inform Byrnes. Truman probably learned of Roosevelt's endorsement the same evening, but he was aware of the president's inconsistency and could not be sure of what it meant. Truman had previously, just like Hannegan, got the impression that Roosevelt wanted Byrnes. But the next morning Truman met with Hillman, who refused to accept Byrnes and said that labor's first choice was Wallace, and if that was impossible they could also consent to Truman or Douglas. Roosevelt had met Hillman the previous Thursday. There is no proof that Roosevelt conspired and struck a deal with Hillman not to accept Byrnes, but it might very well have been like that, according to Ferrell. Byrnes believed that Roosevelt had betrayed him.|$|R

40|$|This EPIN study brings {{together}} contributions from a ​broad selection of member states ​and ​provid​es ​insightful analysis ​into the 2014 elections to the European Parliament on the ground. The report reveals the different factors that impede {{the development of}} genuine European elections {{and the consequences of}} the ballot in the member states covered by the study​, namely Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and the UK​,​ and at EU level. The report finds that: • The EP Resolution to encourage European parties to nominate candidates for the next Commission <b>President</b> has not <b>really</b> increased public interest in the EU and voter turnout will probably remain low. • Visibility of the European top candidates in most member states has been quite limited. • National manifestos do not coincide – and sometimes event conflict with – the European parties’ manifestos. • Election debates focus on national issues; EU issues are only brought to public debate when they are relevant for domestic politics. • Again, we will see a protest vote against governments and large parties. The EP elections are still perceived as a test ahead of local and national elections, or as a vote of confidence in national governments. • This year the protest vote also concerns the EU. The report predicts a more eurosceptic ballot that might complicate decision-making in the EU, exacerbate the conflict between the national and European levels and increase tensions among member states...|$|R
6000|$|While in {{this manner}} he {{exercised}} an ever-increasing influence upon the popular understanding, his sympathetic nature endeared him {{more and more to}} the popular heart. In vain did journals and speakers of the opposition represent him as a lightminded trifler, who amused himself with frivolous story-telling and coarse jokes, while the blood of the people was flowing in streams. The people knew that the man at the head of affairs, on whose haggard face the twinkle of humor so frequently changed into an expression of profoundest sadness, was more than any other deeply distressed by the suffering he witnessed; that he felt the pain of every wound that was inflicted on the battlefield, and the anguish of every woman or child who had lost husband or father; that whenever he could he was eager to alleviate sorrow, and that his mercy was never implored in vain. They looked to him as one who was with them and of them in all their hopes and fears, their joys and sorrows, who laughed with them and wept with them; and as his heart was theirs; so their hearts turned to him. His popularity was far different from that of Washington, who was revered with awe, or that of Jackson, the unconquerable hero, for whom party enthusiasm never grew weary of shouting. To Abraham Lincoln the people became bound by a genuine sentimental attachment. It was not a matter of respect, or confidence, or party pride, for this feeling spread far beyond the boundary lines of his party; it was an affair of the heart, independent of mere reasoning. When the soldiers in the field or their folks at home spoke of [...] "Father Abraham," [...] there was no cant in it. They felt that their <b>President</b> was <b>really</b> caring for them as a father would, and that they could go to him, every one of them, as they would go to a father, and talk to him of what troubled them, sure to find a willing ear and tender sympathy. Thus, their President, and his cause, and his endeavors, and his success gradually became to them almost matters of family concern. And this popularity carried him triumphantly through the Presidential election of 1864, in spite of an opposition within his own party which at first seemed very formidable.|$|R
6000|$|Neither did the Emancipation Proclamation {{forthwith}} command universal assent {{among the}} people who were loyal to the Union. There were even signs of a reaction against the administration in the fall elections of 1862, seemingly justifying the opinion, entertained by many, that the <b>President</b> had <b>really</b> anticipated the development of popular feeling. The cry that the war for the Union had been turned into an [...] "abolition war" [...] was raised again by the opposition, and more loudly than ever. But the good sense and patriotic instincts of the plain people gradually marshalled themselves on Lincoln's side, and he lost no opportunity to help on this process by personal argument and admonition. There never has been a President in such constant and active contact with the public opinion of the country, as there never has been a President who, while {{at the head of the}} government, remained so near to the people. Beyond the circle of those who had long known him the feeling steadily grew that the man in the White House was [...] "honest Abe Lincoln" [...] still, and that every citizen might approach him with complaint, expostulation, or advice, without danger of meeting a rebuff from power-proud authority, or humiliating condescension; and this privilege was used by so many and with such unsparing freedom that only superhuman patience could have endured it all. There are men now living who would to-day read with amazement, if not regret, what they ventured to say or write to him. But Lincoln repelled no one whom he believed to speak to him in good faith and with patriotic purpose. No good advice would go unheeded. No candid criticism would offend him. No honest opposition, while it might pain him, would produce a lasting alienation of feeling between him and the opponent. It may truly be said that few men in power have ever been exposed to more daring attempts to direct their course, to severer censure of their acts, and to more cruel misrepresentation of their motives: And all this he met with that good-natured humor peculiarly his own, and with untiring effort to see the right and to impress it upon those who differed from him. The conversations he had and the correspondence he carried on upon matters of public interest, not only with men in official position, but with private citizens, were almost unceasing, and in a large number of public letters, written ostensibly to meetings, or committees, or persons of importance, he addressed himself directly to the popular mind. Most of these letters stand among the finest monuments of our political literature. Thus he presented the singular spectacle of a President who, in the midst of a great civil war, with unprecedented duties weighing upon him, was constantly in person debating the great features of his policy with the people.|$|R
40|$|Where crises simply cause malaise, {{emergencies}} {{can move}} mountains, writes Frank CastlesAN IMPORTANT lesson {{of history is}} that to create the conditions for change one must often transform vague feelings of a need for reform into the sharp perception of an immediate source of emergency. This is a lesson that modern political managers, always out to gloss over public anxieties and minimise electoral repercussions, are wont to forget. If <b>President</b> Obama <b>really</b> wants to overcome the political logjam that has frustrated health reform in the States for many decades or if Gordon Brown and Obama want genuine action to reform the institutions of capitalism that produced the present financial meltdown, it is one these leaders {{would do well to}} remember. Emergencies can move mountains; crises simply cause malaise. The big institutional changes to modern societies of the past century have almost invariably been brought about by “black swans” – sudden and frightening national emergencies – that challenge our understandings of how our societies work and how they should work in future. The Great Depression showed us that traditional economic policies could not secure a decent level of employment or prevent mass destitution, and the insecurities of the second world war bred the solidarity to do something about it. The modern welfare states fashioned in Britain and across Western Europe in the postwar era were the something they did. Emergencies can mobilise populations to urgent action; crises breed immobility. Some governments – the Roosevelt administration in the States, the Social Democrats in Sweden and Labour in New Zealand – actually responded to the Great Depression with immediate welfare state building initiatives, without waiting for the war to give them an extra prod. These countries were the ones in which newly elected governments sought to portray national economic conditions as emergencies requiring urgent action, policy innovation and the kind of institution-building needed to prevent such emergencies ever occurring again. The countries that tried to pursue a policy of “business as usual” simply presided over the long drawn out consequences of the continuing crisis. That is the leadership test that contemporary progressive governments so often fail. Rather than upping the ante and spelling out the dire consequences of failure to act, of challenging existing institutions which have all the inertia of “elephants on the move,” they attempt the balancing act of arguing the case for change while suggesting that their judicious use of present policies can hold the line. Such a strategy may be electorally advantageous in the short-run in not offending the defenders of the status quo and in not panicking the voters, but is scarcely a recipe for building new more effective institutions or for creating the basis of a new long-term consensus capable of changing the political climate for a generation or more as occurred in Social Democratic Sweden. Modern examples of political leaders ready to buck the advice of political managers and deliberately foster a sense of emergency to create a fulcrum for reform are few and far between. One interesting example was former Prime Minister John Howard’s use of the Port Arthur Massacre to build a coalition of support for gun control in Australia. Somehow he persuaded a normally highly risk averse Liberal Party to take the calculated risk of facing off entrenched interests – both gun owners and an electorate who were asked to demonstrate their solidarity by paying a 1 per cent additional income tax levy for a year – in the name of resolving a national emergency that threatened the lives of ordinary and innocent Australians. President Obama wants to create the kind of national health care institutions that already exist in all other advanced Western nations. For that matter, he and many other Democrats want to reform gun laws with far more serious aggregate effects than any in Australia. In both areas, the obstacles to reform are far greater than almost anywhere else in the civilised world simply by virtue of the memory of a long list of attempted reforms that have failed. That should surely not be an excuse for political timidity – for gracefully accepting defeat for another eight years in the manner of the Clinton administration over the last round of attempted health reforms. It should be a reason for harnessing the “black swan” events that will inevitably come along – the swine flu mortality that may well be with us this autumn, the next Columbine – to foster the sense of true national emergency that will almost certainly be needed to mobilise political action for real change. Clearly, the same argument applies to other governments and other issues. Business as usual responses to the financial meltdown and the ecological catastrophes attendant on global warming will not get us the kind of solutions to which most governments pay lip service and which most populations would probably support with real leadership. The political courage to orchestrate emergencies as a first step in building new institutions is a quality that all countries are likely to require in coming years. The “black swans” are out there and waiting: governments need to learn to use them rather than use spin to defuse their electoral consequences. •Frank Castles is adjunct professor in the Political Science Program at the Australian National University.
