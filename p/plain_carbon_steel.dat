50|$|The {{weldability}} of steel, {{with regard}} to hydrogen-induced cold cracking, is inversely proportional to the hardenability of the steel, which measures the ease of forming martensite during heat treatment. The hardenability of steel depends on its chemical composition, with greater quantities of carbon and other alloying elements resulting in a higher hardenability and thus a lower weldability. In {{order to be able}} to judge alloys made up of many distinct materials, a measure known as the equivalent carbon content is used to compare the relative weldabilities of different alloys by comparing their properties to a <b>plain</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> The effect on weldability of elements like chromium and vanadium, while not as great as carbon, is more significant than that of copper and nickel, for example.

50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} {{considered}} stainless {{because it has}} at least 11% chromium by mass. Chromium is a relatively inert metal and does not rust or react as easily as <b>plain</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> This {{is what makes it}} an exceptional material for cooking. It is also fairly inexpensive, but does not have a very high thermal conductivity. From a surface standpoint, this is because of the thin layer of chromium oxide that is formed on the surface. This thin layer protects the metal from rusting or corroding. While it is protective, the oxide layer is not very conductive, which makes cooking food less efficient than it could be. For most cooking applications, high thermal conductivity is desirable to create an evenly heated surface on which to cook. In this way, stainless steel is usually not considered high-grade cookware.|$|E
50|$|Weight on bit is {{provided}} by drill collars, which are thick-walled tubular pieces machined from solid bars of steel, usually <b>plain</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> but sometimes of nonmagnetic nickel-copper alloy or other nonmagnetic premium alloys. Gravity acts on the large mass of the collars to provide the downward force needed for the bits to efficiently break rock. To accurately control the amount of force applied to the bit, the driller carefully monitors the surface weight measured while the bit is just off {{the bottom of the}} wellbore. Next, the drillstring (and the drill bit), is slowly and carefully lowered until it touches bottom. After that point, as the driller continues to lower the top of the drillstring, more and more weight is applied to the bit, and correspondingly less weight is measured as hanging at the surface. If the surface measurement shows 20,000 pounds kg less weight than with the bit off bottom, then there should be 20,000 pounds force on the bit (in a vertical hole). Some downhole MWD sensors can measure weight-on-bit more accurately and transmit the data to the surface.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop an iron-based alloy, similar to Type 316 {{stainless}} steel in mechanical and corrosion properties but with a reduced chromium content or, ideally, no chromium. A total of twenty-six 225 -g ingots and ten 2. 5 to 12 kg ingots of various compositions in the Fe-Si-Mn-Ni-C system were prepared. All ingots contained from 5 to 11 w/o silicon and drew their corrosion resistance primarily from this component. The composition ranges of the remaining major alloying elements were (in w/o) 0 - 24 Mn, 0 - 35 Ni, and 0. 08 to 0. 95 C. Most of the alloys were reduced to sheet, demonstrating the hot fabricability of these high-silicon alloys. The mechanical and corrosion properties of these alloys are attractive.
