Thus the aim of the system analysis was the accumulation of data and knowledge about sheep and goat milk production in Germany.

Through research, questionnaires and interviews with farmers, processors, commercial representatives and experts it was possible to generate a conclusive overview of this young sector.

State-owned (provincial) farms, which account for just 15 % of the coffee-growing area, are organised and managed by governmental cooperation (Nguyen 2010). They produce high-quality coffee with <b>professional</b> <b>farming</b> techniques. Sustainability programs have concentrated mainly on this high-yield farmer segmentation. However, the private farms accounted for 85 % of the total area operated by household farmers (less than 5  ha per household). Although they receive some support from local authorities, their farming methods are still below certification standards for coffee. Those farmers also have experienced socioeconomic inequality (Nguyen and Yapwattanaphuna 2015). Moreover, intensive use of cheap inorganic inputs and inefficient use of irrigation water have gradually resulted in soil degradation and deteriorated water quality (Zulfiqara and Zulfiqara 2017; Ali and Byerlee 2002). These issues have threatened sustainability {{of economic and social}} achievements in any areas (Zulfiqara and Zulfiqara 2017). Therefore, many problems that needs to be tackled in order to increase the production of sustainable certified coffee in Vietnam.|$|E
30|$|Faster {{growth rate}} through {{nutritional}} manipulation {{is an important}} facet for <b>professional</b> <b>farming</b> system. The dietary application of selenium has exhibited quick growth response in farm animals [58]. Nanoscale selenium also affects reproductive maturity and growth performance of fishes and farm animals like broiler chickens [59]. Nano-selenium when administered as feed supplement at a dose of 0.3  mg/kg to growing weaned Taihang black male goats showed an increase in body weight as compared to inorganic and organic selenium [52]. Scientists have investigated the effects of bulk selenium (Na 2 SeO 3) and nanoscale selenium on the meat quality of finishing pigs (Duroc[*]×[*]Landrance[*]×[*]Yorkshire). It was reported that nano-selenium is effective in increasing antioxidant capacity, selenium content and decreasing drop loss in comparison with sodium selenite [60]. It exhibited higher growth performance in broiler chicken as compared to bulk selenium at concentration range of 0.4 – 1.0  mg/kg. Chicken fed with a dose of 0.03 – 1.3  mg/kg dietary selenium exhibited an increased selenium concentration in serum, breast muscle, and liver, but this increase was comparatively greater when chicken were fed with nanoparticles [61].|$|E

According to location, mutual features and metropolitan governance, we proposed a definition of the urban agriculture which joins in a constructive way intra- and peri-urban spaces, professional and hobby farms, private, public and auto-appropriate agricultural spaces. The study took place in the city of Rennes, in Brittany (France), on the basis of exploratory surveys, on the basis of participating observation and on the basis of twelve in-depth interviews with gardening citydwellers who live the town and country relationship in terms of productive activities but also in terms of sociability, food practices and agro-ecological initiatives. The main results of the thesis are among four. Firstly, the in-depth description of the modes of involvment in the gardens as a spatial issue which represents today the productive nature in the city. Secondly, thanks to a topological approach and to its associated mapping, the highlighting of lived spaces richness for the inhabitants-gardeners, spaces which exceed widely the only current gardening place. Thirdly, "polytopic networks" built by the agricultural experiences of the city-dwellers are sources of questioning not only on the modalities of farming but also on the food and on their contribution to the construction of the city. Fourthly, the agricultural production can be considered as an urban function reconnecting the inhabitant with his environment, thus renewing the inhabiting modes, itemized as three "gardening attitudes": "clever gardener", "rurban gardener" and "militant gardener...|$|E

40|$|Background: Bluetongue (BT) is a {{vector-borne disease}} of {{ruminants}} caused by bluetongue virus that is transmitted by biting midges (Culicoides spp.). In 2006, {{the introduction of}} BTV serotype 8 (BTV- 8) caused a severe epidemic in Western and Central Europe. The principal effective veterinary measure in response to BT {{was believed to be}} vaccination accompanied by other measures such as movement restrictions and surveillance. As the number of vaccine doses available {{at the start of the}} vaccination campaign was rather uncertain, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality and the Dutch agricultural industry wanted to evaluate several different vaccination strategies. This study aimed to rank eight vaccination strategies based on their efficiency (i. e. net costs in relation to prevented losses or benefits) for controlling the bluetongue virus serotype 8 epidemic in 2008 Methodology/Principal Findings: An economic model was developed that included the Dutch professional cattle, sheep and goat sectors together with the hobby farms. Strategies were evaluated based on the least cost - highest benefit frontier, the benefit-cost ratio and the total net returns. Strategy F, where all adult sheep at <b>professional</b> <b>farms</b> in the Netherlands would be vaccinated was very efficient at lowest costs, whereas strategy D, where additional to all adult sheep at <b>professional</b> <b>farms</b> also all adult cattle in the four Northern provinces would be vaccinated, was also very efficient but at a little higher costs. Strategy C, where all adult sheep and cattle at <b>professional</b> <b>farms</b> in the whole of the Netherlands would be vaccinated was also efficient but again at higher costs.

40|$|How can we {{approach}} strategies and innovations specific to organic farmers? Is {{the appearance of}} new practices evidence of a modification {{of the structure of}} <b>professional</b> organic <b>farming?</b> On the basis of a field study carried out in the Midi-Pyrénées region in France, sociological analysis casts light on several examples of strategies and innovations specific to the world of organic farming and from which they arise. The strategic courses of action taken by organic farmers are therefore analysed in relation to organic farming characteristics, defined as the set of issues, interests, representations and other specific characteristics that structure this socio-professional field. Organic farming innovations are the result of interactions between the socio-technical framework, the result of how this field is structured, and the practices of organic farmers (having, to some extent, incorporated these same properties). The emergence of innovative practices as a result of new inputs (converted or used for the first time) is proof of the structural modifications taking place within the area of <b>professional</b> organic <b>farming.</b> Although they may appear to “enrich” organic farming diversity, these new practices are partially derived from traditional farming practices not used in organic farming.
