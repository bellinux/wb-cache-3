40|$|This paper brings {{together}} {{a number of}} previously known techniques {{in order to obtain}} practical and efficient "pipelined" implementations of the prefix operation for the complete binary tree, hypercube, and shuffle-exchange families of networks. In each case, we provide a scheme for performing k prefix operations in O(k + <b>lg</b> <b>p)</b> time on p processors. The same bounds are shown to apply to the "data distribution" operation of Ullman [9]. The data distribution primitive leads to a simplified implementation of the optimal merging algorithm of Varman and Doshi [10], which runs on a pipelined model of the hypercube. Finally, a pipelined version of the multi-way merge sort of Nassimi and Sahni [7], running on the pipelined hypercube model, is described. Given p processors and n ! <b>p</b> <b>lg</b> <b>p</b> values to be sorted, the running time of the pipelined algorithm is O(lg 2 p= lg((p <b>lg</b> <b>p)</b> =n)).

The algorithm runs in linear time and sorts {{all but a}} very small fraction 2 -# n) of the input sequences; the best previously known bound was 2 -# n/(lg n lg lg n)). An EREW PRAM version of the sequential algorithm sorts in O((n/p+lg <b>p)</b> <b>lg</b> n/ lg (n/p + lg n)) time using p # n processors under the same probabilistic conditions.

We present an algorithm simulating one step of an (n lg lg n) - processor crcw pram on an n Θ n rmesh with delay O(lg lg n) with high probability. We use our pram simulation to obtain the first efficient self-simulation algorithm of an rmesh with general switches: An algorithm running on an n Θ n rmesh is simulated on a p Θ p rmesh with delay O((n=p) 2 + lg n <b>lg</b> <b>lg</b> <b>p)</b> with high probability, which is optimal for all <b>p</b> n= <b>p</b> <b>lg</b> n lg lg n.

40|$|Abstract. We propose several modi cations to {{the binary}} buddy system for {{managing}} dynamic allocation of memory blocks whose sizes are powers of two. The standard buddy system allocates and deallocates blocks in (lg n) {{time in the}} worst case (and on an amortized basis), where n {{is the size of}} the memory. We present two schemes that improve the running time to O(1) time, where the time bound for deallocation is amortized.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the queue-read, queue-write (qrqw) parallel random access machine (pram) model, which permits concurrent {{reading and writing}} to shared memory locations, but at a cost proportional {{to the number of}} readers/writers to any one memory location in a given step. Prior to this work there were no formal complexity models that accounted for the contention to memory locations, despite its large impact on the performance of parallel programs. The qrqw pram model reflects the contention properties of most commercially available parallel machines more accurately than either the well-studied crcw pram or erew pram models: the crcw model does not adequately penalize algorithms with high contention to shared memory locations, while the erew model is too strict in its insistence on zero contention at each step. The qrqw pram is strictly more powerful than the erew pram. This paper shows a separation of <b>p</b> <b>lg</b> n between the two models, and presents faster and more efficient qrqw [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{concerns}} {{have been given}} to morphophonemic phenomena in Indonesian from the perspective of morphology-phonology intersection or even semantics. This paper studies the same phenomenon from Natural Language Processing (NLP) application, and proposes an automatic prefixing model which can later be used to perform NLP tasks such as pattern matching and automatic extraction. The focus of this paper is the phenomena of meN- prefixing in Indonesian. The machine readable linguistic resources built in this paper is expected to transform the linguistic description pertaining to the morphophonemic constraints to an applicable mean for NLP. To accomplish this goal, Local Grammar (<b>LG)</b> <b>approach</b> is employed since this approach is very powerful to describe and formalize a linguistic phenomenon. A corpus processing software, UNITEX, is also employed to apply LG in carrying NLP tasks. It demonstrates how morphophonemic prefixing in Indonesian can be carried out automatically to generate an inflected form machine readable dictionaries as lexical resources and how the resources are used for pattern matching and automatic extraction. The existing linguistic resources from the experiment (machine readable dictionaries, regular expressions and LGGs) are maintainable, open for development and application in a larger corpus, and potential to be used to improve search engines performance for on-line documents in Indonesian...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundRepair of {{soft tissue}} {{in favour of}} the {{posterior}} <b>approach</b> for <b>total</b> hip arthroplasty is still under discussion and few studies are assessing this issue. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and safety of the posterior <b>approach</b> for <b>total</b> hip arthroplasty with and without soft tissue repair. We focused on these questions as follows: does primary posterior <b>approach</b> for <b>total</b> hip arthroplasty with soft tissue repair has better result regarding dislocation rate, Harris hip score and the sciatic nerve palsy rate compared with posterior approach without soft tissue repair. Patients and methodsWe conducted electronic literature searches using CENTRAL (Issue 1 of 12, Jan 2014), PUBMED (1980 to Jan 2014), and EMBASE (1980 to Jan 2014). Clinical studies evaluating the posterior <b>approach</b> for <b>total</b> hip arthroplasty with and without soft tissue repair were collected. After independent study selection by 2 authors, data were collected and extracted independently. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. ResultSeven clinical trials with 4594 hips using the posterior <b>approach</b> for <b>total</b> hip arthroplasty were included. The pooled data indicated a lower rate of dislocation (OR: 0. 14, 95 % CI: 0. 08 – 0. 26, P< 0. 00001) and higher Harris hip score (1. 75, 95 % CI: 1. 19 to 2. 32, P< 0. 00001, I 2 = 26 %) after the posterior <b>approach</b> to <b>total</b> hip arthroplasty using soft tissue repair than without using soft tissue repair. There was no statistical difference in sciatic nerve palsy {{between the use of}} soft tissue repair and without it in posterior <b>approach</b> to <b>total</b> hip arthroplasty (OR: 5. 34, 95 % CI: 0. 25 – 112. 25, P= 0. 28). DiscussionOur meta-analysis included data from more studies than were previously available and demonstrated that the use of soft tissue repair and without it in posterior <b>approach</b> to <b>total</b> hip arthroplasty are similar in safety. Using repair resulted in a lower dislocation rate and higher Harris hip score than without repair. Levels of evidenceLevel 2 meta-analysis of low-powered prospective randomised trial...|$|R
40|$|The Linguistic Geometry (<b>LG)</b> <b>approach</b> to {{discrete}} systems {{was introduced}} B. Stilman in early 80 s. It employed competing/cooperating agents for modeling and controlling of discrete systems. The approach {{was applied to}} a variety of problems with huge state spaces including control of aircraft, battlefield robots, and chess. One of the key innovations of LG is the use of almost winning strategies, rather than truly winning strategies for the playing agents. There are many cases where the winning strategies have so high time complexity that they are not computable in practice, whereas the almost winning strategies can be applied and they beat the opposing agent almost guaranteed. Independently of LG the idea of competing/ cooperating agents was employed in the late 80 s by A. Nerode, A. Yakhnis, and V. Yakhnis (NYY) within their approach to modeling concurrent systems and, more recently, within the “Strategy Approach to Hybrid Systems ” developed for continuous systems by A. Nerode, W. Kohn, A. Yakhnis, and others. In order to enlarge the range of applications of Stilman's results as well as to understand why they work, we introduce a new notion of a multi-agent graph-game. Since the applications of Linguistic Geometry sometimes require modeling of agents making simultaneous moves, the new notion was designed to accommodate such behavior of players...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} is presented for polarization analysis of three-component seismic array data. The process {{is applied to}} a large suite of regional events recorded on the three-component sensors in the NORESS array in southern Norway. Polarization properties of the regional seismic phases <b>P,,</b> S,, and <b>Lg</b> are examined in detail. The analysis {{technique is}} based on a time-domain algorithm originally proposed by Flinn (1965). The polarization ellipse is computed within sliding time windows by solving the eigenproblem for the covariance matrix. Various attributes characterizing the particle motions are extracted from the motion ellipse. This technique is extended to multiple three-component sensors in an array configu-ration by averaging covariance matrices for the different sensors. In this case a 1 /M reduction in the estimation variance is obtained (M is the number of sensors), when the noise and local scattering effects are uncorrelated. An important feature of this approach is that the phase velocities of coherent wavefronts across the array are not required to a high degree of accuracy. Significant results of the data analysis are the well-defined polarization of P, and Sn waves across the entire short-period band, the source azimuth estimates obtained from <b>P,</b> and <b>Lg</b> motions, and the distinct polarization for S, and Lg waves allowing these phases to be distinguished in most cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify {{differences}} in the kinematic and kinetic profiles of the trunk and lower extremities during baseball pitching in collegiate baseball pitchers, in relation to differences in the pitched ball velocity. The subjects were 30 collegiate baseball pitchers aged 18 to 22 yrs, who were assigned to high- (HG, 37. 4 ± 0. 8 m·s- 1) and low-pitched-ball-velocity groups (LG, 33. 3 ± 0. 8 m·s- 1). Three-dimensional motion analysis with a comprehensive lower-extremity model was used to evaluate kinematic and kinetic parameters during baseball pitching. The ground-reaction forces (GRF) of the pivot and stride legs during pitching were determined using two multicomponent force plates. The joint torques of hip, knee, and ankle were calculated using inverse-dynamics computation of a musculoskeletal human model. To eliminate any effect of variation in body size, kinetic and GRF data were normalized by dividing them by body mass. The maxima and minima of GRF (Fy, Fz, and resultant forces) on the pivot and stride leg were significantly greater in the HG than in the <b>LG</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). Furthermore, Fy, Fz, and resultant forces on the stride leg at maximum shoulder external rotation and ball release were significantly greater in the HG than in the <b>LG</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). The hip abduction, hip internal rotation and knee extension torques of the pivot leg and the hip adduction torque of the stride leg when it contacted the ground were significantly greater in the HG than in the <b>LG</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05).
