50|$|Because {{of these}} very strong and rigid joints, some of the bending moment in the rafters is {{transferred}} to the columns. This means {{that the size of}} the rafters can be reduced or the span can be increased for the same size rafters. This makes <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> a very efficient construction technique to use for wide span buildings.|$|E
50|$|Generally <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> {{are used}} for single-story {{buildings}} {{but they can be}} used for low-rise buildings with several floors where they can be economic if the floors do not span right across the building (in these circumstances a skeleton frame, with internal columns, would be a more economic choice). A typical configuration might be where there is office space built against one wall of a warehouse.|$|E

40|$|The {{realistic}} {{strength and}} deflection behavior {{of industrial and}} commercial steel <b>portal</b> <b>frame</b> buildings are understood only if the effects of rigidity of end frames and profiled steel claddings are included. The conventional designs ignore these effects and are very much based on idealized two-dimensional (2 D) frame behavior. Full-scale tests of a 1212 m steel <b>portal</b> <b>frame</b> building under a range of design load cases indicated that the observed deflections and bending moments in the <b>portal</b> <b>frame</b> were considerably different from those obtained from a 2 D analysis of frames ignoring these effects. Three-dimensional (3 D) analyses of the same building, including the effects of end frames and cladding, were carried out, and the results agreed well with full-scale test results.

50|$|Monte Tabor is a metro {{station on}} the Line 5 of the Santiago Metro, in Santiago, Chile. It was opened on February 3, 2011, {{as part of an}} {{extension}} of the Line 5 from Quinta Normal metro station. It is one of the three stations built on a viaduct on the just mentioned extension. The platforms and tracks are enclosed by a steel framed structure. The <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> are rectangular in shape with rounded corners and have different heights, which creates an undulating pattern along the platforms lengthwise. The structure base is overlapped by an arched tensile membrane structure. This portion of the station is laterally covered with sandwich-structured composite panels of aluminum.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, glass and reinforced concrete. Compared with the other new stations Holden designed for the extension, Cockfosters' street buildings are modest in scale, lacking the mass of Oakwood or Arnos Grove or the avant-garde flourish of Southgate. Holden's early design sketches show the station with two towers. The most striking feature of the station is the tall concrete and glass train shed roof and platform canopies which are supported by <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> of narrow blade-like concrete columns and beams rising from the platforms and spanning across the tracks. The trainshed roof constructed at Uxbridge in 1937-38 was built to a similar design. Cockfosters station is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

50|$|The new {{building}} had been constructed on land once {{belonging to the}} Medieval manor of Lamorbey House. The manor house to which the school was now adjacent had been rebuilt {{in the eighteenth century}} and by 1950 was housing Rose Bruford College. Chis and Sid's {{new building}} was designed by Howard C. Lobb & Partners of Gower Street, in conjunction with the Kent County Architects S. H. Loweth and E. T. Ashley Smith. As a result of post-war austerity, the building was constructed on a tight budget of under £300,000, and consisted of reinforced concrete and <b>portal</b> <b>frames,</b> with a brickwork finished. The design was largely deemed to be aesthetically unpleasing by both students and staff, although it did allow them access to twice as much land as they had had at Crittal's Corner. Opening in 1954, it was officially opened in a ceremony led by the Lord Lieutenant of Kent and the Bishop of Rochester. As part of the move, in September 1954 it had been decided that the school houses would be renamed as Davies, Edlmann, Williams, Staff, Townshend, and Lester, all figures who had played a prominent role in the school's history. The move also saw a change in the school's winter sport from football to rugby, although cricket remained the school's summer sport.|$|E
50|$|Terminating {{the tree}} lined avenue are the Assembly Hall and the Administration {{building}}. The Administration building {{was the first}} building constructed on the site. It is a classical two storey rendered brick building, designed by Brockwell Gill, that was constructed in stages from 1892. The first stage consisted of the central portion with a transverse gabled wing to the left hand end. Another transverse gabled wing was added at the right hand end in 1901, completing the symmetry of the building. The gabled ends have pilasters rising up through two storeys and terminating in three semi-circular arches above the upper storey windows. The date of construction of each wing is inscribed in raised lettering below each central upper window. The central portion of the facade consists of a ground floor arcaded verandah with a central semi-circular arch leading to the central entrance door. This semi-circular arch is repeated on the upper verandah and is surmounted by a central gabled roof. Timber finials and decorative timber fretwork are {{at the end of}} each gable.The internal walls of the Administration building consist mainly of a painted rendered finish up to the dado line with painted brick above. The majority of the interior timber joinery is intact. A decorative roof lantern lights the fine timber stairwell in the 1901 wing. The 1892 wing also contains a more simply detailed timber stair. The upper room in this wing features heavy timber roof trusses with a diagonally boarded ceiling lined on the rake and timber honour boards dating back to the formation of the school.The rear of the Administration building consists of several wings built around a central courtyard. The rear wings were constructed in stages, beginning with a single storey and resulting in two storey wings to three sides of the courtyard. These wings are of brick and timber construction, with narrow verandahs on both sides of a central room core. The verandahs are simply detailed with timber balustrades with a cross pattern and curved timber brackets.The Assembly Hall was designed in 1964 by Dr Karl Langer and terminates the tree lined entry avenue. The hall has a simple gabled portico to the front with a finely textured face-brick main wall behind. A Shillam sculpture of birds in flight is in the forecourt of the building. Double glazed timber doors lead into the foyer at the front of the building. The interior volume of the hall is punctuated by steel webbed truss <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> which continue out to support the roof of a side aisle on the eastern side. Langer's concern with climatic design is shown in the design of the building. Indirect light is admitted to the hall through eastern clerestory glazing. A folded brick wall to the eastern aisle has glazing on the south walls to admit additional indirect light. High level louvres on the western wall allow the exit of warm air and aid cross-ventilation. Original metal and glass light fittings remain in the foyer and the dark-stained vertical boarded detailing to parts of the hall is intact. The hall has been extended since it was constructed.|$|E

The <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> described in this paper consists of a column and two rafter members, formed from single cold-formed channels sections, and bolted back-to-back at the eaves joint through a gusset plate. Tests were performed to evaluate the structural performance of the eaves region of double-bay <b>portal</b> <b>frames.</b> The eaves region represents {{the distance from the}} point of maximum moment (eaves joint) to the point of zero moment (contraflexure) in the rafters and columns respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Double-bay or multi-bay <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> of {{hot-rolled}} steel {{have been}} in existence since {{the development of the}} plastic analysis theory, and the behaviour of the eaves connections of these frames are well established. With the increasing use of cold-formed steel in <b>portal</b> <b>frames,</b> it is necessary to develop connecting structural systems that are favourable to these elements, and to understand the behaviour of these connections. The purpose of this investigation is to develop internal eaves connections of double-bay <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> of cold-formed steel channels, with the main frames members connected back-to-back. In double-bay <b>portal</b> <b>frames,</b> the columns of two single-bay <b>portal</b> <b>frames,</b> positioned adjacent to each other, are replaced by one internal column. Two internal eaves connections were developed and investigated, and are referred in this paper as Eaves Connection Type 1 (ECT- 1) and Eaves Connection Type 2 (ECT- 2). Tests were then performed to determine the capacity and failure mechanism of these connections, including the members forming these connections. Although the failure mechanisms included local buckling of the compression zone of the web and flange of the channels, and bolt-bearing deformations, all frames finally failed by local buckling of the web and flange of the channels. The moment-curvature graphs show that enough plasticity could not be achieved in both connections...|$|E
