In order to overwhelm the shortcomings of the control measures of the welding fume, the research of the purifying of welding fume on the spot was carried out. The purifying device was designed. The relationship between the corona discharge voltage and the <b>purifying</b> <b>efficiency</b> was investigated through experiments with different needle-electrode numbers, different ring-electrode numbers and different needle-plate distances. The results show that 5 -needle double-ring electrode has the best efficiency; the <b>purifying</b> <b>efficiency</b> is increase with the lessening of the needle-plate distance and the increase of the discharge voltage. Using 5 -needle double-ring electrode, the <b>purifying</b> <b>efficiency</b> reaches its maximum value 97. 9 % while the needle-plate distance is 6 cm, the discharge voltage is- 35 kV. The purifying device has an excellent purifying effect on the welding fume...|$|E
30|$|Introduction Drug {{poisoning}} is {{a frequent}} cause of hospital admission especially {{in intensive care unit}} (ICU). Despite advances in treatment, hospital mortality of severe acute poisoning admitted in ICU seems to increase. Purifying methods, continuous haemodiafiltration veinoveinous (CVVHDF) and molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) were developed with promising clinical results [1]. However no analytical study has quantified their accurately <b>purifying</b> <b>efficiency.</b> It has not been assessed efficiency of the different compartments of MARS nor its advantages over other methods of dialysis and filtration. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the <b>purifying</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the different compartments of the CVVHDF and MARS and to compare their respective efficiency in an ex vivo model in the most favourable conditions for these methods to assess their maximum capacity purification.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The biosand filter (BSF) {{is widely}} applied in {{developing}} counties {{as an appropriate}} technology-based product for supplying “safe ” water. Biosand filters exhibit relatively high <b>purifying</b> <b>efficiency</b> because of the schmutzdecke (biofilm) embedded in them. However, schmutzdecke should be cleaned or discarded {{on a regular basis}} to maintain the <b>purifying</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the BSF. Due to its role in BSFs, the purifying function of schmutzdecke, rather than its potential risk when not properly discarded, has so far been the primary focus of research. This study aims to provide a risk assessment of schmutzdecke in an attempt to draw attention to a wholly new angle of schmutzdecke usage. We conducted 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to identify opportunistic pathogens in schmutzdecke developed using water from the Hyung-San River. The results reveal that the schmutzdecke derived from this water source contains diverse and relatively high portions of opportunistic pathogen strains; 55 % of all isolates collected from schmutzdecke were identified as opportunistic pathogens. Moreover, the diversity of microorganisms is increased in the schmutzdecke compared to its water source in terms of diversity of genus, phylum and opportunistic pathogen strain.

It is shown that the exotoxin is an adenine derivative substituted at position 9 and having a molecular weight of approximately 825. It can be dephosphorylated enzymically or chemically under conditions that define the exotoxin as a phosphomonoester. This results in loss of toxicity, both to insects and to mice. Spectroscopic and kinetic data are presented which suggest that a β-ribofuranosyl moiety may be attached to the adenine. Glucose and allomucic acid have been positively identified as hydrolysis fragments from the exotoxin.

It induces transcription from the - 12 /- 24 promoters of the genes of the formate regulon by sigma 54 RNA polymerase.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{important}} {{indices of}} myogenic differentiation are {{the formation of}} syncytial myotubes and the postmitotic arrest from the cell cycle, both of which occur after fusion of mononucleate cells. We show here that these indices are reversed in {{the environment of the}} urodele limb regeneration blastema. In order to introduce an integrated (genetic) marker into newt myotubes, we infected mononucleate cells in culture with a pseudotyped retrovirus expressing human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP). After fusion the myotubes expressed AP and could be purified by sieving and micromanipulation so as to remove all mononucleate cells. When such purified retrovirus-labelled myotubes were implanted into a limb blastema they gave rise to mononucleate progeny with high <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Purified</b> myotubes labelled with fluorescent lipophilic cell tracker dye also gave rise to mononucleate cells; myotubes which were double labelled with the tracker dye and a nuclear stain gave rise to double-labelled mononucleate progeny.

40|$|The use of TiO 2 as {{photocatalyst}} {{in building}} materials is a rapidly developing technology in environmental engineering. In {{the presence of}} UV-light, anatase, a crystalline form of TiO 2, acts as a photocatalyst and decomposes organic particles and exhaust gases. Materials treated with TiO 2 also become highly hydrophilic {{and can be used}} as self-cleaning materials. Furthermore, these materials have a great potential to cope with the increasing air pollution, caused by traffic and industry. Due to the photocatalytic effect, NOx is oxidized resulting in an air purifying action. For an optimal application of TiO 2 in building materials, {{it is important that the}} photocatalytical TiO 2 is accessible to UV-light. To ensure the adhesion of TiO 2 to the surface of the material, a layer of polymer modified cement mortar can be applied and TiO 2 can be added to the fresh mortar mixture.

40|$|Requirements on {{the quality}} of the {{effluents}} discharged by Messrs. Julius Glatz GmbH Papermills in Neidenfels/Germany with their plants Neidenfels and Frankeneck exceeded by far the generally acknowledged technical norms. Messrs. Glatz GmbH has chosen a purifying method which clearly improved the quality of the effluent beyond the demanded values, a system known as a BIOlogical Fixed-film Oxygen Reactor (BIOFOR). The biological reactor shows an extremely high operational reliability. Even though the contamination of the waste water differs, the installed capacity is sufficient enough to meet the demanded water quality. After the semi-technical trials, the <b>purifying</b> <b>efficiency</b> is much better than expected. Halogen-organic compounds - AOX - are eliminated up to 50 %, thus a stable AOX-concentration of below 0. 1 mg/l in the effluent is obtained. The mechanism to eliminate AOX converts more than 90 % of the eliminated AOX into inorganic chloride and is equivalent to a biological decomposition. The high total elimination capacity of the plant is obviously, apart of the biological decomposition and the mechanical filtration effect, also a matter of an adsorption of smallest particles, colloids and molecular dissolved organic compounds on the biological fixed film of the reactor. The stability of the purifying capacity, the low maintenance expanditure and the relative low specific operating costs of the plant makes especially this process very suitable for this application.

30|$|Extracting pure {{fullerene}} (C 60) from fullerene soot {{was accomplished}} in two steps. In the first step, extraction {{was carried out}} using a Soxhlet extractor. Different solvents, such as toluene, were used in this method. In this process, light and heavy fullerenes were separated from impurities such as soot and other compounds. The applied fullerene soot was produced using an electric arc method, and the obtained purity was close to 7 %. In the next step, fullerene C 60 can be separated from other fullerenes (particularly C 70) by column chromatography. The stationary phase in the chromatography column contained a mixture of activated carbon, silica gel, and celite, {{and in order to}} achieve a high efficiency for separation, the column was filled with a combination of these compounds. Organic solvents such as chlorobenzene and 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene were used as the mobile phase. Several experiments were designed and conducted to obtain optimal conditions, and consequently, the fullerene C 60 was <b>purified</b> with proper <b>efficiency.</b> In this method, parameters including efficiency, low cost, and simplicity are of great importance in the aim of obtaining an optimized method. As a result, a suitable method with low cost and high efficiency was used in this research.|$|R

Recently, we developed the engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) technology for purification {{of specific}} genomic regions. Here, we developed a retroviral expression system for enChIP using CRISPR. We showed that the target genomic locus can be <b>purified</b> with high <b>efficiency</b> by using this system. We also showed that contamination of potential off-target sites is negligible by using this system if the guide RNA (gRNA) for the target site has a sufficiently long unique sequence in its seed sequence. enChIP combined with stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) analysis identified proteins whose association with the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor- 1 (IRF- 1) promoter region increases in response to IFNc stimulation. The list of the associated proteins contained many novel proteins {{in the context of}} IFNc-induced gene expression as well as proteins related to histone deacetylase complexes whose involvement has been suggested in IFNc-mediated gene expression. Finally, we confirmed IFNc-induced increased association of the identified proteins with the IRF- 1 promoter by ChIP.

40|$|Aqueous dispersions {{of reduced}} {{graphene}} oxide (rGO) and multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were fabricated through a modified chemical reduction method. The significant {{advantage of the}} method developed here is the omission of any stabilising compound or organic solvent to obtain stable rGO&# 8211;MWCNT dispersions. Significantly biological entities, {{in this case the}} enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx), can be successfully incorporated into the dispersion. These dispersions were characterised using XPS, SEM, zeta potential and particle size measurements which showed that the dispersion stability is not sacrificed with the addition of GOx, and significantly, the electrical properties of the rGO and MWCNTs are maintained. In this study, rGO acts as an effective dispersing agent for MWCNTs and does not affect the solubility or electroactivity of the GOx. Bioelectrodes fabricated from these rGO&# 8211;MWCNT&# 8211;GOx dispersions were characterised electrochemically to test their feasibility in facilitating direct electron transfer (DET) from the redox centre of the enzyme to the electrode.

40|$|Worldwide {{there are}} many of both to mat and {{groundwater}} bodies that were affected by several serious pollution sources. Moreover, some of these bodies of water used for drinking source. One of biggest sources of these pollutants are untreated waste water, which comes either in direct contact with the water bodies through the discharge of untreated waste water via the overflow to centralized wastewater treatment are sent to these water bodies. Or by indirect emissions through leaks in the sewer network that infiltrated into groundwater and further to the nearest surface water. A local wastewater management could be the key to achieving the best results in terms of economic issues related to water transport and water treatment in the central facilities, and ecological issues associated with line leaks and overflow events. In order to get this in place, you have to separate the sewage into two fractions, namely black water (toilet water) and gray water (not toilet faction). In this way one can easily treat both fractions in that black water accumulates and then sediments into a septic tank. While gray water can be processed for example in a mini purification plant.

TN concentration was decreased by 4. 5 %, 10. 1 % and 14. 6 % in the purification pond with a substitution of commercial feeds for 5 %, 10 % and 15 %, respectively. Water quality regulation technology did not affect TN and TP concentration in the cultivation and purification ponds. Compared with one time's harvest for water hyacinth, it was reduced 10. 0 % and 10. 0 % for TN concentration and 11. 1 % and 11. 1 % for TP concentration in the cultivation pond by harvest two times and three times, respectively. TN concentration was decreased by 16. 1 % and 17. 2 % in the purification pond. In summary, N and P input from commercial feeds were an important cause for the over-range of N and P concentration in the residue water. TN and TP concentration will decrease with increasing substitution rate for commercial feeds in the cultivation and purification ponds. It needs only to harvest two times for water hyacinth when the purifying water will meet the Ⅲ type surface water standard.

With increasing population the need for energy efficient and ecologically sus- tainable solutions for water recovery will grow. Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC) are a promising technique with a potential to contribute to solv- ing this task, {{which is why they}} have been under extensive studies for several years in the context of wastewater treatment and energy recov- ery. A MFC designed for wastewater treatment consists of an electrolysis cell that uses wastewater as electrolyte, turning the chemical energy into electrical energy whilst microbes digests the nutrients and organic sub- stances. Some specific microbes, electrochemically active bacterias, are capable of anaerobic digestion and when the organic loadings are con- sumed, electrons and protons are released and a current can be collected from the fuel cell. This paper is a review of the most recent research focused on solving the critical problems that still prohibit a large scale usage of MFC for wastewater treatment. The most prominent issues are related to high initial costs och operational stability and the aim {{of this study is to}} summarize the state of art regarding cost effective materials and configurations and also to discuss what the future role of MFC in wastewater treatment might be. Due to the limited format only the eco- nomical and ecological aspects of sustainability is regarded. The results from this review indicates that the most cost effective basic configuration of MFC is membranless and free from expensive catalysts. Many studies show that the use of biological catalysts, such as microbial biofilm on the electrode surfaces, is a low-cost and effective way of stimulating the oxidation-reduction-reactions that drives the MFC. Also the use of air- cathodes, where the cathode is exposed to the air in order to stimulate oxygen reduction, instead of energy consuming air pump, is a promising way forward. Recently the use of natural materials, such as loofah and clay ware, have been studied with various results, and if the operational stability and overall performance could be enhanced this might well be a sustainable rout in research. Another strong trend is the use of cole-, metaloxide- or polymerbased nanomaterials which have a documented ability to increase both electric and <b>purifying</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> but the ecolog- ical sustainability regarding nanomaterials is a complex question which is not answered in this paper. Altogether, the research covered in this work shows that large scale wastewater treatment with MFC alone not at all is near at hand. However, some minor improvements have been made regarding cost effective and ecologically sustainable materials and con- figurations for MFC, and these findings could well be used in a context where MFC is integrated with other techniques, such as a Membrane Bio Reactor or Constructed Wetland, in order to take advantage of the syner- gistic effects that has been noticed in several studies. This might be the most reasonable role for MFC to play in the future wastewater treatment business, thereby contributing to the global strive for sustainability. ...|$|R

The <b>efficiency</b> of energy transfer between anthroylouabain and N-[7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl]- 6 -aminohexyl ouabain was 29. 2 % in the microsomes compared with 62. 6 % in the purified preparation. Similar results were obtained with 5 -(and- 6) -carboxyfluorescein- 6 -aminohexyl ouabain as acceptor. We calculate that either the protomer bound probes were on the average 13 Å farther apart in the microsomes than in the purified membranes, or that 53 % of the protomers are monomeric in the microsome preparation. Microsomes prepared {{in the presence of}} phalloidin (a toxin that binds to F actin and stabilizes the actin-based cytoskeleton) showed less quench than those prepared in its absence.

However, the mechanism by which HIV- 1 -infects placental cells remains to be elucidated. We have found that purified cytotrophoblasts as well as trophoblastic cell lines are susceptible to infection by different HIV- 1 isolates as detected by DNA-PCR and release of infectious virus, although with very low <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Purified</b> trophoblast or trophoblastic cell lines express low levels of chemokine receptors CCR- 5 and CXCR- 4 but not CD 4 on the cell surface. To test if those molecules were used as receptors for HIV- 1 infection, placental cells were pretreated with antibodies to CD 4, CC-chemokines, C-X-C chemokines. None of those treatments inhibited HIV- 1 infection. In contrast, {{we have found that}} HIV- 1 infection of placental cells was increased in cocultures of infected T-cell blasts and placental cells. More interestingly, antibodies to β 2 integrins and to LFA- 1 were able to significantly block infection of placental cells. Cell surface expression of ICAM- 1, an adhesion molecule involved in attachment of leukocytes to placenta, was upregulated in HIV- 1 -infected placental cells. Placental cells were able to transfer HIV- 1 infection to T-cell blasts. This transmission required cell to cell contact and was also inhibited by anti-LFA- 1 antibodies. In summary our results suggest that placental trophoblast could be infected by HIV- 1 by a mechanism involving T cell to placental contact. Moreover, placental infection enhanced ICAM- 1 expression and leukocyte adherence, an event which was required to transfer HIV- 1 infection to T cells.

40|$|Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a non-enveloped, {{double-stranded}} DNA virus, {{is responsible}} for 5 % of human cancers. The HPV capsid consists of major and minor structural proteins, L 1 and L 2. L 1 proteins form an icosahedral shell with building blocks of the pentameric capsomere, and one L 2 molecule extends outward from the central hole of the capsid. Thus, L 2 is concealed within L 1 and only becomes exposed when the capsid interacts with host cells. The low antigenic variation of L 2 means that this protein could offer a target {{for the development of}} a pan-HPV vaccine. Toward this goal, here we describe an anti-L 2 monoclonal antibody, 14 H 6, which broadly neutralizes at least 11 types of HPV, covering types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, 58 and 59, in pseudovirion [...] based cell neutralization assay. The mAb 14 H 6 recognizes a minimal linear epitope located on amino acids 21 to 30 of the L 2 protein. Alanine scanning mutagenesis and sequence alignment identified several conserved residues (Cys 22, Lys 23, Thr 27, Cys 28 and Pro 29) that are involved in the 14 H 6 binding with L 2.

The complexes specifically incorporated virus particles and only few other proteins, were not cytotoxic, did not reduce the stability of the viruses, and were large enough to sediment, delivering the viruses to the cells more rapidly than by simple diffusion.

The formation of virus-polymer complexes also permitted concentrating viruses and purifying the stocks from inhibitors of transduction. Pelleting of the complexes followed by resuspension of the pellet in a reduced volume of fresh cell culture medium resulted in substantial enhancement of transduction. Purified virus stocks could be used in smaller quantities than unprocessed stocks to achieve a given level of gene transfer and reduced uncertainties about the relationship between the amount of virus used and the number of genes transferred. When using high concentrations of <b>purified</b> viruses, the <b>efficiency</b> of gene transfer was dependent on the number of envelope proteins displayed on the surface of each virus particle. Viruses with a low number of envelope proteins transduced cells more efficiently than did viruses with a high number of envelope proteins, and allowed more integrations of the transgene per target cell. In contrast, when the number of envelope proteins per virus particle was high, transduction appeared to be limited by a reduction in availability of functional receptors for viruses pseudotyped with the same envelope. Taken together, this novel method for processing retrovirus stocks and a better understanding of major limitations of transduction should simplify efforts to predict the outcome of retrovirus transduction protocols and should help to increase the likelihood that human gene therapy protocols will succeed.

40|$|This thesis {{encompasses}} CO 2 mitigation {{using three}} different processes: i) natural gas-fired combined cycle with chemical looping combustion (CLC), ii) trigeneration of electrical power, hydrogen and district heating with extended CLC, iii) steam-based gasification of biomass integrated in an advanced power cycle. In CLC, a solid oxygen carrier circulates between two fluidised-bed reactors and transports oxygen from the combustion {{air to the}} fuel; thus, the fuel is not mixed with air and an inherent CO 2 separation occurs. In this thesis, CLC has been studied as an alternative process for CO 2 capture in a natural gas-fired combined cycle (NGCC). The potential efficiency of such a process using a turbine inlet temperature of 1200 °C and a pressure ratio of 13 is between 52 and 53 % when including the penalty for CO 2 compression to 110 bar. It is shown that this efficiency cannot be further improved by including an additional CO 2 turbine. Two conceivable reactor designs for CLC in an NGCC are presented. Top-firing has been studied as an option to overcome a temperature limitation in the CLC reactor system. The degree of CO 2 capture is shown versus {{the temperature in the}} CLC reactor and its combustion efficiency. CLC has the potential to reach both a higher efficiency and a higher degree of CO 2 capture than conventional post combustion CO 2 capture technique. However, {{further research is needed to}} solve technical problems as, for example, temperature limitations in the reactor to reach this potential. Extended CLC (exCLC) is introduced, in which hydrogen is not only produced but also inherently <b>purified.</b> The potential <b>efficiency</b> of a novel tri-generation process for hydrogen, electricity and district heating using exCLC for CO 2 capture is investigated. The results show that a thermal efficiency of about 54 % might be achieved. A novel power process named evaporative biomass air turbine (EvGT-BAT) for biomass feedstock is presented. This process contains a steam-based gasification of biomass, which is integrated in an externally fired gas turbine cycle with top-firing. In the EvGT-BAT process, the steam-based gasification is conducted in an entrained-flow tubular reactor that is installed in the SFC as a heat exchanger. The EvGT-BAT process has the potential to generate electrical power from biomass with an efficiency of 41 %...|$|R
40|$|Plasmid DNA (pDNA) vectors are {{the current}} {{conventional}} technology driving therapeutic gene transfer, whether for use toward mal/nonfunctional gene replacement, DNA vaccination, or production of therapeutic proteins in mammalian cells. However, the conventional pDNA vector suffers from several safety and efficiency limitations: 1) it imparts adverse immune responses to bacterial sequences required for maintenance and amplification in prokaryotes; 2) its bioavailability can be compromised due to size; and 3) {{it may be}} genotoxic due to its potential to integrate into the host chromosome and yield an oncogenic event. In this study we have constructed a robust in vivo bacterial platform {{for the production of}} bacterial sequence-free linear covalently closed (LCC) DNA vectors, termed DNA Ministrings, through the manipulation and application of bacteriophage-encoded recombination systems. Phage N 15 and PY 54 lysogenize their bacterial hosts as a linear plasmid with covalently closed ends (LCC plasmid). LCC morphology is conferred by the phage-encoded telomerase via a single cleaving-joining reaction of the perfect palindrome target site. This system was exploited to generate DNA Ministring vectors, encoding only the gene(s) of interest and necessary complementary eukaryotic expression/enhancement genetic elements that are devoid of unwanted bacterial sequences and are linearized through a single in vivo enzymatic reaction. The tel and telN prokaryotic telomerase (protelomerase) genes were amplified from PY 54 and N 15 lysates, respectively, and cloned into a bacterial vector that expresses the gene under control of the temperature sensitive bacteriophage λ CI 857 repressor that confers conditional expression from λ pL/pR promoters. This regulatory circuit was integrated into a RecA+ lacZ+ E. coli K- 12 strain via homologous recombination, where successful recombinants were disrupted for the lacZ gene. Recombinant cells are capable of conditional expression of the phage-derived telomerase enzymes by shifting the temperature to > 37 °C. Phage P 1 -derived Cre recombinase was applied as a positive control, since its functionality in generating DNA minicircle vectors has been previously shown. A multi-purpose 342 bp target site termed Super Sequence (SS) that possesses the Cre, Flp, Tel, and TelN target sites in addition to two flanking SV 40 enhancer sequences was cloned into two different sites of a GFP expression eukaryotic pDNA vector. The amplification of this DNA vector through telN / tel or cre expressing Recombinant E. coli cells (R-cells) generated bacterial sequence-depleted (LCC) DNA Ministring and (CCC) Minicircle vectors, respectively, as evidenced by digestion patterns of the <b>purified</b> vector. Transfection <b>efficiency</b> of these vectors was assessed in rapidly dividing human ovarian cancer and in relatively slowly dividing human embryonic kidney cell lines. In vitro experiments with DNA Ministrings in human cells lines resulted in significantly higher transfection efficiency, bioavailability, and cytoplasmic diffusion levels compared to the parental plasmid precursor and isogenic DNA Minicircle counterparts. The safety of the LCC DNA vector conformation, with respect to insertional genotoxicity, was assessed by forcing LCC pDNA vectors into bacterial and human genomic DNA. The integration of LCC DNA into bacterial and human host genomic DNA resulted in chromosomal DNA disruptions at site of integration, loss of genome stability, and subsequent cell death. LCC integration-induced apoptotic cell death and natural elimination of the integrant from human cell population improves the safety profile of DNA Ministrings by eliminating integrants following the potential genotoxic side effects of undesired vector integration into the host genome. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|Galvanically {{coupling}} enzymatic bioelectrodes {{with drug}} loaded conducting polymers {{to develop a}} controlled drug delivery system is investigated. The system {{is designed to be}} a novel and sophisticated approach to in vivo drug delivery for the treatment of epilepsy. There is a suite of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that are extremely effective at suppressing seizure activity however; their use is restricted due to debilitating side effects. As such, it is of interest to develop novel drug release methods to deliver the AEDs directly to the target area in the brain and in small doses to minimise, and ideally eliminate, the side effects. The significance of using an enzymatic power source lies in its ability to operate off simple sugars naturally present in the human body. Additionally, the on/off switching behaviour of the conducting polymer, polypyrrole (PPy), can be accessed to release the drug when the oxidation state of the polymer is changed. By exposing the glucose oxidase (GOx) bioelectrode to glucose in solution, the catalytic current generated can be harnessed to charge the polymer and instigate drug release on cue. Experiments were carried out to develop and characterise GOx bioelectrodes based on a direct electron transfer (DET) mechanism facilitated by carbon nanomaterials, namely multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Chapter 3 investigates the development of solvated graphene electrodes (SGE), a hydrogel-like system based on graphene, with immobilised GOx. It is proven through biological protein and kinetic assays that the GOx is stable within the graphene structures and the electrodes can be reproducibly fabricated. Through electrochemical techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, impedance, amperometry and fourier transform alternating current voltammetry, it was revealed, however, that the enzyme is not electrically wired to the solvated graphene matrix, and as such, cannot directly transfer the electrons generated from the oxidation of glucose to the nanostructured electrode. As a result of its inability to access the catalytic current, no useable charge is generated and the structures cannot be used to power drug release from a conducting polymer scaffold. In Chapter 4, aqueous dispersions of rGO and MWNT are fabricated through a modified chemical reduction method. The significant advantage of the method developed is the omission of any stabilizing compound or organic solvent to obtain stable rGO-MWNT dispersions. Significantly biological entities, such as GOx, can be successfully incorporated into the dispersion. These dispersions were characterised using XPS, SEM, zeta potential and particle size measurements which showed that the dispersion stability is not sacrificed with the addition of GOx, and significantly, the electrical properties of the rGO and MWNTs are maintained. In this study, rGO acts as an effective dispersing agent for MWNTs and does not affect the solubility or electroactivity of the GOx. Bioelectrodes fabricated from these rGO-MWNT-GOx dispersions were characterised electrochemically to test their feasibility in facilitating direct electron transfer (DET) from the redox centre of the enzyme to the electrode. The DET results showed that the specific catalytic current generated at an optimized rGO-MWNT-GOx electrode was 72 μA/μg GOx, which is 3 times more efficient than other literature values for similar systems. The remarkable specific catalytic current {{can be attributed to the}} use of <b>purified</b> enzyme, the <b>efficiency</b> of charge transfer within the rGO-MWNT composite and the ability of the electrode to facilitate direct electron transfer. The optimised electrode developed and characterised in Chapter 4 is used in Chapter 5 to power the release of drug from PPy. The release of the anti-inflammatory drug, Dexamethasone- 21 -phosphate (DEX), and the anti-convulsant drug, Fosphenytoin (FOS), from PPy films are characterised in Chapter 5. This work investigates, for the first time, the controlled release of FOS from a conducting polymer and galvanically connects the optimised rGO-MWNT-GOx bioelectrode (presented in Chapter 4) to drive the release, also the first of its kind. When the two half cells are connected and the conditions are changed in the bioelectrode cell from 0 mM to 150 mM glucose, there is an increase in the charging current generated, as a result of the additional catalytic current. A corresponding increase in the rate of FOS released was measured in the release cell from 24 to 47 ng/mL. This result shows that the concept of galvanically coupling enzyme-based bioelectrodes with drug loaded conducting polymers to fabricate a controlled drug delivery device is valid...|$|R
