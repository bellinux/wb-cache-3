40|$|Professional risk {{managers}} {{and the general}} public strongly disagree about the seriousness of many risks. Most members of the public are concerned about long-term effects of risks, inequitable siting, lack of personal control, and the pace of technological diffusion into their cultural envi- ronment, whereas professional risk managers focus on the task to minimize the probability of adverse effects caused by a technology or other human activity. To bridge the gap between the professional mandate and the public perception of risk, a dialogue has to be initiated between risk mana- gers, interest groups and representatives of the affected public. This dialogue should serve the function of reconciling conflicts among various groups. A prerequisite for a successful conflict resolution is the willingness of each group to respect the perspective of all the other partici- <b>pating</b> groups and to include their concerns into the decision-making process. This paper reviews the literature on the three main functions of risk communication: message recognition, inducement of attitude and behavioral changes, and resolution of risk-related conflicts. The paper also discusses the structure of the communication process from a descriptive and a normative point of view, and draws on studies about risk perception and communication to develop some guidelines for successful risk communication...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{epidemiology}} of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, using bacteraemia as a marker, shows {{a striking}} geographical pattern in Europe. The prevalence of MRSA {{is low in}} Northern European countries, increases into central Europe and reaches its highest levels in the Mediterranean region. This {{has been attributed to}} varying levels of implementation of infection control and antibiotic stewardship (ICAS) programmes, but reasons for this variation have not been clearly established. Aim: To investigate the possible impact of national cultural dimensions on the epidemi- ology of MRSA in Europe. Methods: Median proportions of MRSA bacteraemia were sourced for countries partici- <b>pating</b> in the EARS-Net surveillance network in 2010, and correlated with the national cultural dimension scores of Hofstede et al. Findings: Significant associations were identified between MRSA proportions and the cultural constructs of uncertainty avoidance (UAI), masculinity (MAS) and power distance. Multiple regression models found significant associations for UAI, MAS and short-term orientation (R 2 adjusted 1 ⁄ 4 0. 475; P < 0. 001). The model was found to be predictive of MRSA trends identified in several European countries between 2006 and 2010. Conclusion: Implementation of ICAS programmes often requires behavioural change. Cultural dimensions appear to be key factors affecting perceptions and values among healthcare workers, which in turn are critical for compliance and uptake. Customizing ICAS initiatives to reflect the local cultural background may improve their chances of success. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of groundwater monitoring and summarizes current interpretations of conditions influencing groundwater quality and flow in the 100 -K Area. The interpretations build on previous work, and statisticzd evaluations of contaminant concentrations were ptiormed for the period July 1996 through April 1998. No new basin leaks are indicated by data from this period. Tritium from a 1993 leak in the KE Basin has been detected in groundwater and appears to be dissi- <b>pating.</b> Tritium and strontium- 90 from inactive injection wells/drain fields are still evident near the KW and KE Basins. These contaminants have increased as a result of infiltration of surface water or a higher- " than-average water table. Inactive condensate cribs near the KW and KE Basins resulted in very high tritium and carbon- 14 activities in some wells. Recent tritium decreases are attributed to changes in groundwater-flow direction caused by the higher-than-average river stage in 1996 - 1998, which caused the contaminant plumes {{to move away from the}} monitoring wells. Results of the groundwater-monitoring program were used to identi~ and correct factors that may contribute to contaminant increases. For example, some sources of surface-water infiltration have been diverted. Additional work to reduce infiltration through contaminated sediments is planned for fiscal year 1999.

This article introduces the Model of Inclusive Facilitation that leads practitioners through a process of gathering information and learning techniques to facilitate groups that include both people with and without disabilities. The model includes: (a) developing a resource base of written materials and community contacts, (b) addressing personal attitudes as well as learning general language and interaction guidelines, (c) obtaining information specific to a client's disability, (d) designing adaptations to make programs structurally and programmatically accessible, (e) implementing the program, and (f) evaluating the process. The goal of the model is to enable facilitators to be comfortable and com petent in including {{people with disabilities}} in their programs by developing the ability to focus on participants' abilities rather than disabilities. Key words: disabilities, outdoor education, adventure education, accessibility, inclusion People with disabilities are increasingly involved in adventure programs. Recent research indicates that patterns of participation in adventure activities for people with, and without, disabilities are similar (McCormick, n. d.).

40|$|The seismic {{sequence}} {{that occurred in}} the Abruzzo Apennines near L’Aquila (Italy) in April 2009 caused extensive damage and a large number of casual- ties (more than 300). The earthquake struck an area in the Italian Apennines chain where several faults, belonging to adjacent seismotectonic domains, create a complex tectonic regime resulting from the interaction among regional stress buildup, local stress changes caused by individual earthquakes, and viscous-elastic stress relaxation. Understanding such complex interaction in the Apennines can lead to a large step for- ward in the seismic risk mitigation in Italy. The Abruzzo earthquake has been very well recorded by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, much better than the first Italian earthquake ever recorded by satellites, namely, the 1997 Umbria–Marche earthquake. ENVISAT (ENVIronmental SATellite) data for the Abruzzo earthquake are, in fact, very clear and allow an accurate reconstruction of the faulting mechanism. We present here an accurate inversion of vertical deformation data obtained by ENVISAT images, aimed to give a detailed reconstruction of the fault geometry and slip distribu- tion. The resulting fault models are then used to compute, by a suitable theoretical model based on the elastic dislocation theory, the stress changes induced on the neigh- boring faults. The correlation of the subsequent mainshocks and aftershocks of the Abruzzo sequence with the volumes undergoing increasing Coulomb stress clearly evidence the triggering effect of coseismic stress changes on further seismicity. More- over, this analysis put in evidence which seismotectonic domains have been more heav- ily charged by stress released by the Abruzzo mainshocks. The most important faults significantly charged by the Abruzzo sequence belong to the Sulmona and Avezzano tectonic domains. Taking into account the average regional stress buildup in the area, the positive Coulomb stress changes caused by this earthquake can be seen as antici- <b>pating</b> the next earthquakes in the neighboring domains of 15 – 20 yr...|$|E
40|$|In {{near future}} Autonomous driving will affect {{every aspect of}} {{transportation}} and offer a significant boost in mobility for everyone. Autonomous driving techniques and modules must be chosen according to the task the platform is developed for. Slow speed driving on campus or highway driving in poor weather conditions, may require different sets of sensors, vehicle models {{and as a result}} different software architecture. Some of the main modules that an autonomous driving system needs are the vehicle state estimator and vehicle controller. The development of these two modules relies heavily on the robustness of the vehicle model chosen and the task at hand. University of Waterloo decided to join the Autonomous Driving research by partici- <b>pating</b> in the project, which required development and implementation of the autonomous driving demo sequence for Consumer Electronics Show in 2017. Since the demo sequence was to be performed at slow speeds and, because certain vehicle parameters were not available at the time, a kinematic vehicle model was used in implementation of the core autonomous driving modules: state estimation and control. These modules are imple- mented on a full scale autonomous driving platform and were designed based on the needs and requirements of the demo sequence. The implementation results show that the cho- sen vehicle model enables the state estimator to fuse incoming sensor data and allows the controller to track the desired path and velocity profile. For further deployment of the autonomous driving platform for research in urban and highway driving an aggressive driving framework was proposed that is based on dynamic vehicle model and incorporates the tire forces in the generation of the speed profile and keeps the vehicle at the limits of adhesion. The aggressive driving controller can be utilized for emergency evasive maneuvers at low road friction conditions. The controller was tested on a high fidelity simulation software for a double lane change emergency maneuver. The results showed that the aggressive driving framework proposed can be successfully incor- porated into the autonomous driving architecture and can perform position and velocity tracking at maximum possible speed...|$|E
40|$|For {{the police}} to be successfull it is {{necessary}} for the public to have enough confidence in the police so that they are prepared to report crimes and in other ways participate in criminal investigations. In some residential areas, that are perceived as particularly crime ridden and insecure, the police ability to protect the inhabitants can come into question. To remedy the trust deficit the police in the Swedish region of Västra Götaland has established local police forces with a specific mission to create confidence in the police in particularly vulnerable areas. But how is {{the police to}} work in order to gain public trust? By highlighting how trust and distrust between police and residents are expressed in local policing, this study sought to understand how local police officers' working-methods affect public confidence in the police force at large. The empirical material consists of qualitative data from participating observations and interviews. The study have been set apart geographically to the residential areas of Hjällbo, Hammarkullen and Eriksbo in Göteborg. Data collection took place in two waves. The first from March 2011 to June the same year and consists of a total of 55 hours of partici - <b>pating</b> observations of local police work and a focus group interview with the police, and resulted in pilot-study in October 2011. The work continued in the spring of 2012, with observations and interviews with parents and residents which produced another 15 hours of observations, 20 field interviews and four longer interviews. Encoding and analysis was done in a three-dimensional array. In the first dimension the different work moments in local policing was identified and encoded. Together with a second dimension of theory based concepts a third result dimension could be created. Local police officers are building confidence in the police authority in two main ways. Through a direct trust-building police work that is characterised {{by the fact that the}} police are visible, accessible and available for interaction and through an indirect trust-building police work that creates confidence by maintaining law and order in a way that the public expects. Combining the two involves some difficulties. Police suspicion and surveillance of individuals and groups in the later method can easily turn into a control caused distrust which reduces earned trust capital from the first. Cooperation with other authorities, local actors and inhabitants can be a fruitful way to create, maintain and rebuild public trust in the police...|$|E
