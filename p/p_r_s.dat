This spelling system was strongly {{inspired by the}} one used for the Drehu (Lifu) language {{in the very early}} period, though later with the change of non-European Mission personnel from Lifu to Polynesian, as well as the growing number of indigenous Torres Strait missionaries, the spelling system lost the overtly Drehu forms tr, dr and ë, which had no phonological basis in Kalaw Lagaw Ya. The mission system is the orthography used in the Reports of the Cambridge Expedition to the Torres Strait (Haddon et al., 1898 and on, University of Cambridge) and in Myths and Legends of Torres Strait (Lawrie, University of Queensland, 1971). Ray, the linguist of the Cambridge Expedition, also used various diacritics to represent vowel length (short vowels) and quality.|$|E

500|$|In 1822, Champollion {{received}} transcriptions of {{the text}} on the recently discovered Philae obelisk, which enabled him to double check his readings of the names Ptolemy and Cleopatra from the Rosetta stone. The name [...] "Cleopatra" [...] had already been identified on the Philae obelisk by William John Bankes, who scribbled the identification in {{the margin of the}} plate though without any actual reading of the individual glyphs. Young and others would later use the fact that the Cleopatra cartouche had been identified by Bankes to claim that Champollion had plagiarized his work. It remains unknown whether Champollion saw Bankes' margin note identifying the cartouche or whether he identified it by himself. All in all, using this method he managed to determine the phonetic value of 12 signs (A, AI, E, K, L, M, O, <b>P,</b> <b>R,</b> <b>S,</b> and T). By applying these to the decipherment of further sounds he soon read dozens of other names.|$|E

500|$|Readers of English can {{generally}} rely on {{the correspondence}} between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds. The letters b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, <b>p,</b> <b>r,</b> <b>s,</b> t, v, w, y, z represent, respectively, the phonemes [...] The letters c and g normally represent [...] and , {{but there is also}} a soft c pronounced , and a soft g pronounced [...] The differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for , sh for , th for [...] or , ng for , qu for , and ph for [...] in Greek-derived words. The single letter x is generally pronounced as [...] in word-initial position and as [...] otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.|$|E
