40|$|Abstract:The {{efficient}} management of product-related data {{is a big}} challenge for many manufacturing companies, especially the larger ones like DaimlerChrysler. So-called Product Data Management (<b>PDM)</b> <b>systems</b> are used to tackle this task. But especially in worldwide distributed product development environments, where low bandwidth networks are used, response times of <b>PDM</b> <b>systems</b> often raise to several minutes even for simple user actions. The main {{reason for this is}} the amount of wide area network communication caused by poor implementations of <b>PDM</b> <b>systems</b> which a) often use the underlying database management system like a stupid record manager, and b) do hardly know anything about the distribution of the data. In this paper we introduce an extension of directed acyclic graphs which enables us to adequately represent product structures. On the basis of this representation we show how some additional infor-mation describing the data distribution can be used to assemble distributed product structures very efficiently. ...|$|R

Her symptoms could be a function of seasonal allergies, a bacterial sinus infection, the common cold, or she may have just come from her grandmother's funeral.

A <b>PDM</b> <b>system</b> qualifies as a platform for integrating construction processes which are essentially multidisciplinary in nature.

Changes in CMS component design need to be tracked and quickly reflected in the production process. In industry, engineers employ Product Data Management (<b>PDM)</b> <b>systems</b> to control access to documented versions of designs.
