40|$|INTRODUCTION: The startle reflex {{is a well}} {{established}} paradigm in psychophysiology. Reflex modulation by affective stimuli and {{the reaction of the}} heart rate are well known. Salt sensitivity is considered a risk factor for the development of primary hypertension later in life. One possible explanation for this heightened risk is an enhanced affective reactivity that also modulates cardiovascular reactions (presumably mediated by an over-reactive amygdala). Enhanced cardiovascular reactions to mental stress and enhanced affective modulation of the startle reflex have both been demonstrated in salt sensitive subjects. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the cardiovascular reaction to startle stimuli and its modulation by affective stimuli in salt resistant and salt sensitive normotensives. METHODS: 80 subjects were categorized as salt resistant and salt sensitive. To modulate the startle reflex, pictures from the categories pleasant, unpleasant and neutral from the international affective pictures system were used. Heart rate, blood pressure and skin conductance were recorded continuously. RESULTS: A heart rate and blood pressure rise followed the startle stimulus. The reaction of the heart rate was modulated by the valence of the pictures, but the blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reaction</b> was enhanced in pleasant and unpleasant context. Salt sensitive subjects had an enhanced modulation of the eye blink and heart rate reaction, but a smaller and less modulated blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reaction.</b> DISCUSSION: Salt sensitive subjects demonstrated an enhanced affective modulation of the heart rate reaction to startle stimuli. This finding supports the view of an over-reactive amygdala. The modulation of the blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reaction</b> to startle stimuli appears to be an indicator for the arousal that is elicited by the pictures. The smaller blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reaction</b> of salt sensitive subjects could be explained by stimulus characteristics or by a less flexibile blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reaction.</b> An enhanced affective modulation of cardiovascular reactions, as well as a less flexible blood pressure regulation can contribute the development of primary hypertension later in life...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} and catalytic properties of silica supported platinum or rhodium model catalysts are studied under both ultra high vacuum (UHV) and elevated <b>pressure</b> <b>reaction</b> conditions (> 1 torr). Platinum or rhodium nanoparticles are vapor deposited onto a SiO 2 /Mo(112) surface and characterized using various surface analytical methods. CO chemisorption is utilized as a surface probe {{to estimate the}} concentration of various sites on the nanoparticles through thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) along with microscopy techniques to estimate particle size. The results are compared with hard sphere models of face centered cubic metals described as truncated cubo-octahedron. Results demonstrate the excellent agreement between chemisorption and hard sphere models in estimating the concentration of undercoordinated atoms on the nanoparticle surface. Surfaces are then subjected to high <b>pressure</b> <b>reaction</b> conditions to test the efficacy of utilizing the rate of a chemical reaction to obtain structural information about the surface. The surfaces are translated in-situ to a high <b>pressure</b> <b>reaction</b> cell where both structure insensitive and sensitive reactions are performed. Structure insensitive reactions (e. g. CO oxidation) allow a method to calculate the total active area on a per atom basis for silica supported platinum and rhodium model catalysts under reaction conditions. While structure sensitive reactions allow {{an estimate of the}} types of reaction sites, such as step sites (?C 7) under reaction conditions (e. g. n-heptane dehydrocyclization). High pressure structure sensitive reactions (e. g. ethylene hydroformylation) are also shown to drastically alter the morphology of the surface by dispersing nanoparticles leading to inhibition of catalytic pathways. Moreover, the relationships between high index single crystals, oxide supported nanoparticles, and high surface area technical catalysts are established. Overall, the results demonstrate the utility of model catalysts in understanding the structure-activity relationships in heterogeneous catalytic reactions and the usefulness of high pressure reactions as an analytical probe of surface morphology...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reactions</b> to mental stress {{predicted}} future blood pressure and hypertension. Methods: Blood pressure was recorded at an initial medical screening examina-tion after which blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reactions</b> to a mental stress task were determined. A follow-up screening assessment of blood pressure and antihypertensive medication status was undertaken 10 years later. Data were available for 796 male public servants, between 35 and 55 years of age upon entry to the study. Results: Systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reactions</b> to mental stress were positively correlated with follow-up screening systolic blood pressure and to a lesser extent, follow-up diastolic pressure. In multivariate tests, by far the strongest predictors of follow-up blood pressures were initial screening blood pressures. In the case of follow-up systolic blood <b>pressure,</b> systolic <b>reactions</b> to stress emerged as an additional predictor of follow-up systolic blood pressure. With regard to follow-up diastolic blood pressure, reactivity did not enter the analogous equations. The same outcomes emerged when the analyses were adjusted for medication status. When hypertension at 10 -year follow-up was the focus, both systolic and diastolic reactions to stress were predictive. However, with correction for age and initial screening blood pressure, these associations were no longer statistically significant. Conclusions: The results of this study provide modest support for the hypothesis that heightened blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reactions</b> to mental stress contribute to the development of high blood pressure. At the same time, they question the clinical utility of stress testing as a prognostic device.

The goal of these studies was to ascertain a fundamental understanding of CO oxidation and acetylene cyclotrimerization reactions on Ptgroup metals. A further goal was to determine the optimal conditions for each reaction. CO oxidation on Rh(111),Pt(100), and Pd(100) was scrutinized on various oxide surfaces from chemisorbed to bulk metal oxides. Low <b>pressure</b> <b>reactions</b> on Rh(111) reveal the highest activity was a CO uninhibited surface with < 1 ML of chemisorbed oxygen. Pt(100) high pressure oxidation revealed that only < 1 ML oxygen is formed during high <b>pressures</b> <b>reactions.</b> High <b>pressure</b> CO oxidation <b>reactions</b> on Pd(100) show oxygen penetration after CO has been consumed; however, during the highest activity XPS found only chemisorbed species.

40|$|Background: Achalasia is {{considered}} to be a primary motor disorder of the oesophagus. However, there is increasing evidence to suggest extra- oesophageal involvement in this disease. Vagal disturbances at different levels and extra- oesophageal dysmotility have been reported in several studies. The aim of this study was to examine cardiovascular reflexes in patients with achalasia further to evaluate the involvement of the autonomic nervous system outside the oesophagus in this entity. Methods: Five patients (age range 38 - 58 years, median 45 years) diagnosed with achalasia were assessed for the autonomic nerve function by the heart rate reaction to deep breathing (E/ I ratio) and to tilt (acceleration and brake index). The blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reaction</b> to tilt was also assessed. The results were compared with a control group comprising 56 healthy individuals (age range 16 - 59 years, median 40 years). Results: Patients with achalasia had a significantly decreased E/ I ratio compared with controls (absolute values 1. 13 (0. 23) (median value (interquartile range)) versus 1. 38 (0. 14) : P = 0. 0309, age corrected values - 1. 39 (1. 49) versus - 0. 25 (1. 20) : P = 0. 0457).

Nephropathy was evaluated by the degree of albuminuria (albuminuria > 20 µg/min or > 0. 03 g/ 24 h) and glomerular filtration rate (51 Cr-EDTA plasma clearance). The acceleration index had deteriorated after 7 years (P = 0. 0155), whereas the E/I ratio (P = 0. 0070) and the diastolic postural blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reaction</b> (P = 0. 0054) had deteriorated 14 years after the baseline examination (age-corrected values). All those with albuminuria at the third examination showed signs of autonomic neuropathy at baseline (10 of 10) compared with only nine of 22 without (P = 0. 0016). Multiple regression analysis showed that the association between autonomic dysfunction and future albuminuria {{was due to the}} E/I ratio.
