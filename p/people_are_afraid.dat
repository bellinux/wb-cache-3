500|$|According to Wong, {{the idea}} of using a roller-coaster {{derailment}} as the opening-scene disaster came from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant and was not inspired by a Big Thunder Mountain Railroad incident. The idea of death omens in photographs was taken from The Omen (1976). Morgan revealed he searched the aisles of a local store at Sunset Boulevard for days to get inspiration regarding Erin's death at the hardware store. According to Morgan, the loss of control was a major theme that he and Wong had envisioned from the very beginning for the film; this is exemplified by both Wendy, who is afraid of losing control, as well as the roller coaster. He stated {{that one of the reasons}} <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of roller coasters is because, according to psychologists, [...] " [...] have no control" [...] while on them.|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{responded to}} the PTC's {{criticism}} on Twitter, and said that parents should not expect her to parent their children and that [...] "touchy subject matters" [...] should not be hidden from children otherwise they will not learn how to adapt in society, and that it empowers abusers even more because children are embarrassed to talk about rape. The singer continued to state that [...] "the industry isn't 'Parent's 'R Us and that singers [...] "have the freedom to create art". In an interview for BET, Rihanna further explain why rape {{was used as the}} vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying [...] "Making that into a mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened. Obviously she's not a cold-blooded killer. It had to be something so offensive.

500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want".

2500|$|Also in Sister Outsider is [...] "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action.*" [...] Lorde {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} speaking, even when afraid because one's silence will not protect them from being marginalized and oppressed. [...] Many people fear {{to speak the truth}} because of how it may cause pain, however, one ought to put fear into perspective when deliberating whether to speak or not. [...] Lorde emphasizes that [...] "the transformation of silence into language and action is a self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger." [...] <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of others' reactions for speaking, but mostly for demanding visibility, which is essential to live. [...] Lorde adds, [...] "We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and ourselves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid." [...] People are taught to respect their fear of speaking more than silence, but ultimately, the silence will choke us anyway, so we might as well speak the truth.|$|E

2500|$|A Ma'an News {{story from}} March 2010 about the Dayton mission {{references}} {{a number of}} complaints raised by Palestinians regarding the PASF training program. Some detractors see the troops as merely the means for the consolidation of Fatah party dominance and power over all other political groups. According to Ma'an, [...] "There is also concern that the training provided by the USSC is leading to a situation where Palestinian security forces effectively take over the occupation from Israel forces, as opposed to operating as a truly independent national force accountable to the majority." [...] These concerns are echoed in an extensive online [...] by Electronic Intifada in September 2010 that references dozens of contested incidents in which members of minority factions such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine(PFLP) and Hamas are reported to have experienced harassment, arrest, and torture {{at the hands of}} PASF.

Ciaran captured Morgan and intended to kill her and steal her powers. One of his coven members found a watch on Morgan that he had given to Maeve as a present. As soon as Morgan had told him that she was Maeve's daughter it was unbearable for him to think that Maeve and Angus had borne a child. He performs tath meanma on Morgan and discovers that she is in fact his daughter. During the tath meanma, he witnessed Morgan's birth and her mother saying [...] "You have your father's eyes."

The other coven members continued with the ritual. Hunter comes in again saved her with the help of Ciaran. The next time Morgan saw Ciaran was in Widows Vale they both shape-shifted into wolves. She had put a watch sigil on him to track him. After a while he contacted Morgan through a vision and said he would go to Widows Vale to meet her once again.
