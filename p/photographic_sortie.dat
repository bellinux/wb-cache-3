2500|$|A lull {{occurred}} in early August, as the 17th Division took {{over from the}} 5th Division; the 52nd Brigade was ordered to attack Orchard Trench, which ran from Wood Lane to North Street and the Flers Road into Delville Wood. A slow bombardment by heavy artillery and then a five-minute hurricane bombardment {{was followed by the}} attack at [...] on 4 August. Both battalions were stopped by German artillery and machine-gun fire; communications were cut and news of the costly failure was not reported until [...] The 17th Division took over from the 2nd Division on the right and attacked again on 7 August, after a methodical bombardment, assisted by a special reconnaissance and <b>photographic</b> <b>sortie</b> by the RFC. The 51st Brigade attacked at [...] to establish posts beyond the wood but the British were stopped by German artillery-fire while still inside. After midnight, a fresh battalion managed to establish posts north of Longueval. German defensive positions in the area appeared much improved and the 17th Division was restricted to obtaining vantage points, before it was relieved by the 14th Division on 12 August.|$|E

50|$|During July 1940, Visintini {{shot down}} several {{aircraft}} {{but the number}} and the dates are unknown. On 29 July, he was decorated with the Medaglia d'Argento al valor militare (Silver Medal for military valour). He claimed another Wellesley, possibly on 26 August (K7731). On 1 September 1940, Visintini shared the kill of another Vickers monoplane with two other pilots. The downed aircraft was a Wellesley (L2669) from No. 14 Squadron, flown by Sergeant Norris on a <b>photographic</b> reconnaissance <b>sortie</b> over Harmil Island, when it was intercepted and attacked by Fiat fighters, scrambled from Massawa. The Wellesley crash-landed on the island, the crew being taken prisoner. According to other sources that was a solo kill, qualifying him as an ace.|$|R
40|$|Subject of investigation: {{networks}} of the photogrammetric extension of control. Purpose of the work: {{development of a}} technology for constructing photogrammetric networks which permits maximum usage of materials of old field preparation of pictures and of materials of the photogrammetric extension of control accomplished when making maps in order to completely exclude repeated field preparation of pictures. Theoretical results: development of a method of use of the points of the initial field preparation of pictures and points of the initial photogrammetric extension of control, which cannot be identified on the pictures of a new <b>photographic</b> <b>sortie,</b> as reference data for constructing {{networks of}} the photogrammetric extension of control. Developed are the technology and the program for constructing networks of the photogrammetric extension of control {{on the basis of}} points of the initial field preparation of pictures and initial photogrammetric extension of control. The developed technologies and programs of constructing networks of the photogrammetric extension of control are put into practice. The introduction of the technology and program considerably reduces or completely exclude repeated field preparation during updating of topographic mapsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
