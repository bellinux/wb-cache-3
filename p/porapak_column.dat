40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A gas chromatographic {{procedure}} {{was developed for}} the determination of nanogram quantities of hydrocyanic acid using a flame ionization detector. Excellent chromatograms were obtained on a porous polyaromatic polymer <b>column</b> (<b>Porapak</b> Q) at 60 °C. The {{procedure was}} employed {{for the analysis of}} HCN in aqueous cyanide solutions. Solutions as low as 1 μg /liter (ppb) HCN were analysed in five minutes after a 30 minute concentration period in which air is swept through the solution and HCN collected in a cold trap for gas chromatographic analysis. When interferences are encountered on the <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>column</b> preliminary separation is achieved on a 1, 2, 3 -tris(2 -cyanoethoxy) -propane (TCEP) on Chromosorb W column. The HCN is trapped from the TCEP column effluent and reinjected on a <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>column</b> for analyses. The amount of chloroform in chlorinated water was also determined by this procedure, Deactivated diatomaceous earth supports and the fluorocarbon supports were evaluated for the determination of trace quantities of HCN. These supports were either inefficient or adsorption on the solid support caused severe tailing. Several stationary phases were investigated. Best results were obtained with Carbowax 1540 or 1, 2, 3 -tris(2 -cyanoethoxy) -propane when Chromosorb W was used as a solid support...|$|R

The reaction mixture was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) using a 2. 5 % FFAP on Chrom G <b>column</b> and a <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>column.</b> In order to collect the products, {{the volume of the}} photolysis solution was reduced in vacuo and the resulting mixture was separated by preparative GLC...|$|R
30|$|Hydrogen {{contained}} in the gas sample was analyzed using gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (GC- 323 /TCD, GL Sciences, Inc.) and a stainless steel <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>column</b> (80 / 100 mesh, GL Sciences, Inc., 2  m, 3.2  mm O.D., 2.1  mm I.D.). Nitrogen {{was used as the}} carrier gas. The column, detector, and injection temperatures were 60, 100, and 120  °C, respectively. Standard hydrogen gas (purity 99.9 %, GL Sciences, Inc.) was used for quantification.|$|R
40|$|Nitrous oxidein the {{atmosphere}} was measured directly by GC-MS equipped with 5 mb gas sampler. Nitrous oxide was separated in the <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>column</b> and detected by MS Ion current of m/e 30, and ionization voltage of 90 eV were set to avoid a large disturbance of CO 2. The relative standard deviation of measured values of nitrous oxide was 5. 5 ％, and analysis time was 5 min per a sample. This method obtained much greater sensitivity and better selectivity than with thermal conductivity detector...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to evaluate the suitability of the ultrasonic flexural plate wave (FPW) device as the detector in a gas chromatograph (GC). Of particular interest is the detection of nitrous oxide (N 2 O). From experimental results we conclude analyte detection is achieved through two mechanisms: changes in gas density, and mass loading of the device membrane due to the sorption of gas molecules. Reducing the dead volume of the FPW chamber increased the FPW response. A comparison of the FPW response {{to that of the}} surface acoustic wave (SAW) detector provided with the GC (made by MSI, Microsensor Technologies, Inc.), shows that for unseparated N 2 O in N 2, the FPW exhibits a sensitivity that is at least 550 times greater than that of the SAW device. A <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>column</b> was found to separate N 2 O from its carrier gas, N 2 or He. With the <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>column,</b> a coated FPW detected 1 ppm N 2 O in N 2 or He, with a response magnitude of 7 Hz. A coated SAW exhibited a response of 25 Hz to pure N 2 O. The minimal detectable N 2 O concentrations of the sensors were not evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} mold level (Botrytis cinerea), {{processing}} method (fresh, {{individually quick frozen}} (IQF), frozen sugared sliced (FSS), freeze dried (FD), canned, and preserves), and maturity (underripe, normal, and overripe) and strawberry volatiles were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography (GLC) using on-column entrainment of head-space volatiles in aqueous extracts. Computerized analyses were used to calculate peak areas and to perform analyses of variance comparing the area of each peak for different samples. Peaks vary-ing significantly (P < 0. 05) with processing method, maturity, and mold count were collected on <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>columns,</b> transferred to GLC columns, and identified by coupled GLC-mass spectrometry and by GLC retention times. All volatiles whose peak areas changed significantly with mold level (P < 0. 05) decreased as mold level increased. These volatiles were as follows: n-propionic acid, n-butyric acid, acetaldehyde...|$|R
30|$|Catalyst {{evaluation}} {{was carried}} out in a fixed-bed stainless steel reactor at atmospheric pressure. In each run, about 1  g of catalyst (18 / 25 mesh size) diluted with equal amount of quartz beads, was suspended between two quartz wool plugs at the centre of the reactor. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was pretreated in He flow (30  ml/min) at 500  °C for 1  h. C 2 H 6, CO 2 (or O 2) and He were fed into the reactor at a volumetric ratio of 15 / 15 / 30 using mass flow controllers (Alborg, USA). The effluent gas stream was analyzed by an on-line Nucon 5765 GC equipped with TCD using Molecular Sieve 5 A and <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>columns.</b> Blank runs (in the absence of catalyst) with quartz wool revealed no conversion of C 2 H 6 in the studied temperature range 550 – 650  °C.|$|R
40|$|Measurement of the {{permanent}} gases in the atmospheres of mission targets is a major objective. A 16 meter long <b>Porapak</b> N <b>column</b> was used on the Venus probe and required a rather high carrier gas flow rate. The researchers have, therefore, surveyed commercial porous polymer types which had some ability to resolve nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon monoxide gases. Porapaks N and Q appeared superior to most. Batch to batch variation, however, was quite wide, so the researchers learned how to synthesize porous polymer and investigated some of the factors affecting the separations. A polymer was synthesized which was superior to all commercial products and allowed at least a 50 % reduction in length and flow rate of carrier gas. Similar studies were made concerning the separation of hydrocarbons and new porous polymers have been synthesized which represent significant improvements in time of analysis, column, and carrier gas flow rate...|$|R

Wet periphyton (5 g) was placed into 42 ml, screw-capped culture tubes (KimaxTM, Kimble Chase Life Sciences and Research Products LLC, Vineland, New Jersey, USA) with an open-top cap containing a teflon-lined, silicone septa (0.125 cm thick). Acetylene gas (generated by adding water to CaC 2 in an evacuated serum bottle) {{was added to}} each tube (4 ml; ∼ 10 % headspace) and the tubes were gently shaken to evenly distribute the gas in the sample. Tubes containing samples and blanks containing only injected C 2 H 2 were incubated at a constant temperature (27 °C) {{for up to three}} hours under either light (∼ 900 µmol m− 2 s− 1 photosynthetically active radiation [PAR]) or dark conditions. After incubation, tubes were vigorously shaken to equilibrate gas phases, and gas samples (4 ml) were taken from each tube and stored in evacuated 3.5 ml Exetainers™ (Labco International, Houston, Texas, USA.) Gas samples were analyzed for ethylene using a GC- 8 A (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (110 °C) and a <b>Porapak</b> N <b>column</b> (80 °C). Two standard gases (1 ppm and 10 ppm) were used to calibrate the measurement. Nitrogenase was then expressed as nmol C 2 H 4 g− 1 dw h− 1.|$|R

Triplicate, 5 g wet soil samples were sealed with rubber septa {{stoppers}} in 30 ml tubes; 3 ml distilled deionized (DDI) water {{were added to}} the tube and purged with N 2 to maintain anaerobic conditions. Two milliliters of acetylene gas (C 2 H 2; approximately 10 % headspace) was injected into the tubes to block the conversion from N 2 O to N 2, and the tubes were then shaken for 1 h to disperse the gas. After shaking, a DEA solution (0.202 g KNO 3 L− 1, 0.25 g chloramphenicol L− 1, and 0.360 g C 6 H 12 O 6 L− 1) purged with oxygen-free N 2 gas was added to the tubes. Samples were shaken and incubated at room temperature. Headspace gas was collected at 1 h intervals for about 5 h. The potential denitrification rate was calculated from the steepest portion of curve produced when cumulative N 2 O evolution was plotted against time. The sampled gas was injected in a Shimadzu GC- 14 -A ECD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD) and <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>column</b> (Waters Associates, Inc., Milton, Massachusetts, USA). The operation temperatures for the column, injection port, and detector were set at 70 °C, 120 °C, and 230 °C, respectively. A 10 ppm standard concentration gas (Scott Specialty Gases, Inc., Plumsteadville, Pennsylvania, USA) was used to calibrate the measurement, and results were reported as N 2 O-N produced per gram of dry weight soil, per hour.|$|R
30|$|The {{reactant}} pulses {{were introduced}} into the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed using a fixed volume sample loop. Using this system, the catalysts (typically 0.50  g) were reduced in situ in a flow of hydrogen (40  cm 3  min− 1) by heating to 673  K {{at a rate of}} 10  K min− 1. The catalyst was held at this temperature for 2  h. The catalyst was then purged with argon (40  cm 3  min− 1) for 30  min and the catalyst was cooled in flowing argon to 293  K. The adsorbate gases were admitted by injecting pulses of known size (typically 24  μmol) into the argon carrier-gas stream, and hence onto the catalyst. The residence time of the pulse in the catalyst bed was ~ 1.5  s. In all cases, the whole pulse was analysed by on-line GC. For co-adsorption studies, the gases were mixed in the gas manifold prior to injection into the carrier gas. The amount of gas adsorbed, from any pulse, was determined from the difference between the peak area of a calibration pulse sent directly to the GC from the sample volume, and the peak area obtained following the injection of pulses of comparable size onto the catalyst. The detection limit for adsorption was 0.3  μmol g− 1. Adsorption measurements were typically repeated three times and the values reported are the average. Standard deviation on the amount adsorbed was typically less than ± 8 %. Adsorptions were followed using a gas chromatograph fitted with a thermal conductivity detector and Molecular Sieve 5 A and <b>Porapak</b> Q <b>columns.</b>|$|R
30|$|The bio-stimulation {{effects were}} {{measured}} during experiments. The produced gases which mainly reflected the re-pressurization {{of an oil}} reservoir were collected in a Devex gas collecting bag (0.3  L), and the gas volume was recorded by a graduated syringe. The gas composition was analyzed on a HP 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent, Wilmington, DE, USA) equipped with a TCD detector (80  °C) and a <b>Porapak</b> Q packing <b>column</b> (60  °C). Helium was used as carrier gas. The pH values which indicated the production of acids were measured on a PHSJ- 4 meter (Leici, Shanghai, China). Two mL of broth was extracted by a graduated syringe and injected to a 5 -mL centrifuge tube for pH measurement. Bacterial numbers were counted by a cell counting method (Zhou and Wang 2004). Surface tension and emulsification degree both characterized the production of emulsifiers such as biosurfactants, biopolymer, acids and solvents. Surface tension was measured with a JK 99 B tensiometer (Powereach, Shanghai, China), and emulsification degree was obtained with the emulsification index (%, EI 24) method (Reddy et al. 2010).|$|R
30|$|Each of the de-topped plant roots with {{attached}} nodules {{was kept}} in an incubation bottle fitted with lid containing a self-sealing septum at the centre. Ten mL of air was taken out from the bottle and an equal volume of acetylene was injected. Bottles along with roots were incubated for 1  h at 27  °C and then 1  mL of gas sample was taken out {{with the help of}} a Hamilton syringe and immediately fed into GC (Nucon 5675) fitted with flame ionization detector (FID) and 2  m-length <b>Porapak</b> stainless steel <b>column</b> (id 2  mm). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas. The temperature of the column was kept at 70  °C and that of the injection port maintained at 110  °C. The retention time of ethylene was 1.2  min. The amount of ethylene produced by roots was derived after injecting a range of standard ethylene (110 – 1000  µg mL− 1) supplied by Spancan Products Limited, England. After estimation of nitrogenase, the roots were washed, and the nodules were detached and weighed.|$|R
30|$|At {{the end of}} the {{nutrient}} incubation period, the acetylene inhibition technique was used to assess bacterial denitrification (Chan and Knowles 1979; Smith et al. 2006). Each replicate received 50  ml of ultrapure water and amended with 5  ml of a 0.1  M chloramphenicol solution. The headspace of each media bottle was than purged with N 2 gas for 5  min to create anaerobic conditions. Acetylene (C 2 H 2) gas, 15  ml, was injected into the headspace and shaken to incorporate into the soil. The addition of C 2 H 2 blocks the conversion of NO 3 –N to N 2 gas, therefore the end product for this assay is N 2 O. A 10  ml headspace gas samples was taken 15  min after the initial C 2 H 2 injection, and once an hour for the following 4  h. Denitrification rates were calculated from the production of N 2 O h− 1  g− 1 of dried soil. Headspace gas samples collected throughout the assay were measured using a Shimadzu GC- 2014 gas chromatograph with a <b>Porapak</b> Q packed <b>column,</b> detector temperature 300  °C, oven temperature 100  °C, and ultrapure nitrogen gas carrier was 10  ml min− 1. Dry soil weight was obtained by drying the soil sample at 100  °C for 48  h after the incubation.|$|R
