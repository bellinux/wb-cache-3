40|$|Due {{to genetic}} defects in apical {{membrane}} chloride channels, the cystic fibrosis (CF) intestine does not secrete chloride normally. Depressed chloride secretion leaves CF intestinal absorptive processes unopposed, {{which results in}} net fluid hyperabsorption, dehydration of intestinal contents, and a propensity to inspissated intestinal obstruction. This theory is based primarily on in vitro studies of jejunal mucosa. To determine if CF patients actually hyperabsorb fluid in vivo, we measured electrolyte and water absorption during steady-state perfusion of the jejunum. As expected, chloride secretion was abnormally low in CF, but surprisingly, there was no net hyperabsorption of sodium or water during perfusion of a balanced electrolyte solution. This suggested that fluid absorption processes are reduced in CF jejunum, and further studies revealed that {{this was due to}} a marked depression of <b>passive</b> chloride <b>absorption.</b> Although Na+-glucose cotransport was normal in the CF jejunum, absence of <b>passive</b> chloride <b>absorption</b> completely blocked glucose-stimulated net sodium absorption and reduced glucose-stimulated water absorption 66 %. This chloride absorptive abnormality acts in physiological opposition to the classic chloride secretory defect in the CF intestine.

50|$|Of equal {{importance}} to the storage and movement of water in soil is {{the means by which}} plants acquire it and their nutrients. Ninety percent of water is taken up by plants as <b>passive</b> <b>absorption</b> caused by the pulling force of water evaporating (transpiring) from the long column of water that leads from the plant's roots to its leaves. In addition, the high concentration of salts within plant roots creates an osmotic pressure gradient that pushes soil water into the roots. Osmotic absorption becomes more important during times of low water transpiration caused by lower temperatures (for example at night) or high humidity. It is the process that causes guttation.|$|E
5000|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is carried out}} without utilisation of metabolic energy. Here, only the roots act as an organ of absorption or passage. Hence, sometimes it is called water absorption 'through roots', rather 'by' roots. It occurs in rapidly transpiring plants during daytime, because of opening of stomata and the atmospheric conditions. The force for absorption of water is created at the leaf end i.e. the transpiration pull. The main cause behind this transpiration pull, water is lifted up in the plant axis like {{a bucket of water}} is lifted by a person from a well. Transpiration pull is responsible for dragging water at the leaf end, the pull or force is transmitted down to the root through water column in the xylem elements. The continuity of water column remains intact due to the cohesion between the molecules and it act as a rope. Roots simply act as a passive organ of absorption. As transpiration proceeds, simultaneously water absorption also takes place to compensate the water loss from leaf end. Most volume of water entering plants is by means of <b>passive</b> <b>absorption.</b> Passive transport is nothing different from diffusion but just explaining its meaning [...] "passive" [...] refers to requiring no input of energy. There is a free movement of molecules from their higher concentration to their lower concentration. The water will enter the plant via the root cells that {{can be found in the}} roots where mainly <b>passive</b> <b>absorption</b> occurs.

40|$|A {{literature}} survey which concerns {{a variety of}} wave generation and absorption methods was accomplished. The survey deals with {{the methods used for}} the experiment wave tank and numerical wave tank. Their implementations are also described very briefly. The numerical wave tank (NWT) was set up using the hybrid particle-mesh method with the emphasis on the wave generation of solitary wave and linear progressive wave, and <b>passive</b> <b>absorption</b> at {{the far side of the}} wave tank. The Discontinuous Galerkin method was applied to solve the Navier-Stokes equations on the background mesh while the particles are used for solving the non-linear advection term. The waves are generated by using a piston-type wavemaker with the use of first-order linear wavemaker theory. For the absorption of reflected waves at the termination end, the sponge layer approach was implemented making use of viscous damping or internal friction among water particles. The hyperbolic tangent function is found to be applicable for smoothly increasing viscosity in the damping zone, which is also be able to prevent the formation of rigid body at the transition point. The drawbacks of the <b>passive</b> <b>absorption</b> technique are not only the extra cost of computational power and domain size, but also the rising slope of average water surface elevation induced by the accumulation of water particles near the end of the wave tank. The solitary waves of small amplitude could be simulated with reliable accuracy and also did the linear progressive waves in the intermediate water. The short waves and the long waves need to paid more attention for the wave generation boundary condition. Regarding the <b>passive</b> <b>absorption</b> for both of solitary waves and progressive waves, the same hyperbolic tangent function was used for viscosity functions which increases spatially. The solitary wave can be damped out using this function while the latter one cannot be damped, leading to the instability of the computation induced by the loss of the particles in the mesh system.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intravenous}} {{vasoactive intestinal polypeptide}} (VIP) on normal transport mechanisms in the human jejunum in vivo was examined with the triple-lumen, steady-state perfusion technique. By using special test solutions that revealed different aspects of jejunal transport, {{we were able to}} evaluate the effect of VIP on specific transport processes, such as active bicarbonate absorption, active chloride secretion, and <b>passive</b> <b>absorption</b> or secretion of sodium chloride. At an infusion rate of 200 pmol/kg per h, VIP inhibited active bicarbonate absorption by approximately 42 %, stimulated active chloride secretion to a slight extent, and slightly reduced passive sodium chloride absorption. A larger dose of VIP, 400 pmol/kg per h, had essentially the same effect on active bicarbonate absorption and active chloride secretion, but it markedly depressed passive sodium chloride absorption and also inhibited passive secretion induced by mannitol. VIP reduced the lumen-to-plasma unidirectional sodium and chloride flux rates, while the plasma-to-lumen flux rates were decreased to a lesser extent or remained unchanged. The potential difference became more lumen-negative with VIP, but the sodium diffusion and glucose-stimulated potential were not affected. We conclude that the major effect of VIP in the human jejunum is to decrease the normal absorption of water and electrolytes [...] not only active bicarbonate-mediated absorption, but also the <b>passive</b> <b>absorption</b> in response to osmotic forces generated by active or facilitated absorptive processes.

40|$|Under {{commercial}} conditions, weaning of piglets {{is associated}} with social, environmental and dietary stress. Consequently, small-intestinal barrier and absorptive functions deteriorate {{within a short time}} after weaning. Most studies that have assessed small-intestinal permeability in pigs after weaning used either Ussing chambers or orally administered marker probes. Paracellular barrier function and active absorption decrease when pigs are weaned at 3 weeks of age or earlier. However, when weaned at 4 weeks of age or later, the barrier function is less affected, and active absorption is not affected or is increased. Weaning stress is a critical factor in relation to the compromised paracellular barrier function after weaning. Adequate feed intake levels after weaning prevent the loss of the intestinal barrier function. Transcellular transport of macromolecules and <b>passive</b> transcellular <b>absorption</b> decrease after weaning. This may reflect a natural intestinal maturation process that is enhanced by the weaning process and prevents the pig from an antigen overload. It seems that <b>passive</b> and active <b>absorption</b> after weaning adapt accurately to the new environment when pigs are weaned after 3 weeks of age. However, when weaned at 3 weeks of age or earlier, the decrease in active absorption indicates that pigs are unable to sufficiently adapt to the new environment.
