A small number exhibit some form of parental care, where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store <b>provisions</b> <b>in</b> it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps.|$|E

40|$|Next Generation Networks (NGNs), as {{envisioned by}} ITU-T, are packet-based networks, capable of {{provisioning}} consistent and ubiquitous services to end-users, {{independently of the}} network, the access technology and the devices used. RESTful Web services are now being contemplated as a technology for service <b>provisioning</b> <b>in</b> NGNs. They are emerging as an alternative, which may be more adequate than SOAPbased Web services in some cases. SOAP-based Web services are modular applications that can be discovered and invoked over a network. RESTful Web services, on the other hand, are defined as a network architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. This paper presents a survey on RESTful Web services for service <b>provisioning</b> <b>in</b> NGNs. It introduces the concept of RESTful Web services and reviews the state-of-the-art of RESTful-based-service <b>provisioning</b> <b>in</b> NGNs. It also provides {{an evaluation of the}} overall suitability of RESTful Web services for service <b>provisioning</b> <b>in</b> NGNs, and discusses research directions. RESTful Web services do show significant potential for service <b>provisioning</b> <b>in</b> NGNs. However, open issues such as publication/discovery and mechanisms for the development of complex session-based services need to be solved before its full potential can be realized...|$|R
