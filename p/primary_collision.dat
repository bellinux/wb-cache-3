40|$|A {{wireless}} ad hoc {{network is}} a collection of radio nodes (transceivers) located in a geographic region. Each node is equipped with an omnidirectional antenna and has limited transmission power. A communication session is established either through a single-hop radio transmission if the communication parties are close enough, or through relaying by intermediate nodes otherwise. A channel assignment to the nodes in a wireless as hoc network should avoid two collisions. The <b>primary</b> <b>collision</b> occurs when a node simultaneously transmits and receives signals over the same channel. The secondary collision occurs when a node simultaneously receives more than one signals over the same channel. Thus, to prevent the <b>primary</b> <b>collision,</b> two nodes can be assigned the same channel if and only if neither of them is within the transmission range of the other. Similarly, to prevent the secondary collision, two nodes can be assigned the same channel if and only if no other node is located in the intersection of their transmission ranges. The conflict-free channel assignment problem seeks an assignment of the fewest channels to a given set of radio nodes with specified transmission ranges without any <b>primary</b> <b>collision</b> or secondary collision. It is a classic and fundamental problem in wireless ad hoc networks [1][2][4][11][12][16][15]. It is NP-hard even when all nodes are located in a plane and have the same transmission radii [14]. Therefore, only polynomial-time approximation algorithms can be expected. The performance of a polynomial-time approximation algorithm is measured by it...|$|E

Antibodies against L-selectin, but not against CD 11 a, CD 11 b, or CD 18, reduced ɛ at 100 s− 1 by > 85 %. High resolution imaging detected large scale deformation of the flowing neutrophil during the collision at 100 s− 1 with the apparent contact area increasing up to ∼ 40 μm 2. We observed the formation of long linear string assemblies of neutrophils downstream of neutrophils preadhered to ICAM- 1, but not fibrinogen, with a maximum in string formation at 100 s− 1. Secondary capture events to the ICAM- 1 or fibrinogen coated surfaces after primary collisions were infrequent and short lived, typically lasting from 500 to 3500 ms. Between 5 and 20 % of neutrophil interactions with ICAM- 1 substrate converted to firm arrest (> 3500 ms) and greatly exceeded that observed for fibrinogen, thus defining {{the root cause of}} poor string formation on fibrinogen at all shear rates. Additionally, neutrophils mobilized calcium after incorporation into strings. Static adhesion also caused calcium mobilization, as did the subsequent onset of flow. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 1), hydrodynamic thresholding in neutrophil string formation; 2), string formation on ICAM- 1 but not on fibrinogen; 3), large cellular deformation due to collisions at a venous shear rate; and 4), mechanosensing through neutrophil β 2 -integrin/adhesion.

40|$|Wind {{farms are}} known to source of {{disturbance}} for the wildlife within {{the area in which}} the farm is build. This disturbance mostly manifests itself in the displacement of animals out of the area. With bird species this disturbance also includes the risk of colliding with the wind turbines, what could result in injuries or death. Collisions with the turbines can be classified as being primary or secondary, in which <b>primary</b> <b>collision</b> concerns the direct contact with parts of the turbine and secondary collision concerns the bird being brought out of balance during fleight, causing it to crash, by the wake behind the turbine. The different air conditions within the wake could surprise the bird during flight, forcing it to deviate from its path. The level of riks is determined by the characterisitics of the bird and the wind turbine. This risk level is mostly calculated by using a bottom up method in which the risk is determined by the amount of victims found beneath the turbines. This number is then extrapolated to the number of birds passing the wind farm. To deternine the risk of collisions prior to the construction of the wind farm, a model can be used. This report describes a model-based approach to determine the expected number of collisions within a certain area prior to the wind farm construction. The method of calculating the risk is divided into a <b>primary</b> <b>collision</b> risk, a secondary collision riks, and a method to calculate the number of birds passing the wind turbines, thereby being at risk of colliding with a turbine. This model provides a full, species specific impression of the number of collision expected when a construction of a wind farm is planned within a certain area. The incorporation of the secondary collision risk is an innovation compared to the already known risk models. The secondary collision risk is equal, or even larger, than the <b>primary</b> <b>collision</b> risk making it a vital component of the collision risk model.

40|$|In this report, {{we present}} a {{methodology}} for assessing the benefits of different vehicle coordination strategies on {{the safety of a}} platoon during emergency braking. One can say that a coordinated braking strategy B is more beneficial than a strategy, if strategy B leads to a larger reduction in the probability of a collision, the expected number of collisions, and the expected relative velocity at impact as compared to strategy. We consider an emergency braking scenario, in which the lead vehicle brakes at its maximum capability and the following vehicles brake while obeying a vehicle following control law. The sequence of maximum deceleration of vehicles in the platoon is assumed to be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables; this distribution is assumed to be discrete and known. Due to coordination, however, the "executive "deceleration of a following vehicle may not necessarily be its maximum value. The problem of assessing the benefits of coordination can be formulated as three subproblems: the first subproblem deals with determining the probability distribution of the "executive" deceleration of following vehicles during emergency braking. It is intuitive that the smaller the variance of this distribution, the greater the safety benefits are. The second subproblem deals with determining the probability of an intervehicular collision, the expected number of collisions and the expected relative velocity at impact {{as a function of the}} difference in the braking capabilities of successive vehicles in a platoon. The probability of an intervehicular collision and the expected number of <b>primary</b> <b>collisions</b> are computed via a Markov chain. Here, the asymptotic behavior (as the size of the string increases indefinitely) of the probability of an intervehicular collision and the expected number of <b>primary</b> <b>collisions</b> is computed.

Thus, with the emerging of cognitive radio paradigm, {{the next generation}} network is determined to increase spectral efficiency {{in order to satisfy}} the wireless services demand. In this study, we proposed a novel solution that optimized the performance of cognitive radio networks that is mainly affected by spectrum sensing and channel selection process.

Inaccurate detection of spectrum availability had caused delays, throughput degradation and high spectrum handoffs in cognitive radio network.

40|$|Grazing {{collisions}} with {{background gas}} {{are the major}} cause of trap loss and trap heating in atom traps. To first order, these effects do {{not depend on the}} trap density. In collisionally opaque trapped atom clouds, however, scattered atoms with an energy E larger than the effective trap depth Eeff, which are destined to escape from the atom cloud, will have a finite probability for a secondary collision. This results in a contribution to the heating rate that depends on the column density of the trapped atoms, i. e., the product of density and characteristic size of the trap. For alkali-metal atom traps, secondary collisions are quite important due to the strong long-range interaction with like atoms. We derive a simple analytical expression for the secondary heating rate, showing a dependency proportional to Eeff 1 / 2. When extrapolating to a vanishing column density, only <b>primary</b> <b>collisions</b> with the background gas will contribute to the heating rate. This contribution is rather small, due to the weak long-range interaction of the usual background gas species in an ultrahigh-vacuum system—He, Ne, or Ar—with the trapped alkali-metal atoms.
