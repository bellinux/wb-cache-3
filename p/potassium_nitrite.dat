40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of some food additives used in foods on cold tolerance of Clostridium perfringens at pH close to neutral. Maximal concentrations recommended for foods of sodium benzoate, <b>potassium</b> sorbate, sodium <b>nitrite,</b> monosodium glutamate, or mixtures of those were added to cultures and their effects on C. perfringens tolerance to 10 °C were evaluated. The effect of a previous shock at 28 °C was also determined. Growth of C. perfringens was not inhibited by the substances examined. Sodium nitrite, applied at maximal permitted concentrations, increased C. perfringens survival at 10 °C. Mixtures of GRAS compounds had either no clear effect, or increased tolerance to 10 °C. A pre-shock (28 °C) of the cultures treated with sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite or monosodium glutamate increased survival and stimulated growth of the cultures treated at 10 °C. We conclude that the addition of these compounds including sodium benzoate, <b>potassium</b> sorbate, sodium <b>nitrite</b> and monosodium glutamate to cultures of C. perfringens can influence their cold tolerance. In some cases, the substances that would normally eliminate microorganisms at lower pH, can increase tolerance of this bacterium, permitting survival at low temperatures...|$|R

50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>nitrite</b> forms {{potassium}} nitrate when heated {{in the presence}} of oxygen from 550° to 790°.

From 650° to 750°, as the case of decomposition of {{potassium nitrate}} is, the system attains equilibrium. At 790°, a rapid decrease in volume is first observed, followed by a period of 15 minutes during which no volume changes occur. This is then followed by an increase in volume due primarily to the evolution of nitrogen, which is attributed to the decomposition of <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrite.</b>|$|E

Rates of utilization were of first-order kinetics, with nitrite removed more rapidly than nitrate. The rates were approximately 10 times as rapid at 0. 25 mM than at 2 mM for either nitrogen source. Nine clinical isolates that included M. avium serovars 1, 4, and 8 and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum serovar 43 were tested for rate of utilization of ammonia, nitrate, or nitrite. Ammonia and nitrite were utilized with first-order kinetics by all strains. Nitrate utilization occurred but was not at the same level for all strains. Clinical tests indicate that M. avium is negative for nitrate reductase; this is because of the rapid reduction of nitrite produced from nitrate...|$|R

A laboratory scale study was performed to investigate the recovery of NH 4 +-N as struvite using MgCl 2. 6 H 2 O and Na 2 HPO 4 as Mg and P sources, respectively. Seven different molar ratios (Magnesium: Ammonium: Phosphate) were used to optimize the removal efficiency of ammonia-N, Around 58 of ammonia removal was obtained in 1 : 11 molar ratio. Maximum removal efficiency of 76 and 78 achieved at the molar ratio of 2 : 11. 5 and 1. 51 : 2, respectively.

30|$|Natural {{colorants}} {{derived from}} plants and microorganisms have recently gained popularity over synthetic coloring agents because of undesirable toxic effects including mutagenicity and potential carcinogenicity {{in some cases}} [1]. Monascus pigments produced by Monascus purpureus (M. purpureus) fermentation are now used in processed seafood, sausages, and sauces in Asia to replace some food additives such as cochineal, <b>potassium</b> nitrate, and <b>nitrites</b> [2]-[4]. However, M. purpureus is also a toxigenic strain that can produce the nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic mycotoxin citrinin which greatly limits the wide application of the Monascus-related products [5]-[7]. Monascus pigments are safe, especially characterized with high protein adhesion and heat stability {{and can be used}} in a wide pH range [8],[9]. Hence, the investigations on the improvement of the pigment production are of commercial importance in the food coloration market.|$|R

Note that the maximum allowable amount of sodium nitrite and <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrite</b> is governed by regulations and is limited to 7 grams per 45 kg (0.25 ounces per 100 pounds) of chopped meat. Since Prague powder #1 is a 1:15 dilution (in 0.45 kg of Prague powder #1 30 grams is sodium nitrite and 425 grams are common table salt), we get the proper amount at a rate of 114 grams added to 45 kg of meat.|$|E
40|$|Careful {{examination}} of 35 Missouri caves, 95 Illinois caves, 17 Tennessee caves, 2 Indiana caves, and 11 Arkansas caves has shown cave-adapted banded sculpins (Cottus carolinae) {{to be limited}} to only two karst areas of Perry County, Missouri. Within these two karst areas, the sculpins are known from only 7 caves, though they may be in a few other caves that are hydrologically connected to these known sites. They were found in large cave streams, in pools and riffles, and on a variety of substrates, from sediment to breakdown. Banded sculpins without features of cave adaptation were found in caves of other areas of Missouri, and in Illinois, Indiana, and Tennessee and are reported from Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia caves as well. Caves of Perry County provide a unique habitat for sculpins, and also pose a serious threat, as they are located downgradient of the city of Perryville and other smaller communities that are intensively farmed. Specific documented threats include high levels of <b>potassium,</b> ammonia, <b>nitrite</b> + nitrate, and chloride, probably from agricultural fertilizers, organic waste, septic systems, and livestock (Vandike 1985). Underneath Perry County lies the highest concentration of caves in Missouri (about 630 known in the county), and the four largest caves in the state (Unklesbay and Vineyard 1992). The size of these caves and their respective streams is probably {{a major factor in the}} limited distribution of these sculpins...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} results from the assessment of the salinity status of a highly productive agricultural area, under a semiarid climate. The objectives were to: identify the origin of salts, assess seasonal changes of salt contents, and examine spatio-temporal and vertical variability of the presence and composition of salts. Soil samples from the surface horizon, and topsoil samples, soil profiles, water samples and salt precipitates on aggregates were collected in January and July 2009. High electrical conductivity was mainly the result of the poor low quality irrigation water. However, ions responsible for salinity were chlorides, sulfates, calcium, magnesium and sodium, while phosphates, ammonium, nitrates, and potassium were associated with fertilizers. SEM-EDX (scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray) analyses suggested that calcium sulfate came from both irrigation water and from a pedogenic source, as indicated by differences in crystal morphology and seasonal occurrence, which indicates that primary salinization is also a contributor to soil salinity in the area studied. Significant differences were reported between seasons. The electrical conductivity and concentrations of chloride, sulfates, calcium, magnesium, sodium, <b>potassium,</b> and <b>nitrite</b> are significantly higher in July. The observed differences were caused by the effect of soluble salt movement through evaporation and capillary rise, resulting in precipitation of salts on the surface. Multivariable, GIS and advanced laboratory analysis have confirmed to be useful techniques to identify the salts sources, spatial distribution of anions, and identification of vulnerable areas...|$|R
40|$|Among {{anthropogenic}} discharges, <b>nitrite</b> and <b>potassium</b> can simultaneously enter aquatic ecosystems at high loading rates {{which can}} threaten marine animals. The sensitivity of early juvenile blue swimmer crabs, Portunus pelagicus, to the subchronic exposure to <b>nitrite,</b> <b>potassium</b> and their combination was evaluated {{by measuring the}} survival, growth, total haemocyte count(THC) and gill histopathological changes. In all NaNO 2 -N and KNO 2 -N treatments the survival substantially decreased, many due to ‘‘molt death syndrome’’, along with significantly lower (po 0. 01) specific growth rates(SGR). Although fewer deaths occurred in the KCl-K treatments, the SGR at the higher concentrations were significantly less (po 0. 05) than the control. The gill histopathological changes following elevated NaNO 2 -N, KNO 2 -N and KCl-K exposure showed drastic but similar damage.
