50|$|Turbo-compound engines (actually {{employed}} on some trucks) are {{fitted with}} blow down turbines which {{are similar in}} design and appearance to a turbochargerexcept for the turbine shaft being mechanically or hydraulically connected to the engine's crankshaft instead of to a centrifugal compressor, thus providing additional power instead of boost.While the turbocharger is a pressure turbine, a <b>power</b> <b>recovery</b> turbine is a velocity one.|$|E
50|$|Recovery is {{initiated}} by increasing airspeed, using the vertical stabilizer to reduce yaw or, if uncorrectable by application of speed or tail-rotor thrust, entry into autorotation.

50|$|A {{turbo-compound engine}} is a {{reciprocating}} engine that employs a turbine to recover {{energy from the}} exhaust gases. The turbine is usually mechanically connected to the crankshaft, as on the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone engines fitted to Douglas DC-7B and the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation airliners, but electric and hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>recovery</b> systems have been investigated as well. Recovery turbines increase {{the output of the}} engine without increasing its fuel consumption, thus reducing the specific fuel consumption. Turbo-compounding was used for commercial airliners and similar long-range, long-endurance roles before the introduction of high-bypass turbofan engines replaced them in this role.|$|E

Four eighteen-cylinder Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone Turbo-Compound engines provided power. The prototype flew in May 1953 and American received their first DC-7 in November, inaugurating the first nonstop east-coast-to-west-coast service in the country (unrealistically scheduled just under the eight-hour limit for one crew) and forcing rival TWA to offer a similar service with its Super Constellations. Both aircraft frequently experienced inflight engine failures, causing many flights to be diverted. Some blamed this on the need for high power settings to meet the notional schedules, causing overheating and failure of the engines' <b>power</b> <b>recovery</b> turbines.|$|E
