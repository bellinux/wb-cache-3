50|$|When {{applying}} in October 2007 {{to start}} KABR-FM, the Alamo Navajo School <b>Board</b> <b>pledged</b> to divest itself of the AM station upon receiving its license for the FM station. The FCC granted the license for KABR-FM.|$|R
50|$|Raoul Weil is {{a member}} of the Optimus Foundation, a {{charitable}} foundation administered by UBS which helps with disease prevention and education across the world. In 2008, Weil was elected chairman of the Optimus Foundation’s <b>board,</b> <b>pledging</b> the foundation to the goal of becoming the largest charitable organization in Switzerland in the next decade.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2006, Lemieux's {{ownership}} group {{announced that}} it had reached an agreement to sell the Penguins to Research In Motion Chairman and Co-CEO Jim Balsillie. [...] However, Balsillie unexpectedly rescinded his offer two months later after an apparent dispute with the NHL Board of Governors over purchasing conditions, despite Balsillie having earlier <b>pledged</b> to the <b>Board</b> {{that he would not}} relocate the team. Lemieux was offended that Balsillie had pulled out at last minute and initially refused to return Balsillie's deposit, saying that it was in breach of their agreement.|$|R
25|$|In June 1911, the General Education <b>Board</b> <b>pledged</b> $60,000 if Fisk {{could raise}} the {{remaining}} $240,000 by October 1912, and in June 1913, the trustees eventually secured commitments from Andrew Carnegie, Julius Rosenwald, J.P. Morgan, and Charles Hull. In February 1912, {{on his way}} to meet with Fisk trustees in New York City, Gates suffered a severe concussion in a train accident near Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. Ordered to rest and recuperate in North Carolina, he briefly returned to Fisk to participate in commencement, but soon after his health deteriorated. During the summer, his wife submitted, without her husband's consent or knowledge, his resignation, and later that fall Gates died.|$|R
500|$|On December 2, the {{trustees}} authorized subscriptions to be solicited and paid to Waller {{with a goal}} of $20,000. On May 20, 1863, the board met again and learned that $12,800 had been <b>pledged</b> and the <b>board</b> then set up a building committee of Waller, Hines, Moores, E.N. Cook, and Thomas Milton Gatch. It was mainly {{through the efforts of}} the Reverend Waller that the hall was built. Several designs were then considered for the new building, and on February 22, 1864, by a vote of 16 to 1 the board selected the final plan that called for a brick building with a stone foundation. The foundation was to rise to a level [...] above the ground to prevent moisture from the ground seeping into the bricks.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2000, {{the science}} {{curriculum}} {{director of the}} Kanawha County, West Virginia, school district selected Of Pandas and People as a textbook [...] "that presents Darwin's Theory of Evolution as theory, not fact" [...] following pressure from the local community and teachers. A committee of science teachers unanimously voted to purchase copies of the book, but ultimately decided to abandon the idea for fear of litigation. A Christian conservative legal group, the Thomas More Law Center, offered to represent the county for free if any litigation arose but its offer was rejected. A proposal to buy the book for school libraries was eventually rejected by the school board, though a conservative member of the <b>board</b> <b>pledged</b> to pay for at least 14 copies out of her own pocket.|$|R
50|$|Telethon tote <b>board</b> <b>pledges</b> for 2004 {{were down}} nearly 2%, to $59,398,915 (from $60,505,234 in 2003). Hurricane Frances had struck {{through most of}} the Florida {{peninsula}} late on September 5, during the telethon, significantly reducing pledges from the southeast United States. As many Florida stations devoted their air-time to coverage of Hurricane Frances, most Love Network stations in Florida cancelled the local segments of the telethon and either aired only parts of the telethon, moved the telethon to a digital subchannel, or did not broadcast the telethon at all. On a Saturday afternoon in early December 2004, some Florida Love Network stations showed a special three-hour telethon, as a way to recoup some of the lost pledges. Telethon pledges were down another 7.5%, to $54,921,586 in 2005 due to significant Hurricane Katrina disaster relief efforts in New Orleans and throughout the region in 2005. That year, Jerry and his guests urged telethon viewers to also give donations to The Salvation Army and the American Red Cross.|$|R
5000|$|In 1960, the Norfolk City Council {{appointed}} {{him to the}} city's school board. He became chairman of the Norfolk from 1962 to 1972, when he {{was appointed to the}} statewide Virginia State Board of Education. In 1971, the Norfolk Public School system began busing students to schools across the city to fulfill a school desegregation initiative which had been ordered by the courts. Speaking at a rally in opposition to the busing, Thomas, who was chairman of the Norfolk School <b>Board,</b> <b>pledged</b> to keep his children in public schools and urged other parents to support the desegregation busing plan. One month later, Thomas published a 17-page press release. In his statement, Thomas called the busing initiative a failure, lamenting the flight of white families and students to the suburbs, [...] "I was greatly disturbed that the so-called solution to Norfolk's problem resulted in the loss of about 20 percent of our white children." ...|$|R
50|$|Before {{and after}} the {{campaign}} was launched, there were several benefiting activities and events that took place primarily in the National Capital Region (NCR). Events like plantation {{on the day of}} the campaign launch, and various other activation programs like, flash dance performances in several malls and as part of Raahgiri in Dwarka and Noida areas around New Delhi. The high point of the performances was the bird formation whereby, the people were informed that not only humans but other members of our ecosystem including fauna are affected by the impure air. Other activation programs included several road shows on many traffic light areas in New Delhi and grand celebration of the World Environment Day at the India Gate. The various events were covered by the print and digital media alike with full coverage in many leading dailies. Other activities include, the pledge signing in Cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore where around 50,000 and more people signed large <b>boards</b> <b>pledging</b> to do everything possible for protecting the environment.|$|R
50|$|The MDA itself donated $1 {{million to}} the Salvation Army for {{hurricane}} relief efforts. Prior to the hurricane-affected results of 2004 and 2005, the only other time the telethon raised less than the previous year was in 1982 ($28,400,000), during the recession of the early 1980s. One source said, however, that {{it was due to}} Jerry sitting out most of the telethon, due to his heart attack earlier (even though the heart attack did not occur until December of that year). However the next year - 1983, the telethon succeeded again in raising more money than its previous year and by 1984 was back to its record breaking pace. In 2006, the final tote board tally was $61,013,855 as five major regional stations knocked out during the previous telecast came back online. It was the first time since 2003 that the telethon raised more money than the previous year. In 2007, the telethon again raised more than any previous year, closing the show with tote <b>board</b> <b>pledges</b> totaling $63,759,478.|$|R
50|$|Under Kleinfeld’s leadership, the Siemens’ financially {{stricken}} {{mobile handset}} business {{was sold to}} Taiwan's BenQ in June 2005. The division’s German subsidiary, BenQ Mobile GmbH & Co. OHG, declared bankruptcy about one year later when the Taiwanese parent enterprise stopped all funding, resulting in extensive redundancies. This led to speculation in the German media that Siemens had off-loaded the division to avoid dealing with the fallout of its imminent demise. At about the same time, Siemens' Supervisory Board increased the salary of the Siemens Managing Board by 30%. In an attempt to limit damage over negative publicity, the <b>board</b> <b>pledged</b> their pay rises to a relief fund set up by Siemens to aid workers affected by the handset sale. Prior to his role as CEO, Kleinfeld transformed Siemens Management Consulting into an effective partner for the global businesses and he {{contributed significantly to the}} profitable turnaround of Siemens’ regional business in the U.S. By April 2007, all Siemens Groups reached or exceeded target margins for the first time.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{financial}} {{assistance from the}} American Missionary Association at liberal arts colleges continued to decline and found it nearly impossible to obtain money from Northern foundations unless they first obtained Booker T. Washington's blessing. In 1909, Fisk's third president, George A. Gates (1909-1912), {{opened the door to}} Northern foundations by inviting Washington to join the Board of Trustees and using his influence to solicit funds. Fisk needed to immediately install steam heat, lighting and a laundry plant. Raising $300,000 represented a significant challenge for Fisk, both for the amount and the willingness of Northern philanthropy to fund Black liberal arts higher education. By 1910, Gates commented that Washington had [...] "cornered" [...] New York funders for Black education in the South and initiated a capital campaign to raise $300,000.In June 1911, the General Education <b>Board</b> <b>pledged</b> $60,000 if Fisk could raise the remaining $240,000 by October 1912, and in June 1913, the trustees eventually secured commitments from Andrew Carnegie, Julius Rosenwald, J.P. Morgan, and Charles Hull. In February 1912, on his way to meet with Fisk trustees in New York City, Gates suffered a severe concussion in a train accident near Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. Ordered to rest and recuperate in North Carolina, he briefly returned to Fisk to participate in commencement, but soon after his health deteriorated. During the summer, his wife submitted, without her husband's consent or knowledge, his resignation, and later that fall Gates died.|$|R
40|$|Project (M. S. B. A., Business Administration (Accountancy)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. In 2002, the U. S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) {{entered into}} The Norwalk Agreement. This {{agreement}} was a Memorandum of Understanding {{in which the}} two <b>boards</b> ??????<b>pledged</b> to use their best efforts to (a) make their existing financial reporting standards fully compatible as soon as is practicable and (b) to coordinate their future work programs to ensure that once achieved, compatibility is maintained??? (FASB, 2002). Over time, it is expected that U. S. public companies will eventually prepare their financial statements according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Professionals who appraise small private companies often use data derived from public markets to arrive at their values. Since it is not likely that small private companies will adopt IFRS at the same rate, or to the same extent, as publicly traded companies, discount rates derived from public market data will not be applicable in the valuation of small private companies without specific adjustments to ensure comparability. In this project, a hypothetical company is used to illustrate the difference in discount rates when the financial statements are prepared according to U. S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) versus when they are prepared according to IFRS. The discount rate is selected using the buildup method from data published in the Ibbotson SBBI 2010 Valuation Year Book and applied to the subject company to arrive at an indicated value. The next step is to convert the GAAP basis financial statements to IFRS. The value of the subject company and the IFRS financial statements will then be used to determine and compare the corresponding discount rates. Finally, the adjusted discount rates will be used to illustrate the importance of matching the benefit streams of small private U. S. companies that continue to use GAAP to the benefit streams of publicly traded companies once they have adopted IFRS. Business Administration (Accountancy...|$|R
