In many cases the bonds permit state and local governments to transfer the risk of declines in future master settlement agreement payments to bondholders.

50|$|Various {{problems}} {{were perceived to}} persist with the availability, quality and reliability of financial information from debtors.

There are contradictory positions within the contemporary argument for methodological pluralism, such {{that it does not}} resolve tensions surrounding issues of women's experience and the warranting of interpretations. Epistemological debates involving feminism and post-modernism have created a changed intellectual landscape for reconsidering the link between qualitative research and standpoint theory. These raise issues of grounding, depth and evaluating knowledge by appeals to a notion of strong (or feminist) objectivity, together with the need to mitigate <b>against</b> <b>appropriation</b> of the `other'.

40|$|The recent {{decision}} in Cariou v.

In this article, I consider the legal history leading to the Cariou case, including a series of suits brought <b>against</b> <b>appropriation</b> artist Jeff Koons, as well as strategies proposed by several theorists for accommodating appropriation art within the law. Unfortunately, largely due to vagaries of the law and the misunderstood nature of appropriation art, the matter remains unresolved. I argue that, by investing borrowed material with new ideas, appropriation artists create new expressions and so transform their original sources. Being in line with the Constitutional mandate of copyright law, I suggest that such works of appropriation art be treated as presumptively fair uses...|$|R

40|$|The {{principles}} underpinning {{community education}} offer both a mirror on {{society and a}} shield <b>against</b> <b>appropriation</b> and co-option. However, for some time there have been concerns {{about the loss of}} community education and its influences in Scottish discourse, policy and in practice. These concerns have been serially discussed with likeminded friends and colleagues in the field, with partners in research activity and with academic colleagues representing a fair cross section from the community education firmament. In these discussions a loss of principle is argued, there are observations that critical practices are being marginalised or eradicated and there is recognition of a growing co-option and corruption of practices to meet neoliberal ends over associational, democratic and empowering community education. Across domains of youth work, adult learning and community development ‘technologies’ (Martin, 1988) of policy, audit, inspection and challenge-funding are seen as instrumental in precipitating this deleterious trend.
