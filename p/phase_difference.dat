5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the <b>phase</b> <b>difference</b> between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative <b>phase</b> <b>difference.</b> Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E
5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency). The <b>phase</b> <b>difference</b> between the two beams results in {{a change in the}} intensity of the light on the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.|$|E

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in a hetero Josephson junction formed by a conventional single-gap superconductor and a multi-gap one such as ${MgB}_{ 2 }$ and iron-based superconductors. In such a Josephson junction {{more than one}} <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> are defined. We clarify the quantum dynamics of the <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> and construct a theory for the MQT in the multi-gap Josephson junctions. The dynamics of the <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> are strongly affected by the Josephson-Leggett mode, which is the out-of-phase oscillation mode of the <b>phase</b> <b>differences.</b> The escape rate is calculated {{in terms of the}} effective action renormalized by the Josephson-Leggett mode. It is shown that the escape rate is drastically enhanced when the frequency of the Josephson-Leggett mode is less than the Josephson-plasma frequency. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

25|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>difference</b> is the difference, {{expressed}} in degrees or time, between two waves {{having the same}} frequency and referenced to the same point in time. Two oscillators that have the same frequency and no <b>phase</b> <b>difference</b> {{are said to be}} in phase. Two oscillators that have the same frequency and different phases have a <b>phase</b> <b>difference,</b> and the oscillators are said to be out of phase with each other.|$|E
25|$|Time is {{sometimes}} used (instead of angle) to express {{position within the}} cycle of an oscillation. A <b>phase</b> <b>difference</b> is analogous to two athletes running around a race track {{at the same speed}} and direction but starting at different positions on the track. They pass a point at different instants in time. But the time difference (<b>phase</b> <b>difference)</b> between them is a constant - same for every pass since they are at the same speed and in the same direction. If they were at different speeds (different frequencies), the <b>phase</b> <b>difference</b> is undefined and would only reflect different starting positions. Technically, <b>phase</b> <b>difference</b> between two entities at various frequencies is undefined and does not exist.|$|E

In fact, phase is relative because of its periodic behavior, so considering <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> {{with respect to a}} fixed reference (i.e., the first measurement) shall not improve or degrade the performance.|$|R

This means: evaluation of interaural time <b>differences</b> (interaural <b>phase</b> <b>differences)</b> for lower frequencies and evaluation of interaural level differences for higher frequencies. The evaluation of interaural <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> is useful, as long as it gives unambiguous results. This is the case, as long as ear distance is smaller than half the length (maximal one wavelength) of the sound waves. For animals with a larger head than humans the evaluation range for interaural <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> is shifted towards lower frequencies, for animals with a smaller head, this range is shifted towards higher frequencies.|$|R

30|$|The {{difference}} between the coherent and non-coherent algorithms is in the way how the summation in the criterion function is used; in the coherent algorithm, it is the real component of the sum that is applied whereas in the non-coherent algorithm, it is the absolute values of its terms that are exploited (cf. (24) and (29)). By taking absolute values, the constant <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> among channels are lost. We can use this idea to formulate a semi-coherent algorithm by taking the appropriate absolute values before summing over the channels (over m), but after summing over the antennas in each subarray (over l). In this way, the <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> between the antennas of the same subarray are preserved, whereas the <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> between subarrays are lost.|$|R

25|$|Where {{reactive}} loads are present, such as with capacitors or inductors, {{energy storage}} in the loads {{results in a}} <b>phase</b> <b>difference</b> between the current and voltage waveforms. During each cycle of the AC voltage, extra energy, in addition to any energy consumed in the load, is temporarily stored in the load in electric or magnetic fields, {{and then returned to}} the power grid a fraction of the period later.|$|E
25|$|In {{all other}} cases, {{where the two}} {{components}} either {{do not have the}} same amplitudes and/or their <b>phase</b> <b>difference</b> is neither zero nor a multiple of 90°, the polarization is called elliptical polarization because the electric vector traces out an ellipse in the plane (the polarization ellipse). This is shown in the above figure on the right. Detailed mathematics of polarization is done using Jones calculus and is characterised by the Stokes parameters.|$|E
25|$|The {{measured}} signal {{is the change}} in polarization as the incident radiation (in a known state) interacts with the material structure of interest (reflected, absorbed, scattered, or transmitted). The polarization change is quantified by the amplitude ratio, Ψ, and the <b>phase</b> <b>difference,</b> Δ (defined below). Because the signal depends on the thickness {{as well as the}} material properties, ellipsometry can be a universal tool for contact free determination of thickness and optical constants of films of all kinds.|$|E

The <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> between both variations have roughly equal values between 90 ° and 180 ° or - 90 ° and - 180 ° regardless of their periods. Using the polarization factors of temperature and conductivity derived from the theory of atmospheric internal gravity waves, the <b>phase</b> <b>differences</b> are calculated taking vertical wavelength as a parameter, and they are shown to be constant at longer periods than about 20 minutes. It is, however, difficult to explain the large values of the <b>phase</b> <b>differences...</b>|$|R

Peak volume flow rates are {{of the order of}} 150 mm 3 /s for the aqueduct of Sylvius and for the foramina of Monro.

The model includes variations of the distribution of the choroid plexus between the ventricles.
