25|$|Ten {{locomotives}} (numbers 92020-92029) {{were built}} in 1955 with the Franco-Crosti boiler. which incorporated a combustion gas feed water <b>preheater</b> that recuperated low-grade residual heat In the 9F version, this {{took the form of}} a single cylindrical water drum running along the underside of the main boiler barrel. The standard chimney on top of the smokebox was only used during lighting up. In normal working the gases went through firetubes inside the <b>preheater</b> drum that led to a second smokebox situated beneath the boiler from which there emerged a chimney on the right-hand side, just forward of the firebox. In the event, the experiment did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently to justify the cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite of the later provision of a small deflector plate forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent removal of the <b>preheater</b> drum, although the locomotives did retain the original main smokebox with its distinctive look.|$|E
25|$|A {{fossil fuel}} steam {{generator}} includes an economizer, a steam drum, and the furnace with its steam generating tubes and superheater coils. Necessary safety valves are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure. The air and flue gas path equipment include: forced draft (FD) fan, air <b>preheater</b> (AP), boiler furnace, induced draft (ID) fan, fly ash collectors (electrostatic precipitator or baghouse) and the flue gas stack.|$|E
25|$|Maximum {{supplementary}} firing {{refers to}} the maximum fuel that can be fired with the oxygen available in the gas turbine exhaust. The steam cycle is conventional with reheat and regeneration. Hot gas turbine exhaust is used as the combustion air. Regenerative air <b>preheater</b> is not required. A fresh air fan which {{makes it possible to}} operate the steam plant even when the gas turbine is not in operation, increases the availability of the unit.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{regenerative}} air preheaters: the rotating-plate regenerative air <b>preheaters</b> (RAPH) and the stationary-plate regenerative air <b>preheaters</b> (Rothemuhle).|$|R
50|$|Stationary-plate {{regenerative}} air <b>preheaters</b> {{are also}} known as Rothemuhle <b>preheaters,</b> manufactured for over 25 years by Balke-Dürr GmbH of Ratingen, Germany.|$|R
30|$|The steam {{extraction}} for district heating reduces the steam {{which is available}} for the low-temperature <b>preheaters.</b> For maximum boiler load the thermal energy transferred in the <b>preheaters,</b> which extract steam from the LP turbine, decreases from 147 to 18 MW, compared to the operation without heat extraction. The transferred thermal energy in the residual <b>preheaters,</b> including feed water tank, increases accordingly from 361 to 447 MW (also discussed by [17]).|$|R
25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air <b>preheater.</b> The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations.|$|E
2500|$|External {{fans are}} {{provided}} to give sufficient air for combustion. The Primary air fan takes {{air from the}} atmosphere and, first warms {{the air in the}} air <b>preheater</b> for better economy. [...] Primary air then passes through the coal pulverizers, and carries the coal dust to the burners for injection into the furnace. [...] The Secondary air fan takes air from the atmosphere and, first warms the air in the air <b>preheater</b> for better economy. Secondary air is mixed with the coal/primary air flow in the burners.|$|E

40|$|The {{largest single}} area for {{industrial}} energy conservation {{is in the}} improvement of combustion efficiencies for heaters and boilers. A number of methods can be employed to recover heat. The most common are by use of recuperative air <b>preheaters,</b> regenerative air <b>preheaters</b> and economizers. Relative advantages and applicability of the three methods are discussed. Analytical methods and correlations are presented which enable determination of size and unit, capital cost and operating cost {{for each of the}} three methods of heat recovery...|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} funnel was retained, but {{was only}} used for lighting-up and was blanked when running. The final chimney was {{located on the}} right-hand (fireman's) side, just forward of the firebox. The Crosti <b>preheaters</b> provided less improvement than had been expected, and were a problem for maintenance, owing to acidic fluegases condensing in the feedwater heater and causing corrosion. All were converted back to a more standard form within a few years, the <b>preheaters</b> remaining in place, but blanked off, {{as seen in the}} accompanying photograph.|$|R

50|$|Tubular preheaters {{consist of}} {{straight}} tube bundles which {{pass through the}} outlet ducting of the boiler and open at each end outside of the ducting. Inside the ducting, the hot furnace gases pass around the <b>preheater</b> tubes, transferring heat from the exhaust gas to the air inside the <b>preheater.</b> Ambient air is forced by a fan through ducting {{at one end of}} the <b>preheater</b> tubes and at other end the heated air from inside of the tubes emerges into another set of ducting, which carries it to the boiler furnace for combustion.|$|E

50|$|From 1950, 105 {{examples}} of this newly designed class were manufactured for medium passenger train and light express train services. They had welded locomotive frames, boilers and tenders together with all the latest refinements of German practice. These included a superheated multiple-valve regulator and central lubrication of the least accessible parts of the running gear. Engines up to operating number 023 had Knorr surface <b>preheaters</b> and journal bearings. Locomotives with serial numbers 024 and 025, {{as well as those}} from 053 onwards were equipped with roller bearings for the axles and drive as well as mixer-preheaters. A small number of vehicles were given Heinl <b>preheaters</b> and several were equipped for push-pull train operations.|$|R

Even <b>preheaters,</b> feed pumps, Frontschürzen, smoke deflectors and other equipment not essential for {{the operation of the}} locomotives were sometimes left out.|$|R
30|$|In {{the steam}} CHP plant, the steam is {{similarly}} {{extracted from the}} steam turbine. In contrast to the CCPP, the feed water is heated by condensate <b>preheaters</b> with steam from the steam turbine and not by flue gas. The flow sheet of the simulated model is shown in Fig. 9.|$|R
30|$|Modern {{cement plants}} with <b>preheaters</b> {{are not a}} {{significant}} PCDD/F source [9, 233]. In the past, however, cement plants with high PCDD/F emissions were also measured, with releases of up to 136  ng TEQ/m 3 and 40  g TEQ in a year [234]. PCDD/F levels in egg slightly above EU regulatory limits were measured in Mozambique and Uruguay [30].|$|R

50|$|The {{heating plate}} {{elements}} {{in this type}} of regenerative air <b>preheater</b> are also installed in a casing, but the heating plate elements are stationary rather than rotating. Instead the air ducts in the <b>preheater</b> are rotated so as to alternatively expose sections of the heating plate elements to the upflowing cool air.|$|E
50|$|In {{certain cases}} the unburnt {{deposits}} may {{occur on the}} air <b>preheater</b> elements causing it to catch fire during normal operations of the boiler, giving rise to explosions inside the air <b>preheater.</b> Sometimes mild explosions may be detected {{in the control room}} by variations in the inlet and outlet temperatures of the combustion air.|$|E
