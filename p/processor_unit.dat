25|$|The Nintendo 64's central {{processing}} unit (CPU) is the NEC VR4300. Popular Electronics said it had power similar to the Pentium processors found in desktop computers. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retained the computational abilities of the more powerful 64-bit MIPS R4300i, though software rarely took advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. Nintendo 64 games generally used faster (and more compact) 32-bit data-operations, as these were sufficient to generate 3D-scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal <b>Processor)</b> <b>unit.</b> In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space (which is at a premium on the Nintendo 64's cartridges).|$|E
25|$|Both the PPE and SPE are RISC {{architectures}} with a fixed-width 32-bit instruction format. The PPE {{contains a}} 64-bit {{general purpose register}} set (GPR), a 64-bit floating point register set (FPR), and a 128-bit Altivec register set. The SPE contains 128-bit registers only. These {{can be used for}} scalar data types ranging from 8-bits to 64-bits in size or for SIMD computations on a variety of integer and floating point formats. System memory addresses for both the PPE and SPE are expressed as 64-bit values for a theoretic address range of 264 bytes (16 exabytes or 16,777,216 terabytes). In practice, not all of these bits are implemented in hardware. Local store addresses internal to the SPU (Synergistic <b>Processor</b> <b>Unit)</b> processor are expressed as a 32-bit word. In documentation relating to Cell a word is always taken to mean 32 bits, a doubleword means 64 bits, and a quadword means 128 bits.|$|E

The multichip module (MCM) input/output pin density in z 990 <b>processor</b> <b>units</b> {{is more than twice}} that of the MCMs in z 900 <b>processor</b> <b>units.</b> This increase in packaging density and the consequent tripling of the current drawn by the <b>processor</b> <b>units</b> were accommodated by the first-time use of land grid array (LGA) MCM-to-board interconnections in an IBM zSeries � eServer. This was done by using innovative refrigeration cooling of the MCM with air cooling as backup, and by a new mechanical packaging and power distribution scheme. This paper describes the mechanical engineering of the CEC cage, the LGA MCMto-board interconnection scheme, and the mechanical isolation of the MCM evaporator–heat-sink mass from the LGA contacts. The paper also describes the electrical power and the cooling solutions implemented to meet the more demanding requirements of the denser CEC package...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} for par-allel sorting on stream processing architectures. It is based on adaptive bitonic sorting. For sorting n val-ues utilizing p stream <b>processor</b> <b>units,</b> this approach achieves the optimal time complexity O((n log n) /p). While this makes our approach competitive with common sequential sorting algorithms not only from a theoretical viewpoint, it is also very fast from a practi-cal viewpoint. This is achieved by using efficient linear stream memory accesses (and by combining the opti-mal time approach with algorithms optimized for small input sequences). We present an implementation on modern pro-grammable graphics hardware (GPUs). On recent GPUs, our optimal parallel sorting approach has shown to be remarkably faster than sequential sorting on the CPU, {{and it is also}} faster than previous non-optimal sorting approaches on the GPU for sufficiently large input sequences. Because of the excellent scalability of our algorithm with the number of stream <b>processor</b> <b>units</b> p (up to n / log 2 n or even n / log n units, depend-ing on the stream architecture), our approach profits heavily from the trend of increasing number of frag-ment <b>processor</b> <b>units</b> on GPUs, so that we can expect further speed improvement with upcoming GPU gener-ations. 1...|$|R
