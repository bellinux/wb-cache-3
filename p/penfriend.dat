25|$|Paganini met Berlioz in Paris, {{and was a}} {{frequent}} correspondent as a <b>penfriend.</b> He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was {{not satisfied with the}} resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato Harold en Italie. He never performed it, and instead it was premiered a year later by violist Christian Urhan. He did however write his own Sonata per Gran Viola Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in Harold, Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of Beethoven and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its sound box.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{look at what}} an ethnographic {{approach}} {{to the study of}} letter writing can tell us about the nature and meaning of a specific group of correspondences between men incarcerated on death row in the United States and their <b>penfriends</b> in Britain. I focus in particular on the letter writers' views about how the correspondence has changed them as people. While traditional letter writing on paper using pen, pencil or typewriters may have declined since the advent of emailing, chat rooms, and text messaging, it still survives where socially isolated people have an urgent need to reach out beyond their current situation but have access only to basic implements. In these circumstances, letter writing can provide an enormously rich and flexible channel for the pursuing of social relationship, new experience, and internal reflection. In order to understand this potential, I would suggest that we need to look not only at the content of the letters but also at the nature of the correspondences as a particular kind of literacy practice - in other words, at what the letter writers actually do, in what circumstances, and at the meanings and the values they attach to their correspondence. It is these particularities of practice in letter writing between prisoners and both male and female <b>penfriends</b> that create the opportunities for specific kind of epistolary relationship and an associated reconfiguring of the self...|$|R

Traube furthermore attributed two hexameter poems to Cellanus (Traube, pp. 105-08, 1900).|$|E
5000|$|While the {{expansion}} of the Internet has reduced the number of traditional penpals, penpal clubs can nowadays be found on the Internet, in magazine columns, newspapers, and sometimes through clubs or special interest groups. Some people are looking for romantic interests, while others just want to find friends. It seems, on the internet, that the term [...] "pen pals" [...] defines those looking to correspond with others that live in a different place, where pen pals originated via postal mail correspondences and has evolved to mean something more. Penpals also make and pass around friendship books, slams and crams. Another term used to describe pen pal is the word <b>penfriend.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of an identity among lesbian women during 1950 -­‐ 1965 is in focus in this master ́s thesis. My starting point is that identity, such as lesbian or any other identity, is formed {{in relation to other}} people and groups, as well as society. This thesis will also examine how lesbian women met and formed bonds with like-­minded, and whether these aspects changed, during the defined time period. The empirics is made up by letters written by women to Riksförbundet för sexuellt likaberättigande (a Swedish organisation for lesbian and gays) as well as an interview with two lesbian women who were born in 1938 and 1940. The theoretical approach is queer theory and phenomenology. In summary: I have found that women in this study to a great extent formed their identity in relation to prevailing scientific ideas that claimed to explicate homosexuality. Disappointments in marriage and personal failures were stressed by the women writers in order to explain their lesbian desires. Some of them also put equal weight on the relationship between a high sexual drive/nymphomania and homosexuality. Among many lesbians outside Stockholm in the 1950 ’s personal ads {{played a major role in}} order for them to meet with like-­minded women. The women in this study travelled long distances with the aim to visit pen friends in other parts of Sweden. Through those <b>penfriends</b> they were also introduced to other lesbian women, showing how lesbian networks emerged and grew. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1975, Van Eijk {{was sentenced}} to 18 years {{imprisonment}} and TBS. The details of the murders, as revealed during the trial, were so horrifying that several judiciary guards vomited. Psychiatric reports explained that Van Eijk had severe childhood trauma {{as a result of}} bullying and rejection by women. During his therapy at the Van Mesdagkliniek, psychiatrists speculated that his deviant behavior was the result of brain damage sustained during his birth. In 1980, while still in remand, he married his <b>penfriend</b> Adri. In 1990 he was released and together they moved into a house in Harkstede. Psychiatrists believed that his relationship with Adri would prevent him from reoffending, but warned that subsequent female rejections could trigger a relapse. The relationship {{turned out to be a}} downward spiral for Van Eijk.|$|E

50|$|Wouldn't it be cool to have {{a killer}} as <b>penfriend?</b> 15-year-old Chas is fascinated of this idea. He impersonates his mother and writes to a man, called Lenny, {{who is in a}} death row in the USA, because he {{allegedly}} had killed a teenager. The Man is from Chas' home town in England. And he actually writes back. A risking game! But that's not all. Chas steals a truck with his friend - only for fun. But the prison, in which the crazy teenagers land, isn't any fun.

5000|$|In the 1519 Sendweistum, {{the office}} of Heimburge is mentioned, and that {{warrants}} special attention. The office of Heimburge, who was no lordly official, but rather {{a representative of the}} community, shows that the village constitution in Fürfeld exhibited strong collective traits. The municipality under a Heimburge was called a Heimgerede. It is surely not superfluous to refer to such early forms of political organization not exercised by the nobility, because a common preconception has it that Germans only ever learnt democracy by French Revolutionary or, even later, Anglo-Saxon coaching. In April 1521 came the famous confrontation between Martin Luther and Emperor Charles V. In Fürfeld, the proceedings drew much attention, for a Fürfeld villager was known to be Luther’s supporter and <b>penfriend.</b> The family von Cronberg, whose castle seat lies north of Frankfurt {{at the edge of the}} Taunus, cropped up in Fürfeld not, as was formerly believed, in 1553. much less as late as 1571, but rather as early as 1521. In this year, a man named “Hartmann von Cronberg” acquired the properties of Wiegand von Dienheim. Because in bygone ages the names Hartmann and Hartmut were used haphazardly and interchangeably throughout records, and because in 1521, no other member of the family von Cronberg of a suitable age was living, it seems conclusive that this reference to the buyer meant none other than Hartmut XII (1488-1549), the “follower and fighter of the Lutheran Reformation”. For the assumption that Hartmut von Cronberg, Luther’s <b>penfriend</b> and reform-minded publicist, subscribed in Fürfeld to the schism then taking place, there is no proof. There is speculation to this effect, but in the 16th century, the church patronage rights were never in the Cronbergs’ hands. Even the notion that Fürfeld had by order become Lutheran is historically unfounded. Indeed, that is still not the case. In 1553, Philipp Melchior Marshal of Waldeck died, and with him, so did the lordly House of Waldeck. His estate in Iben was acquired by Hartmut von Cronberg, “Hartmann von Cronberg’s” son, on 29 June 1571 for 3,000 Thaler and 2,000 Rhenish guilders. Having entered into office as court lords in 1577, and later acquiring a further share in the court from the House of Boos von Waldeck in 1701, the Junker of Cronberg are represented in the first and second fields of the municipal coat of arms. In July 1704, Johann Niclas von Cronberg, the last Lord Cronberg, died, and the lordship in Fürfeld was now taken over by Johann Ferdinand von Kerpen in December of that same year. Iben had now escheated to the overlord - Saint Maximin’s Abbey - who then enfeoffed the family von Schmidtburg with it. It should be pointed out that the village lord did not actually own all the ground within the whole municipality. The Lord of Kerpen - from 1732 to 1788 this was Lothar Franz Christoph - had at his personal disposal, as personal property, only somewhat more than 20 ha of land. A whole series of noble families shared ownership over the rest, having given out their lands in hereditary or temporal pledges. A 1750 book of landholds lists the following as knightly families: ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} the intentional fallacy in the North Korean short story 'First Meeting' by Kim Hye-yong. Serially published in Korea Today in 2007, the nationalist allegory centres on Shin Ch'ong-mi, a young female journalist in Pyongyang, who falls in love with her <b>penfriend</b> Song-u, a soldier in the Korean People's Army, and struggles to remain devoted to him when he suddenly stops writing. With the literary-critical method of counterintuitive reading, the inquiry analyses the structural relations of the narrative, its discourse on desire, its apparent intentions, and its contravening elements, revealing an incidental unstable narrative that is symbolically protesting of the moral of the story to affectionately embrace the political authority of the North Korean party-army regime in the military-first (songun) era...|$|E
40|$|Focussing on a {{corpus of}} <b>penfriend</b> correspondences, this chapter argues that {{language}} creativity {{in this context}} is intensely dialogic, and that creativity at the level of text is intimately connected with creativity in the building of relationship and extension of the self. Dialogic patterns of address and response are traced across letters between six men on death row in the United States, and their penfriends in England. Creativity involved in the practice of letter writing, the design of the letters as artefacts and the writers’ poetic and playful uses of language and genre are considered in relation to the particular context of this correspondence, and the development of relationships between the writers. Processes of projection and mirroring reported by the penfriends are similar to those which have been found in virtual relationships developed on the Internet. Textual analysis suggests that each correspondence developed its own distinctive creative profile, where creative language served both expressive and interactional purposes, {{and at the same time}} generated a dialogic network of connections across the correspondence which created coherence and strengthened the writers’ relationship...|$|E
