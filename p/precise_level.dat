The <b>precise</b> <b>levelling</b> network provides the vertical reference datum for mapping and engineering purposes {{as well as for}} scientific research work, which includes tectonic movement monitoring and mean sea level studies. At present, twelve loops of <b>precise</b> <b>levelling</b> which cover {{the southern part of the}} Peninsular Malaysia were surveyed, processed and adjusted.

In deformation monitoring, terrestrial techniques such as <b>precise</b> <b>levelling</b> and/or space-based techniques such as GPS (Global Positioning System) are most commonly used measurement methods. In this paper, the subject is vertical deformation analysis of a large viaduct across a lake. The viaduct is a very attractive test object with its geological and geotechnical conditions for deformation research. With the aim of determining the deformations of this engineering structure, a control network was established and four campaign GPS measurements were carried out. GPS measurements were supported by <b>Precise</b> <b>Levelling</b> Technique. Because of that the height component is the least accurately determined GPS coordinate, due to geometric weakness of system and atmospheric errors.
