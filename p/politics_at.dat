He was reelected in 1932, winning 86.3% of the vote against Republican J. Theodore Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius {{seems to}} have tired of <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> this point. In AD22, he shared his tribunician {{authority}} with his son Drusus, and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year.

Nonetheless, Hareide himself showed a video clip {{of one of the}} parodies when publicly announcing his stepdown from national <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> the 2007 party congress.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years later}} public attitudes had changed little. When Ian Harvey, a junior Foreign Office {{minister}} in Harold Macmillan's government, {{was found guilty}} of indecent behaviour with a Coldstream Guardsman in November 1958, he lost both his ministerial job and his parliamentary seat at Harrow East. He was ostracised by the Conservative Party and by most of his former friends, and never again held a position in public life. Thus, anyone entering <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> that time knew that revelations of homosexual activity would likely bring such a career to a swift end.|$|E
5|$|His {{dispute with}} the General Assembly over the naming of a land {{registrar}} left Garrard embittered, and he retired from <b>politics</b> <b>at</b> the expiration of his second term. He privately backed Christopher Greenup's bid to succeed him in 1804, and Bourbon County's vote broke heavily for Greenup in the election. Although his sons William and James would continue running for public office into the 1830s, Garrard never indicated a desire to run again.|$|E
