30|$|Two {{positive}} control treatments {{were included in}} the bioassay, i.e., the inorganic toxin <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenate</b> and an insecticidal protein (snowdrop lectin, GNA). Ingestion of both toxins revealed adverse effects on the recorded parameters of the A. bipunctata larvae. Thus, these {{positive control}} treatments confirmed that the test compounds were ingested and that the test system is able to detect treatment effects. The inclusion of positive control (or reference) treatments is an important factor to consider in ecotoxicological studies [10 – 12].|$|E
30|$|Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] {{argued that}} {{exposure}} and uptake must be verified using a positive control which {{in their case}} was <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenate.</b> While we {{agree that it is}} important to validate uptake, we argue that validation of uptake through a particular pathway using a positive control is much more critical in cases where no differences between the treatment and control can be observed, as for example in the direct feeding studies by Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8]. This is to exclude the possibility that the lack of an effect was due to the lack of ingestion. We argue that in the case of Schmidt et al. [1], the researchers did indeed demonstrate uptake through the incurment of significantly higher mortalities in their treatments serving effectively as the 'positive control.' The only difference between the controls and the treatments in the studies by Schmidt et al. [1] was the applied Bt toxin. Hence, by all scientific standards, this is a reasonably strong indication that the Bt toxin elicited this response.|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenate,</b> {{as measured by}} retardation or inhibition of growth on solid nutrient media, showed wide variation among different fungi but was consistently reduced {{by the addition of}} large amounts of potassium phosphate, with both arsenic-sensitive and arsenic-tolerant fungi. Poria monticola was completely inhibited by 0. 0025 M arsenate but was progressively less inhibited as the phosphate content of the medium increased and grew slowly at 0. 04 M arsenate when 0. 16 M KH 2 PO 4 was added. Cladosporium herbarum showed 36 % reduction in growth at 0. 08 M arsenate in a low-phosphate medium, but when 0. 01 M KH 2 PO 4 was added, arsenate concentrations up to 0. 64 M (at which the medium contains 4. 8 % As) caused no reduction in growth rate. Addition of phosphate also reduced the {{toxicity of}} potassium arsenite but not that of dimethyl sodium arsonate (sodium cacodylate). The counteracting effect of phosphate on arsenate toxicity was found to occur with every one {{of a wide variety of}} microorganisms tested. The author interprets the results as supporting the thesis that the fungitoxicity of arsenate is due to its competitive interference with phosphorus in oxidative phosphorylation and not to a reaction with the —SH groups of essential proteins. The latter mechanism is, however, probably operative with dimethyl sodium arsonate. The practical implications of the counter-inhibition phenomenon in laboratory investigations and standard tests of arsenical fungicides, in biochemical research, and in the commercial use of arsenical biocides are set out...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} dietary effects of insecticidal substances on the predacious ladybird beetle, Coleomegilla maculata De Geer, a Tier- 1 laboratory testing system was developed. Artificial diets using shrimp eggs were developed, and a tier- 1 bioassay examining C. maculata development and survival was designed {{based on those}} diets. To further measure the artificial diet in a Tier- 1 testing system, larvae of C. maculata were fed the diet treated with different concentrations of an inorganic stomach poison, <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenate</b> (PA), or a cysteine protease inhibitor, E- 64. The results demonstrated that the testing system was capable of detecting the dietary effects of both substances on the survival and development of C. maculata. With increasing concentrations of PA in the diet, fewer larvae developed to adults, with only 22. 7 % larvae surviving to the adult stage in the treatment with the highest content of PA (32 μg/g of diet). Likewise, dose-dependent responses also were found for other life-table parameters of C. maculata. Similar to the assays with PA, the survival rates of C. maculata consistently decreased with increasing E- 64 content in the diet. Survival analysis showed that the insects fed E- 64 at 50, 150, and 450 μg/g in the diet had significantly lower survival rates compared with those on the untreated artificial diet. The study presented here describes a robust testing system that will be useful for assessing the potential hazard (or toxicity) effects after dietary exposure of insecticidal compounds produced by GE plants or conventional insecticides on the ladybird predator, C. maculat...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} of l-methionine by the gram-positive species Brevibacterium linens CNRZ 918 is described. The one transport system (Km = 55 μM) found is constitutive for l-methionine, stereospecific, and pH and temperature dependent. Entry of l-methionine into cells {{is controlled by}} the internal methionine pool. Competition studies indicate that l-methionine and α-aminobutyric acid share a common carrier for their transport. Neither methionine derivatives substituted on the amino or carboxyl groups nor d-methionine was an inhibitor, whereas powerful inhibition was shown by l-cysteine, s-methyl-l-cysteine, dl-selenomethionine and dl-homocysteine. Sodium plays important and varied roles in l-methionine transport by B. linens CNRZ 918 : (i) it stimulates transport without affecting the Km, (ii) it increases the specific activity (on a biomass basis) of the l-methionine transport system when present with methionine in the medium, suggesting a coinduction mechanism. l-Methionine transport requires an exogenous energy source, which may be succinic, lactic, acetic, or pyruvic acid but not glucose or sucrose. The fact that l-methionine transport was stimulated by <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenate</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} by potassium fluoride suggests that high-energy phosphorylated intermediates are not involved in the process. Monensin eliminates stimulation by sodium. Gramicidin and carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone act in the presence or absence of Na+. N-Ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercurobenzoate, valinomycin, sodium azide, and potassium cyanide have no or only a partial inhibitory effect. These results tend to indicate that the proton motive force reinforced by the Na+ gradient is involved in the mechanism of energy coupling of l-methionine transport by B. linens CNRZ 918. Thus, this transport is partially similar to the well-described systems in gram-negative bacteria, except for the role of sodium, which is very effective in B. linens, a species adapted to the high sodium levels of its niche...|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} inelastic neutron {{scattering}} (INS) spectroscopy {{to study the}} "A, B, C" region of the hydrogen bond in <b>potassium</b> dihydrogen <b>arsenate.</b> The broad spectral feature observed in infrared spectroscopy is shown {{to be associated with}} a ridge of constant intensity in the INS, which follows the recoil line for a unit-mass particle. The onset energy of the ridge is unclear but, we believe, is associated with the optical "C" feature at 1610 cm(- 1), and which we assign to nu(O-H). The "B" and "A" optical bands were both demonstrated to be two-quantum events and are, thus, not associated with the fundamental nu(O-H). They are readily assigned to the harmonic overtone delta(OH) (0 - 2) and the combination gamma(OH) (0 - 1) + delta(OH) (0 - 1), which both sit astride the ridge and there is no evidence for Evans' holes. The other overtone, gamma(OH) (0 - 2), has been assigned to a very weak feature, observed {{for the first time at}} 1900 cm(- 1).
