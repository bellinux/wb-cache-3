5000|$|Paleobotany, also spelled as palaeobotany (from the Greek words <b>paleon</b> = old and [...] "botany", {{study of}} plants), is {{the branch of}} {{paleontology}} or paleobiology dealing with the recovery and identification of plant remains from geological contexts, and their use for the biological reconstruction of past environments (paleogeography), and both the evolutionary history of plants, with a bearing upon the evolution of life in general. A synonym is paleophytology. Paleobotany includes the study of terrestrial plant fossils, {{as well as the}} study of prehistoric marine photoautotrophs, such as photosynthetic algae, seaweeds or kelp. A closely related field is palynology, which is the study of fossilized and extant spores and pollen.|$|E

40|$|The Late Permian strata, namely Raggyorcaka Formation, is {{distributed}} {{along the line}} from Shuanghu agency to Raggyorcaka area. The Formation comprises two parts divided by fault. The lower part is mainly composed of shale and carbonate containing fusulinids and brachiopods while the upper part is dominated by flora-bearing sandstone and mudstone. Acording to the new materials got from 1 ∶ 250 000 scale Mayigangrimap, the upper terrestrial flora-bearing deposits conformably overlie the lower marine fusulinids-bearing deposits. So, based on the analysis of <b>paleon</b> to logy and litho stratigraphy, the original Raggyorcaka Format ion are divided in to two parts. The lower is Raggyorcaka Formation standing for fusulinids-bearing marine deposits and the upper is Heitugou Formation (P 3 h), a new lithostratigraphic name represen ting flora-bearing deposits. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{in cultural}} anthropology examines how material traces {{on the landscape}} are used to construct the long-term environmental histories that inform conservation policy and land management decisions. The Anthropocene, both as planetary crisis and crisis of insufficient theorization, is the analytical starting point for this research, as it offers a framework from which to view {{the emergence of new}} kinds of environmental thought made manifest in science and politics. The dissertation is based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted among a network of scientists, <b>PalEON</b> (the Paleo-ecological Observatory Network), who were working to develop an ecological forecasting model and conservationists who are working on environmental protection issues in Northwest Indiana. By bringing together anthropologies of science and American environmental history, this dissertation critically analyzes the development and use of Big Data-driven ecological forecasting models in this process. The particular modes of environmental protection that emerge represent the extent to which market-based ontologies have become entrenched in everyday American life and inform ecological theory. These worldviews are not singular, however, and they contain within them examples of actually existing alternatives to environmentalism and the potential to reconceptualize this moment of crisis. Further, this dissertation makes a methodological intervention into Science and Technology Studies. Building on methodological techniques developed at the Science and Justice Research Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz, this research explores the potentials of critical collaborations between the anthropologist of science and the interlocutors who inform this study...|$|E

The inversion can also accommodate custom priors (so far, only normal and lognormal) and preset constants (i. e. inversions can be performed on all parameters, or only a subset of unknown parameters if some are known). The inversion process has been rewritten in Fortran to facilitate addition of new models. In addition, users can perform a much slower inversion with fully customizable models and priors (passed as function arguments).
