5|$|Abolition {{continued}} to be associated in the <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> with the French Revolution and with British radical groups, resulting in a decline in public support. In 1795, the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade ceased to meet, and Clarkson retired in ill-health to the Lake District. However, despite the decreased interest in abolition, Wilberforce {{continued to}} introduce abolition bills throughout the 1790s.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's music, {{his status}} as one of music's {{earliest}} superstars, his association (if only indirect) with political insurrection, his love life and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era in the <b>public</b> <b>consciousness.</b> His works remain popular, {{and he has been}} the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered <b>public</b> <b>consciousness.</b> It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few years after publication, German readers widely assumed that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen was {{responsible}} for the stories. According to witnesses, Münchhausen was deeply angry that the book had dragged his name into <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> and insulted his honor as a nobleman. Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties or tell any more stories, and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{the first}} openly non-heterosexual {{character}} {{in the history of}} televised Doctor Who. The popularity of the character amongst multiple audiences directly influenced the development of the spin-off series Torchwood. The character became a figure of the British <b>public</b> <b>consciousness,</b> rapidly gaining fame for portrayer John Barrowman. As an ongoing depiction of bisexuality in mainstream British television, the character became a role model for young gay and bisexual people in the UK. Jack is featured in various Doctor Who and Torchwood books and has action figures created in his likeness.|$|E

5|$|Madness in the Fast Lane is the BBC documentary, first {{broadcast}} on BBC One on 10 August 2010, which brought {{the story of}} Sabina and Ursula Eriksson and the killing of Glen Hollinshead into the <b>public</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The footage on the M6 motorway of the two women jumping into the passing traffic had previously been {{broadcast on}} Motorway Cops, {{but this was the}} first time the rest of the story had been told.|$|E
5|$|The work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis {{was widely}} read, {{and helped to}} create <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> of female {{homosexuality}}. The sexologists' claims that homosexuality was a congenital anomaly were generally well-accepted by homosexual men; it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by nor {{should be considered a}} criminal vice, as was widely acknowledged. In the absence of any other material to describe their emotions, homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin. Lesbian began to describe elements of a subculture.|$|E
5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed {{largely from the}} hardcore scene in the 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which {{laid the groundwork for}} underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre is considered to be rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands laid the groundwork for the breakthrough of the genre in the American <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> in the next decade.|$|E

5|$|The NWOBHM {{began as}} an {{underground}} phenomenon growing in parallel to punk and largely ignored by the media. It was only through the promotion of rock DJ Neal Kay and Sounds campaigning that it reached the <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> and gained radio airplay, recognition and success in the UK. The movement involved mostly young, white, male and working-class musicians and fans, who suffered the hardships brought on by rising unemployment for years after the 1973–75 recession. As a reaction to their bleak reality, they created a community separate from mainstream society to enjoy each other's company and their favourite loud music. The NWOBHM was heavily criticised for the excessive hype generated by local media in favour of mostly talentless musicians. Nonetheless, it generated a renewal in the genre of heavy metal music and furthered {{the progress of the}} heavy metal subculture, whose updated behavioural and visual codes were quickly adopted by metal fans worldwide after the spread of the music to continental Europe, North America and Japan.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Red Letter Day, Dewees became a {{full-time}} member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, Vagrant Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund {{the production of the}} album. On September 21, 1999, the band released Something to Write Home About on Vagrant Records. The album's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. Something to Write Home About has been singled out as the band's only 'true' emo album, as the album's aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre. Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie labels in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids the poster children for emo, but it also launched the genre into a <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene's DIY ethic.|$|E
5|$|Lion taming {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established circus or as an individual act, such as Siegfried & Roy. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards, and cougars. The practice was pioneered {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. Van Amburgh performed before Queen Victoria in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a pantomime titled Les Lions de Mysore ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries. The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by placing his head in the lion's mouth. The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903–1965).|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{the aim of}} {{environmental}} history is to arouse the <b>public’s</b> <b>consciousness</b> of today’s worsening environmental situation. With the rapid industrial development in China, increased production and consumption both have dramatically caused severe environmental problems. Although the study of economics, sociology, and politics can contribute to understanding contemporary problems, environmental history makes it clearer that we need as well to place those issues in a broader and longer historical context.|$|R

50|$|When the World Wildlife Fund (U.S.) {{was formed}} in Washington, D.C., on December 1, 1961, Russell Train became its first ever Vice-President; in later years he was named Chair Emeritus of the WWF.

5|$|John Greyson became {{interested}} in offering a counterpoint to the Patient Zero story as early as 1987, when the Patient Zero meme began entering the <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> following the publication of Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On. The book described the cluster study {{which led to the}} popular identification of flight attendant Gaëtan Dugas as the vector through which HIV was first brought to North America. It should be noted, however, that Shilts himself never claimed that Dugas was the first. In early 1991 Greyson was given a development grant for the script from the Canadian Film Centre, of which Greyson is an alumnus. Over the next year Greyson, in collaboration with Film Centre partners Louise Garfield and Anna Stratton, continued to develop the script, eventually presenting it with producer Alexandra Raffé in a workshop format. During the first half of 1992, the production team secured additional development funding from the Canada Council, Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation. By June of that year the script and the songs were completed and that autumn, with funds from the Telefilm Canada and OFDC grants along with revenue from the sale of British broadcast rights to Channel 4, pre-production and casting got underway. Principal photography began in November 1992 and wrapped after five weeks. Sneak previews took place at the Seattle International Film Festival and a number of LGBT film festivals across the United States before its official debut in September 1993 at Toronto's Festival of Festivals.|$|E

50|$|Brent Dowe, {{the lead}} singer of the Melodians, told Kenneth Bilby that he had adapted Psalm 137 to the new reggae style {{because he wanted to}} {{increase}} the <b>public's</b> <b>consciousness</b> of the growing Rastafarian movement and its calls for black liberation and social justice. Like the Afro-Protestant Revival services, traditional Rastafarian worship often included psalm singing and hymn singing, and Rastas typically modified the words to fit their own spiritual conceptions; Psalm 137 was among their sacred chants.|$|R
5000|$|Use of {{the term}} hacker meaning {{computer}} criminal was also advanced by the title [...] "Stalking the Wily Hacker", an article by Clifford Stoll in the May 1988 issue of the Communications of the ACM. Later that year, the release by Robert Tappan Morris, Jr. of the so-called Morris worm provoked the popular media to spread this usage. The popularity of Stoll's book The Cuckoo's Egg, published one year later, further entrenched the term in the <b>public's</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|R
