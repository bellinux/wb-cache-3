5000|$|Government agendas {{are created}} when {{problems}} are recognized that have viable solutions {{that will be}} politically correct to make {{at the time of}} decision making. Kingdon recognizes when these three aspects join together using the term [...] "policy window". When a <b>policy</b> <b>window</b> is recognized and open, there is a potential for policy making to happen. Policy entrepreneurs function at this time as the action takers who take advantage of these windows while they are open. In the problems stream, conditions are defined as problems based on how an individual values and believes in it and how much of an impact will happen through change. In the policy stream, ideas and solutions are formulated through policy ideas usually developed by specialists to an issue. Policy development has better chance of surviving implementation if it has support from various different communities effected by the policy. The politics stream focuses on different elements that will effect a policy such as national mood, efforts by the people to campaign for change and legislative turnover.|$|E
50|$|In the multiple-streams frameworks, policy {{entrepreneurs}} do most {{of their}} work in the policy stream working on agenda setting ideas. The role of a policy entrepreneur is to first identify demand for innovation in the political landscape when a recognizable <b>policy</b> <b>window</b> is open. When this window is open, a policy entrepreneur has {{a limited amount of}} time to undergo the initial launch of proposing policy recommendations to supply the demand by utilizing their personal, network and institutional resources to take action on joining streams together on their idea through the policy stages. This is done by addressing issues and problems and coming up with solutions to them by creating policy alternatives into a product that they can present as a persuasive agenda that policy-makers should examine. They will implement persuasive strategies and techniques on the policy-makers to coerce their innovation onto the agenda. A successful policy entrepreneur will manage to get their issues onto a political agenda and potentially pass and influence a form of legislation that relates to their personal benefit. However, not every attempt will be successful. If unsuccessful, a policy entrepreneur may hold onto their agenda for a later time or even apply it to a different issue that they deem may work.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} paper to {{statistically}} examine the timing of interest group lobbying. It introduces a theoretical framework based on recurring “structural <b>policy</b> <b>windows</b> ” and argues that these types of windows should have a large effect on the intensity and timing of interest group activity. Using a new database of all lobbying expenditures in the U. S. states ranging up to 25 years, the paper shows interest group lobbying increases substantially during one of these structural windows in particular [...] the budgeting process. Spikes in lobbying during budgeting are driven primarily by business groups. Moreover, even groups relatively unaffected by budgets lobby more intensely during legislative budgeting, consistent with the theory that these interests are attempting to have legislators attach (de) regulatory riders to the budget bills. Overall, the paper demonstrates that these structural <b>policy</b> <b>windows</b> largely determine lobbying expenditures...|$|R

40|$|During the 1990 s, {{terrorist}} actions using {{biological weapons}} and the fear that rogue states pos-sessed such weapons placed bioterrorism on the political agenda, a <b>policy</b> <b>window</b> widened by the September 11 attacks. Advocates for improving the U. S. public health infrastructure attempted to use this window to obtain the resources necessary for modernization. This article examines those efforts and identifies significant problems arising from a mismatch between the goals of public health policy entrepreneurs and the <b>policy</b> <b>window</b> used to address them. By defining bioterrorism as a security rather than a public health issue, policy entrepreneurs squander the opportunity to institute broad-based reforms that would improve not only the ability to manage a terrorist incident, but also meet other public health needs. The bioterrorism program proves a useful case study in how the goals of policy entrepreneurs can be displaced by attaching policy preferences to the wrong policy stream. In 1910, M. J.

40|$|The {{passage of}} the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and {{subsequent}} establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau marked an unexpected victory for consumers across America {{at the expense of}} the well-financed business lobby. Although classical social scientists, such as Mancur Olson, claim that consumer movements should fail to emerge due to the difficulty of providing public goods for large constituencies, consumer victories – like the passage of Dodd-Frank — have occurred in waves throughout the last century. In conducting this study, I thus sought to answer why it is that some consumer movements are able to push through consumer legislation while others fail. In order to answer this question, I conducted two cases studies, comparing Ralph Nader’s failed attempt to establish a Consumer Protection Agency in the 1970 s with Elizabeth Warren’s successful push to create Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010. Ultimately my research demonstrates that three variables are critical to the passage of consumer legislation: 1) the opening of a <b>policy</b> <b>window</b> via key events, 2) the existence of favorable structural conditions in the policy making process, and 3) the ability of political entrepreneurs to utilize successful legislative and framing strategies that help them advance their agenda within the broader environmental context.

40|$|Analysing {{the first}} decade of post-communist pension policy in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, we find an {{interesting}} policy pattern: while the Czech government has implemented a pension reform characterised by gradual and partially parametric policy changes, Hungarian and Polish policymakers have enacted a far-reaching reform of their countries' old age security systems, involving a transformation of the previous one-pillar system into a multipillar system based on a substantial fully-funded element. Taking up the neo-institutionalist literature, which conceives pension policy as 'locus classicus' for path-dependent policy development, the central analytical question arising is why Hungary and Poland {{on the one hand and}} the Czech Republic on the other took so different reform paths during the 90 s - despite the fact that all three countries were characterised by rather similar pension systems under communist rule. By referring to the theoretical framework provided by the multiple streams approach of John W. Kingdon, the paper develops an explanatory argument which focuses on the role of the World Bank in the agenda-setting/pre-decision phase of the pension reform processes throughout the three Visegr 1 d countries. In a nutshell, the paper argues that the rapidly increasing problem pressure within the Hungarian and Polish pension system during the mid- 90 s finally opened a <b>policy</b> <b>window</b> for a far-reaching pension reform, which allowed the policy entrepreneur World Bank to couple its elaborated country-specific pension proposals to both the respective problem and policy streams.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an apparent}} 'early stage' governance {{transformation in the}} Tam Giang Lagoon, Vietnam. In this context, the role of key <b>policy</b> <b>windows</b> for innovative governance practice is assessed (e. g., changes to Land and Fisheries Laws). Also examined {{is the emergence of}} recent initiatives to catalyze a wider shift in governance practice in the region, including the formation of co-management institutional networks that contribute to trust building and learning, and the allocation of collective territorial use rights for fisheries. While these changes are consistent with experiences in other coastal marine contexts, the paper shows that place-based and longitudinal research is necessary to explain and predict the conditions and incentives that catalyze governance shifts. Differences between a governance change and more fundamental transformation are difficult to discern using point-in-time analysis. Moreover, the results show that current declines in ecological conditions in the lagoon may not be reversed by changes to access rights or the emergence of co-management. Rather, these governance changes may simply help to stabilize the situation and buy time until other livelihood opportunities arise. Assessments of governance transformation thus need to be linked to ecological outcomes (i. e., reversing degradation of coastal marine systems, avoiding biophysical tipping points) which may not be easily identified in the short-term. Despite uncertainty, the emergence of <b>policy</b> <b>windows,</b> evidence of institutional innovation, and small-scale rights allocation experiments, all suggest important shifts in the trajectory of governance are underway in the Tam Giang Lagoon.

We argue that we need to see the moments and structures of opportunity not simply as fixed, but as something that actors can ‘make’. The moments of opportunity refer to the dynamic, emerging factors of opportunity. Meanwhile, the structures of opportunity consist of relatively consistent, stable factors of opportunity. This theoretical insight is then applied to two debates on development planning projects in the periurban area of North Bandung Area, Indonesia. Three aspects of institutional capacity result from the practice of ‘constructing’ opportunity in the case study: mobilization of social resources, empowerment of weak actors, and focusing of politicians and policymakers’ attention. ...|$|E

40|$|Mainstreaming {{climate change}} and future {{uncertainty}} into rural development planning in developing countries is a pressing challenge. By taking a complex systems approach to decision-making, the adaptation pathways construct provides useful principles. However, there are no examples of how to operationalise adaptation pathways in developing countries, or how to evaluate the process. This paper describes a 4  year governance experiment in Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia, which applied adaptive co-management (ACM) as a governance approach to ‘prime’ a transformation to adaptation pathways-based development planning. The project’s Theory of Change (ToC) consisted of three causally-linked phases which mirrored the evolutionary stages of ACM: priming stakeholders, enabling policies and programs, and implementing adaptation. The first phase established a trans-disciplinary research team to act as facilitators and brokers, a multi-stakeholder planning process demonstrating adaptation pathways practice, and trialling of ‘no regrets’ adaptation strategies in case study sub-districts. A participatory evaluation method was designed to test the ToC’s assumptions and measure ACM outcomes. Stakeholder interviews at the project’s closure indicated that through ACM, stakeholders had been successfully primed: leaders emerged, trust, cross-scale social networks and knowledge integration grew, communities were empowered, and innovative adaptation strategies were developed and tested. However, there was limited evidence of institutional change to existing planning processes. This was attributed {{to the absence of}} <b>policy</b> <b>windows</b> due to ineffective and insufficient time for political engagement, and the fluid institutional environment caused by a national decentralisation policy. To enhance the priming of adaptation pathways into development planning under these conditions, three recommendations are made: (1) provide long term support for emergent leaders and brokers to become ‘policy entrepreneurs’ who can capitalise on <b>policy</b> <b>windows</b> when they appear, (2) establish and support local livelihood innovation niches as ‘bridgeheads’ for ACM, and (3) maintain participatory evaluation amongst primary stakeholders to re-kindle ACM...|$|R
40|$|In 2014, European {{heads of}} state {{selected}} new targets for the EU {{as part of the}} 2030 climate and energy framework. The targets will guide the ambition and nature of EU policy in this area until 2030 and are likely to have important implications for Europe’s transition to a low-carbon economy. The decision taken by the European Council was preceded by several years of vigorous interaction between interest groups, the European Commission and the member states. The outcome of this interaction set the agenda for EU climate and energy policy but the role of interest groups in climate and energy policy, especially relative to important economic ideas, is relatively under researched. By augmenting and applying the multiple streams approach developed by John Kingdon in the 1980 s and using process-tracing techniques, this thesis contributes a detailed case study of this important instance of European interest representation. It is found that the complex and dynamic political context for the interaction made planning and executing advocacy campaigns challenging for all actors. The debate about the 2030 framework is shown to hinge on the idea of technology-neutrality and its status on the policymaking agenda. A number of policy coalitions are observed {{with a wide range of}} characteristics, some novel. Several attempts at ‘policy entrepreneurship’ by interest groups are recorded but most were disrupted by the confused and fast-changing political situation. It is shown that a combination of spill-over between <b>policy</b> <b>windows,</b> framing and coalition building activity served to push the idea of technology neutrality up the agenda. The multiple streams approach is shown to be broadly applicable to the research context and aims but greater agency over <b>policy</b> <b>windows</b> than originally assumed must be granted to actors and the possibility for successful policy entrepreneurship to yield unintended policy outcomes allowed for.
