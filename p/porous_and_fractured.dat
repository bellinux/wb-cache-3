40|$|Abstract: Air {{pressure}} in coastal unsaturated aquifers fluctuates with sea tides, {{as does the}} groundwater level. Tide-induced air pressure fluctuations in coastal subsurface systems, however, are not well addressed in literature. Significant diurnal air pressure fluctuations are observed below the asphalt pavement in a coastal reclamation area of Hong Kong. A two-dimensional cross-sectional model is built to describe the air-water two-phase flow in the unsaturated zone of the area. TOUGH 2, a general-purpose numerical simulation program for multi-dimensional fluid and heat flows of multiphase, multicomponent fluid mixtures in <b>porous</b> <b>and</b> <b>fracture</b> media, is used to obtain the numerical solutions. The numerical simulation reveals that the significant air pressure fluctuation results {{from a combination of}} various factors such as asphalt pavement of extremely low permeability, soil structures of the reclamation area, and rainfall intensity during spring tides. Numerical simulation also reveals that the air pressure is approximately proportional to the tidal rate. A great amplitude of the sea level fluctuation will not necessarily lead to high air pressure, if the sea level changes slowly. Coastal unsaturated zones inhale and exhale as the tidal level falls and rises. The paper goes on to discuss various engineering and environmental implications of air pressure fluctuations in coastal aquifers...|$|R

Both numerical and analytical models are used in this study. General non-Darcy flow is described using the Forchheimer equation, implemented in a three-dimensional, multiphase flow reservoir simulator. The non-Darcy flow through a fractured reservoir is handled using a general dual continuum approach, covering commonly used conceptual models, such as double porosity, dual permeability, explicit fracture, etc. Under single-phase flow conditions, an approximate analytical solution, {{as an extension of}} the Warren-Root solution, is discussed. The objectives of this study are (1) to obtain insights into the effect of non-Darcy flow on transient pressure behavior through <b>porous</b> <b>and</b> <b>fractured</b> reservoirs and (2) to provide type curves for well test analyses of non-Darcy flow wells. The type curves generated include various types of drawdown, injection, and buildup tests with non-Darcy flow occurring in <b>porous</b> <b>and</b> <b>fractured</b> reservoirs. In addition, non-Darcy flow into partially penetrating wells is also considered. The transient-pressure type curves for flow in fractured reservoirs are based on the double-porosity model.

The environmental concerns due to chemical composition of geothermal waste waters had urged the industry to dispose it underground.

Several analytical and numerical studies are available where the effect of fractures on the movement of thermal front are discussed. It was shown that when the conduction heat transfer from matrix to fracture dominates, retardation of the thermal front movement will be observed.
