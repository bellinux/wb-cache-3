5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined {{the location of}} the <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E
5|$|Late LTP (L-LTP) is {{the natural}} {{extension}} of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis,</b> L-LTP requires gene transcription and <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis,</b> while the second depends upon both gene transcription and <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis.</b> These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> provides a mechanism for specificity, global <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis,</b> synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the local}} <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> {{hypothesis}} gained significant support, there was general {{agreement that the}} <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> underlying L-LTP occurred in the cell body. Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> could occur in the cell body without compromising LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in the cell body but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.|$|E

5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> then takes place. The rate of <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{is a key}} {{complex in}} {{cellular}} RNA quality control. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes possess highly active RNA surveillance systems that recognise unprocessed and mis-processed RNA-protein complexes (such as ribosomes) prior to their exit from the nucleus. It is presumed that this system prevents aberrant complexes from interfering with important cellular processes such as <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} only a few {{proteins}} synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is thought that they contribute to the increase in dendritic spine number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression. The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP. Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of synaptotagmin and an increase in synaptic vesicle number, suggesting that L-LTP induces <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well. As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis,</b> there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell. This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.|$|E

Most cellular functions need energy {{in order to}} be carried out: <b>synthesis</b> of <b>proteins,</b> <b>synthesis</b> of membranes, movement of the cell, cellular division, transport of various solutes etc. ATP is the molecule that carries energy to the place where the energy is needed. When ATP breaks into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate (Pi), the breakdown of the last covalent link of phosphate (a simple -PO4) liberates energy that is used in reactions where it is needed.|$|R
5|$|The {{synaptic}} tag hypothesis {{may also}} account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (see Properties) is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas {{one might expect}} only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), both synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis,</b> then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.|$|E
5|$|Transfer RNA (tRNA) {{is a small}} RNA {{chain of}} about 80 {{nucleotides}} that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> during translation.

5|$|It does so by {{preventing}} {{the formation of}} the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl transferase activity), close to the binding sites of chloramphenicol, lincomycin, and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other <b>protein</b> <b>synthesis</b> inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent.|$|E
