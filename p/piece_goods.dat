Spice cultivation on Penang Island became the chief means of covering administrative costs in Penang. The development of the spice economy drove the movement of Chinese settlers to Penang Island, which was actively encouraged by the British.|$|E

500|$|The port of Nagapattinam {{is in the}} Bay of Bengal in {{the mouth}} of river Kuduvayyar. Nagapattinam was the most {{important}} port of the Chola empire. All the eastern naval expeditions of Rajendra Chola I (1012–44 CE) were through the port. The port was widely used by the Dutch, Portuguese and British as one of the major ports of the Coramandel Coast for trading purposes. Most of the principal exports to Sri Lanka from the port during the British period were rice, <b>piece</b> <b>goods,</b> livestock, cigars, tobacco and hides. The trade of Nagapattinam was mostly with Sri Lanka, Straits Settlements, Burma and to a small extent to the United Kingdom and Spain. The port also served passenger traffic to Singapore, but this was susepended due to a fire accident. The modern day port has a commercial port complex and a dockyard that are protected by a river mouth sand bar facing the port. The port handles only a limited amount of edible oil imports. The Nagapttinam lighthouse is the first conventional [...] lighthouse tower, built inside the port premises by the British in 1869. The port and the lighthouse are maintained by the Tamil Nadu Maritime Board under the Government of India.|$|E

2500|$|At {{odds with}} his {{suspicious}} Antwerp backers, Bolts found himself declared bankrupt in mid-1782. Although he possessed no capital himself, {{he was able}} to trade on his reputation as an expert in the Eastern trade to launch a new share company in 1783, the Triestine Society, which in September sent the Cobenzell on a commercial voyage to the Malabar Coast by way of Marseilles, where she took in the principal part of her cargo, and the Cape of Good Hope. At Bombay, a second ship was purchased, called the Count de Belgiojoso. The captain of the Cobenzell, John Joseph Bauer, transferred to the Belgiojoso, and sailed on to China. It was reported from Trieste on 22 February 1786 that [...] "The Comte Cobenzel East Indiaman arrived in this port the 18th inst. with a rich cargo" [...] of saltpetre, tea, cassia, camphire, coffee, pepper and other merchandise, having left Canton 23 January 1785. The Belgioioso under Bauer went from Canton to New York, where she arrived in June 1786. The ship's arrival from New York at Dover, England, was reported in The Daily Universal Register of 15 September, and the same newspaper published an extract of a letter from Ostend dated 24 September that said: [...] "The Count de Belgioioso, on account of the East India Company, is arrived here from Bengal and China, her cargo consists chiefly of <b>piece</b> <b>goods,</b> with only a few chests of the finest teas, and one of spices, from Ceylon, at which island they touched on their way home".|$|E

The Khalifate of Kowfat at present buys its whole supply of cotton <b>piece</b> <b>goods</b> in our market and pays cash. The Shriek, who is a man of enlightenment, has {{consistently}} upheld the principles of Free Trade. Not only are our exports of cotton <b>piece</b> <b>goods,</b> bibles, rum, and beads constantly increasing, but they are more than offset by our importation from Kowfat of ivory, rubber, gold, and oil. In short, we have never seen the principles of Free Trade better illustrated. The Shriek, it is now reported, refuses to wear the braces presented to him by our envoy at the time of his coronation five years ago. He is said to have thrown them into the mud. But we have no reason to suppose that this is meant as a blow at our prestige. It may be that after five years of use the little pulleys of the braces no longer work properly. We have ourselves in our personal life known instances of this, and can speak of the sense of irritation occasioned. Even we have thrown on the floor ours. And in any case, as we have often reminded our readers, what is prestige? If any one wants to hit us, let him hit us right there. We regard a blow at our trade as far more deadly than a blow at our prestige.|$|E
