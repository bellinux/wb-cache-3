60|$|Yes, Lucy, very dangerous. Lucy, {{before she}} went to bed that night, had owned to herself that they were so; and lying there with sleepless eyes and a moist pillow, she was driven to confess that the label would in truth be now too late, that the caution had come to her after the poison had been swallowed. Was there any antidote? That was all that was left for her to consider. But, nevertheless, on the {{following}} morning she could appear quite at her ease. And when Mark had left the house after breakfast, she could still joke with Fanny as to Lady Lufton's <b>poisoned</b> <b>cupboard.</b>|$|R

5000|$|MTV {{supported}} a contest {{and a special}} program entitled mtvTREATMENT in which the winner was chosen to direct the video for [...] "Alone I Break." [...] It {{was shot in the}} form of a reality TV show where Jonathan Davis kills members of the band. The video starts with the band performing in the downstairs foyer. Part way through the song, Jonathan turns towards Munky and acts aggressively towards him. This then leads to a short scuffle between the two, as Fieldy proceeds to break up the fight. Jonathan then storms out, and is seen throwing things around in his room, apparently enraged. Meanwhile, Munky takes a bath but soon falls asleep, as Jonathan finds a lamp nearby and pushes it into the tub, instantly electrocuting and killing Munky. Head is then seen looking around as the lights flicker on and off, implying that it this is happening while Munky is being killed. He then proceeds to the balcony as he speaks to someone on his cell phone, unaware that Jonathan is approaching. He pushes Head off the ledge, killing him. He then tosses his cell phone over as well. Later, David is sleeping with two women, as Jonathan creeps in with a pillow, suffocating him then quietly leaving. He moves downstairs where Fieldy is cooking Spaghetti Bolognaise in the kitchen. Jonathan takes out a bottle of rat <b>poison</b> from a <b>cupboard</b> and waits. Fieldy goes into the pantry to fetch some more ingredients, as Jonathan pours rat poison in the sauce. Fieldy serves himself, takes one bite, then dies. Jonathan, apparently pleased with himself, walks outside and proceeds toward the cameraman, as he falls to the floor. This implies that Jonathan killed him, too. All of this takes place throughout the night, implied by the band performing in the evening, Munky and Head dying at night, David being killed in the early hours of the morning, and Fieldy dying at the break of dawn. Jonathan also leaves and kills the cameraman in the morning.|$|R

5000|$|Distaste {{for sexual}} impropriety long kept Restoration comedy not only {{off the stage}} but also locked in a {{critical}} <b>poison</b> <b>cupboard.</b> Victorian critics like William Hazlitt, although valuing the linguistic energy and [...] "strength" [...] of the canonical writers Etherege, Wycherley, and Congreve, always {{found it necessary to}} temper aesthetic praise with heavy moral condemnation. Aphra Behn received the condemnation without the praise, since outspoken sex comedy was considered particularly offensive coming from a woman author. At the turn of the 20th century, an embattled minority of academic Restoration comedy enthusiasts began to appear, for example the important editor Montague Summers, whose work ensured that the plays of Aphra Behn remained in print.|$|E
5000|$|... "These {{are very}} private, uncensored {{experiences}} and sentiments of a Red Army Officer as an occupier of Germany. His {{account of the}} end of World War II in Germany and the German society that underwent its post-war crisis is also highly instructive. Apart from offering a different view on the spirit and the moral condition of the Red Army which was often represented in an exaggeratedly glorifying manner in the Soviet media, the diary contradicts to the commonly held belief that explains the military success of the Red Army by systematic repressions. Furthermore, the diary depicts the growing self-confidence of the front soldiers Stalin was so afraid of. Gelfand represents a certain group among the conquerors, namely the young officers who were sure that their front experience gave them the right to laugh at a dull instructor, to avert denunciation, to speak plainly to a high-ranged party functionary or to go their own way in occupied Germany. Gelfand’s experience with women also proves the existence of love relations between masculine conquerors and feminine conquered in 1945-46. The diary illustrates that German women searched contact to Soviet soldiers on their part, too, and that not only for material matters or in need of protection." [...] Dr. Elke Scherstjanoi, Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ), Munich-Berlin [...] "A Diary of a Soviet Soldier—it is the description of reality that makes it so impressive, a reality that had been disclaimed {{for a long time and}} of everyday life that had never been depicted. Despite all atrocities it is a very interesting book to read, though it appeared many years after it had been written. It is most gratifying that this diary eventually became available after 60 years, even if only in German yet, because this is a view of the events that was missing. This diary is the first book that presents Soviet vanquishers as flesh and blood people and helps to understand the inner world of Soviet soldiers. It will be difficult for Putin and his post-soviet guards to lock up this diary into the <b>poison</b> <b>cupboard</b> for anti-Russian propaganda." [...] Per Landin, Dagens Nyheter, Sweden [...] "Gelfand’s “German Diary 1945-1946” is a remarkable book in every sense. It is the unique eye-witness account of the liberation of Poland and East Germany by the Red Army. The only facts that Soviet soldiers were not allowed for security’s sake to keep a diary and that the Ukrainian lieutenant Gelfand had the courage to violate this prohibition is a very good reason to be thankful to the author. Although imperfect in certain respects, this diary surely refutes the assertion of numerous historical revisionists trying to represent the great victory of mankind over Hitler as a barbarian aggression of Stalin’s Henchmen against Western civilisation." [...] Stefan Lindgren, Flamman, Sweden [...] "Among the many eye-witness accounts {{of the end of}} World War 2 in Germany to emerge in the anniversary year of 2005 was the diary of a young Red Army lieutenant who participated in the capture of Berlin and remained in that city until September 1946. Vladimir Gelfand’s Deutschland-Tagebuch was the subject of widespread media interest with commentators generally agreed that his account forces a review of existing German narratives of the fall of Berlin and the perceived relationship of the Soviet occupiers to the German population at this time." [...] Anne Boden, Trinity College Dublin, Bradford Conference on Contemporary German Literature [...] "The Young Lieutenant’s Diary. This is a review of Vladimir Gelfand’s Deutschland-Tagebuch 1945-1946 which presents a unique insight both into the Red Army during the decisive battles for Berlin and into the German society of the period immediately following liberation. Gelfand, a Lieutenant of Jewish-Ukrainian origin, served from May 1945 until his demobilization in September 1946 at various locations around Berlin. His diary also permits a very intimate view into his personal actions, his feelings and his reflections." [...] Wolfram Adolphi, UTOPIE kreativ, Rosa Luxemburg Foundation ...|$|E
