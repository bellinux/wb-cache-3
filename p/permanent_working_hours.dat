However, with the aging of the population there is an increasing threat to current welfare levels. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the possibilities of a rise in wealth through a change in (the trend of) <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> For the analysis we have created a unique data base which includes workers that have occupied the same job in the period 2003 - 2005. This means we abstain from {{dynamics in}} jobs, (i. e. job finders, job switchers, job losers), which can partly be attributed to changes in participation. Instead we focus completely at <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> of a given job. The analysis is comprised of two parts, first we analyse factors determine the actual number of hours worked for both female and male occupied jobs. Second, we analyse the dynamics in <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> of a given job using a bivariate probit estimation with selection. This model takes into account what factors determine if a person does or does not change <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and subsequently examines which factors determine whether this change is an increase or a decrease in <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> Women more frequently change their <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> than men and both rather decrease than increase their <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> Changes in work situation and household situation are important determinants of changes in <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> for women also changes in residential context play a role.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine whether there is any {{connection}} between <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> desired <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and the worker ́s health. The study also aims to investigate if there are any differences over time. Earlier studies have shown that individuals need a balance in their life between worked hours and free time. This balance seems to be important for employees if they want to lead and remain a healthy lifestyle. If the employed doesn’t feel satisfied with his or her <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> then the balance can get disrupted which could lead to a number of health problems. There are a lot of studies that aim to explain the relationship between <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and health. There is a missing area which examines the relation between desired <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and the worker`s health. Therefore, this topic is interesting to study more closely. The study is conducted using data from the Swedish survey of living condition panel (ULF). The panels consist of people between 16 to 84 years old. The study started in 1975. Since 1979 the study has been conducted at 8 yearly intervals. The data is administrated by Statistic Sweden (SCB). Three hypotheses have derived from previous research 1; employees who are satisfied with their work hours are least fatigued 2; the relation between <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and desired <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> has bigger effects on women than men. 3; women who are satisfied with their <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> are less fatigued over time. The results showed that people who are working fulltime or part time with a desire to work less are feeling most fatigued.

Generally unskilled, these peasants received low wages, were employed in unsafe working environments, and worked up to fifteen hours a day. Although some workers still had a paternalistic relationship with their employer, factory employers were more present and active than the noble landowners that previously had ownership of the serfs. Under serfdom, peasants had little, if any, contact with their landowner. In the new urban setting, however, factory employers often used their absolute authority in abusive and arbitrary manners.

40|$|Background: Long <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> have {{negative}} effects on employee health and safety in terms of performance, fatigue, psychological and physiological health, safety, and the work-life balance. As a result of globalization, {{it has become increasingly}} common internationally for people to work long hours. Many researchers have investigated the relationships among <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> work stress, and job satisfaction in Western countries, but little research has been conducted in the Chinese community to determine the relationships between <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and work stress, especially in different job satisfaction situations. The job nature of textile and clothing merchandising staff in Hong Kong is different from that in Western countries. The large time difference between Hong Kong and its two major markets, Europe and the United States, may result in longer <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> The influence of these long <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> on the lives of staff members may thus be different from that in Western industries. Purpose: The main objective of this project is to investigate the influence of <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> on the work stress of Hong Kong textile and clothing merchandising staff with the mediation of job satisfaction. Methodology: Data from 180 merchandising staff members have been collected by questionnaire for multiple regression analysis Findings: The results suggest that people who report longer <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> generally suffer from higher levels of work stress. Although the influence of long <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> on work stress is weaker in high job satisfaction situations than it is in low job satisfaction situations, it is still statistically significant.
