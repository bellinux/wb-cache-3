40|$|Have made {{design a}} {{monitoring}} system using a closed car park area-based infrared sensors {{and use of}} barcode AT 89 S 51 microcontroller as a safety system. The design {{of this can be}} exploited for the managers of car parks to ease service and minimize the occurrence of car theft. It has worked before and after the infrared sensor is blocked. This circuit works on two conditions namely high and low. The output from IC 7408 is then used as inputs logic high or low on the microcontroller. Microcontroller sends data to a computer via serial communication. Data is sent in accordance with the microcontroller input port. On the computer displays the location of car parking is available in green and red filled in accordance with data sent from the microcontroller. Barcode is used as a <b>parking</b> <b>card,</b> reading a barcode using a barcode scanner which is then connected directly to the computer. The system has been successfully realized and can show the location of which still lies empty parking lot or have used and know the number of cars being parked. View the parking map on the computer in accordance with the location of a parked car in the parking building...|$|E

50|$|Muni Meter is {{the name}} used by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) for its pay and display {{centralized}} parking meter system. The Muni Meter system was introduced broadly in 2009, following a period of experimentation that began in 1999. Muni Meters are located on streets adjacent {{to a group of}} parking spots, with no designated striping that separates spots. A driver parks their car, pays at the Muni Meter (using coins, credit <b>cards,</b> or prepaid <b>parking</b> <b>cards),</b> and takes a receipt provided by the Meter. They then display that receipt on their vehicle's dashboard. The system reduces the number of individual meter devices required, increases the number of parking spots available (by allowing as many cars to park as can fit) and, some argue, reduces losses due to unused time left on meters (which may then be reused by subsequent parkers).|$|R

50|$|Magstripes come in {{two main}} varieties: high-coercivity (HiCo) at 4000 Oe and low-coercivity (LoCo) at 300 Oe, {{but it is not}} {{infrequent}} to have intermediate values at 2750 Oe. High-coercivity magstripes require higher amount of magnetic energy to encode, and therefore are harder to erase. HiCo stripes are appropriate for cards that are frequently used, such as a credit card. Other card uses include time and attendance tracking, access control, library cards, employee ID cards and gift cards. Low-coercivity magstripes require a lower amount of magnetic energy to record, and hence the card writers are much cheaper than machines which are capable of recording high-coercivity magstripes. However, LoCo cards are much easier to erase and have a shorter lifespan. Typical LoCo applications include hotel room keys, time and attendance tracking, bus/transit tickets and season passes for theme <b>parks.</b> A <b>card</b> reader can read either type of magstripe, and a high-coercivity card writer may write both high and low-coercivity cards (most have two settings, but writing a LoCo card in HiCo may sometimes work), while a low-coercivity card writer may write only low-coercivity cards.|$|R
