The phone came {{in a variety of}} colors, including pink, turquoise, and cream. When one of Mattel's Barbie doll outfits included a Princess phone as an accessory, a fashion trend was born. By 1963, many Baby Boomers had reached driver's license age and, for the first time, middle-class families splurged on cars for their offspring.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, AT&T ended {{production}} of the <b>Princess</b> <b>telephone.</b> It continues to lease the Signature Princess model. Due to its removal from production, and its attractive design, the Princess has become a collectible phone. Princess telephones in pink, turquoise, and black are among the rarest colors of the phones and most valuable.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Princess</b> <b>telephone</b> was {{introduced}} by the Bell System in 1959. It was a compact telephone designed for convenient use in the bedroom, and contained a light-up dial {{for use as a}} night-light. It was commonly advertised with the slogan [...] "It's little...It's lovely...It lights", which was suggested by Robert Karl Lethin, an AT&T employee.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid 1970s, AT&T {{introduced}} modular connectors for {{the line}} cord and handset cords, requiring the [...] RJ11 standard home telephone jack. Most customers who had <b>Princess</b> <b>telephones</b> {{were converted to}} modular jacks.|$|R
50|$|Some {{telephones}} {{such as the}} Western Electric <b>Princess</b> and Trimline <b>telephone</b> models {{require additional}} power (~6 V AC) for operation of the incandescent dial light. This power is delivered to the telephone set from a transformer by the second wire pair (pins 2 and 5) of the 6P4C connector.|$|R

5000|$|Residential {{telephone}} {{production was}} shifted back to North America in 1993 when AT&T opened established a subsidiary in Mexico {{and built a}} telephone plant. As a result, [...] "WE" [...] markings on modular telephone plugs were replaced with [...] "HHE" [...] or [...] "ECI", marking the end of any Western Electric branding whatsoever on any part of an AT&T telephone. In 1994, AT&T discontinued production of the <b>Princess</b> <b>telephone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Upon {{arriving}} {{back in the}} United States in 1955, Diffrient joined Dreyfuss Associates in their Pasadena offices, {{and spent the next}} few decades revolutionizing American industrial design through his development of interiors and corporate identity for American Airlines planes, the landmark <b>Princess</b> <b>telephone,</b> the Polaroid SX-70 camera, and tractor seats for John Deere. In 1980 after 25 years with Henry Dreyfuss Associates, Diffrient left to start his own independent practice, establishing a design studio in Ridgefield, Connecticut which he shared with his wife, tapestry artist Helena Hernmarck.|$|E
50|$|In the powered version, Pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) {{may carry}} low voltage AC or DC power. While {{the phone line}} itself (tip and ring) {{supplies}} enough power for most telephone terminals, old telephone terminals with incandescent lights in them (such as the classic Western Electric <b>Princess</b> and Trimline <b>telephones)</b> need more power than the phone line can supply. Typically, the power on Pins 2 and 5 comes from a transformer plugged into a wall near one jack, supplying power {{to all of the}} jacks in the house. Trimline and Princess phone dial lights are rated at 6.3 volts and the transformer output is typically around 5 volts, providing a long service life for the incandescent lamps.|$|R
5000|$|A 1960s nostalgia-themed {{video for}} the Carpenters' [...] "Beechwood 4-5789" [...] was shot on A&M's Chaplin Stage. The video's setting is divided between a soda shop where couples dance and Karen sings, {{and a young}} woman's bedroom (implied {{to be that of}} Karen's character) where Karen sings seated in front of a dresser. Karen is then shown seated and singing {{alongside}} Richard playing the keyboard; the footage is superimposed onto the dresser in the bedroom, making the duo appear miniature, especially alongside a pink <b>Princess</b> <b>telephone.</b> The video ends with Richard and Karen singing along with the band performing in the shop in front of the couples dancing on seats.|$|E
50|$|After the {{introduction}} of the popular <b>Princess</b> <b>telephone</b> line, in 1959 and the early 1960s, the design motivation for the Trimline series was to create an alternative design that was stylish and easier to use than a traditional telephone. This was accomplished by moving the dial from the telephone's base to the underside of the handset, between the earpiece and mouthpiece. The same concept was later used for cellular telephone and cordless telephone models. To miniaturize the rotary dial sufficiently to fit in the Trimline handset, the designers invented an unusual moving fingerstop. Like in the Princess line, the dial was lit when the handset was removed from the base. The Trimline {{was also one of the}} first phones to use the predecessor of the now-ubiquitous RJ11 modular phone plug and jack.|$|E
