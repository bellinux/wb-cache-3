This highway to the northern Hismá falls, I have said, into the Mínat el-Ayánát, a <b>portlet</b> useful to Sambúks: its sickle-shaped natural breakwater, curving from west to south, resembles that of Sinaitic Marsá el-Ginái, and those which are so common in Western Iceland. On February 22nd, a very devious path, narrow and rocky, lasting for one hour, led them, about noon, to the northern Jebel el-Kibrít. The distance from El-Muwaylah is about sixty-six miles; and the country west of a line drawn from Aynúnah to Makná was, before this march, utterly unknown to us, consequently to all the civilized world.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Portlet</b> {{container}} runs portlets {{and provides}} them with the required runtime environment. A <b>portlet</b> container contains portlets and manages their life cycles. It also provides persistent storage mechanisms for the <b>portlet</b> preferences. A <b>portlet</b> container receives requests from the portal to execute requests on the portlets hosted by it. A <b>portlet</b> container is not responsible for aggregating the content produced by the portlets; the portal itself handles aggregation. A portal and a <b>portlet</b> container can be built together as a single component of an application suite or as two separate components of a portal application.|$|E

50|$|JSR168 Standards emerged around 2001. Java Specification Request (JSR) 168 {{standards}} {{allow the}} interoperability of <b>portlets</b> across different portal platforms. These standards allow portal developers, administrators and consumers to integrate standards-based portals and <b>portlets</b> across {{a variety of}} vendor solutions.|$|R
50|$|Portlets produce {{fragments}} of markup (HTML, XHTML, WML) code that are aggregated into a portal. Typically, following the desktop metaphor, a portal page is displayed {{as a collection}} of non-overlapping <b>portlet</b> windows, where each <b>portlet</b> window displays a <b>portlet.</b> Hence a <b>portlet</b> (or collection of portlets) resembles a web-based application that is hosted in a portal.|$|E

5000|$|Portal {{technology}} {{defines a}} complete event model covering reads and updates. A {{request for an}} aggregate page on a portal is translated into individual read operations on all the portlets that form the page ("" [...] operations on local, JSR 168 portlets or [...] "" [...] operations on remote, WSRP portlets). If a submit button is pressed on any <b>portlet</b> on a portal page, it is translated into an update operation on that <b>portlet</b> alone ( [...] on a local <b>portlet</b> or [...] on a remote, WSRP <b>portlet).</b> The update is then immediately followed by a read on all portlets on the page.|$|E

5000|$|The WSRP {{specification}} {{does not}} make any statements as to implementation. Java's <b>portlet</b> specification, JSR 168, and WSRP are not competing technologies. JSR 168 {{may be used to}} define a <b>portlet,</b> and WSRP may be used to define a portlet's operations to remote containers. JSR 168 portlets and WSRP may be used together to define a <b>portlet</b> and to provide remote operations. Similarly, [...]NET portlets may be created for use with WSRP. Interoperability between JSR 168 and [...]NET WSRP implementations has been demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|JSR 168 i.e. JavaTM <b>Portlet</b> Specification {{request is}} {{basically}} a standard to determine the development of Java portal components.

By {{adopting}} a general three-tiered architecture based on common standards for <b>portlets</b> and Grid Web services, we can deliver numerous capabilities to science gateways from our diverse constituent efforts. In this paper, we discuss our support for standards-based Grid <b>portlets</b> using the Velocity development environment. Our Grid <b>portlets</b> are based on abstraction layers provided by the Java CoG kit, which hide the differences of different Grid toolkits. Sophisticated services are decoupled from the portal container using Web service strategies.
