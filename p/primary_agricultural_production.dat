50|$|Its {{economy is}} based in agriculture, in which rural {{population}} produces agricultural commodities for export to larger markets in Praia, Assomada and Fogo. Small market centers exist in São Lourenço dos Órgãos and Pedra Badejo, which act primary as commodity exchanges where subsistence farmers exchange goods as available with merchants who transport and sell goods in larger markets. The <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>productions</b> include fodder (usually {{in the form of}} maize stalks), bananas, papayas and coconuts. Prior to 1981 the area also produced a substantial percentage of the island's maize, but the arrival of large-scale international food aid, while vastly improving the region’s food security, made producing foodstuffs unprofitable. Maize and legumes are still the region's <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> product, though 97% is consumed by the families that produce it. The mixture of nitrogen fixing and nitrogen consuming crops reduces the need for chemical fertilizers, allowing small farmers to remain solvent despite little cash income.|$|R

40|$|A {{database}} of global <b>agricultural</b> <b>primary</b> <b>production</b> has been constructed {{and used to}} estimate its energy content.

However, by using residues and bioorganic waste, it was found that biofuel production could theoretically replace one fourth of the global consumption of fossil fuels for transport.

40|$|Processing of {{meat and}} crops {{accounts}} for {{a large share of}} manufacturing in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The paper assesses empirically the impact of hypothesized productivity change in agro-food processing on growth, trade, employment, and input and output prices in SSA, using a 13 commodity, 7 region version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) applied general equilibrium model with a 1995 database. Results are compared to impacts of factor-neutral and biased technical change in <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> [...] grains, non-grain crops, and livestock [...] overall and with respect to the agro-food sector itself. A given percentage increase in total factor productivity in <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> is shown by every criterion to have much greater favorable impacts than the same increase in any form of technical change in processing, even when consideration is given only to the welfare of people in the agro-food processing sector itself. Technological change in the non-grain high value agricultural sectors such as horticulture and livestock are second-best, but still powerful promoters of increased welfare. However, the paper is not able to assess the costs or likelihood of securing different kinds of technical change, and therefore comparisons are limited to the benefit side.

The increase in the dynamics of the long term property requires a certain amount and structure of operational property and solvency. It depends on the quality of financial resources. Specific conditions of entrepreneurial activities in agricultural production in comparison with other entrepreneurial companies have a concrete impact on the assets and financial situation. Reproduction process of acquiring tangible investments, as well as own inventory production and in-plant services neces-sitate an increased pressure on the available financial resources. Financial competitiveness of inputs in the entrepreneurial environment in connection to costs negatively influences the financial results of these companies.

40|$|Although soil {{fertility}} {{is recognized as}} a <b>primary</b> constraint to <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> in developing countries, use of fertilizer in Sub-Saharan Africa is declining. Smallholder farmers still rely heavily on livestock manure for {{soil fertility}} management. To explore the determinants of soil fertility management practices, including both the use of cattle manure and inorganic fertilizer, data are used from a sample of 3, 330 geo-referenced farm households across Central and Western Kenya. A bivariate probit model is applied to jointly examine {{the use of the}} two technologies. Particular attention is given to measures of location related to market access and agroclimate, which in the adoption literature have typically been addressed using crude proxies. To avoid such proxies, GIS-derived variables are integrated into the household decision model. Their use also allows the spatial prediction of uptake based on parameter estimates. The results show clearly the derived-demand nature of soil fertility services, based on markets for farm outputs. They also illustrate that supply of manure for soil fertility amendments is conditioned by demand for livestock products, especially milk. The integration of GIS-derived variables is shown to better estimate the effects of location than the usual measures employed, and offers scope to wider use in technology adoption research.

40|$|Agriculture {{has been}} always the {{important}} sector of national economy which {{as a part}} of the agri-food complex using the international agrarian market en-sures necessary demands not only in the CR but also abroad through its offer of food raw-material products and foodstuffs. Results of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production,</b> particularly plant production, are heavily affected by changes in weather conditions which markedly influenced results of our agriculture particularly in the recent years. In 2000 to 2003, a relatively unfavourable development was noticed in the sector of agriculture caused particularly by rainy weather and two waves of floods in 2002 and subsequent long-term drought for most of the growing season in 2003. Unfavourable conditions affecting particularly plant production, the continuing decrease in prices of agricultural products and the decrease in the stock of farm animals also negatively influenced animal production and thus also the total <b>production</b> of <b>agricultural</b> products and the sector of agriculture as a whole.
