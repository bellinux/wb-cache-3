5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{identity of}} enzymes was still {{unknown in the}} early 1900s. Many scientists observed that enzymatic activity was associated with proteins, but others (such as Nobel laureate Richard Willstätter) argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins <b>per</b> <b>se</b> were incapable of catalysis. In 1926, James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was a pure protein and crystallized it; he did likewise for the enzyme catalase in 1937.

5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an embryo <b>per</b> <b>se</b> would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which the embryo were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% of the size of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the embryo was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E

It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him.

40|$|Abstract Background Sedentary {{behaviour}} {{has been}} linked with adverse health outcomes in young people; however, the nature and context of being sedentary is poorly understood. Accurate quantification and description of sedentary behaviour using population-level data is required. The aim {{of this research was}} to describe sedentary behaviour among New Zealand (NZ) youth and examine whether sedentary behaviour differs by Body Mass Index (BMI) status in this population. Methods A national representative cross-sectional survey of young people aged 5 - 24 years (n = 2, 503) was conducted in 2008 - 2009. Data from this survey, which included subjectively (recall diary; n = 1, 309) and objectively (accelerometry; n = 960) measured sedentary behaviour for participants aged 10 - 18 years were analysed using survey weighted methods. Results Participants self-reported spending on average 521 minutes per day (standard error [SE] 5. 29) in total sedentary behaviour, 181 minutes <b>per</b> day (<b>SE</b> 3. 91) in screen-based sedentary activities (e. g., television and video games), and 340 minutes <b>per</b> day (<b>SE</b> 5. 22) in other non-screen sedentary behaviours (e. g., school, passive transport and self-care). Accelerometer-measured total sedentary behaviour was on average 420 minutes <b>per</b> day (<b>SE</b> 4. 26), or 53 % (SE 0. 42 %) of monitored time. There were no statistically significant differences in time spent in sedentary behaviour among overweight, obese and healthy/underweight young people. Conclusions Both subjective and objective methods indicate that NZ youth spend much of their waking time being sedentary. No relationships were found between sedentary behaviour and BMI status. These findings extend previous research by describing engagement in specific sedentary activities, as well as quantifying the behaviour using an objective method. Differences in what aspects of sedentary behaviour the two methods are capturing are discussed. This research highlights the potential for future interventions to target specific sedentary behaviours or demographic groups. </p...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a <b>per</b> <b>se</b> rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E

40|$|Fabry {{disease is}} an X-linked {{lysosomal}} storage disorder caused by α-galactosidase A deficiency leading to renal, cardiac, cerebrovascular disease and premature death. Treatment with α-galactosidase A (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT) stabilises disease in some patients, but long term effectiveness is unclear. Renal, cardiac, and cerebral outcomes were prospectively studied in {{males and females}} with Fabry disease treated with ERT. Additionally, the occurrence of major cardiac events, stroke, end-stage renal disease and death was compared to a natural history (NH) cohort meeting treatment criteria. Of 75 patients on ERT (median treatment duration 5. 2 years, range 0. 05 - 11. 0), prospective follow-up was available for 57 adult patients (30 males) and 6 adolescents. Renal function declined in males (- 3. 4 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 <b>per</b> year, <b>SE</b> 0. 2; p[*] <[*] 0. 001) despite ERT, but followed the normal course in females (- 0. 8 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 <b>per</b> year, <b>SE</b> 0. 3; p[*]=[*] 0. 001). Cardiac mass increased during ERT in males (+ 1. 2 gram/m 2. 7, SE 0. 3; p[*] <[*] 0. 001), but remained stable in females (- 0. 3 gram/m 2. 7 <b>per</b> year, <b>SE</b> 0. 4; p[*]=[*] 0. 52). ERT did not prevent the occurrence of cerebral white matter lesions. Comparison of ERT treated to untreated patients revealed that the odds to develop a first complication increased with age (OR 1. 05 (95 % CI: 1. 0 - 1. 1) per year, p[*]=[*] 0. 012). For development of a first or second complication the odds declined with longer treatment duration (OR 0. 81 (95 % CI: 0. 68 - 0. 96) per year of ERT, p[*]=[*] 0. 015;OR 0. 52 (0. 31 - 0. 88), p[*]=[*] 0. 014 respectively).

40|$|Unusually high {{flows in}} the Columbia River in 2011 raised total {{dissolved}} gas (TDG) {{levels in the}} river above the 120 percent legal limit imposed to prevent harmful impacts to aquatic organisms.

In-river (IR) migrating juvenile yearling Chinook released at Bonneville Dam with acoustic tags during periods when TDG exceeded 120 percent received estimated maximum exposures of 134 TDG. Subsequent daily survival rates in the lower river and plume were reduced by 0. 06 <b>per</b> day (<b>SE</b> equals 0. 01) and 0. 15 <b>per</b> day (<b>SE</b> equals 0. 05) relative to IR migrant fish released when TDG was less than 120 percent.

River temperature levels and trends in turbidity and disease prevalence between releases of high and low exposure smolts were not consistent with the observed effects on survival rates. We conclude that smolts may suffer from chronic effects of elevated TDG exposure while migrating through the Columbia River and plume. Consideration should be given to measuring these survival losses in an explicit experimental framework that isolates possible confounding factors...|$|R

Corals successfully colonised the {{artificial reef}}, despite the relatively harsh environmental conditions at the site (annual water temperature range 18 - 32 °C, intermittent high turbidity, frequent cyclones, frequent nearby ship movements). Coral settlement to the artificial reef was examined by terracotta tile deployments, and later stages of coral community development were examined by in-situ visual surveys within fixed 25 x 25 cm quadrats on the rock and concrete substrates. Mean coral density on the tiles varied from 113 ± 17 SE to 909 ± 85 <b>SE</b> <b>per</b> m 2 over five deployments, whereas mean coral density in the quadrats was only 6. 0 ± 1. 0 <b>SE</b> <b>per</b> m 2 at eight months post construction, increasing to 24. 0 ± 2. 1 <b>SE</b> <b>per</b> m 2 at 62 months post construction.
