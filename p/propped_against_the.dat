500|$|Carter, however, also {{discovered}} 2 separate coffins in the burial chamber. The beautifully carved sarcophagus of Hatshepsut [...] "was discovered open {{with no sign}} of a body, and with the lid lying discarded on the floor;" [...] it is now housed in the Cairo Museum along with a matching yellow quartzite canopic chest. A second sarcophagus, was found lying on its side with its almost undamaged lid <b>propped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall nearby; it was eventually presented to Theodore M. Davis, the excavation's financial sponsor as a gesture of appreciation for his generous financial support. Davis would, in turn, present it to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The second quartzite sarcophagus had originally been engraved with the name of [...] "the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare Hatshepsut." [...] However, when the sarcophagus was complete, Hatshepsut decided to commission an entirely new sarcophagus for herself while she donated the existing finished sarcophagus to her father, Thutmose I. The stonemasons then attempted to erase the original carvings by restoring the surface of the quartzite so that it could be re-carved with the name and titles of Tuthmose I instead. This quartzite sarcophagus measures 7 feet long by 3 feet wide with walls 5 inches thick and bears a dedication text which records Hatshepsut's generosity towards her father: ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} this time that Chabrias gave his most famous command. With {{scarcely}} [...] separating the two armies, Agesilaus was expecting the Theban and Athenian forces to charge at any moment. Instead, Chabrias ordered his men to stand at ease. In unison, his mercenary hoplites immediately assumed the resting posture—with the spear remaining pointing upwards instead of towards the enemy, and the shield <b>propped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> left knee instead of being hoisted at the shoulders. Gorgidas, on seeing this, also commanded the Sacred Band to follow suit, which they did with the same military drill precision and confidence.|$|E
2500|$|Page became WCW World Heavyweight Champion in April 1999, at Spring Stampede when he {{defeated}} Sting, Hogan, and Ric Flair for {{the title}} in a Four Way Dance with [...] "Macho Man" [...] Randy Savage as Special Guest Referee. Page pinned Flair after giving Flair the Diamond Cutter. Page began to have a change in attitude, fans quietly began to start booing Page and he quietly turned heel. During the match, Page knocked Goldberg out with brass knuckles and repeatedly struck his leg with a steel chair as it was <b>propped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ring stairs, then taunted the fans by saying [...] "boo me now" [...] repeatedly. He only stopped when Kevin Nash, an ally of Hogan's who was angry at Page for (kayfabe) injuring Hogan's knee during the match at Spring Stampede, came back from injury and chased him away.|$|E
50|$|In Round 1, Kasiano {{made his}} NRL debut for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs at <b>prop</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Wests Tigers in the 24-14 win at ANZ Stadium. He played 19 games in his debut season {{and picked up}} the Steve Mortimer Medal for the Bulldogs Rookie of the Year.|$|R

The audacity of the maneuver and the discipline of the execution was such that Agesilaus halted the advance. Seeing that his attempts to provoke the Theban and Athenian forces to fight on lower ground were unsuccessful, Agesilaus eventually thought it wiser to withdraw his forces back to Thespiae.|$|E
2500|$|Photographing at Art Basel and Art Basel Miami Beach fairs, the Museum of Modern Art, Christie's {{and various}} galleries, Lawler later {{presented}} a behind-the-scenes view of art: the hoisting of a Richard Serra sculpture attended by uniformed handlers; white-gloved hands carefully transporting a Gerhard Richter painting; Maurizio Cattelan's giant Picasso head swathed in plastic {{sitting on the}} floor behind its disconnected body; another Richter painting lying on its side <b>propped</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, its public exposure at MoMA at an end; a Damien Hirst spin-painting glimpsed through a closet door. Lawler titled her 2004 survey show at Museum für Gegenwartskunst in Basel [...] "Louise Lawler and Others" [...] in acknowledgement of the artists whose artworks she photographs. Lawler created Not the way you remembered (Venice) for the exhibition [...] "Sequence One: Painting and Sculpture from the François Pinault Collection (2006–07)"; rather than contributing discrete artworks, these photographs were taken of the exhibition’s early installation process in Venice, depicting works of art in their shipping crates, besides pieces of foam or bubble wrap.|$|E

50|$|The birds {{find food}} by {{climbing}} tree bark vertically or by climbing {{along the bottom}} of branches while hanging upside-down. While foraging and feeding, the tail feathers are used as a <b>prop</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tree surface. The parrot feeds on fungi and lichens found on the tree bark, as well as the seeds of the casuarina tree in which it is commonly found. Some birds apparently associate with slow-moving mixed bird flocks.|$|R
50|$|Sio {{made his}} run-on debut at loosehead <b>prop</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> All Blacks during the winning final of the 2015 Rugby Championship, after {{a pair of}} {{impressive}} cameos from <b>the</b> reserves bench <b>against</b> South Africa and Argentina. Sio was named in the Wallabies 31-man squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where he supplanted most-capped Wallabies prop James Slipper as the Wallabies first choice loosehead. He currently is now a regular in the Wallabies starting XV at loosehead prop.|$|R

5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{spends much}} of its time climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a <b>prop</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.|$|R
