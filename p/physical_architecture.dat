50|$|Due to {{difficulties}} handling device failures and adding new stations to a network, token ring {{gained a reputation}} for being unreliable and difficult to upgrade. Bus networks, such as Ethernet, had a more flexible and reliable <b>physical</b> <b>architecture,</b> but Ethernet's access protocol could not absolutely guarantee a maximum time any station would have to wait to access the network, so was thought to be unsuitable for manufacturing automation applications. The Token bus protocol was created to combine the benefits of a physical bus network with the deterministic access protocol of a token ring network.|$|E

5000|$|The {{model is}} layered, {{with the top}} layer being the {{business}} requirements definition stage.

Code generation is handled by providing architecture-specific (either <b>physical</b> <b>architecture</b> of the processor or a virtual machine architecture) file writers. Phoenix provides the [...] compiler backend, which it shares with Visual C++, to handle analysis, optimization and code generation for the x86 architecture. Writers for other architectures must be provided separately.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s DCA, through its NMCS Technical Support Directorate, had {{responsibility}} for the technical support, planning, and system engineering for the four command centers then comprising the NMCS. These were the NMCC and the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (these funded by the USAF), the Alternate National Military Command Center (funded by the Army), and the National Emergency Command Post Afloat (funded by the Navy, and deactivated in the late 1960s). DCA performed the requirements collection and analysis, system engineering, funding estimation, subsystem project plan development, and establishment of the initial <b>physical</b> <b>architecture</b> {{for the expansion of}} the NMCC that was implemented by the Air Force in the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|In the beginning, Parsytec {{had participated}} in the GPMIMD (General Purpose MIMD) project under the {{umbrella}} of the ESPRIT project, both being funded by the European Commission's Directorate for Science.However, after substantial divisions with the other participants, Meiko, Parsys, Inmos and Telmat, as regards the choice of a common <b>physical</b> <b>architecture,</b> Parsytec left the project and announced a T9000-based machine of their own, i.e. the GC. But due to Inmos' problems with the T9000, they were forced to change to the ensemble Motorola MPC 601 CPUs and Inmos T805. This led to Parsytec's [...] "hybrid" [...] systems (e.g. GC/PP) degrading transputers to communication processors whilst the compute work was offloaded to the PowerPCs.|$|E

40|$|Not all quantum {{protocols}} require entanglement to outperform their classical alternatives. The nonclassical correlations {{that lead}} to this quantum advantage are conjectured to be captured by quantum discord. Here we demonstrate that discord can be explicitly used as a resource: certifying untrusted entangling gates without generating entanglement at any stage. We implement our protocol in the single-photon regime, and show its success {{in the presence of}} high levels of noise and imperfect gate operations. Our technique offers a practical method for benchmarking entangling gates in <b>physical</b> <b>architectures</b> in which only highly-mixed states are available. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The {{fourth step}} {{has the same}} intents as logical {{architecture}} building, except that it defines the “final” architecture of the system/SW at this level of engineering, ready to develop (by lower engineering levels). Therefore, it introduces rationalization, architectural patterns, new technical services and components, and makes the logical architecture evolve according to implementation, technical & technological constraints & choices (at this level of engineering). Note that the same [...] "Viewpoints-driven" [...] method as for logical architecture building is used for <b>physical</b> <b>architecture</b> definition.Outputs of this step consist of the selected physical architecture: components to be produced, including formalization of all viewpoints {{and the way they}} are taken into account in the components design. Links with requirements and operational scenarios are also produced.|$|E
50|$|Application Defined Network (ADN) is an {{enterprise}} data network that uses virtual network and security components {{to provide a}} dedicated logical network for each application, with customized security and network policies {{to meet the requirements}} of that specific application. ADN technology allows for a simple <b>physical</b> <b>architecture</b> with fewer devices, less device configuration and integration, reduced network administration and a lower tax on IT resources. ADN solutions simplify businesses’ need to securely deploy multiple applications across the enterprise footprint and partner networks, regardless of where the application resides. ADN platforms provide policy-based, application-specific delivery to corporate data centers, cloud services and/or third-party networks securely and cost effectively. Some ADN solutions integrate 3G/4G wireless backup services to enable a second internet connection automatically and instantly when connectivity is lost on the primary access connection. The ADN design provides an application-to-application (A2A) based model that evolves enterprise networks beyond the traditional site-to-site (S2S) private model.|$|E
5000|$|... {{4-channel}} audio installation, variable durationA {{room tone}} is a recorded element of sound design, often {{employed in the}} movie industry, to impress the sonic ambience of a depicted environment. It {{is the sound of}} “silence” in a room, though never quite silent as each room tone is inflected by different characteristics such as sonic reflections bouncing off <b>physical</b> <b>architecture,</b> the absorptive presence of bodies, and other kinds of technology present (i.e., the subtle hum of air-handling systems and lights). Room Tone is run by a computer program that generates sounds drawn from a database of approximately 1,000 room tones through four separate channels. The program may layer, cut up, and combine these room tones, varying in duration and volume, to create a new, dynamic, and visceral room tone for any particular space. Constantly changing and evolving, the aural experience of Room Tone humorously plays with the oft-cited adage of John Cage: “There {{is no such thing as}} an empty space or an empty time. There is always something to see, something to hear. In fact, try as we may to make a silence, we cannot.” ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} how quantum architectures affect {{the efficiency of}} the execution of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and linear transformations, which are essential parts of the stabilizer/Clifford group circuits. In particular, we show that in most common and realistic <b>physical</b> <b>architectures</b> including the linear nearest neighbor, two-dimensional lattice, and bounded degree graph (containing a chain of length n), n-qubit QFT and n-qubit stabilizer circuits can be parallelized to linear depth using no auxiliary qubits.

40|$|International audienceModular {{product design}} has {{received}} great attention for about 10 years, but few works have proposed tools to either jointly design the functional and <b>physical</b> <b>architectures</b> or propagate {{the impact of}} evolutions from one domain to another. In this paper, we present a new method supporting the product architecture design. In new product development situations or in reengineering projects, system architects could use this method in the early design stages to predetermine cohesive modules and integrative elements and to simulate a domain architecture by propagating architecture choices from another domain. To illustrate our approach, we present an industrial case study concerning {{the design of a}} new automobile powertrain...|$|R
