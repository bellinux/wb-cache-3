3000|$|To {{accomplish}} the above objectives, it is, therefore, inevitable {{to find a}} simple, sensitive and reliable technique {{for the analysis of}} thiophanate methyl. Of the various analytical methods, namely LC (Nakamura et al. 2011), HPLC (Li et al. 2013; Ye et al. 2008; Singh et al. 2007) and spectrophotometric (Verma et al. 2004 a; Skowron and Ciesielski 2008; Fleeker et al. 1974; Naidu et al. 2011; Mandal et al. 2010; Li and Li 2007) developed for the determination of thiophanate methyl, very little work has been done on its analysis by polarography (Verma et al. 2004 b). The polarographic methods are finding greater use in pesticide analysis, because the determination can be done even at larger dilutions and with smaller volume of solutions without any interference from inert carriers commonly present in formulated products. Differential pulse polarography is well known for its sensitivity and selectivity and has emerged as a reliable, sensitive and cost-effective technique amongst the <b>polarographic</b> methods for <b>analysis.</b> In a significant effort in this context, {{we have been able to}} develop a remarkably sensitive method for the determination of thiophanate methyl by making use of its reaction with copper(II) perchlorate in the presence of butylmethylimidazolium bromide (BMIB, an ionic liquid) in acetonitrile. Copper(II) perchlorate in acetonitrile and in the presence of ionic liquid gives a well-defined diffusion controlled peak at − 300  mV (vs SCE), whereas thiophanate methyl gives a similar peak at 180  mV. When copper(II) is added to thiophanate methyl in 2 : 1 molar ratio in the presence of BMIB, both the peaks due to copper(II) and thiophanate methyl disappears completely, and a new peak at − 180  mV appears showing approximately ten times more intensity than the one due to thiophanate methyl alone. The ionic liquid does not show any peak at these potentials and hence does not interfere in the proposed method. The remarkable sensitivity of the new peak coupled with the linear relationship obtained between concentration of thiophanate methyl added to copper(II) and the current intensity of this peak afforded us a sensitive differential pulse polarographic method for the determination of thiophanate methyl. This method has been applied to the analysis of thiophanate methyl in commercial formulation and to study its adsorption on four Indian soils of different soil characteristics. The formulation analysis is not only essential to ensure the quality of the marketed product but also to get reliable adsorption data.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The heat and light stabilities of the 16 UK-permitted synthetic food colouring matters were investigated in aqueous solution. A specially constructed light box was used to provide exaggerated lighting conditions with fan-cooling of the samples. Comparison of stability has been {{made on the basis}} of the shape of the entire decay curve rather than by simple comparison of loss after a fixed degradation period. Indigo carmine and erythrosine showed little light stability, while ponceau 4 R, chocolate brown HT and brown FK all showed fairly mediocre stability. The thermal stabilities of chocolate brown HT, ponceau 4 R and, most especially, indigo carmine, all proved poor. A new polarographic peak which appeared during the thermal degradation of red 2 G was shown to be due to the deacetylation product, red lOB. Identification was made by polarographic and chromatographic (hplc) comparison with a red lOB standard. A method for the analysis of red 2 G and red lOB present in the same solution was developed using differential pulse polarography. This method included the use of tetrapheny 1 phosphonium chloride to produce a differential shift 1 n the E 1 / 2 values of the respective colouring matters, and so increase the resolution of their <b>polarographic</b> peaks. Hplc <b>analysis</b> was conducted using reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography. A temperature control system was devised for the hplc column (water jacket) which was shown to improve the resolution and reproducibility of retention of the chromatographic peaks. An eluent comprising 63 / 37 / 0. 25 v/v/w methano 1 /water/cetrimide, an SAS-Hypersil packing and thermos tatting at 40 °C were found to be suitable for most of the thermal degradation solutions. A series of 13 chromatograms of thermally degraded solutions were produced under these conditions for comparative purposes. An unexpectedly large number of decay product chromatographic peaks were observed for some food colours. Whereas thermally degraded ponceau 4 R only showed four peaks, most colours showed up to about ten peaks, and a few, e. g. amaranth, green S and sunset yellow FCF showed a dozen or more. Tentative identifications were made of some products from azo colours by reference to standard phenols and aromatic amines. Growth curves were plotted by hplc for a number of the products from the thermal degradation of yellow 2 G. Polarographic and/or chromatographic evidence clearly showed that the thermal degradations of yellow 2 G and of red 2 G were not single step, single pathway processes. The large number of products observed by hplc indicate that this is true of most of the colours. Moreover, thermal degradation pathways need not be the same as photodegradation pathways. This has been shown simply for ponceau 4 R by comparison of UV spectra. Qualitative analysis linked to hplc was also investigated. The construction of UV spectra of decay products by repeated chromatography at different detection wavelengths proved to be quite straightforward. It was found that the use of diazotisation as a pre-column reaction for the differentiation of aromatic amines from phenolic analogues was not suitable: the acidic and strongly ionic conditions employed for diazotisation disrupted the chromatographic ion-pair mechanism beyond correction. Use of fluorescamine proved rapid and simple for sulphanilic acid, but no significant reaction occurred in the aase of naphthionic acid. A method was devised for the analysis of phenol- 4 -sulphonic acid and sulphanilic acid when chromatographically unresolved by comparison of peak absorbance at two wavelengths. Finally, preliminary work was carried out to find how the dependence of retention on eluent composition was affected by the presence of specific functional groups in the analyte. This was seen as of particular application where functional group (e. g. carboxylate) analysis was required for decay products present in low concentration...|$|R

40|$|The {{polarographic}} {{method of}} chemical analysis {{was introduced by}} Professor J. Heyrovsky {{in a series of}} papers published between 1922 and 1926. The method is based on interpretation of current-potential curves obtained when electroreducible or electro-oxidizable substances are reduced or oxidized at a dropping mercury electrode. The complete cell consists of a dropping mercury electrode, and another electrode which is essentially non-polarizable. The curve obtained by plotting the external voltage applied to the cell against the resulting current is the current-voltage curve, and since the one electrode is non-polarizable, this curve is actually the current-potential curve of the dropping electrode. <b>Polarographic</b> <b>analysis</b> depends essentially on certain unique characteristics of these current-potential curves. In an electrolytic cell which consists of a flat mercury electrode in combination with an electrode of constant potential, the reaction which takes place at the mercury electrode may be either reduction or oxidation depending on the direction of the current. If the reaction is reduction of metal ions to the corresponding metal, the metal may be soluble or insoluble in the mercury.

We previously generated mice with an insertion allele at the Inhba locus, InhbaBK. In this allele, the sequence encoding the Inhba mature domain is replaced with that of Inhbb, rendering the gene product functionally hypomorphic. Homozygous (InhbaBK/BK) and hemizygous (InhbaBK/−) mice are smaller and leaner than their wild-type littermates, and many tissues are disproportionately small relative to total body weight. To determine the mechanisms that contribute to these phenomena, we investigated the metabolic consequences of the mutation. Although the growth of InhbaBK mice is improved by providing a calorie-rich diet, diet-induced obesity, fatty liver, and insulin resistance (hallmarks of chronic caloric excess) do not develop, despite greater caloric intake than wild-type controls. Physiological, molecular, and biochemical analyses all revealed characteristics that are commonly associated with increased mitochondrial energy metabolism, with a corresponding up-regulation of several genes that reflect enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and function.

Confocal and transmission electronmicroscopy analyses showed that compound 5 induced severe mitochondrial swelling and vesicula-tion. <b>Polarographic</b> <b>analysis</b> using an oxygen electrode demonstrated that complex II of the respiratory chain (succinate reduc-tase) was strongly inhibited by compound 5, identifying this complex as one of the primary targets. Furthermore, for other -amino alkanols whose structures differed subtly from that of compound 5, plasmamembrane permeabilization or interfer-ence with membrane traffic was also observed. In all, N-substituted -amino alkanols were shown as appealing leishmanicida...|$|E
40|$|Using nitronium fluoroborate as a nitrating agent, {{rates of}} {{nitration}} of nitrobenzene to m-dinitrobenzene were measured in methanesulfonic acid, in sulfuric acid and in acetonitrile. For comparison, the nitration rates were also determined with nitric acid {{in each of}} these solvents and with anhydrous nitric acid alone. The reaction was followed by <b>polarographic</b> <b>analysis</b> of quenched samples. Conditions for purification of the fluoroborate, analysis and preparation of kinetically reproducible methanesulfonic acid are described. The reaction is first order in nitrobenzene and first order in the nitrating agent (except for HNO_ 3 in CH_ 3 SO_ 3 H). Second order rate constants are about equal for the two nitrating agents in sulfuric acid and, when the HNO_ 3 data are extrapolated to zero HNO_ 3, in methanesulfonic acid. The rate constants in the two solvents are also comparable in magnitude. When a second order rate constant in anhydrous nitric acid is computed from the estimated NO_ 2 ^+ concentration, its value at - 13 ° is about the same as those observed in the above acidic solvents at 25 °, and its approximate value at room temperature is appreciably greater. In acetonitrile, the rate constant with NO_ 2 BF_ 4 is much less, in qualitative agreement with the negligible content of free NO_ 2 ^+ in this medium as deduced from infrared spectra. The nitration rate with HNO_ 3 in acetonitrile is negligible. The study extends somewhat the range of solvents suitable for the investigation of medium effects on the attack of aromatics by NO_ 2 ^++...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin E {{deficiency}} in rats {{gives rise to}} a neuromuscular syndrome that includes a peripheral neuropathy as well as generalised muscle wasting and weakness. This is probably related to damage by oxygen-derived free radicals. In the present study, histological examination of lower limb muscles showed widespread myopathic changes which included the presence of amorphous electron-dense inclusions and tubular aggregates in muscle fibres and muscle fibre necrosis. Histochemical observations suggested a reduction in the activity of oxidative enzymes. The mitochondria showed nonspecific degenerative changes on electron microscopy; no paracrystalline inclusions were observed. <b>Polarographic</b> <b>analysis</b> of isolated muscle mitochondria revealed statistically significant decreases in oxygen utilisation rates with both NADH and FADH 2 -linked substrates. In confirmation of a generalised respiratory chain abnormality, enzymatic analyses revealed decreases in the activities of complexes I, II/III and IV, although only the decreases in complexes I and IV activities were statistically significant. Measurements of membrane fluidity showed that this is reduced in mitochondria from vitamin E deficient rats, indicating reduced stability of their membranes. The respiratory control ratio, derived from the polarographic results, was also reduced in mitochondria from vitamin E deficient animals, suggesting membrane damage. An altered lipid environment, possibly secondary to a higher level of lipid peroxidation, could result in the inhibition of complexes I and IV. This could also be caused by oxidative damage to the complexes or to mitochondrial DNA. The preservation of citrate synthase activity is against any generalised defect of mitochondrial function. The question as to whether these defects of mitochondrial respiratory chain function are responsible for the muscle fibre damage and necrosis requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} systemfor {{the determination}} of the L- 2 form of the majority of amino acids is presented. The method is based upon oxidative deamination of the amino acid coupled with oxidation of o-dianisidine by hydrogen peroxide. This procedure can be used comparatively for {{the determination of}} a mixture of L-a-amino acids or for the majority of separatedL-z-amino acids (especially in conjunction with column separa-tions from urine and blood which give falsely positive identification with ninhydrin detection). The stereospecific nature of the L [...] amino acid oxidase enables the investigator to quantitate the amount of L [...] amino acid {{in the presence of the}} D- 2 form. From an academic viewpoint, the extreme sensitivity and wide range of the detection system make it advantageous for the study of the enzyme itself. This automated method also may be employed to follow enzymatic reactions-e. g., those catalyzed by peptidases or racemases. The methodology is extremely convenient with good reagent stability and is much more sensitive than manometric technics. SEVERAL METHODS ARE AVAILABLE for the quantitation of amino acids. A microbiologic assay for the analysis of L [...] amino acids was developed by Loy and Wright (1). The ninhydrin reaction has been utilized suc-cessfully for the automated analysis of amino acids in ion-exchange eolumn effluents (2). An indirect <b>polarographic</b> <b>analysis</b> of a-amino acids was developed by Blaedel and Todd (3). A selective enzymatic method for {{the determination of the}} primary amino group in certain D [...] amino acids was developed by Ma and Breyer (4). Malmstadt and Hadjiianriou (5) described a specific enzymatic determination of some L-a-amino acids by a semiautomatic, spectrophotometric reaction-rate method. This last system fulfilled our need, hut the lack of complete automa-tion and lessened sensitivity of the detection system led us to develo...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Biochemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. MitochondriaI {{disorders}} {{are caused by}} biochemical abnormalities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC), {{a key component of}} oxidative phosphorilation (OXPHOS). The diagnosis of a RC deficiency can be invasive, expensive, time consuming and labour intensive. The corner stone for diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders and the only two definitive tests are DNA analysis and respiratory chain enzyme analysis (Naviaux, 2004). The aim {{of this study was to}} use biochemical analysis (<b>polarographic</b> <b>analysis</b> and enzyme assay) to identify patients with an OXPHOS defect by setting up reference values from healthy control data. The most commonly used approach in many centres is the interpretation of enzyme activity data based on retrospectively compiled reference values obtained from the data from diseased children, because of the unavailability of muscle tissue from healthy children (Thorburn, 2004). Ethics approval (protocol 91 / 98) was given to obtain muscle biopsies from selected healthy children. Biochemical tests were done on the muscle biopsies of the healthy children (control group) and those of the selected possible patients, based on their clinical phenotypes. The methods used in the literature differ significantly, so the first aim was to evaluate and partly standardise the method. Reference values were determined from the control group, based on four different approaches used in the literature. The most accurate approach was chosen, the patient data were compared to the reference range and the patients with OXPHOS deficiencies were diagnosed. During this study 18 controls were collected and 26 possible patients identified. In 69 % of the patients an OXPHOS defect could be diagnosed based on their enzymatic assay data. Only 11 % of the enzymatic assay data were comparable with the respiratory analysis data. It is thus recommended that in future respiratory analysis is no longer utilised. Master...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a well {{recognized}} need for an adequate method of measuring oxygen tension in small volumes during short time intervals without disturbing movement and without toxicity to living cells. Conventional polaro-. graphic technique provides the kind of data desired, but its dropping mercury electrode obviously fails to meet the requirements. The static platinum electrode {{has been used in}} <b>polarographic</b> <b>analysis</b> (Laitenen and Kolthoff, 1942) but a number of difficulties are encountered: (1) the long time required for observation, (2) instability, and (3) lack of reproducibility. In biological application of this electrode, Davies and Brink (1942) reported a day-to-day variability of 30 per cent and Roseman, Goodwin, and McCuUoch (1946) interpret only relative values for oxygen. The recessed electrode used by Davies and Brink improves the stability and reproducibility, but imposes a long time for restoration between successive observations. The rotating platinum electrode employed by Laitenen and Kolthoff (1942), though improving stability, not only introduces disturbing movement but lacks reproducibility. In like manner the flow system of Gigu~re and Lanzier (1945) imposes similar restrictions. In this investigation the possibility has been explored of overcoming the difficulties attendant {{on the use of the}} open, static platinum electrode through the employment of a suitable pattern of alternating potential with techniques arising from a special consideration of the time aspects involved. Because a good many other investigators have considered the possibility of an alternating potential, our observations over a wide range of frequency and pattern will be reported as well as the choice which has yielded the most satisfactory results. Since the shortest possible time between successive measurements was desirable our observations began at 30 c. P. s. 1 and were extended ultimately to quite low frequency, 6 to 12 c. P. ~¢. ~ Since these observations develope...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{chemistry}} as a {{field is}} composed largely of methods of measurement and analysis. The needs of analytical chemists have developed a complexity which must be matched by the capability of the techniques in use. This calls for the advent of new methods and techniques suitable for the problems at hand. Two new instruments are described in this work which are small steps in meeting some of the complex needs of analytical chemistry;The first instrument {{represents one of the}} older analytical methods, polarography, which has been in use in analytical chemistry for over 65 years. Polarography is a method which has seen a decline in use as more sensitive techniques are discovered, but which is still in wide use. The instrument described herein allows <b>polarographic</b> <b>analysis</b> of metals without removal of dissolved oxygen, previously a time-consuming necessity. Detection is accomplished by constant potential pulse polarography (CPPP). The instrument makes feasible detection in flowing samples by elimination of the required oxygen removal step. CPPP further offers a degree of freedom from interference due to reduction of hydrogen ion in acidic solution. The technique is shown to be sensitive, with a detection limit in the range of 10 [superscript]- 7 M for the metals studied. A differential method has also been developed, differential CPPP (DCPPP), which is shown to have increased selectivity over CPPP, offering resolution on the same scale as differential pulse polarography (DPP);The second instrument described represents one of the newer analytical techniques, supersonic jet spectroscopy. Analytical usage of this method has been only within the current decade, though recent development has been rapid, chiefly due to the immense selectivity resulting from the cooled analytes. The instrument designed for this work was intended to be versatile, allowing sample introduction by gas chromatography (GC) or by laser desorption (LD). Capabilities of the instrument are shown and a method for analysis is given. The detection limit for jet spectroscopy is hampered by the large dilution of sample which is necessary to accomplish the molecular cooling, but was found to be 9 ppm for aniline in Helium carrier gas under optimized expansion conditions for this instrument using multiphoton ionization (MPI) ...|$|E
