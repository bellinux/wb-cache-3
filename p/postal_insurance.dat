50|$|As he {{travelled}} to Orenburg Serge {{was finally}} able to meet and have discussions with Left Oppositionists who were also being deported. Orenburg was an impoverished town and he had to struggle for food. He could not work because he refused to declare his support for the general line of the party. He depended on parcels of food from his wife and money from the sale of his books in France. However, the GPU could confiscate his mail at any time, and after his first year in Orenburg they largely cut off mail delivery. Serge was able to address manuscripts to the French writer Romain Rolland, who was sympathetic to Stalin but was against Serge's repression, but many manuscripts that Serge tried to send were 'lost' (that is to say confiscated by the GPU). Paradoxically, the <b>postal</b> <b>insurance</b> payments on the missing packages helped Serge survive.|$|E
