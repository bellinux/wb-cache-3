5|$|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065) was a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} eleventh-century Irish Sea region. At his height, he reigned as king over Dublin, the Isles, and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway. The precise identity of Echmarcach's father, Ragnall, is uncertain. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this man {{was one of two}} eleventh-century rulers of Waterford. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Echmarcach's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles. If any of these identifications are correct, Echmarcach may have {{been a member of the}} Uí Ímair kindred.|$|E
5|$|One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Venus has no solid inner core, tidal Love {{number from}} Magellan and PVO {{tracking}} data |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=23 |issue=14 |pages=1857–1860 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1996/96GL01589.shtml |accessdate=12 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512154523/http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1996/96GL01589.shtml |archive-date=12 May 2011 |dead-url=yes |doi=10.1029/96GL01589 |date=1996 |bibcode=1996GeoRL..23.1857K}} or that its core is not cooling, {{so that the}} entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> its core has already completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is unknown at present.|$|E
5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E
50|$|One hypothesis, {{presented}} {{only as a}} <b>possibility,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Earth {{took the}} Moon from Venus.|$|R
5000|$|... {{covers the}} case when 2∈π4 and e=1, where the only <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> G <b>is</b> a C-group or the Tits group.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> {{it formed}} in an {{extremely}} cold region of the Solar System (such that most carbon gets trapped in other molecules).|$|R
5|$|Although {{the first}} {{documentary}} {{reference to a}} castle at Framlingham occurs in 1148, the actual date of its construction is uncertain and three possible options have been suggested by academics. The first <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the castle was built by Roger Bigod in either the late 11th century or around 1100, similar to the founding of Bigod's caput at nearby Eye. A second <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Roger's son, Hugh Bigod, built it {{during the years of}} the Anarchy in the 1140s on the site of an existing manor house; the castle would then be similar to the Bigod fortification at Bungay. A third <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there were in fact two castles: the first being built in the late 11th century and then demolished by Hugh Bigod in the 1160s in order {{to make way for a}} newer, larger castle. Historian Magnus Alexander hypothesizes the castle might have been built on top of a set of pre-existing Anglo-Saxon, high prestige buildings, a practice common elsewhere in East Anglia, possibly echoing the arrangement at Castle Acre; this would be most likely if the castle was built in the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a {{gene for}} aposematism might be {{recessive}} and {{located on the}} X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E
5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> long head hair {{is a result of}} Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some groups or individuals, however, short hair is the selected trait.|$|E
5000|$|Two other <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> end of ice age {{deposits}} either just grew {{too large}} and collapsed {{or they were}} destabilised by an earthquake.|$|R
50|$|The {{place of}} Luo's birth and date are a {{controversial}} question. One <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> from Taiyuan, {{and lived in}} the late Yuan Dynasty and early Ming Dynasty by the record of his contemporary, the playwright Jia Zhongming (賈仲明), {{who said that he}} had met him in 1364. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> born in Dongyuan, the province of Shangdong, in about 1280 - 1360. Literary historians suggest other possibilities for his home, also including Hangzhou and Jiangnan.|$|R
50|$|Philosopher George MacDonald Ross has {{identified}} a close parallel in a 14th-century mystical text, the Swester Katrei. Other <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> a surviving parody or self-parody, or a training topic in debating.|$|R
5|$|Echmarcach {{was the son}} of a {{man named}} Ragnall. Whilst Echmarcach bore a Gaelic name, the name of his father is {{ultimately}} derived from Old Norse, a fact that serves to exemplify the hybrid nature of the eleventh-century Irish Sea region, The identity of Echmarcach's father is uncertain. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Ragnall was a member of the dynasty that ruled the Norse-Gaelic enclave of Waterford in tenth- and eleventh centuries. If so, Echmarcach may have been the son of one of two Waterfordian rulers: Ragnall mac Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1018), or this man's apparent son, Ragnall ua Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1035). Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Echmarcach belonged to a family from the Isles, and that his father was Ragnall mac Gofraid, King of the Isles (died 1004/1005), son and possible successor of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles (died 989). As a descendant of either of the aforesaid families, Echmarcach would appear to have been a member of the Uí Ímair, a royal dynasty descended from the Scandinavian sea-king Ímar (died c.873).|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity in the Catalogue is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the relic of the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here. Both these relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture, and would have made the Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{one of the most significant}} and venerated buildings in the country.|$|E
50|$|One {{theory for}} the cause of the fall <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the quarrymen <b>were</b> annoyed with the tourist visits to the place. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it fell due to {{vibrations}} from blasting of the bore in the quarries nearby.|$|R
30|$|The other <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> the {{weakness}} of abdominal wall caused by two transvaginal deliveries. Although she underwent abdominoplasty due to separated linea alba, abdominal wall rupture occurred. The last <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the resistance of the}} abdominal pressure could not be maintained by sacrificed intercostal nerve. Spontaneous rupture in our case is considered the complex of these elements.|$|R
5000|$|Another <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Bolesław III Wrymouth and Salomea of Berg had a {{daughter}} named Adelaide who died in infancy (and for this probably not mentioned in sources) whose tomb {{would be in the}} country, and Casimir II named his daughter after her.|$|R
5|$|An {{alternative}} <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> 55 Cancri e {{is a solid}} planet made of carbon-rich material {{rather than}} the oxygen-rich material that makes up the terrestrial planets in our solar system. In this case, roughly {{a third of the}} planet's mass would be carbon, much of which may be in the form of diamond {{as a result of the}} temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior. Further observations are necessary to confirm the nature of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E
5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> an external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.|$|E
50|$|Maugham LJ concurred, though {{expressing his}} regret at the result. He held he {{was bound to}} do so. He said the only two <b>possibilities</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> the {{document}} <b>was</b> signed non est factum, or <b>that</b> the document <b>was</b> induced to be signed by a misrepresentation.|$|R
50|$|The inquiry did not {{determine}} a particular cause. The aircraft had flown {{into the ocean}} for no apparent reason, and so the board focussed on the altimeter. One <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the static pressure system or altimeter was malfunctioning and not allowing display of the correct altitude.|$|R
5000|$|The second <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> “a rule of {{the common}} law is not {{inconsistent}} with a specific constitutional provision but may fall short of its spirit, purport and objects.” If so, “the common law must <b>be</b> adapted so <b>that</b> it grows {{in harmony with the}} ‘objective normative value system’ found in the Constitution.” ...|$|R
5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus was {{described}} as Roman senator in the undated tomb inscription and Hairan I was mentioned with the same title in the 251 inscription. Scholarly opinions vary on the exact date of Odaenathus' elevation to the position; Gawlikowski and Jean Starcky maintain that the senatorial rank predates the Ras elevation. Udo Hartmann concludes that Odaenathus first became a Ras in the 240s then a senator in 250. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the senatorial rank and lordship occurred simultaneously; Odaenathus was chosen as a Ras following Gordian's death, then after Philip the Arab concluded a peace with the Persians, the emperor ratified Odaenathus' lordship and admitted him to the senate to guarantee Palmyra's continuous subordination.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the three}} kings, Máel Coluim {{appears to have}} been the most powerful, and it is {{possible}} that Mac Bethad and Echmarcach were underkings or clientkings of his. Mac Bethad appears to have become Mormaer of Moray in 1032 after the slaying of his kinsman, Gilla Comgáin mac Máel Brigti, Mormaer of Moray (died 1032). Previous rulers of Moray are sometimes styled as kings by various Irish annals, a fact which may explain why Mac Bethad was called a king when he met Knútr. Although the apparent date of Mac Bethad's accession to the mormaership (1032) appears to contradict the date of the kings' meeting (1031), this discrepancy can be accounted for in two ways. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Gilla Comgáin was actually slain in 1031 but only recorded in 1032. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Knútr merely returned from Rome in 1031, but actually met with the kings in 1032, after Gilla Comgáin's demise and Mac Bethad's accession. There is further evidence that could cast doubt on the date of the meeting. Although the aforesaid versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date Knútr's pilgrimage to 1031, he is otherwise known to have visited Rome in 1027. Whilst it is possible he undertook two pilgrimages during his career, {{it is more likely that}} the chronicle has misdated his journey. In fact, it possible that the chronicle failed to account for the time in which Knútr spent on the continent and Scandinavia after having visited Rome.|$|E
50|$|Disposing of the {{dissected}} {{body was}} difficult, {{and over the}} years, rumors have appeared about how anatomists might have managed to do so. One <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> secretly burying the remains behind their school, whilst another rumored <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they gave the bodies to zoo keepers, as feed for carnivorous animals or burial beneath elephant grazing pens, or fed the bodies to vultures kept specifically for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|Police {{believed}} <b>that</b> Worledge <b>was</b> lured {{from her}} bed by someone whom she knew and trusted, and had simply left the house via the front door, which had been left unlocked. Another <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{she may have been}} abducted by a prowler known to be in the area at the time.|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} the name derived {{from a group of}} children in St Sidwells who were referred to as the 'Greasy Un's'. A further <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it derived from a jeweller's shop in Sidwell Street, close to the ground, which had a clock hanging outside displaying the name 'Grecians' on its face.|$|R
5|$|One temnospondyl, the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis, {{may have}} brooded young {{in an area}} between the gills called the {{pharyngeal}} pouch. Small bones belonging to younger Trimerorhachis individuals {{have been found in}} these pouches. The living Darwin's Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way. An alternative <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic, eating its young like many amphibians do today. If this was the case, the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri {{is known}} from one {{specimen}} which might contain a pathology. The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae {{at the base}} of the neck. Originally thought to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids. One other <b>possibility,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology. The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a pathology, even though some illustrations of Parasaurolophus restore the skin flap.|$|E
5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning on Venus, and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning and thunder. The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming {{the occurrence of}} lightning on Venus. One <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped {{by a factor of}} 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5000|$|There is debate but no {{conclusion}} {{over the}} origin of the name [...] "Ragged Staff". One of the <b>possibilities</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it came from the symbol for Morvidus who was a legendary Earl of Warwick. He fought and killed a giant using an uprooted tree, hence the symbol of a ragged staff, but there is no consensus.|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} the name of Springer Mountain is unclear. One {{possible}} origin <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> named in honor of William G.

Another <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Springer Mountain <b>was</b> named for the first Presbyterian minister to be ordained in Georgia, John Springer, who was ordained in 1790.|$|R
