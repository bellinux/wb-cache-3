40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the penalty stroke when it is {{executed}} with 45 degree stance. For the purpose of the study 6 intervarsity level male hockey players who represented University of Lucknow, Lucknow, India were selected as the subjects. The mean age, height and body weight of the selected subjects were 20 yrs, 169. 67 cm and 59. 5 kg, respectively. One high speed camcorder was used to capture the execution of penalty stroke. The camcorder was placed at 10 meters away from the penalty spot on the saggital plane of the subjects and perpendicular to the backline. The height of the camcorder was adjusted as required 1. 5 meters from the ground. At each critical corner of the goal post i. e. right top corner (RTC), left top corner (LTC), right ground corner (RGC) and left ground corner (LGC), specially designed (2 × 2 feet) targets were placed to determine the ball accuracy. After experimental setup the subjects were asked to perform 3 penalty strokes each for all four corners of the goalpost with 45 degree stance (DS). Their movements during the execution were recorded in the camcorder. After recording all the video footages were downloaded into personal computer and subjected to biomechanical analysis.

40|$|Bioavailability results, {{obtained}} in humans, of wheat flour fortified with elemental iron {{might not be}} reliable because these studies have been performed using tracer iron compounds that probably {{do not have the}} same physicochemical characteristics as the commercial elemental iron powders. The aim of the present study was to measure, in Caco- 2 cells, the iron bioavailability of hydrogen-reduced (H-reduced) iron (<= 45 -mu m particle size) from 72 %-extraction wheat flour bread. Bread was fortified with either 8 -mu m H-reduced iron (<b>pro</b> <b>analysi</b> compound used as control) or <= 45 -mu m H-reduced iron (industrialized food grade product). Solubility and dialyzability, were determined from bread homogenate. Ferritin and intracellular iron content were assessed in Caco- 2 cells incubated with either reduced iron or fortified bread homogenate. The 8 -mu m H-reduced iron had higher solubility and dialyzability than <= 45 -mu m H-reduced iron. Intracellular iron and ferritin concentrations in Caco- 2 cells exposed to digest from bread fortified with 8 -mu m H-reduced iron were significantly higher than in bread fortified with <= 45 -mu m H-reduced iron (P <. 05). When bread fortified with ferrous sulfate was used as a reference, the relative iron bioavailabilities of the fortified bread with 8 -mu m H-reduced iron and <= 45 -mu m H-reduced iron were 68. 2 % and 31. 1 %, respectively. In conclusion, there is an inverse relationship between H-reduced particle size and iron bioavailability. If H-reduced (food grade, <= 45 -mu m particle size) iron is used in wheat flour fortification, it should be added at 3 times the level of ferrous sulfate to provide the same absolute amount of absorbed iron...|$|E
40|$|It is {{of utmost}} {{importance}} that the white liquor used in the digester of a sulphate pulp mill is of high quality. The white liquor is prepared in the causticizing plant, through causticizing of the sodium carbonate in the green liquor. The causticizing is made with slaked lime, which, in turn, has been calcined in the lime mud reburning plant and slaked in the green liquor. To enable high quality white liquor to be produced the lime has to be of high quality. A high quality lime is reactive in the slaking and causticizing and the later-formed lime mud has to be easily separated from the white liquor. This study {{has shown that the}} quality of the lime is closely correlated to the specific surface area of the lime. Lime calcined in different types of equipment was slaked and causticized in laboratory scale equipment. The specific filtration resistance of the later-formed lime mud was then determined. Reburned lime mud from a rotary kiln, a pilot scale fluidised bed and from a laboratory oven were all more reactive when the specific surface area of the lime was large. However, the later-formed lime mud was more easily separated from the white liquor if the lime had a small surface area. Since the size of the specific surface area of the lime is extremely important, the effects of various reburning conditions on the surface area were more closely examined. Experiments in a laboratory oven showed that the specific surface area of the lime is decreased by an increased temperature or increased residence time in the oven. Limes that were not completely calcined had a specific surface area between that of the parent and the calcined material. Furthermore, experiments in an atmosphere of pure carbon dioxide, at non-calcining temperatures, showed considerable sintering of lime mud before calcination. This is important since the characteristics of the parent material is of importance to the final product. Calcium carbonate <b>pro</b> <b>analysi</b> used as a reference, had ten times larger specific surface area. This is likely the effect of less impurities and of the different structure of the parent material. Lime mud and calcium carbonate were calcined in pure nitrogen in a quartz glass reactor. These experiments showed the largest reported specific surface area of calcined lime mud, 9. 2 m 2 /g, when treated for 300 s at 700 °C. The specific surface area of calcium carbonate p. a. calcined in the quartz glass reactor was about ten times larger than that of the lime mud. The decrease in specific surface area with time was found to follow the German and Munir equation. The temperature dependence was empirically estimated and included in the German-Munir equation. The. gamma. value, 3, indicates solid phase diffusion as the mechanism of sintering. The lowest specific surface area was obtained for lime produced in a rotary kiln, 0. 2 m 2 /g. The lime from the pilot scale fluidised bed was more soft-burned and had a specific surface area that was ten times larger, 2 m 2 /g. This is presumably due to the good mixing in the fluidised bed reactor, which enables high heat and mass transfer in the reactor. Accordingly, the temperature and the concentration of carbon dioxide is kept at a low level. The largest surface area obtained in this study was that of calcium carbonate p. a. calcined in pure nitrogen, 99 m 2 /g...|$|E
