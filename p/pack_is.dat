5|$|As {{hunting with}} beagles {{was seen as}} ideal for young people, many of the British public schools {{traditionally}} maintained beagle packs. Protests were lodged against Eton's use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the <b>pack</b> <b>is</b> still in existence today, and a pack used by Imperial College in Wye, Kent was stolen by the Animal Liberation Front in 2001. School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, Marlborough, Wye, Radley, the Royal Agricultural University and Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E

5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains that his rocket <b>pack</b> <b>is</b> a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 Los Angeles, two gangsters in Eddie Valentine's gang steal {{a rocket}} pack from Howard Hughes. During their escape, they find {{themselves}} on an airfield, where they hide the rocket pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord's Gee Bee racer is totaled during the accident; he and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a biplane cockpit. Movie star Neville Sinclair had hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, and he sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket <b>pack</b> <b>is</b> at the airfield.|$|E
5|$|The Volt's {{battery is}} {{guaranteed}} by General Motors {{for eight years}} or , and will cover all 161 battery components. GM estimates that the Volt batteries will degrade by 10 to 30% after 8 years or 100,000 miles. GM has applied for a patent that may allow technicians to quickly and cheaply recover some {{of the performance of}} degraded battery packs. The Volt’s battery management system runs more than 500 diagnostics at 10 times per second, allowing it {{to keep track of the}} Volt’s battery pack in real-time, 85% of which ensure the battery <b>pack</b> <b>is</b> operating safely and 15% monitor battery performance and life.|$|E

5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV {{and the other with}} an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV battery <b>pack</b> <b>is</b> related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} from the vault on October 5, 2010 as the second of Disney's Diamond Editions, {{in the form of a}} three-disc Blu-ray Disc and DVD combination pack— the first release of Beauty and the Beast on home video in high-definition format. This edition consists of four versions of the film: the original theatrical version, an extended version, the New York Film Festival storyboard-only version, and a fourth iteration displaying the storyboards via picture-in-picture alongside the original theatrical version. Upon its first week of release, the Blu-ray sold 1.1 million units, topping the Blu-ray sales chart and finishing in third place on the combined Blu-ray and DVD sales chart for the week ending on October 10, 2010. It was the second best-selling Blu-ray of 2010, behind Avatar. A two-disc DVD edition was released on November 23, 2010. A five-disc combo pack, featuring Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D, DVD and a digital copy, was released on October 4, 2011. The 3D combo <b>pack</b> <b>is</b> identical to the original Diamond Edition, except for the added 3D disc and digital copy. The Blu-ray release went into the Disney Vault along with the two sequels on April 30, 2012.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{the notion}} of {{orthogonal}} nonseparable quarternary wavelet <b>packs,</b> which <b>is</b> the generalization of orthogonal univariate wavelet <b>packs,</b> <b>is</b> introduced. The definition for orthogonal nonseparable quarternary wavelet <b>packs</b> <b>is</b> presented by iteration method. The orthogonality characters of quarternary wavelet <b>packs</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Three orthogonality formulas concerning these wavelet packets are estabished. Moreover, it is shown how to obtain new orthogonal bases of space 2 4 L (R) from these wavelet packets...|$|R
