5|$|In 1884 the DF renamed {{itself the}} Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and {{underwent}} an internal reorganisation. However, {{the group was}} facing an internal schism between those (such as Hyndman), who argued for a parliamentary <b>path</b> <b>toward</b> socialism, and those (like Morris) who deemed the Houses of Parliament intrinsically corrupt and capitalist. Personal issues between Morris and Hyndman were exacerbated by their attitude to British foreign policy; Morris was staunchly anti-imperialist while Hyndman expressed patriotic sentiment encouraging some foreign intervention. The division {{between the two groups}} developed into open conflict, with the majority of activists sharing Morris' position. In December 1884 Morris and his supporters – most notably Ernest Belfort Bax and Edward Aveling – left the SDF; the first major schism of the British socialist movement.|$|E

The rotunda opens to the south to a terrace that links all five of the Museum pavilions. A separate building to the west of the arrival plaza and stairs holds a cafeteria and restaurant. Next to the restaurant is a stone arch, which separates the Museum from the GRI. Stairs from the terrace connecting the GRI and the restaurant lead down to the central garden.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Traffic {{congestion}} is a {{very serious}} problem in large cities. With the number of vehicles increasing rapidly, especially in cities whose economy is booming, the situation is getting even worse. In this paper, by leveraging the techniques of Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) we present a dynamic navigation protocol called VAN for individual vehicles to find the shortest-time <b>paths</b> <b>toward</b> their given destinations. Specifically, a vehicle initiates a number of queries, which are routed by VANETs along different <b>paths</b> <b>toward</b> its destination. During query forwarding, the real-time road traffic information in each road segment is aggregated from multiple participating vehicles and returned to the source after the query reaches the destination. This information enables the source to calculate the shortest-time path. W...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Spontaneous networking, where {{wireless}} mobile nodes opportunistically exploit multi-hop ad-hoc <b>paths</b> <b>toward</b> {{peers to}} share content and available resources in an impromptu way, has recently received growing interest from both industry and academia. In this paper, we specifically {{focus on the}} notable case of sharing connectivity to the traditional Internet, with the general goal of an overall better exploitation of connectivity resources, often underutilized as the population of wireless devices grows, {{as well as their}} local computing/memory/bandwidth resources. In particular, here we show how our novel middleware, called RAMP, can exploit both networkand application-layer solutions to dynamically manage mission-oriented <b>paths</b> <b>toward</b> peers offering Internet connectivity. Thanks to our middleware-level cross-layer approach, RAMP can dynamically select and combine different solutions for multi-hop multi-path ad-hoc path formation and can take proper management decisions based on run-time context. The reported results demonstrate the suitability of dynamically integrating network- and application-layer approaches to achieve the best overhead/performance tradeoff depending on specific application requirements...|$|R

25|$|Displays {{based on}} electro-wetting provide several {{attractive}} features. The switching between white and colored reflection is {{fast enough to}} display video content. It's a low-power and low-voltage technology, and displays based on the effect can be made flat and thin. The reflectivity and contrast are better {{than or equal to}} other reflective display types and approach the visual qualities of paper. In addition, the technology offers a unique <b>path</b> <b>toward</b> high-brightness full-color displays, leading to displays that are four times brighter than reflective LCDs and twice as bright as other emerging technologies. Instead of using red, green and blue (RGB) filters or alternating segments of the three primary colors, which effectively result in only one third of the display reflecting light in the desired color, electro-wetting allows for a system in which one pixel can switch three different colors independently.|$|E

He based his argument on the submarine project, which may involve the production of highly enriched uranium, and the fact that Brazil seeks to develop capacity to conduct all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle indigenously.

Commenting on Rühle’s article, the Argentine scholars Federico Merke and Florencia Montal said that Brazil might develop the capacity to manufacture a bomb but that it didn’t seem to have the intention to do so.|$|E

25|$|When he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups had {{a second}} vision {{involving}} the Little People, one that changed the fate of his entire tribe. Plenty Coups' family had moved to be with other bands of Crow lodging in the Beartooth Mountains. All the young men were challenged {{to go into the}} hills to seek visions, and Plenty Coups did so. Plenty Coups walked for two days (fasting as he went) and entered the Crazy Mountains, but had no vision. He returned a few days later with three friends, fasted, and took sweat-baths. He decided to cut off the tip of his left index finger as an offering to the spirits. That night, he dreamt of the chief of the Little People again. The chief introduced Plenty Coups to a buffalo that turned into a man with buffalo-like features (the buffalo-man), who led him underground and down a tunnel or <b>path</b> <b>toward</b> the Pryor Mountains. For two days, he traveled underground among throngs of American bison. Finally, the buffalo-man showed Plenty Coups a vision of endless streams of bison coming out of {{a hole in the ground}} but disappearing. Then a second stream of bison—with different colors (even spots), tails, and sounds—came up out of the ground, and remained on the plains. Plenty Coups had a vision of himself as an old man lodged near the Medicine Rocks, and of a vast forest whose trees had been felled by a great wind. Only a chickadee remained. A voice told Plenty Coups that the day of the Plains Indian was ending, and that white men would swarm over the land like buffalo. But the chickadee remains, because it is a good listener, develops its mind, and survives by its wits.|$|E
