5000|$|For the album's front cover, {{the band}} {{wanted to take}} a photo with a monkey from the Bronx Zoo. George DuBose {{originally}} took the picture in the zoo's monkey house, but this photo was rejected by the zoo director. The zoo would not allow the band to borrow a chimp for photographing, so DuBose decided to try and hire Zippy the Chimp from The David Letterman Show and was successful. The resulting idea was to take the picture of the band {{standing in front of a}} gorilla cage with Legs McNeil, Joey's brother and Punk Magazine author, in a gorilla costume. Dee Dee is holding Zippy the Chimp, a baby chimpanzee, and because of this, DuBose had to refrain from flashing light as he could possibly spooked it, although according to DuBose, the chimp was already out of control. [...] "Zippy was getting wild," [...] Dubose recalled, [...] "he wasn't looking at the camera and was fucking around with the guys. I wasn't getting the <b>picure</b> because the chimp was out of control, so finally the traner goes up to Zippy and whacks him across the face." [...] The lack of flash resulted in a lowlighted warmer colored photograph, which would be used as the album's cover.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1930s, the ADL, {{along with}} the American Jewish Committee, coordinated American Jewish groups {{across the country in}} {{monitoring}} the activities of the German-American Bund and its pro-Nazis, nativist allies in the United States. In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion <b>picure</b> industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, Leon Lewis. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1931-1925. From 1934-1941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of [...] "un-American activities" [...] (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.|$|E

40|$|During {{the final}} {{decades of the}} eighteenth century, when the {{dictates}} of Adam Smith's theory of political economy began to take hold, charity became deeply unfashionable. In consonance with Smith's dictates, though conceived independently of them, William Gilpin's theory of Picturesque beauty suggested protocols for representation that excluded the <b>picuring</b> of charitable acts along with other kinds of sentimental narrative. Against political economic hostility to acts of charity and Picturesque reluctance to picture such gestures of sympathy for and solidarity with the poor, some English women writers continued to perpetuate in fiction a mid-century tradition of charitable benevolence. The novels of Sarah Fielding and other women writers of the 1740 s and 1750 s continued to resonate between the 1770 s and 1790 s with such writers as Frances Burney and Elizabeth Inchbald. Inchbald's *Nature and Art* is particularly noteworthy and important in its radical combination of charitable benevolence with Picturesque dishevelment. In this fiction of charitable benevolence there is a hearkening back to seventeenth-century ideas of charity as the poor's rightful property and the body politic as properly a commonwealth. We might say that Inchbald, like Sarah Fielding before her, refused to relinquish the Enlightenment grand narrative of human emancipation in favour of the grand narrative of progress, defined ever more narrowly as the progress of capitalism...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} part of my lectures on the Pomeron {{structure}} which I am going to read during this academic year at the Tel Aviv university. The main goal of these lectures is to remind young theorists as well as young experimentalists of what are the Reggeons that have re-appeared in the high energy phenomenology to describe the HERA and the Tevatron data. Here, I show how and why the Reggeons appeared in the theory, what theoretical problems they have solved and what they have failed to solve. I describe in details what we know about Reggeons and what we do not. The major part of these lectures is devoted to the Pomeron structure, to the answer to the questions: what is the so called Pomeron; why it is so different from other Reggeons and why we have to introduce it. In short, I hope that this lectures will be the shortest way to learn everything about Reggeons from the beginning to the current understanding. I concentrate on the problem of Reggeons in this lectures while the Reggeon interactions or the shadowing corrections I plan to discuss {{in the second part of}} my lectures.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study examined use of picuristes among Haitian immigrants in Miami-Dade County, Florida. It describes how this health-seeking behavior is socially constructed among Haitian immigrants {{in terms of}} benefits. (b) risks, (c) sex, (d) gender, (e) acculturation proxies and (f) transnational influences. It is conducted within the frameworks of Symbolic Interactionism, the Health Belief Model and the Explanatory Model of Illness. Purposive sampling and a mixed-method design were used to obtain semistructured interviews of 10 picuristes and 25 users. The same methods were employed to select survey respondents so as to obtain a descriptive estimate of picuriste use and covariates of picuriste use within the sample. ATLAS. ti 5. 0 and SPSS 14. 0 were {{used to analyze the}} data. The findings indicate an interconnection of elements from Vodou, traditional Haitian health beliefs and picuriste practice and use. Rekonnèt, a relationship based on a history of trust with individuals related by blood or who share close personal and social ties was identified as a sufficient and necessary reason for picuriste practice and use. Benefits reported are that the picuriste injections directly impact the blood, and that they represent affordable and convenient access to health care. Risks include rashes, abscesses and fevers. The reuse of injection equipment, routine injection of antibiotics and unknown substances and the improper discard of syringes and needles were reported, implying unrecognized risks of preventable infectious disease. No participant described a process that adheres to established international standards for safe injections. There is no clear evidence that biological sex, gender, length of time in U. S. or language of interview influence picuriste practice or use. Transnational ties facilitate transport of substances from Haiti and the practice and use of picuristes locally. Recommendation by a relative or trusted friend and believing that the benefits of <b>picures</b> outweigh risks were covariates of picuriste use. This study highlights values and priorities of Haitian immigrants seeking healthcare, and cultural forces that shape their decisions about wellness and treatment. Future studies should test the application of Symbolic Interactionism to picuriste use in larger epidemiological studies that examine picuriste use in relation to health status...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of finding maximal patterns in an twodimensional text for the class of two-dimensional <b>picure</b> patterns with wild cards (don’t cares). A maximal pattern for two-dimensional text is a generalization of a 1 -dimensional sequential motif in (Parida et al., SODA’ 00; Pisanti et al., MFCS’ 03; Pelfrene etal., CPM’ 03), and {{it is such a}} representative pattern that is not properly contained in any larger pattern with the same location lists under invariance with respect to parallel motion. Since a text may contain exponentially many maximal patterns in general, it is natural to consider an outputsensitive algorithms for enumerating all patterns in the class. Then, we present a polynomial space and polynomial delay algorithm for enumerating all maximal patterns in a text array in exact polynomial time per discovered pattern in the total size of the input text. This result is achieved by backtracking through depth-first search of a tree-shaped search route over all maximal patterns, similar to (Arimura et al., ISAAC’ 05). We also discuss the lowerbound results on the number of maximal patterns and the #P-hardness of conting, and efficient input polynomial time computation of constant patterns with matrix suffix trees. ...|$|E
40|$|Entanglement in J_ 1 -J_ 2, S= 1 / 2 quantum spin chains with an {{impurity}} is studied using analytic methods as well {{as large}} scale numerical density matrix renormalization group methods. The entanglement is investigated {{in terms of the}} von Neumann entropy, S=-Tr rho_A log rho_A, for a sub-system A of size r of the chain. The impurity contribution to the uniform part of the entanglement entropy, S_{imp}, is defined and analyzed in detail in both the gapless, J_ 2 J_ 2 ^c, of the model. This quantum impurity model is in the universality class of the single channel Kondo model and it is shown that in a quite universal way the presence of the impurity in the gapless phase, J_ 2 0. In the dimerized phase an appealing <b>picure</b> of the entanglement is developed in terms of a thin soliton (TS) ansatz and the notions of impurity valence bonds (IVB) and single particle entanglement (SPE) are introduced. The TS-ansatz permits a variational calculation of the complete entanglement in the dimerized phase that appears to be exact in the thermodynamic limit at the Majumdar-Ghosh point, J_ 2 =J_ 1 / 2, and surprisingly precise even close to the critical point J_ 2 ^c. In appendices the relation between the finite temperature entanglement entropy, S(T), and the thermal entropy, S_{th}(T), is discussed and and calculated at the MG-point using the TS-ansatz.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of environmental factors on major production traits in savanna criollo sows kept in the swine unit of the <b>Picure</b> farm. Records corresponding to 14 different sows were analysed for pigs per litter (NLC), average pig weight at birth (PPLN) and average pig weight at weaning (PPLD). Using the Proc GLM of SAS/STAT (v. 9. 1), a linear model was fitted including the following environmental effects: calving year (AP; three levels), calving season (EP; two levels), calving number (NP; three levels) and sow animal effect (CE; fourteen levels). DUNCAN’s multiple-range test was performed on all main effect means affecting the analized traits for α= 0. 05.

It seems to promise the heavenly kingdom toward which we poor pilgrims progress-a celestial city with computers and television and as yet undreamed of devices to make life more interesting and pleasurable. The new technology {{is one of those}} phrases which seems to embody some instinctive belief that science will somehow make better things for better living, and, if only libraries latch onto them, the problems and crises constantly faced will somehow be dealt with magically. Even a librarian as clear-thinking as John Humphry, who usually applies straightforward commonsense to his writing and thinking about libraries, talks of communication devices and systems, or automated and computerized services, without really defining them. ' Many of us fall into this tempting hyperbole. When the new technologies finally do arrive, they are not wholly new, and they seldom seem to provide totally new services. There has not been a radical change in library activity with the advent of microfilm, or motion <b>picure</b> film, or phonodiscs, or color slides. What almost all of these devices have done is either to provide a new item to be circulated, vie~ved, borrowed, or read, or through some technological process enabled a large body of information to be stored. This body of information gets relatively little use item for item and piece by piece; what use it does get is of the same nature as those pieces of information collected before the advent of the technology. In addition, one of the greatest impacts any technology has had on libraries is the increasing cost of equipment. That is not only a nonservice; it may, in fact, impede the provision of service. More importantly libraries are pressured to look inward to their own procedures, personnel and problems, rather than outa ard to the use which people make of these devices and technologies.

40|$|Cross {{cultural}} studies so far suggest that all children, {{regardless of their}} primary linguistic input use gestures together with speech in early stages of linguistic development. But culture and adult input may influence {{the extent to which}} the manual modality is used for representational purposes. Many studies have reported more frequent production of representational gestures produced by Italian children include numerous object and action gestures (e. g. eating) and attributive gestures (e. g., big), wheareas Amarican children almost exclusively produce conventional gestures (e. g. hi, yes) (Iverson et. al., 2008). Previous studies have yet to examine representational gestures within a large population as well as to investigate cultural influences in gesture production. They did not compare gestures produced by children raised in different cultures and exposed to different languages to represent the same referents. The present study is designed to address this issue by investigating the spontaneous production of gestures in a highly constrained, simple picture naming task (Stefanini et al., 2008) performed by children from different countries and languages. Given that Japanese culture has been never described as gesture-rich like the Italian culture, it is quite possible that young Italian children use a repertoire of gestures larger than the repertoire developed by Japanese children. Method and Discussion: Two groups of 22 children, Italian and Japanese children (age range: 25 - 37 months) matched for age and gender performed the same <b>picure</b> naming task consisting of forty six coloured pictures divided into two sets: a set of 24 pictures representing objects/tools (e. g. comb), animals (e. g. lion), food (e. g. banana) and clothing (e. g. gloves), and a set of 22 pictures representing actions (e. g. eating) and characteristics (e. g., small). the data were collected in comparable settings for the two groups of children, and spoken and gestural productions were analyzed according to the same criteria. Results: Both groups of children produced representational gestures with and without spoken responses. With representational gestures, children performed of reproduced the action usually produced with the object depicted (e. g. the comb), the character depicted (e. g. the lion) or the actoin in the picture itself (e. g. to swim). In both groups the majority of differences between the two groups in naming the spoken accuracy as well as in the number of representational gestures. The results indicate that, contrary to our expectations, Japanese children produced less correct spoken responses but more representational gestures than Italian children. In young children motor representations appear to support linguistic representations in speech: performing a gestural motor representation may be necessary to create a more experimental dimension and a more precise and concrete image linked to the word. Representational gestures produced in a naming task appear, therefore, to be linked to motor experiences common to all children. Results were discussed in terms of the characteristics of interactoin between child and caregiver in both cultures...|$|E

Choroba niedokrwienna serca jest to zespół objawów chorobowych, które są następstwem stanu niewystarczającego zaopatrzenia komórek mięśnia serca w tlen i w substancje odżywcze, a jej obraz kliniczny wykazuje duże zróżnicowania. Jednym z cennych badań diagnostycznych w tej chorobie jest przezklatkowe badanie echokardiograficzne. Wykonywane jest w celu oceny anatomii mięśnia serca, oceny kurczliwości globalnej i odcinkowej lewej komory, oceny aorty piersiowej oraz naczyń płucnych. Cel pracy: Celem pracy była ocena znaczenia przezklatkowej echokardiografii w diagnostyce choroby niedokrwiennej serca. Skrócony opis stanu wiedzy: Wśród wielu objawów i następstw w chorobie niedokrwiennej serca może występować upośledzenie funkcji skurczowej i rozkurczowej lewej komory, niedokrwienna niedomykalność zastawki mitralnej oraz powiększenie lewego przedsionka. U pacjentów po zawale mięśnia serca, objęty niedokrwieniem obszar ulega włóknieniu i zanikowi oraz przestaje pełnić swoje funkcje. W rozpoznawaniu choroby niedokrwiennej serca ważne znaczenie ma echokardiografia obciążeniowa, zwłaszcza w przypadku współistnienia dodatkowych czynników, utrudniających interpretację próby wysiłkowej EKG. Podsumowanie: Badanie echokardiograficzne powinno być wykonywane u każdego pacjenta z podejrzeniem choroby niedokrwiennej serca.

Abstract Introduction: The incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is the highest of cardiovascular disease in societies of highly developed countries. Coronary artery disease is complex of clinical syndrome based on inadequate supply of heart muscle cells with oxygen and nutrients. The clinical <b>picure</b> of CAD shows large variation. One of the valuable diagnostic studies for this disease is transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). TTE is performed to assess the anatomy of the heart, global and segmental left ventricular contractility and the structure of the thoracic aorta and pulmonary vessels. Aim of the study The aim of the study was to evaluate the importance of transthoracic echocardiography in the diagnosis of coronary heart disease. Short description of state of knowledge Among the many symptoms and consequences of coronary artery disease impaired systolic and diastolic left ventricular contractility, ischemic mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement may occur. In patients after myocardial infarction, atrophy and fibrosis of myocardium is leading to impairment of myocardial function. In the diagnosis of coronary artery disease stress echocardiography is important, especially in the case of co-existing additional factors causing difficulty in the interpretation of stress ECG. Conclusion. Echocardiography should be performed in all patients with suspected coronary artery disease. It is the most important test in the differential diagnosis of chest pain. Echocardiography has a predictive value in patients with ischemic heart disease. Keywords: echocardiography, coronary artery disease, diagnosis...|$|E
