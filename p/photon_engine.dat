5000|$|<b>Photon</b> <b>engine</b> has {{replaced}} the normal spaceship engines {{by the end of}} 20th and the beginning of 21st century. It utilizes energy of thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen-tritium plasma combined with s.c. absolute reflector, a material reflecting any (!) electromagnetic waves without loss, to create a propelling force capable of accelerating a spaceship up to relativistic sub-light speeds. See The Land of Crimson Clouds for more info.|$|E
50|$|A cargo spaceship, {{propelled}} by a <b>photon</b> <b>engine</b> {{with a large}} reflective mirror ("sail"), visits the Jupiter system to deliver a cargo to a manned science station on Amalthea. Damaged by meteorites, the spaceship falls into Jupiter, but survives the pressure and floats in the dense atmosphere; the crew manage to work around the damaged mirror and start the main engine to escape Jupiter and finally reach Amalthea.|$|E
5000|$|A spaceship, {{propelled}} by a prototype <b>photon</b> <b>engine,</b> sets off for Venus, which at that time, is an enigmatic and unexplored planet covered by clouds. The tasks {{of the crew}} are a) to test the prototype engine in field conditions and b) to locate and set radio beacons on the s.c. [...] "Uranium Golconda" [...] (a place with incredibly large heavy metals deposits), presumably, found somewhere on the second planet of the Solar System.|$|E
40|$|Basic {{tutorial}} {{article on}} the thermodynamic feasibility of laser engines at {{the present state of}} the art. Three main options are considered: (1) laser power applied externally to a heat reservoir (boiler approach); (2) internal heating of working fluid by resonance absorption; and (3) direct conversion of selective excitation into work. Only (2) is considered practically feasible at present. Basic concepts and variants, efficiency relations, upper temperature limits of laser engines, selection of absorbing gases, engine walls, bleaching, thermodynamic cycles of optimized laser engines, laser-powered turbines, laser heat pumps are discussed. <b>Photon</b> <b>engines</b> and laser dissociation engines are also considered...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{radiation}} {{could possibly}} provide a feasible approach for {{the transmission of}} energy between stations and vehicles in space and on earth. The transmitted energy {{could be used for}} the operational requirements of the receiving space station, lunar base, or spacecraft. In addition, laser energy could also be employed to provide power for the propulsion of vehicles in space. The present status of development regarding the various technological areas involved in an implementation of these objectives is examined, taking into account the possibility of further advances needed to satisfy the technical requirements. Attention is given to laser-induced chemistry for converting the radiation energy into chemical energy. Other subjects considered are related to photovoltaics, optical diodes, thermo-electronics, laser rockets, and <b>photon</b> <b>engines...</b>|$|R
50|$|A laser {{could be}} used as a <b>photon</b> rocket <b>engine,</b> and would solve the reflection/collimation problem, but lasers are {{absolutely}} less efficient at converting energy into light than blackbody radiation is - though one should also note the benefits of lasers vs blackbody source, including unidirectional controllable beam and the mass and durability of the radiation source.|$|R
5000|$|Subspace jump has {{replaced}} the <b>photon</b> <b>engine</b> in the 21st century. This technology {{is based on the}} subspace physics and uses the [...] "wrapping" [...] of traditional space in order to achieve a condition in which a material body, e.g. a spaceship, is [...] "stretched" [...] between two points in space for a short time. This {{has nothing to do with}} traditional space travelling and is much more like teleportation but unlike null-T (see below) it is not applicable on a planet surface because of some technical restrictions. See Escape Attempt for more info.|$|E
50|$|First of all, it {{was marked}} by {{extensive}} exploration of Earth's own secrets such as those the ocean and deep underground. However, more fascinating were the studies of space. At the beginning they were limited to exploration of the Solar System (see The Land of Crimson Clouds), but with {{the invention of the}} <b>photon</b> <b>engine,</b> inter-stellar flights became possible (see Ruzhena). Simultaneously, due to various technological advances in other fields, {{by the end of the}} 21st century Earth was capable of satisfying all material needs of its citizens including spaceships for amateur exploration of the galaxy.|$|E
40|$|High performance, {{high power}} fibre lasers (FLs) are now well {{established}} as an extremely robust and reliable <b>photon</b> <b>engine</b> enabling a growing and diverse number of demanding industrial and medical applications [1 - 3]. Compared to rival technologies, such as CO 2, LPSS, DPSS and disk lasers, FLs offer {{a number of}} unique characteristics that have resulted in their wide adoption in {{an increasing number of}} industrial sectors. In addition to enhancing existing applications, FLs have been very successful in enabling novel applications and thus continuing to increase their market share<br/...|$|E
40|$|A Bussard ramjet is a {{relativistic}} spacecraft, {{fueled by}} fusion energy of cosmic matter that is {{collected during the}} flight. We derive the equation of motion of such a spaceship for a given mass density in space and the fusion mass defect. Two ramjet engine scenarios, where the thrust for propulsion is generated by emission of photons or acceleration of matter, are outlined. As long as not all collected matter is transformed into fusion energy, mass engines are superior to <b>photon</b> <b>engines.</b> If the collected matter is stopped by the spacecraft before fusion it may not reach relativistic terminal velocities. For an ideal ramjet, where no matter is stopped for the generation of energy for propulsion, endless acceleration and relativistic velocities may be obtained such that crossing the universe in a human lifespan would be possible. A journey along one space coordinate and the smallest possible radii of curves were evaluated. The results are compared to the plots in the novel “Tau Zero” by Poul Anderson...|$|R
50|$|Exit Games is a German {{venture capital}} financed company, founded in 2003, {{with offices in}} Hamburg and Portland {{offering}} <b>Photon,</b> a multiplayer <b>engine</b> for cross-platform realtime multiplayer games, massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs), chat and voice chat on various technological platforms, including mobile, PC and consoles.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{physical}} {{implementation of the}} <b>Photon</b> Carnot <b>engine</b> (PCE) based on the cavity QED system [M. Scully et al, Science, 299, 862 (2003) ]. Here, we analyze two decoherence mechanisms for the more practical systems of PCE, the dissipation of photon field and the pure dephasing of the input atoms. As a result we find that (I) the PCE can work well to some extent even {{in the existence of}} the cavity loss (photon dissipation); and (II) the short-time atomic dephasing, which can destroy the PCE, is a fatal problem to be overcome.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the development of a novel, versatile optical sensor platform for optical metrology and chemical sensing. We demonstrate the feasibility of embedding optical components between bonded silicon wafers with receptor cavities and optical windows to create a self-contained sensor microsystem {{that can be used for}} in-situ measurement of hostile environments. Arrays of these sensors internal to a silicon wafer can enable optical sensing for in-situ, real-time mapping and process development for the semiconductor industry in the form of an instrumented substrate. Single-die versions of these optical sensor platforms can also enable point-of-care diagnostics, high throughput disease screening, bio-warfare agent detection, and environmental monitoring. Our first discussion will focus on a single-wavelength interferometry-based prototype sensor. Several applications are demonstrated using this single wavelength prototype: refractive index monitoring, SiO 2 plasma etching, chemical mechanical polishing, photoresist cure and dissolution, copper etch end-point detection, and also nanopore wetting phenomena. Subsequent sections of this dissertation will describe efforts to improve the optical sensor platform to achieve multi-wavelength sensing function. We explore the use of an off-the-shelf commercial RGB sensor for colorimetric monitoring of copper and aluminum thin-film etchings. We then expand upon our prior work and concepts to realize a fully integrated, chip-sized microspectrometer with a <b>photon</b> <b>engine</b> based on a diffraction grating. The design, fabrication, and demonstration of a working prototype with dimensions < 1 mm thick using standard planar microfabrication techniques is described. Proof-of-concept demonstrations indicate the working principle of dispersion, although with a low spectral resolution of 120 nm. With working knowledge of the issues of the first prototype, we present an improved 5 -channel microspectrometer with a spectral range 400 - 900 nm and demonstrate its ability for spectral identification with 3 different phosphor powder samples. Finally, we conclude with suggestions for future areas of research...|$|E
5000|$|Players {{could join}} either the Federation or Klingon Empire, {{although}} {{the difference was}} purely cosmetic and each side had identical ships. In games where one team had too many players, new players would be forced onto the smaller team. When joining, the player was presented {{with a list of}} ships on each side that were not currently being played, and could re-enter the game in the same ship if they were killed. Each ship was equipped with warp and impulse <b>engines,</b> <b>photon</b> torpedoes, phasers, deflector shields, a computer, life support, sub-space radio, and a tractor beam. Each ship started with 5000 units of energy, 2500 units of shield strength, and 0 units of damage. If a ship receives 2500 points of damage it is destroyed, and a ship that loses all of its energy is likewise [...] "dead". In addition to total damage for the ship as a whole, each hit would do damage to a part of the ship, which would be rendered inoperative if this reached 300 points.|$|R
