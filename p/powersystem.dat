40|$|The {{power system}} {{modelled}} {{in this thesis}} work has been developed for simulationwhen e. g. the production in {{some part of the}} power system is changed. The <b>powersystem</b> has been modelled according to the swing mass of the system, the frequencydependency of the load and the turbine governor. The model determines the systemfrequency, the period of regulation and the power exchange between the differentsubsystems in the Nordic synchronized system. In this model the system frequency is assumed to be the same in all different parts ofthe power system and the voltage conditions in the power system are neglected. Forthat reason power swings does not occur between different subsystems in the <b>powersystem,</b> which usually occur {{as a result of the}} swinging connection between thetransmissions line. The loads in this power system are modelled to be voltageindependent. The power system has been implemented in Matlab Simulink. The model has beenimplemented according to different transfer block functions, such as transferfunctions, amplifiers and limiters. Two different power systems have been developedin this model, a 3 -district model and a 10 -district model. The 10 -districts model is thesubdivision of the Nordic synchronized system in 10 districts. The number of districtsdefines the number of hydropower or steam power block functions with swing massesin the model, i. e. there are three hydropower block functions with swing masses in the 3 -district model. In both power systems the loads are modelled to be frequencydependent and controlled according to the turbine governor in the system. Thehydropower block functions in the power system can easily be changed to i. e. windpower block functions. The power system modelled in this thesis work was compared to a more accuratesimulation, (real time simulation) which is for ARISTO-simulation. Comparisonbetween the result of this model and simulations in the real time simulator are made tostudy i. g. the change of frequency when the system production is increased.
