40|$|Abstract — Small cracks or chips of {{a product}} appear very {{frequently}} {{in the course of}} continuous production of an automatic press process system. These phenomena become the cause of not only defective product but also damage of a <b>press</b> <b>mold.</b> In order to solve this problem AE system was introduced.

40|$|<b>Press</b> <b>molding</b> {{of silicon}} (Si) /high-density {{polyethylene}} (HDPE) composite {{is an important}} technology for producing thin hybrid infrared (IR) optics with microstructures. In this research, Si-HDPE hybrid micro-lens arrays were press molded under various conditions, and the form accuracy and surface integrity of the molded lenses were evaluated. Air trapping occurs inside the micro-lens cavities during molding in a non-vacuum environment, which leads to severe surface defects. To investigate the air trapping phenomenon, a new in-situ observation system was developed which enables real-time direct observation of the molding process. From the in-situ observations, {{it was found that}} air traps were formed among the HDPE pellets during melting, and an increase in the pressing force will increase the pressure of the trapped air, forming trenches on the lens surface. The trapped air also impacts the mold coating, causing trench formation on the coating surface. To minimize air trapping, the molding temperature, and pressing force must be strictly controlled. By performing <b>press</b> <b>molding</b> in a vacuum environment, trench formation was completely eliminated. Moreover, polymer shrinkage compensation was performed to improve the lens form accuracy...|$|E

These panels were transformed into sand-wich panels with near-pyramidal truss cores by EDM plunge-cutting the corrugated core between the face sheets with a shaped cuprite electrode. The flat top corrugation permits adhesive to be applied consistently, and the selected dimen-sions leave a substantial bond area after cutting, resulting in a strong core-to-sheet bond.
