2500|$|A year later, in {{the autumn}} of 1928, he {{established}} himself as self-employed in Budapest with a precision-tool workshop, whose activity was based on three of his own inventions, which he had patented. All these inventions were intended for the registration and improvement of the running of the spinning machines. At times he had about ten employees in his workshop. The name of his firm was Dipl.ing. G.K. Tolnai, Finommechanikai készülékek for Fine mechanical devices, in Mester útca 13, IX. Budapest in the district of Ferencváros. In his machine workhop in Budapest he manufactured the machines, which he had invented, and he also collaborated with the manager of the company Linum Taussig, Paul Hermann (Hungarian: Hermann Pál), Budaörsi út 45, XI. Budapest, Újbuda in the district of Újbuda. The machine was a tool that consisted of one or more parts, and used energy to achieve a particular goal. The machines were usually powered by [...] mechanical, chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and were frequently motorized. A <b>powered</b> <b>tool</b> also requires moving parts to classify as a machine.|$|E
5000|$|A {{soldering}} gun is an approximately pistol-shaped, electrically <b>powered</b> <b>tool</b> for soldering metals using tin-based solder {{to achieve a}} strong mechanical bond with good electrical contact. The tool has a trigger-style switch {{so it can be}} easily operated with one hand. The body of the tool contains a transformer with a primary winding connected to mains electricity when the trigger is pressed, and a single-turn secondary winding of thick copper with very low resistance. A soldering tip, made of a loop of thinner copper wire, is secured {{to the end of the}} transformer secondary by screws, completing the secondary circuit. When the primary of the transformer is energized, several hundred amperes of current flow through the secondary and very rapidly heat the copper tip. Since the tip has a much higher resistance than the rest of the tubular copper winding, the tip gets very hot while the remainder of the secondary warms much less. A tap on the primary winding is often used to light a pilot lamp which also lights the workpiece.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A rigid-flexible {{coupling}} {{model of}} sliding guideway working in powered turret {{for a new}} developed multifunction NC lathe is built up based on Solidworks, ANSYS and ADAMS. A solid model of is built up by the 3 d-Modeling software Solidworks, and then the built model of sliding guideway is imported into finite element analysis software ANSYS to analyze elastic deformation. A mnf file of model generated by ANSYS which is a flexible body is fed into ADAMS to replace the rigid body of assembly. A dynamics simulation is conducted by considering a typical cutting processing like milling on lathe, the deformation of fixed guideway in working condition is checked. The analyzed results show {{that it is more}} rational and accurate to apply rigid-flexible coupling dynamic simulation for analyzing such mechanical system and this type of sliding guideway used in <b>powered</b> <b>tool</b> turret can stand up with cutting load and can meet the requirement...|$|E
40|$|Data mining is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) <b>powered</b> <b>tool</b> {{that can}} {{discover}} useful information within a database. Efficient algorithms to find frequent patterns {{are important in}} data mining research. Frequent pattern mining required in many business applications such as market analysis, production control, Science exploration and group decision support systems etc. Several effective data structures, such as two-dimensional arrays, trees and tries have been proposed to collect candidate and frequent item-sets. It seems as the tree structure is most extractive for storing item-sets. The outstanding tree has been proposed so far is called FP-tree (Frequent Pattern) which is a prefix tree structure. Some advancement with the tree structure is called the CATS tree (Compressed Arranged Transaction Sequences). CATS Tree extends the idea of FP-Tree to improve storage compression and allow frequent pattern mining without generation of candidate item-sets. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is the emerging field of artificial intelligence. ACO has shown a tremendous performance to solve many real time problems like Travelling Salesman Problem, Packet routing in Network and so on. Here in this paper {{the representation of the}} database is shown as a Graph to solve the frequent pattern mining problem, which is a prime requirement to solve any problem by ACO...|$|E

40|$|The project ”Investment {{proposal}} for grinding station for service work of screw feeders” has been performed {{during the spring}} semester 2014 for the course Bachelor’s thesis for degree of  Bachelor of science in machine engineering at Karlstad’s University. The project has been performed in cooperation with Fiber Workshop which is a service department in the company Valmet AB. Valmet AB {{is a company that}} develops and manufacture soft paper tissue machines. The screw feeder is a part that is used to feed, and squeeze out the water out of woodchips. The service work of the screw feeder mostly consists of service work on two major parts, namely the feeder screw and the split pipe, which the feeder screw is mounted in.   The purpose of the project was to evaluate the service work, namely the grinding in a working environment point of view. Another goal of the project was to present some improvements for this process.   The working environment which has been evaluated is primarily the risk of vibration damage in arm and hand, the risk of ergonomic musculoskeletal disorders and even a dust measurement has been performed, with the help of Hans-Olov Karlsson from the company Clarahälsan. The result from the working environment survey suggests that the operator exceed the work environment limits in regards to the risk of suffering damages from vibrations in the hand and arm. The grinding work of the split pipe {{is considered to be a}} bigger problem in regards to ergonomics than the grinding on the feeder screw. The split pipe requires the operator to stand in a posture that takes more concentration and precision than for the feeder screw. The results from the dust measurements indicate that the levels of dust in the air, during the grinding, are within the approved limits. The safety equipment used by the operator is adequate, there has however been a desire of the client to find a solution that manages the dust.   One of the improvement proposals consists mainly of a number of accessories for the grinder to help improve the problems with vibration and the dust. The possibilities to circumvent the grinding work for the screw pipe altogether have been examined. It is possible to begin to mill the screw pipe in the lathe, which has a <b>powered</b> <b>tool.</b> For it to be possible to mill the split pipe instead of grinding, the lathe machine is in need of an extension arm, to be able to reach down the whole split pipe. This arm has been designed and developed in this project...|$|E

5000|$|This {{database}} {{was created}} {{in order to provide}} information to the general public about the sound and vibrations generated by <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> during their use. Many of these tools produce sound levels high enough to damage hearing if precautions are not taken. Since this information was not readily available in most cases, NIOSH created the <b>Power</b> <b>Tools</b> Database and ran tests on <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> to provide the information. According to NIOSH, the <b>Power</b> <b>Tools</b> Database [...] "is particularly helpful in determining the 'real-world' noise level of <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> as they are used on the job." [...] The database {{is a part of the}} much larger Hearing Loss Prevention Research Program conducted by NIOSH. The Hearing Loss Prevention Research Program is designed to reduce occupational hearing loss through research and the application of the research to real-world situations. This database advances this goal by informing buyers and users of <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> of the dangerous levels of noise and vibrations that they are exposed to while using the tools. By making people aware of how loud <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> actually are, NIOSH is attempting to encourage the design and production of quieter <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> and the proper use of hearing protectors when using such tools. The database is also part of a larger NIOSH prevention initiative called Buy Quiet. In recent years, Buy Quiet programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment.|$|R

Most <b>power</b> <b>tools,</b> including drills, circular saws, belt sanders, and chainsaws, operate at sound levels above the 85 dB limit, some even reaching over 100 dB.
