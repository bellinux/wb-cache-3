5|$|In 2006, Lexus {{incorporated}} the first production eight-speed automatic transmission {{in an automobile}} with the LS 460, and the gearbox was later adapted for the GS 460 and IS F models. Continuously variable transmissions, regenerative brakes, and electric motors have been used on all Lexus hybrid models. In 2007, Lexus executives signaled intentions to equip further models with hybrid powertrains, catering to demands for a decrease in both carbon pollution and oil reliance. Hybrid models have been differentiated by separate badging and lighting technology; in 2008, the LS 600h L became the first <b>production</b> <b>vehicle</b> to use LED headlamps.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Ford Focus Electric {{was planned}} to include warning sounds for pedestrians. Ford Motor Company {{developed}} four alternative sounds, and in June 2011 involved the electric car fans by {{asking them to}} pick their favorite from the four potential warning sounds through the Focus Electric Facebook page. However, ultimately Ford decided to hold off including warning sounds unless federal legislation required it, and no such system was implemented on the <b>production</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E

5|$|In May 1985, {{designers}} {{started work}} on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow front profile. By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a conventional <b>production</b> <b>vehicle</b> of the time (C'd 0.29). For the passenger cabin, the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather {{for two years before}} settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan, and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in September 1986, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 13 May 1987.|$|E

25|$|The CSR was {{released}} in the United States {{in the summer of}} 2006 in very limited quantities. As a <b>production</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the CSR is illegal because of lack of safety features and failure to meet emissions standards.

Chassis may be purchased from Superformance, Caterham's official distributor in the United States, and their network of dealerships nationwide.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Carroll Shelby International and AC Motor Holdings, Ltd. {{announced}} {{production of}} an authentic Shelby/AC Cobra, with the <b>production</b> <b>vehicle</b> arriving at dealers in July 2004.

In February 2004, the first handcrafted aluminum body shell was built at Frimley works.|$|E
25|$|Although the C1 Corvette chassis and {{suspension}} design {{were derived}} from Chevrolet's full-size cars, the same basic design was continued through the 1962 model even after the full-size cars were completely redesigned for the 1955 model year. This {{was due to the}} combined factors of the relatively high re-engineering and re-tooling costs for this low-volume <b>production</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the continued potential for cancellation of the car, and the increased size and weight of the all-new suspension design for the full-size cars, which made it unsuitable for use in the lighter weight Corvette.|$|E

As {{installed in the}} recently renewed Nissan Cedric/Gloria, this {{had been the first}} turbo engine to power a Japanese <b>production</b> <b>vehicle.</b> One notable aspect of the turbo versions was that they were not intercooled and there was no form of blowoff valve, only an emergency pressure release valve. As usual with Japanese cars of this period, there were four- or five-speed manuals and a three-speed automatic, with a column-shifted three-speed manual available on lower end cars and vans.|$|E

On November 18, 2013, the USAF's 88th Test and Evaluations Squadron (TES) in Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada took {{delivery of the}} initial set of the GAARV for operational testing. Tests were scheduled to commence in March 2014 and will validate the vehicle's suitability and effectiveness for the Guardian Angel (GA) weapon system. The 88th TES is focused on maximising HH-60 Pave Hawk, HC-130 Hercules, and the GA weapon systems capability.|$|E
25|$|In January 1990, GM {{chairman}} Roger Smith {{demonstrated the}} Impact, an electric concept car, at the 1990 LA Auto Show.

Alan Cocconi of AC Propulsion designed and built the original drive controller electronics for the Impact, and the design was later refined by Hughes Electronics. On April 18, 1990, Smith announced that the Impact would become a <b>production</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E

The Aura replaced the Saturn L-Series, which was discontinued after the 2005 model year. Although Saturn had never intended to use the Aura name for the <b>production</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the name ended up sticking {{as a result of the}} popularity of the concept.|$|E
500|$|In June 1961 Fleming sold {{a six-month}} option {{on the film}} rights to his {{published}} and future James Bond novels and short stories to Harry Saltzman. Saltzman formed the <b>production</b> <b>vehicle</b> Eon Productions along with [...] Albert R. [...] "Cubby" [...] Broccoli, and after an extensive search, they hired Sean Connery on a five-film deal, beginning with Dr. No (1962). Connery's depiction of Bond affected the literary character; in You Only Live Twice, the first book written after Dr. No was released, Fleming gave Bond a sense of humour that was not present in the previous stories.|$|E
500|$|The Talbot Tagora is an {{executive}} car developed by Chrysler Europe and produced by Peugeot Société Anonyme (PSA). The Tagora was marketed under the Talbot marque after PSA took over Chrysler's European operations in 1979. PSA presented the first <b>production</b> <b>vehicle</b> in 1980 and launched it commercially in 1981. The Tagora {{fell short of}} sales expectations, described as a [...] "showroom flop" [...] just a year after its launch, and PSA cancelled the model two years later.
