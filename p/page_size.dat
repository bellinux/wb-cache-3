25|$|All of the manuscripts are codices, {{which was}} {{surprising}} {{to the first}} scholars who examined the texts because {{it was believed that}} the papyrus codex was not extensively used by Christians until the 4th century. Most of the manuscripts dated to the 3rd century, with some as early as the 2nd. The manuscripts also helped scholars understand the construction of papyrus codices. There is significant variation between the construction of each manuscript. <b>Page</b> <b>size</b> ranges from about 14 by 24.2cm (P. III) to 18 by 33cm (P. VI). Some of the manuscripts were constructed of a single gathering (quire) of papyrus sheets (Pap. II, VII, IX + X), while in others the gathering varies from a single sheet (I) to five (V) or seven (VII). The largest codex (P. IX/X) is believed to have contained roughly 236 pages.|$|E

He employed multiple layers of watercoloring, and sometimes used gouache. All species were drawn life size which accounts for the contorted poses of the larger birds as Audubon strove to fit them within the <b>page</b> <b>size.</b> Smaller species were usually placed on branches with berries, fruit, and flowers. He used several birds in a drawing to present all views of anatomy and wings. Larger birds were often placed in their ground habitat or perching on stumps. At times, as with woodpeckers, he combined several species on one page to offer contrasting features. He frequently depicted the birds' nests and eggs, and occasionally natural predators, such as snakes. He usually illustrated male and female variations, and sometimes juveniles. In later drawings, Audubon used assistants to render the habitat for him. In addition to faithful renderings of anatomy, Audubon also employed carefully constructed composition, drama, and slightly exaggerated poses to achieve artistic as well as scientific effects.|$|E
500|$|The St Cuthbert Gospel, {{also known}} as the Stonyhurst Gospel or the St Cuthbert Gospel of St John, is an early 8th-century pocket gospel book, written in Latin. [...] Its finely {{decorated}} leather binding is the earliest known Western bookbinding to survive, and both the 94 vellum folios and the binding are in outstanding condition for a book of this age. [...] With a <b>page</b> <b>size</b> of only , the St Cuthbert Gospel is one of the smallest surviving Anglo-Saxon manuscripts.

500|$|The {{size of the}} Cuthbert Gospel {{places it}} within the Insular {{tradition}} of the [...] "pocket gospels", of which eight Irish examples survive, including the Book of Dimma, Book of Mulling, and Book of Deer, although all the others are or were originally texts of all four gospels, {{with the possible exception}} of a few pages from the Gospel of John enshrined with the Stowe Missal in its cumdach or book-reliquary. [...] There was a tradition of even smaller books, whose use seems to have been often amuletic, and a manuscript of John alone, with a <b>page</b> <b>size</b> of 72 x 56mm, was found in a reliquary at Chartres Cathedral in 1712. [...] It is probably Italian from the 5th or 6th century, and the label it carried in 1712 saying it was a relic of St Leobinus, a bishop of Chartes who died in about 556, may be correct. [...] The other examples are mostly in Greek or the Coptic language and contain a variety of biblical texts, especially psalters. [...] Julian Brown concludes that the three Latin manuscripts of John [...] "seem to attest an early medieval practice of placing a complete Gospel of St. John in a shrine, as a protective amulet; and it seems reasonable to conclude that our manuscript was placed in St. Cuthbert's coffin to protect it".|$|E

[...] Often the bas de page image shows a scene of contemporary life related in some way to the main devotional image, or an Old Testament subject. The borders, with one exception, all follow the same relatively simple design of stylised foliage, typical of the period when the work was started, and are largely or completely from the first phase of decoration in the 14th century. [...] These would have been done by less senior artists in the workshop, or even sub- contracted out.

[...] David faces the large Beatus initial (f 15r) that begins the text of the Latin Book of Psalms, which includes three scenes from the life of David along the stem of the [...] "B": David beheading Goliath, bringing his head to Saul, and harping, crowned as king. [...] This occupies about two thirds of the page. The usual ten English sections into which the psalms are divided are marked by smaller decorated initials, some historiated with figures. [...] These mark the start of Psalms 26 (f 38v), 38 (f 53r), 51 (f 66), 51 and 52 (f 66r and v), 68 with Jonah thrown off his ship, and riding on the whale (f 80v), 80 (f 98r), 97 (f 114r), 101 with Christ in the initial, and a kneeling monk below it with a scroll reading [...] "Lord hear my prayer" [...] (f 116), and 109 with the Trinity (f 132).
