According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% <b>palmitoleic</b> <b>acid.</b> Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E

40|$|Plasmodium {{falciparum malaria}} kills roughly 2. 5 million people, mainly children, annually. Much of this {{mortality}} {{is thought to}} arise from {{the actions of a}} malarial toxin. This toxin, identified as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), is a major pathogenicity determinant in malaria. A malarial molecule, Pfj, labeled by [3 H]glucosamine like the GPIs, was identified as a non-GPI molecule. Here we show that Pfj is able to down-regulate tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production induced by the GPI of P. falciparum. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that Pfj was not a single molecule but represented a number of molecules. Separation methods, such as cation-exchange chromatography and thin-layer chromatography, were used to isolate and identify the following four main fatty acids responsible for the inhibitory effect on TNF-α production: myristic, pentadecanoic, palmitic, and <b>palmitoleic</b> <b>acids.</b> This regulatory effect on cytokine production suggests that there is balanced bioactivity for the different categories of malarial lipids...|$|R

Vaccenic acid was the most abundant fatty acid, with lesser amounts of myristic, palmitic, and <b>palmitoleic</b> <b>acids.</b> No branched-chain or cyclopropane fatty acids were found. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that ethanol induces the synthesis of phospholipids enriched in vaccenic acid in Escherichia coli (L. O. Ingram, J. Bacteriol. 125 : 670 - 678, 1976). The fatty acid composition of Z. mobilis, an obligately ethanol-producing microorganism, represents an extreme of the trend observed in E. coli. In Z. mobilis, vaccenic acid represents over 75 % of the acyl chains in the polar membrane lipids. Glucose and ethanol had no major effect on the fatty acid composition of Z. mobilis.

Free fatty acids (FFAs) are critically involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus type 2, in particular the regulation of pancreatic beta-cells survival. The objectives {{of this study were}} to elucidate the role of palmitic <b>acid,</b> <b>palmitoleic,</b> and oleic <b>acid</b> in the regulation of podocyte cell death and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We show that palmitic acid increases podocyte cell death, both apoptosis and necrosis of podocytes in a dose and time-dependent fashion. Palmitic acid induces podocyte ER stress leading to an unfolded protein response (UPR) as reflected by the induction of the ER chaperon immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) and proapoptotic C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) homologous protein (CHOP) transcription factor. Of note, the monounsaturated <b>palmitoleic</b> and oleic <b>acid</b> can attenuate the palmitic acid-induced upregulation of CHOP, thereby preventing cell death. Similarly, gene silencing of CHOP protects against palmitic acid induced podocyte apoptosis.

The fact that there was no treatment based on cell differentiation therapy for solid tumors prompted us to study whether novel transdifferentiating molecules secreted by human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) could prevent cancer progression.
