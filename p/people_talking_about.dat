25|$|The writing {{style of}} the lyrics is {{deliberately}} obscure; Oakey says this is because he wanted the band's lyrics to provoke thought and get <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> their songs. Often the meanings behind the songs have only been disclosed by Oakey in various interviews given since the album's release. An {{important point is that}} the album essentially evolved during 1981 and wasn't written from a single conceptual starting point.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} into how often gay men use homosexual slang terms that are often not understandable to those outside of the LGBT community. The particular slang used by gay men as well as lesbians has been recorded in a number of specialist dictionaries, and according to researcher Greg Jacobs, is that the terminology listed in said dictionaries revolves heavily around sexual matters including terms for sex organs, preferences and activities, although Jacobs questions whether this accurately reflects {{the amount of time spent}} by gay <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> sex and sexuality or whether it is down to methodological assumptions that conversations amongst LGBT people is primarily dominated with talk about sex.|$|E
25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. Auditory hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the subject behind his/her back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|E

Glenn Gamboa of Newsday called [...] "Little Miss Obsessive" [...] a [...] "passable Pinkish pop" [...] song, but {{stated that it}} isn't enough to keep Bittersweet World from [...] "going sour". Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote that Simpson's voice is [...] "insufficiently meaty" [...] {{to be able to}} sing the song. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song [...] "quite awful", writing that exploring [...] "the endless possibilities of the word 'over' in the chorus" [...] is [...] "a bit of a slog".|$|E
500|$|According to Carter, it {{was evident}} that The X-Files was a [...] "series in making" [...] during this episode. The episode was {{inspired}} by common ufology. Believers in aliens have long thought that Nevada's Area 51 and Nellis Air Force Base have alien technology captured during 1947's Roswell UFO incident. The name Ellens Air Force Base was derived from the name of Carter's college girlfriend, whose last name was Ellens. The story's military project was inspired by a rumor that the United States Air Force had started a project named the Aurora Project. Carter said he remembered <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> this rumor and that its inclusion in the story was a [...] "nod" [...] to it. The surname for the two guest characters, Budahas, came from a high school friend of Carter. Duchovny and Anderson had never used a gun or held one before, so they were trained on how to hold them properly.|$|E

Fans have lobbied for actress Cindy Morgan to be in the film with active campaigns online, such as [...] "Yori Lives" [...] on Facebook, which is independent of Morgan herself. [...] "All I know is what I'm seeing online," [...] Morgan said. [...] "I am so thrilled and touched and excited about the fan reaction and about <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the first one and how it relates to the second one. I can't tell you how warm a feeling I get from that. It just means so much." [...] No one from Tron: Legacy had contacted Morgan, and she did not directly speak with anyone from the sequel's cast and crew. As Dr. Lora Baines, Cindy Morgan had appeared with Bruce Boxleitner (as Alan Bradley) at the Encom Press Conference in San Francisco, April 2, 2010.|$|E

500|$|The use of fake weapons {{generated}} controversy. After {{the concert}} in Colorado, Madonna was criticised {{over the use}} of fake weapons, since the public was sensitized by the 2012 Aurora shooting, which occurred at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Burns, a radio broadcaster in the region, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "You could see people kinda looking at each other. I heard the word 'Colorado', you know, 'Aurora', 'shooting'. You could hear <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it, and it was little bit unsettling. I saw two or three people get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and shooting up bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity crowd into a dark place that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music". In a review of the concert, Ross Raihala from Twin Cities mentioned that there was [...] "darkness hung over much {{of the first half of}} the show" [...] because of the performances of [...] "Revolver" [...] and [...] "Gang Bang." ...|$|E
500|$|The Windows {{version was}} {{originally}} slated {{for a late}} 2008 release but slipped to at least October 2008. Blow decided to prevent Braid being overwhelmed {{by a number of}} large titles that were scheduled for release in late 2008 and pushed the release to early 2009. The PC version benefited from the work by Blow to create Braid on a standardized platform like the Xbox 360 in order to finish the core game before dealing with various compatibility issues inherent in PC development. Prior to the game's release for Microsoft Windows, Blow had priced the game at , using pricing models for other games such as World of Goo and Crayon Physics Deluxe. However, this was priced $5 more than the Xbox Live version, leading many to criticize his pricing choice. Due to this response, Blow reduced the price to meet the Xbox Live cost, stating that he would [...] "rather have <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the game itself" [...] than complaining about its cost. Hothead Games ported Braid to both the PlayStation 3 and Macintosh platforms. A Linux port was done by Ryan C. Gordon and released in December 2010 as part of the second Humble Indie Bundle alongside the Windows and Mac version. It was further added as a bonus to the Humble Indie Bundle V. Blow said that a WiiWare version would not be possible under Nintendo's current size restrictions.|$|E

[...] Wilson has said: [...] "I felt that ... however abominable the decision might be, it was rational that if you were an administration and did not want <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the intelligence or talking about what underpinned the decision to go to war, you would discourage them by destroying the credibility of the messenger who brought you the message.

[...] Reacting against the blurring of theological distinctions, Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits wrote that [...] "Judaism is Judaism because it rejects Christianity, and Christianity is Christianity because it rejects Judaism." [...] Theologian and author Arthur A. Cohen, in The Myth of the Judeo-Christian Tradition, questioned the theological validity of the Judeo-Christian concept and suggested that it was essentially an invention of American politics, while Jacob Neusner, in Jews and Christians: The Myth of a Common Tradition, writes, [...] "The two faiths stand for different <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> different things to different people." ...|$|E
