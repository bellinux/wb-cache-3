40|$|Premiums {{constitute}} {{the cost of}} insurance protection. There are however authors who tend to find some tax elements in them. This article aims at presenting {{the conditions in which}} such a view may be regarded as correct and when the marks which are the characteristics of taxes can also appear in premiums paid on account of insurance as part of the Polish insurance system. Taxes are commonly regarded as being obligatory and not subject to refund. Compulsion cannot, however, be the right criterion that differentiates taxes from other payments and also from premiums. Although premiums are compulsory payments paid by the insured they cannot be compared to taxes. It is not because of the fiscal reasons that obligatory insurance was introduced. It was destined to popularize it in those fields in which such popularization proved to be necessary. Premiums as a cost for insurance protection must be equivalent. The degree of the rate of payment depends upon the realization of the principle of equilibrium between the premiums and the amount recoverable. In practice the premiums paid by the insured are not only destined to make good any loss or damage or to pay benefits, but also form a <b>preventive</b> <b>fund</b> and a reserve fund. The part of premiums which constitutes the <b>preventive</b> <b>fund</b> can be regarded as a specific kind of tax securing financial means for undertakings preventing the occurrence of events. The other part of the premiums which provides for the reserve fund bears even more distinctive marks of a tax. This fund is a form of revenue subject to refunding. As the insurance company has never exercised its right to that fund the payments on that account may be considered a permanent source of budget income.

40|$|Abstract. Combating the {{financing}} of terrorism (CFT) is a core pillar of the fight against terrorism. An effective CFT can play investigative, analytical, deterrent and even <b>preventive</b> roles. Terrorists <b>fund</b> themselves from {{a great variety of}} sources. Especially since 9 / 11, many instruments giving power to governments to counter {{the financing}} of terrorism have been adopted. However, the achievements so far are very modest and this combat is very far from being accepted as successful. Our strategies, by addressing the challenges confronted, need to be re-examined and adapted in accordance with the new conditions so as to be effectively implemented in practice. Undoubtedly, instead of rhetorical collaboration, those strategies require real international and bilateral cooperation in the fields of intelligence sharing, police and judicial cooperation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this classic {{grounded}} theory study was to understand how seniors who are living independently resolve issues influenced by visual impairment and high fall risk. We interviewed and observed 13 seniors with visual impairment in their homes. We also interviewed six visual instructors with experience from many hundreds of relevant incidents from {{the same group of}} seniors. We found that the seniors are resolving their main concern of ‘‘remaining themselves as who they used to be’’ by self-preservation. Within this category, the strategies maintaining the established self and defying deterioration emerged as the most prominent in our data. The theme maintaining the established self is mostly guided by change inertia and includes living the past (retaining past activities, reminiscing, and keeping the home intact) and facading (hiding impairment, leading to avoidance of becoming a burden and to risk juggling). Defying deterioration is a proactive scheme and involves moving (by exercising, adapting activities, using walking aids, driving), adapting (by finding new ways), and networking by sustaining old support networks or finding new networks. Self-preservation is generic human behavior and modifying this theory to other fields may therefore be worthwhile. In addition, health care providers may have use for the theory in fall <b>preventive</b> planning. <b>Funding</b> Agency: Halland County Research Council, Sweden</p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the process of}} translating an evidence-based, telephone-delivered physical activity and dietary behavior change intervention from research into practice. Design: Descriptive case study. Setting/Subjects: Nongovernment, primary medical care based community health organization. Intervention: Telephone-delivered intervention targeting physical activity and diet in primary medical care patients. Measures/Analysis: Systematic documentation of process outcomes related to intervention adoption and adaptation. Results: Research-community partnerships were critical in facilitating translation, including (1) an initial competitive advantage within a State Health. Department <b>funded</b> <b>preventive</b> health initiative; (2) advocacy to ensure the adopt on of the intervention, (3) subsequent support for the adaptation of program elements to ensure fit of the program with the community organization's objectives and capacities, while maintaining feasible elements of fidelity with the original evidence-based program; (4) the integration of program management and evaluation systems within the community organization; and (5) ongoing support for staff members responsible for program delivery and evaluation. Preliminary process evaluation of the Optimal Health Program supports the acceptability and feasibility of the program within community practice. Conclusions: Intervention characteristics central to adoption can be influenced by research-community partnerships.

40|$|Rural {{primary care}} {{services}} {{have the potential}} {{to play a major role}} in reducing the gap in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes between rural and metropolitan Australians, particularly in men at high risk of CVD. The aim of this study was to explore the self-reported behaviours and satisfaction with their general practice/practitioner of men at high risk of CVD, and attitudes of rural primary care clinicians regarding the role of primary care in CVD prevention. This observational research was addressed through survey questionnaires with rural men at high risk of CVD and semi-structured interviews with rural primary care clinicians. Fourteen rural primary care practices from towns with populations less than 25000 participated. One hundred and fifty-eight high-risk men completed the questionnaire. Their responses demonstrated poorly controlled risk factors despite a willingness to change. Alternatively, rural primary care clinicians (n≤ 20) reported that patients were unlikely to change and that illness-based funding models inhibited cardiovascular preventive activities. Australians living in rural areas have worse CVD outcomes. In addition, there is a disparity in the assumptions of health providers and male patients at high risk of CVD in rural areas. This necessitates innovative rural primary care models that include a blended payment system that incentivises or <b>funds</b> <b>preventive</b> care alongside an emphasis on lifestyle advice, as well as an explicit strategy to influence clinician and patient behaviour to help address the disparity. 7 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The most {{effective}} public health measure for Babesia is avoidance of tick exposure. This {{can be performed}} through personal prevention strategies such as avoiding tick-infested areas (especially during high tick season between May and September), remaining covered with light clothing, searching for ticks after being outdoors, and removing discovered ticks from the skin. Other preventive measures include applying diethyltoluamide (DEET), a common repellent that is effective against ticks and insects. (For people who react adversely to DEET, alternative insect repellents should be used.) On a state level, if health departments are particularly motivated, tick elimination is a possibility. In 1906, {{efforts were made to}} eradicate the tick vector of the bovine disease form of babesiosis in the United States. This eradication was recorded as being successfully completed four decades later. Complete eradication efforts would be a long-term project, which would significantly reduce the prevalence of both babesiosis and Lyme disease. However, as public health departments are often short on <b>funding,</b> <b>preventive</b> measures seem to be more recommended over vector control. Due to the relatively low prevalence of the disease and the presence of several reservoirs, babesiosis is currently not a candidate for vaccine-based prevention. In regions where ticks of domestic animals are routinely controlled with chemical acaricides to reduce incidence of infection with B. bovis and B. bigemina, the risk to humans from these parasites will be reduced.|$|R
40|$|This {{supplement}} is {{the second}} {{of a series of}} periodic reports from a CDC initiative to monitor and report on the use of a set of selected clinical preventive services in the U. S. population in the context of recent national initiatives to improve access to and use of such services. Increasing the use of these services can result in substantial reductions in the burden of illness, death, and disability and lower treatment costs. This supplement focuses on services to improve the health of U. S. infants, children, and adolescents. The majority of clinical preventive services for infants, children, and adolescents are provided by the health-care sector. Public health agencies play important roles in increasing the use of these services by identifying and implementing policies that are effective in increasing use of the services and by collaborating with stakeholders to conduct programs to improve use. Recent health-reform initiatives, including efforts to increase the accessibility and affordability of <b>preventive</b> services, <b>fund</b> community prevention programs, and improve the use of health information technologies, offer opportunities to improve use of preventive services. This supplement, which follows a previous report on adult services, provides baseline information on the use of a set of selected clinical preventive services to improve the health of infants, children, and adolescents before implementation of these recent initiatives and discusses opportunities to increase the use of such services. This information can help public health practitioners, in collaboration with other stakeholders that have key roles in improving infant, child, and adolescent health (e. g., parents or guardians and their employers, health plans, health professionals, schools, child care facilities, community groups, and voluntary associations), understand the potential benefits of the recommended services, address the problem of underuse, and identify opportunities to apply effective strategies to improve use and foster accountability among stakeholders. The findings described in this supplement can help improve collaboration among public health and other stakeholders who influence infant, child, and adolescent health (e. g., parents or guardians and their employers, health plans, health professionals, schools, child care facilities, community groups, and voluntary associations) to increase the use of selected clinical preventive services among U. S. infants, children, and adolescents. Increased use can substantially reduce illness and long-term disability and improve health and quality of life. This supplement underscores that the use of the clinical preventive services among U. S. infants, children, and adolescents is not optimal and is variable, ranging from < 10...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundAutoimmune {{disease is}} one of the leading causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. In Addisons disease, the adrenal glands are targeted by destructive autoimmunity. Despite being the most common cause of primary adrenal failure, little is known about its aetiology. MethodsTo understand the genetic background of Addisons disease, we utilized the extensively characterized patients of the Swedish Addison Registry. We developed an extended exome capture array comprising a selected set of 1853 genes and their potential regulatory elements, for the purpose of sequencing 479 patients with Addisons disease and 1394 controls. ResultsWe identified BACH 2 (rs 62408233 -A, OR = 2. 01 (1. 71 - 2. 37), P = 1. 66 x 10 (- 15), MAF 0. 46 / 0. 29 in cases/controls) as a novel gene associated with Addisons disease development. We also confirmed the previously known associations with the HLA complex. ConclusionWhilst BACH 2 has been previously reported to associate with organ-specific autoimmune diseases co-inherited with Addisons disease, we have identified BACH 2 as a major risk locus in Addisons disease, independent of concomitant autoimmune diseases. Our results may enable future research towards <b>preventive</b> disease treatment. <b>Funding</b> Agencies|Swedish Research Council; Torsten Foundation; Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; European Union [201167]; Stockholm County Council; Karolinska Institutet; Swedish Society for Medical Research; Swedish Society of Medicine; NovoNordisk Foundation; Tore Nilsons Foundation for Medical Research; Swedish Research Council Formas; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation; Swedish Reumatism Foundation; King Gustaf Vs 80 -year Foundation; Ake Wiberg Foundation; AstraZeneca Science for Life Laboratory Research Collaboration grant (DIS-SECT) </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} any {{organization}} irrespective of size or nature depends, {{to a large}} extent, {{on the effectiveness of}} security within the organization. The need for effective and efficient security in local government councils in Nigeria is long overdue. Local governments in Nigeria in addition to old security problems facing the councils in the past, now face new complicated and sophisticated ones. These are: protection of sensitive information from theft, loss or damage; emergence of organized crime such as arson, murder, fraud, and drugs; riots, demonstrations, civil disorders and work to rule; losses by fire, theft, fraud, damage and natural disasters; theft no longer has the criminal stigma attached to it, etc. The society seems now to support anyone who makes money dishonestly without bothering to find out how such money was made. The inability of local government councils to employ and retain competent and trained security personnel to guard against these numerous security problems to which the system has been vulnerable over the years leaves much to be desired. The managers and administrators of the local government councils in Nigeria should be implored to take the necessary steps to educate the staff on the importance of good and adequate security at all times. For good security to exist in a local government council, it is recommended that the following areas have to be examined at all times: security planning; the security policy; access control procedures; the security manager; the security survey and <b>preventive</b> measures. Adequate <b>funding</b> and good governance are equally complementary to good security. Key Words: Local government council; Security; Effective organization and Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|The {{legal and}} {{economic}} analysis presented here empirically tests the theoretical framework advanced by Kugler, Verdier, and Zenou (2003) and Buscaglia (1997). This paper {{goes beyond the}} prior literature {{by focusing on the}} empirical assessment of the actual implementation of the institutional deterrence and prevention mechanisms contained in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Convention). A sample of 107 countries that have already signed and/or ratified the Convention was selected. The paper verifies that the most effective implemented measures against organized crime are mainly founded on four pillars: (i) the introduction of more effective judicial decision-making control systems causing reductions in the frequencies of abuses of procedural and substantive discretion; (ii) higher frequencies of successful judicial convictions based on evidentiary material provided by financial intelligence systems aimed at the systematic confiscation of assets in the hands of criminal groups and under the control of licit businesses linked to organized crime; (iii) the attack against high level public sector corruption (that is captured and feudalized by organized crime) and (iv) the operational presence of government and/or non-governmental <b>preventive</b> programs (<b>funded</b> by the private sector and/or governments and/or international organizations) addressing technical assistance to the private sector, educational opportunities, job training programs and/or rehabilitation (health and/or behavioral) of youth linked to organized crime in high-risk areas (with high-crime, high unemployment, and high poverty). An empirical jurimetrics model is for the first time developed for the above four anti-crime policy domains in order to assess the legal implementation of organized crime laws. In this context, the empirical results suggest that high-impact prosecutions and effective convictions against criminal organizations are less driven by incarceration of physical persons and more focused on disrupting the production function of criminal groups through asset forfeitures that reduce the amounts of net worth aimed at expanding public corruption rings in order to feudalize States. At the same time, preventive policies aimed at diminishing the flow of youth into criminal activities will also tend to disrupt the street-based operational capacities of organized crime. Accordingly, a paradox of criminal dissuasion emerges that requires the adjustment of Beckers (1968) framework when applied to organized crime. As a result of the jurimetrics-based analysis presented in this study, just relying on traditional legal sanctions to counteract organized crime (e. g., increased incarceration and/or extradition of physical persons) will tend to create an incentive for criminal groups to expand their corruption rings (in order to protect themselves from higher expected sanctions) thus increasing the feudalization of the state by criminal groups while enhancing their operational capacities. This unwanted result of applying traditional criminal sanctions will occur if the network of criminal assets (net worth {{in the hands of a}} network of licit and illicit businesses) is not hampered by intelligence and judicial authorities first. In the cases where criminal asset networks remain untouched, the data in this paper show that criminal groups will simply react to higher expected punishments by re-assigning their relatively untouched financial resources to expanding their rings (scope) and scale of corruption at higher levels in order to protect themselves. As a result, organized crime and high level corruption grow even when the expected punishment aimed at the members of criminal enterprises is increasing at the same time. The jurimetrics-based results in 107 countries show that, in the absence of an active financial intelligence-based criminal assets forfeiture program, high-level corruption grows rapidly while, paradoxically, public sectors continue to devote more criminal justice system resources to incarcerating increasing numbers of organized crime members. At the same time, empirical analysis shows that higher probabilities of sanctions combined with stiffer sentencing guidelines on the books against organized crime members do not play their dissuasive role in the absence of preventive programs to reduce the flow of youth to criminal groups. This constitutes the paradox of criminal sanctions where more frequent and stiffer punishments applied to physical persons lead to higher levels of organized crime and higher level corruption. The deterioration of institutional performance against criminal enterprises in Afghanistan and México and the recent 2001 - 2007 significant improvements experienced by Colombia and Jordan can be explained jointly by financial intelligence, judicial capacities, and preventive capabilities coordinated by public sectors and civil societies. ...|$|R
