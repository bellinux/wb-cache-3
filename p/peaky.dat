40|$|Multiresolution models {{such as the}} wavelet-domain hidden Markov tree (HMT) model {{provide a}} {{powerful}} approach for image modeling and processing because it captures the key features of the wavelet coefficients of real-world data.

Thus we propose a new HMT model based on the two-state, zero-mean Laplace mixture model (LMM), the LMM-HMT, which provides significantly potential for characterizing real-world textures. By using the HMT segmentation framework, we develop LMM-HMT based segmentation methods for image textures and dynamic textures.

50|$|The codings {{generated}} by algorithms implementing a linear generative {{model can be}} classified into codings with soft sparseness and those with hard sparseness. These refer to the distribution of basis vector coefficients for typical inputs. A coding with soft sparseness has a smooth Gaussian-like distribution, but <b>peakier</b> than Gaussian, with many zero values, some small absolute values, fewer larger absolute values, and very few very large absolute values. Thus, many of the basis vectors are active. Hard sparseness, on the other hand, indicates {{that there are many}} zero values, no or hardly any small absolute values, fewer larger absolute values, and very few very large absolute values, and thus few of the basis vectors are active. This is appealing from a metabolic perspective: less energy is used when fewer neurons are firing.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} effects of {{metropolitan}} industrial structure on housing market outcomes.

Homeownership rates are found to be lower in new economy metropolitan areas, while crowding is higher. Although the distribution of housing values, costs, and rents was more equal in new economy markets, the cause would seem to be differences in area income levels, with poorer metropolitan statistical areas having greater inequalities. Regression analysis is used to identify the contribution of traditional supply and demand factors, such as job growth, income, and residential construction, as well as new economy indicators, to housing market outcomes. Rather than being fundamentally different, new economy housing markets are found to be faster and more extreme versions of traditional housing markets...|$|R

40|$|The Southampton Oceanography Centre ocean retracker, {{initially}} {{designed for}} ERS- 1 altimeter data, has been updated for RA- 2 Envisat waveform data, {{in order to}} be used to retrieve some geophysical parameters such as, the significant wave height, the backscatter power and the range. The algorithm, based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimation, is capable of obtaining those parameters, assuming both linear and non-linear conditions. The use of the non-linear case, allows us to estimate additional parameters, such us the skewness, which relates to the nonlinearity of the wave field (i. e. <b>peakier</b> crests/flatter troughs) and a crossskewness term, with no clear physical significance. In the present work, we have retrieved the significant wave height and the range from RA- 2 Envisat 18 Hz waveforms using the SOC ocean retracker. First results show that the linear MLE model retrieves parameters consistent with those in RA- 2 SGDR records. This work is part of an ESA study for the exploitation of the Envisat radar altimeter individual echoes and S-band data for ocean, coastal zone, land and ice/sea-ice altimetry (RAIES). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{runoff from}} blanket {{peatland}} catchments {{tends to be}} dominated by flashy stormflows. However, it is not known whether changes in vegetation cover influence the nature of stormflow hydrographs from blanket peatlands. This is important since degraded peatlands are of concern to restoration bodies who seek to understand the wider impacts of restoration investment on ecosystem services. This paper tests the hypothesis that peak flows are significantly higher and lag times shorter at the catchment scale when blanket peat vegetation cover is reduced. Storm hydrograph data from the 1950 s to the present day are analysed from a blanket peat catchment in northern England. The proportion of the catchment that was vegetated appears to have declined between the early 1950 s and mid 1970 s and then increased again to the present day. The changes in the proportion of bare peat over the catchment are coincident with changes in storm hydrographs. Hydrographs were significantly <b>peakier</b> with higher peaks per unit of rainfall (0. 40 m 3 mm− 1 compared with 0. 27 m 3 mm− 1) and narrower hydrograph shapes during the more eroded periods in the catchment and less so as the site has revegetated. Mean peak storm discharge was also significantly higher during the most eroded period. Thus, {{for the first time we}} have found evidence in a blanket peat headwater catchment that vegetation cover influences river flow response to rainfal...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} method to extract the shape {{information}} of line profiles from discrete kinematic data. The Gauss-Hermite expansion, which is widely {{used to describe the}} line of sight velocity distributions extracted from absorption spectra of elliptical galaxies, is not readily applicable to samples of discrete stellar velocity measurements, accompanied by individual measurement errors and probabilities of membership. We introduce two parameter families of probability distributions describing symmetric and asymmetric distortions of the line profiles from Gaussianity. These are used as the basis of a maximum likelihood estimator to quantify the shape of the line profiles. Tests show that the method outperforms a Gauss-Hermite expansion for discrete data, with a lower limit for the relative gain of approx 2 for sample sizes N approx 800. To ensure that our methods can give reliable descriptions of the shape, we develop an efficient test to assess the statistical quality of the obtained fit. As an application, we turn our attention to the discrete velocity datasets of the dwarf spheroidals of the Milky Way. In Sculptor, Carina and Sextans the symmetric deviations are consistent with velocity distributions more peaked than Gaussian. In Fornax, instead, there is an evolution in the symmetric deviations of the line profile from a <b>peakier</b> to more flat-topped distribution on moving outwards. These results suggest a radially biased orbital structure for the outer parts of Sculptor, Carina and Sextans. On the other hand, tangential anisotropy is favoured in Fornax. This is all consistent with a picture in which Fornax may have had a different evolutionary history to Sculptor, Carina and Sextans. Comment: MNRAS, accepted for publication, minor change...|$|R
