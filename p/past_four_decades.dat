5|$|There is an {{impending}} real estate boom in Saudi Arabia, with increasing demand and rising prices {{due to high}} population growth and a short supply of housing, which may include a demand for high-end luxury units, {{such as those in}} Jeddah Tower. To boost growth, the Saudi Arabian government is going to invest US$67 billion (SR251 billion) in building 500,000homes throughout the country. According to Saudi officials, about 900 new homes are needed a day to meet the demand of the rapidly growing population, which has nearly quadrupled in the <b>past</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> Jeddah Tower is also an attempt to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy, which, holding a quarter of the world's oil reserves and being one of the founding OPEC nations, is currently largely dependent on its crude oil exportation, which accounts for nearly 75% of government revenues and 90% of exports. This generates enough income to support Saudi Arabia as a welfare state, which spends billions of dollars on job creation and housing for its lower income residents.|$|E

25|$|These {{seemingly}} contradictory trends {{were driven}} by the heavy, ongoing Hispanic and Asian immigration wave of the <b>past</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> For whites and blacks, these immigrants (and, increasingly, their U.S.-born children who are now of marrying age) have enlarged the pool of potential spouses for out-marriage. But for Hispanics and Asians, the ongoing immigration wave has also enlarged the pool of potential partners for in-group marriage.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture, while of {{shrinking}} {{importance to}} the economy over the <b>past</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades,</b> offers part-time employment to a sizeable portion of the populace. Rice is the main agricultural crop, followed by areca, cashew and coconut. Fishing employs about 40,000 people, though recent official figures indicate a decline {{of the importance of}} this sector and also a fall in catch, due perhaps, to traditional fishing giving way to large-scale mechanised trawling.|$|E

25|$|As T-REX {{began to}} wrap up, CDOT's next major effort began with Colorado Springs Metro Interstate Expansion (COSMIX). It {{could be argued}} that COSMIX was even more {{important}} to Colorado's interests than T-REX had been, since the Colorado Springs corridor of I-25 had seen immense growth over the <b>past</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades,</b> and experienced major choke points all along the 16-mile corridor from Exit 135 (Academy Blvd) in the south to Exit 151 (Briargate Pkwy) in the north.

Cronbach (1950) suggests that the multiple-choice test is comparatively free of sets. There is some evidence (Rapaport & Berg, 1955) which tends to support this con-tention. There are, however, several studies which seem to refute this conclusion. McNamara and Weitzman (1945) report positional preferences in the multiple-choice item. Studies using highly un...|$|R
