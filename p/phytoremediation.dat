5|$|The {{species has}} a long history of use in {{traditional}} medicine in its native range, where it is employed as a treatment for a variety of ailments. This has led to the investigation of its phytochemistry. Its flowers can be eaten in salads or crushed for dyemaking, and the plant has been considered for potential use in the <b>phytoremediation</b> of contaminated soil.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its use in folk medicine, P.atriplicifolia is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail. Its flowers are eaten in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Kashmir, adding a sweet flavor to salads; {{they can also be}} crushed to yield a blue colorant that can be employed in cosmetics or as a textile dye. This species is considered a candidate for use in <b>phytoremediation</b> because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, and ability to accumulate toxic heavy metals from polluted soil.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very high concentrations of copper within the plants, more so than the 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant with the next highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. The results suggest that the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and <b>phytoremediation.</b>|$|E

25|$|The city of Växjö {{reduced its}} fossil fuel {{consumption}} by 30% between 1993 and 2006, and aimed for a 50% reduction by 2010. This was to be achieved largely by way of biomass fired teleheating. Another example is the plant of Enköping, combining the use of short rotation plantations both for fuel {{as well as for}} <b>phytoremediation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pollutants and {{contaminants}} can {{be removed}} from ground water by applying various techniques thereby making it safe for use. Ground water treatment (or remediation) techniques span biological, chemical, and physical treatment technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the biological treatment techniques include bioaugmentation, bioventing, biosparging, bioslurping, and <b>phytoremediation.</b> Some chemical treatment techniques include ozone and oxygen gas injection, chemical precipitation, membrane separation, ion exchange, carbon absorption, aqueous chemical oxidation, and surfactant enhanced recovery. Some chemical techniques may be implemented using nanomaterials. Physical treatment techniques include, {{but are not limited}} to, pump and treat, air sparging, and dual phase extraction.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new approach to}} restoring land is to inoculate soil with AM fungi when reintroducing vegetation in ecological restoration projects (<b>phytoremediation).</b> It has enabled host plants to establish themselves on degraded soil and improve soil quality and health. Soils' quality parameters were significantly improved long-term when a mixture of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species was introduced compared to noninoculated soil and soil inoculated with a single exotic species of AM fungi. The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and soil nitrogen content, higher soil organic matter content, and soil aggregation, attributed to higher legume nodulation {{in the presence of}} AMF, better water infiltration, and soil aeration due to soil aggregation.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} {{of environmental problems}} through biological means is known as bioremediation and the specific use of plants for example by using <b>phytoremediation.</b> Bioremediation is sometimes {{used in conjunction with}} a pump and treat system. In bioremediation, either naturally occurring or specially bred bacteria are used to consume contaminants from extracted groundwater. This is sometimes referred to as a bio-gac system. Many times the groundwater is recycled to allow for continuously flowing water and enhanced bacteria population growth. Occasionally the bacteria can build up to such a point that they can affect filtration and pumping. The vessel should then be partially drained. Care must be taken to ensure that a sharp change in the groundwater chemistry does not kill the bacteria (such as a sudden change in pH).|$|E
25|$|Physical, chemical, and {{biological}} {{methods have been}} used to remediate arsenic contaminated water. Bioremediation is said to be cost effective and environmentally friendly Bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite, the toxic form of arsenic to humans, to arsenate. Arsenate (+5 oxidation state) is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water, while arsenite (+3 oxidation state) is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments. Arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate. Many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor. This is a useful method in ground water remediation. Another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via <b>phytoremediation</b> but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered.|$|E

2500|$|This mustard {{plant is}} used in <b>phytoremediation</b> to remove heavy metals, such as lead, from the soil in {{hazardous}} waste sites {{because it has a}} higher tolerance for these substances and stores the heavy metals in its cells. In particular, [...] Brassica juncea was particularly effective at removing cadmium from soil (Schneider et al.). The process of removing heavy metals ends when the plant is harvested and properly discarded. <b>Phytoremediation</b> {{has been shown to be}} cheaper and easier than traditional methods for heavy metal reduction in soils. In addition, it has the effect of reducing soil erosion, reducing cross-site contamination.|$|E
50|$|Hairy root {{cultures}} can be {{used for}} <b>phytoremediation,</b> and are particularly valuable for studies of the metabolic processes involved in <b>phytoremediation.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} methods {{that have been}} shown to be {{effective}} as in decontamination and remediation of contaminated soils. A highly applicable method of soil remediation known as <b>phytoremediation</b> has been specifically shown to be effective as when used in soils contaminated with heavy metals. <b>Phytoremediation</b> has been demonstrated to be effective as for correcting Crotalaria juncea found in soils contaminated with herbicides. The method of <b>phytoremediation</b> functions effectively in decontamination and remediation by using microorganisms and plants to remove, transfer, stabilize, or destroy harmful elements. Crotalaria juncea found in soils contaminated with herbicides revealed high <b>phytoremediation</b> capacity. In addition, <b>phytoremediation</b> is effective in removal of copper, which has been identified as a metal strongly present in the soil of Crotalaria juncea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phytoremediation</b> is a {{cost-effective}} plant-based approach of remediation that {{takes advantage of}} the ability of plants to concentrate elements and compounds from the environment and to metabolize various molecules in their tissues. It refers to the natural ability of certain plants called hyperaccumulators to bioaccumulate, degrade, or render harmless contaminants in soils, water, or air. Toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants are the major targets for <b>phytoremediation.</b> Knowledge of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of <b>phytoremediation</b> began to emerge in recent years together with biological and engineering strategies designed to optimize and improve <b>phytoremediation.</b> In addition, several field trials confirmed the feasibility of using plants for environmental cleanup.|$|E

50|$|<b>Phytoremediation</b> may {{be applied}} {{wherever}} the soil or static water environment has become polluted or is suffering ongoing chronic pollution. Examples where <b>phytoremediation</b> {{has been used}} successfully include the restoration of abandoned metal mine workings, and sites where polychlorinated biphenyls have been dumped during manufacture and mitigation of ongoing coal mine discharges reducing the impact of contaminants in soils, water, or air. Contaminants such as metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives, and crude oil and its derivatives, have been mitigated in <b>phytoremediation</b> projects worldwide.
