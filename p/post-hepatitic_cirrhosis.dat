40|$|Experience in liver {{transplantation}} (OLT) in Italy over {{a ten-year}} period is reported, Data were obtained using a multiple-items form collected from Italian liver transplant centres (reference centres) and other Italian institutions actively involved {{both in the}} processes of evaluation of the candidates and the follow-up of liver transplant recipients (afference centres), During this period, a total of 1046 liver transplants were performed on 954 patients, with a cumulative proportional survival of 71 %, The most common indication for liver transplantation was <b>post-hepatitic</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> due to either hepatitis B virus (+/- hepatitis Delta virus) or hepatitis C virus infection, Good survival rates were observed, particularly in controversial indications, such as alcoholic cirrhosis, post-hepatitic hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, most likely due to proper and careful selection of the patients, Cirrhosis, secondary to an autoimmunity-based liver disease, showed {{the highest rate of}} rejection episodes, Infections, in our study population, were {{the most common cause of}} death after transplantation...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of cirrhosis and primary hepatic carcinoma in the autopsy material is studied. in 4389 autopsies performed, {{during the last}} 9 years we found 134 (3 %) cases of cirrhosis and 24 (0. 5 %) cases of primary hepatic carcinoma. The majority of the patients were from NorthWest and west part of the city. of the 134 cases of cirrhosis 90 correspond to the portal type, 24 to the post-necrotic type, 12 to the biliary cirrhosis, 6 to the post-hepatitis cirrhosis and two cardiac cisrhosis. 19 of our 134 cases of cirrhosis, occured in children between the age of 4 months to 13 years. The liver of the 90 cases diagnosed, Portal cirrhosis were characterized grossely by weights from 510 - 2800 Gr and fine uniformly nodular surface. Micscopically there was marked, fatty change of hepatic cells, focal and spotty necrosis and delicated fibrillary tongue, interconnecting portal spaces. of the 24 cases post-necrotic cirrhosis 4 had had (26 %) an antecedent jaundice. The liver ranged, from 700 - 2500 gr., presenting broad scarring and coars nodules. In bur six cases, <b>Post-hepatitic</b> <b>cirrhosis,</b> the liver were redish brown, and presented uniform nodules, 0, 5 to 1. 5 Cm. in diameter. Liver weights varried form 850 to 1200 Gr. Microscopically 17 cases of carcinoma were hepato-carcinoma, two presented mixed structures of hepatoma and 5 cases were cholangio Carcinoma. Six of hepatomas showed previous portal cirrhosis and one mixed carcinoma showed previous portal cirrhosis...|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims The AFP {{model was}} shown to be {{superior}} to the Milan criteria for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation in a French population. Our aim was to test the AFP model in a non-French, post-hepatitic cirrhosis-based population of HCC candidates. Methods 574 patients transplanted for HCC in four Italian centers were studied. AFP score was assessed at the last evaluation before liver transplantation (LT). Probabilities of recurrence and survival were estimated by the log-rank test or competing risk analysis and compared according to the AFP model. Results 24. 7 % patients were beyond Milan criteria. HCC complicated hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) cirrhosis in 58. 7 % and 24 % of the cases, respectively. Five-year probabilities of recurrence differed according to AFP score ⩽ 2 vs. > 2 in the whole population (13. 2 ± 1. 8 % vs. 49. 8 ± 8. 7 %, p 2 were 71. 7 ± 2. 2 % vs. 42. 2 ± 8. 3 % (p < 0. 001, HR = 2. 14). Conclusions The AFP model identifies HCC candidates at low risk of recurrence, otherwise excluded by Milan criteria in a population with a predominance of post-hepatitic-related HCC. The AFP score can be proposed for selection of HCC candidates in programs with {{a high proportion of}} viral/HCV-related cirrhosis. Lay summary Selection criteria for liver transplantation of patients affected with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are based on the Milan criteria, which {{have been shown to be}} too restrictive, precluding access to liver transplantation for some patients who might be cured by this operation. Recently, a French group of researchers developed a new selection model called the AFP model, or AFP score, allowing some patients with HCC not meeting Milan criteria to be transplanted with excellent results. In the present work, the AFP score was tested in a population of non-French patients transplanted for HCC occurring mainly on post-hepatitic (HCV or HBV) cirrhosis. The results confirm that in this specific population, as in the original French population of patients, the AFP model better selects patients with HCC eligible for transplantation, compared to Milan criteria. We conclude that the AFP score, which has been officially adopted by the French organization for Organ Sharing for HCC patients, can also be implemented in countries with an important burden of HCC occurring on <b>post-hepatitic</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> © 2016 European Association for the Study of the Live...|$|E
