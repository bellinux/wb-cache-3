30|$|Smucker et al. (2005) {{also noted}} that fire {{severity}} effects on non-cavity nesting species varied {{with the amount of}} time since the fire. For instance, they noted that some species such as <b>pine</b> <b>siskins</b> (Carduelis pinus) peaked in the first year after the fire and declined thereafter. Smucker et al. (2005) hypothesized that short term increases in the availability of seeds were responsible for the pattern they observed in <b>pine</b> <b>siskins</b> and other seed-eating species. Due to the variability in temporal responses to fire severity by different species, Smucker et al. (2005) cautioned that pooling data across years might potentially mask important temporal variation in avian responses. The temporal responses of flickers and siskins illustrate the potential issues associated with pooling data. For instance, pooling data across multiple years for siskins would have masked the strong response that siskins showed in the first year after the fire. Likewise, pooling data for northern flickers for the first three years following the fire would mask the fact that researchers did not detect this species regularly until the third year following the fire.|$|R

40|$|Advisor: Muir EatonElaborate and/or {{colorful}} bird plumages {{have often}} been hypothesized to evolve via sexual selection for increased ornamentation. Differences in coloration among individuals can be influenced {{by a number of}} variables, including diet, hormones, and disease resistance. Specifically, Hamilton and Zuk 22 (1892) hypothesized a link between an individual’s parasite resistance and more colorful plumage signals, as a mechanism for individuals to advertise their ‘quality’. While much data has accumulated documenting the nutritional and hormonal regulation of various types of plumage coloration, relatively little data exists reporting the effects of parasite load on individual plumage colors (i. e. melanin and carotenoid pigmented feathers). We collected ectoparasites and plumage color data from 24 purple finches (Carpodacus purpureus), 11 <b>pine</b> <b>siskins</b> (Carduelis pinus), and 21 American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis).

40|$|From winter 1997 {{to summer}} 1998, an {{epizootic}} of salmonellosis affected {{several species of}} songbirds over a large area of the eastern North American continent. This article describes {{the details of this}} epizootic in the Canadian Atlantic provinces, based on laboratory examination of dead affected birds and on suspected but unconfirmed cases of salmonellosis reported by members of the public. The common redpoll (Carduelis flammea) was the species most often affected, followed by <b>pine</b> <b>siskins</b> (C. pinus), purple finches (Carpodacus purpureus), evening grosbeaks (Coccothraustes vespertinus), and American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis). A poor body condition and necrotizing and fibrinopurulent esophagitis and ingluvitis were the most common gross lesions in these birds.

50|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>siskin</b> in its typical morph is a drab bird, whereas European siskin (a bird {{the species}} does not {{naturally}} co-exist with), in many plumages, is much brighter. Adult male European siskins are bright {{green and yellow}} with a black cap, and an unstreaked throat and breast; <b>pine</b> <b>siskin</b> {{does not have a}} corresponding bright plumage. Adult female European siskins also usually have green and yellow plumage tones: for example, yellow in the supercilium and {{on the sides of the}} breast, green tones in the mantle and yellow in the rump. Adult pine siskins of the typical morph do not have green and yellow tones, although juveniles can have a yellowish-buff wash on their underparts and buff-toned wingbars, for a short period prior to their autumn migration. The ground colour of the underparts of European siskin is normally pure white, whereas on <b>pine</b> <b>siskin</b> it is usually a dirtier colour. In female and juvenile European siskin, the centre of the belly and lower breast are often largely or entirely unstreaked, whereas in most pine siskins the streaking extends across the whole of the underparts. The wingbars of European siskin are broad and yellow (with the tips white) whereas they are normally narrower and buffish white in <b>pine</b> <b>siskin,</b> contrasting with the bright yellow flash at the base of the primaries. Pine siskins have a longer bill, usually with a straight culmen, compare with a short bill in European siskin, with a decurved culmen. There is a green morph of <b>pine</b> <b>siskin,</b> closer in appearance to European siskin; these birds make up only 1% of the population. These are closer in appearance to female European siskin, but differ in that they have a yellow-wash on the undertail-coverts (white on European siskin), no yellow in the supercilium, reduced underparts streaking, and much yellow at the base of the tail and remiges; there may also be a difference in the extent of yellow in the underparts but this needs further study.|$|E

50|$|These birds forage in trees, {{shrubs and}} weeds. They mainly eat seeds, plant parts and some insects. In winter, they often feed in mixed flocks {{including}} American goldfinches and redpolls. Small seeds, especially thistle, red alder, birch, and spruce seeds, {{make up the}} majority of the pine siskin's diet. In a part of their esophagus called the crop, the species can store up to 10% of their body weight in seeds overnight, providing extra food on cold days. They will alternately eat the young buds of willows, elms and maples, and the soft stems and leaves of weeds and even young garden vegetables. They'll glean the seeds of grass, dandelions, chickweed, sunflowers and ragweed. Bird feeders often attract <b>pine</b> <b>siskins,</b> where they may eat fragments of heavy-shelled seeds, such as black oil sunflowers, left behind by heavier-billed bird species. In summer, they will eat many insects, especially aphids, as well as a few spiders and grubs, which they then feed to the young as a protein-rich food that contributes to their growth. By the time of winter, even first year siskins predominately eat seeds.|$|R

40|$|Censuses of two 20 -acre plots {{in upper}} Logan Canyon, Utah, {{were made by}} the spot-mapping method during 1970 and 1971 to {{determine}} the differences in composition and density of breeding-bird populations in aspen stands of significantly different density and stature. The less dense stand of greater average d. b. h., average height and per cent ground cover had 20 breeding species totalling 615 pairs per 100 acres (expressed as equivalent territories). The more dense stand of smaller trees and brushy undergrowth had 14 breeding species with 267. 5 equivalent territories per 100 acres. Nine species were found on both areas. Observations of foraging height were made concurrently with recordings of time spent at various methods of feeding- ground, vi foliage, bark, hover, and hawking- for the birds of the more open stand. Comparison showed that more ground- and low bush-nesters were present on the dense, brushy stand whereas more cavity-nesters were found in the larger trees. Cavity excavation was limited to trees of greater d. b. h. and cavity-dependent birds were thus limited by nest-hole availability.
