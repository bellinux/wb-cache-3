5|$|SS <b>Pennsylvanian</b> was a {{cargo ship}} built in 1913 for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. During World War I she was requisitioned by the United States Navy and {{commissioned}} as USS <b>Pennsylvanian</b> (ID-3511) in September 1918, and renamed {{two months later}} to USS Scranton. After her naval service, her original name of <b>Pennsylvanian</b> was restored.|$|E
5|$|The main rock {{formations}} in {{and near the}} watershed of Nanticoke Creek include the Mauch Chunk Formation (which dates to Late Mississippian and Early <b>Pennsylvanian</b> times), the Pottsville Group (from <b>Pennsylvanian</b> times), and the Llewellyn Formation (also from <b>Pennsylvanian</b> times). The Lower Red Ash coal seam is present near {{the headwaters of the}} creek.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the United States entered World War II, <b>Pennsylvanian</b> was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration (WSA), and, as with her pre-U.S. Navy service in World War I, she {{continued}} to be operated by American-Hawaiian. From July to September 1942, <b>Pennsylvanian</b> sailed between New York and Caribbean ports, calling at Trinidad, Key West, Hampton Roads, Guantánamo Bay, and Cristóbal. In January 1943, <b>Pennsylvanian</b> called at Bandar Abbas, Iran, on the Persian Gulf, and returned to Caribbean sailings again by March 1943.|$|E
50|$|Thousands of <b>Pennsylvanians</b> volunteered {{during the}} Spanish-American War, and many <b>Pennsylvanians</b> {{fought in the}} {{successful}} campaign against the Spanish in the Philippine Islands. Pennsylvania was an important industrial center in World War I, and the state provided over 300,000 soldiers for the army. <b>Pennsylvanians</b> Tasker H. Bliss, Peyton C. March, and William S. Sims all held important commands during the war. Following the war, the state suffered {{the effects of the}} Spanish Flu.|$|R

5|$|On 13 September 1918, <b>Pennsylvanian</b> was {{transferred}} to the U.S. Navy at New York and commissioned USS <b>Pennsylvanian</b> (ID-3511) the same day. Assigned to the Navy's Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS), <b>Pennsylvanian</b> loaded a general cargo and sailed for Brest, France, on 30 September. She arrived there on 15 October and sailed for La Pallice the next day, where she unloaded her cargo before departing for New York on 5 November.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pennsylvanian</b> {{was built}} by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was {{employed}} in inter-coastal service via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Panama Canal after it opened. <b>Pennsylvanian</b> {{was one of the}} first two steamships to travel eastbound through the canal when it opened in August 1914. During World War I, as both SS <b>Pennsylvanian</b> and USS Scranton, the ship carried cargo and animals to France, and returned American troops after the Armistice in 1918.|$|E

5|$|Between 1981 and 1983, <b>Pennsylvanian</b> {{equipment}} was turned every night {{to operate a}} second state-supported train, the Fort Pitt, which ran from Pittsburgh to Altoona. Amtrak withdrew this train in early 1983 after the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) declined to continue subsidizing the increased operation. At the time the Fort Pitt carried 30 passengers per day. On October 30, 1983, the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> was extended to New York City, eliminating the transfer at Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Between May and September 1943, <b>Pennsylvanian</b> made four transatlantic {{crossings}} between New York and Liverpool, making intermediate {{stops in}} Loch Ewe and Methil {{while in the}} United Kingdom. The cargo ship made two New York– Guantánamo Bay roundtrips between September and December before resuming transatlantic sailings. After two New York– Liverpool roundtrips between late December 1943 and April 1944, <b>Pennsylvanian</b> left the United States for the final time on 19 May 1944, arriving in Liverpool on 2 June. She called at the British ports of Methil, Loch Ewe, Clyde, and Milford Haven in late June and early July, and, sailing from Barry in mid July, <b>Pennsylvanian</b> arrived at Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, France. There she was scuttled {{as part of the}} breakwater for the Mulberry artificial harbor built to support the Normandy Invasion.|$|E

5|$|On November 7, 1998, Amtrak {{extended}} the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> through to Chicago {{along the route}} of the Capitol Limited via Toledo, finally bringing a daylight connection to Cleveland. The Three Rivers continued to run over a different schedule via Akron and Fostoria. As part of the change Amtrak truncated the eastern end to Philadelphia, enabling the train to complete the run within a single day. The change was driven by Amtrak's growing mail and express business; Pittsburgh–Philadelphia ridership suffered. Amtrak returned the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> to the New YorkPittsburgh route on January 27, 2003, citing low ridership and Amtrak's withdrawal from the express freight business. On November 1, 2004, Amtrak merged the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> and Three Rivers, keeping the latter name with a western terminus in Chicago. Amtrak had sought $2.5million in assistance from Pennsylvania to keep both trains running. On March 8, 2005, Amtrak truncated service to PittsburghNew York and restored the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> name to the route.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pennsylvanian</b> is a {{once a day}} {{replacement}} of the Keystone service between New York and Harrisburg, offering Business Class seating as an upgrade to the coach-only seating on Keystone trains. Prior to Amtrak, the route {{was known as the}} Duquesne, named after Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh, and operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The <b>Pennsylvanian</b> began on April 27, 1980, as a state-supported daylight train between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with connecting service to New York. The train was extended to New York in 1983. Between November 1998 and January 2003, Amtrak shifted the endpoints west to Chicago and Philadelphia, providing daylight service to Cleveland, Ohio. In 2003 the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> reverted to the PittsburghNew York schedule.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{impetus for}} the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> was the discontinuance of the National Limited, a New YorkKansas City train which had provided service over the corridor. The <b>Pennsylvanian</b> began on April 27, 1980, as a state-supported daylight train between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with connecting service to New York via the Philadelphian (a Clocker) westbound and the Montrealer eastbound. At the time the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> was inaugurated, the Broadway Limited was departing Pittsburgh at an inconvenient early morning hour. The new train ran with Amfleet equipment, including a cafe car. Pennsylvania agreed to pay 20% of the train's costs for the first year, or $580,000, with the state and Amtrak eventually splitting the costs 50/50 by the third year.|$|E

Sixty yards into the trip, the <b>Pennsylvanians</b> turned their guns on the Marylanders and a fight ensued with Cresap attempting to use the oars to defend himself. After a short struggle, both Marylanders ended up in the water, holding on to the boat to keep from drowning. The <b>Pennsylvanians</b> tried to force Cresap {{to let go of the}} boat, and when Cresap asked if they intended to murder him, one swore that he did. Cresap eventually escaped when the boat drifted to shallow water near a large rock where Cresap was stranded for several hours until rescued by a friendly Indian.|$|R

5|$|After the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, {{coupled with the}} fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route. <b>Pennsylvanian,</b> on the west side of the canal when it opened, was one of the first two eastbound steamers to traverse the canal during her trip to New York. In late August, American-Hawaiian announced that <b>Pennsylvanian</b> would sail on a San Francisco– Panama Canal– Boston route, sailing opposite of , Honolulan, and sister ship Washingtonian. When landslides closed the canal in October 1915, all American-Hawaiian ships, including <b>Pennsylvanian,</b> returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.|$|E
5|$|In March 1945, the WSA {{offered a}} payment of $565,910 to American-Hawaiian for <b>Pennsylvanian</b> {{as part of}} a $7.2 million {{settlement}} for eleven requisitioned American-Hawaiian ships that had either been sunk, scuttled, or were to be retained by the government.|$|E

5|$|On its inauguration the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> {{ran with}} then-new Amfleet equipment: two coaches and a cafe. Today the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> {{continues}} {{to use an}} all-Amfleet consist {{although the number of}} coaches has grown to six. The train consists of an Amfleet I business class car, an Amfleet I cafe car, an Amfleet I coach, and three Amfleet II long-distance coach cars. Motive power is usually a Genesis diesel-electric locomotive west of Philadelphia. East of Philadelphia, the motive power is a Siemens ACS-64 electric locomotive; an engine swap is made at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Pennsylvanian</b> began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for {{eastbound}} cargo, and Coatzacoalcos for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. <b>Pennsylvanian</b> sailed in this {{service on the}} west side of North America.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} major rock {{formations}} from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods {{are present in}} Quehanna Wild Area.

Below this is the <b>Pennsylvanian</b> Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal, and which forms much of the Quehanna plateau. The next formations {{are found in the}} valleys and gorges which the creeks have eroded over time. The first of these is the Mississippian Pocono Formation, which is buff colored with shale, coal, and conglomerate inclusions; parts of this formation are also known as the Burgoon Sandstone. Below this is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. The lowest and oldest layer is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation.|$|E
