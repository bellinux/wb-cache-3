50|$|Most {{pretreatment}} {{processes are}} not effective {{when applied to}} feedstocks with high lignin content, such as forest biomass. Organosolv, SPORL ('sulfite pretreatment to overcome recalcitrance of lignocellulose') and SO2-ethanol-water (AVAP®) processes are the three processes that can achieve over 90% cellulose conversion for forest biomass, especially those of softwood species. SPORL is the most energy efficient (<b>sugar</b> <b>production</b> per <b>unit</b> energy consumption in pretreatment) and robust process for pretreatment of forest biomass with very low production of fermentation inhibitors. Organosolv pulping is particularly effective for hardwoods and offers easy recovery of a hydrophobic lignin product by dilution and precipitation. AVAP® process effectively fractionates all types of lignocellulosics into clean highly digestible cellulose, undegraded hemicellulose sugars, reactive lignin and lignosulfonates, and is characterized by efficient recovery of chemicals.|$|R

40|$|Three switchgrass cultivars (‘Performer’, ‘BoMaster’, and ‘Colony’ switchgrass) were delignified using NaOH at varying {{concentrations}} and residence {{times at}} 121 oC for improved <b>sugar</b> <b>production</b> in enzymatic hydrolysis. Because of its greater carbohydrate/lignin ratio {{and the more}} substantial lignin reduction upon alkaline attack, ‘Performer’ switchgrass gave greater <b>sugar</b> <b>productions</b> under all the pretreatment conditions investigated. Maximum <b>sugar</b> <b>production</b> from ‘Performer’ was 425 mg/g raw biomass, which was achieved at 1 % NaOH and 0. 5 h. <b>Sugar</b> <b>production</b> increased with the improvement of delignification until the lignin reduction reached 30 %. The more severe pretreatment conditions, which led to greater lignin reductions, did not favor the increase of <b>sugar</b> <b>production</b> because of greater solid losses.

40|$|How {{affected}} are the <b>sugar</b> <b>production</b> in Mozambique and Tanzania by EU sugar regime? What {{does the}} EU sugar reform constitute in these countries? Using theories regarding {{free trade and}} anti-free trade, I am able to answer these questions. The aim {{of this paper is}} to study how the various sugar agreements with EU affect the <b>sugar</b> <b>production</b> in Mozambique and Tanzania. Therefore I am using a method called a most similar system design in this comparative case study. The conclusion is that the EU sugar regime is the main reason to how the <b>sugar</b> <b>productions</b> in developing countries are. This conclusion is drawn since the difference in their developed <b>sugar</b> <b>production</b> is based on the importance of an advantageous sugar agreement. This can be applied to the case in Tanzania, which had a higher sugar export when the country had an advantageous sugar agreement with EU. Now when the trade has been more liberalized with the sugar reform the country does not have the same advantageous agreements with EU and the sugar export has been smaller. Compared to Tanzania Mozambique has had a better development in their <b>sugar</b> <b>production,</b> since their trade agreements with EU is better today than before 2001...|$|R
