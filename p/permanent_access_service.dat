40|$|ABSTRACT: Increasing {{numbers of}} {{organizations}} are “replicating ” the pro-grams of successful microfinance institutions (MFIs). This approach allows rapid start-up using tested models and systems. These strengths are also weaknesses, though, since the models being replicated usually require sub-stantial modifications {{to make them}} appropriate for local conditions. Furthermore, close adherence to “blueprints ” is likely to substitute for care-ful research into the needs and opportunities {{for the provision of}} financial services to the poor—and thus the design of appropriate systems. Replication also risks the suppression of innovative ways of providing still better financial services—particularly when promoted by powerful apex funding organizations, as is currently in vogue among donor agencies. Perhaps the most dangerous form of replication is that driven by consul-tants, lenders, or donors who design or recommend systems they only partly understand, thus giving incomplete or blurred blueprints. Credit is also used as a way to attract clients to meetings (where they may be required to participate in other activities, such as family planning, etc.). This “part-time banking ” is dangerous, both {{as a result of the}} complexity of providing financial services, and because clients come to rely on <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> to these <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|Determinants of {{type and}} timing of initial <b>permanent</b> {{hemodialysis}} vascular <b>access.</b> BackgroundWe undertook a population-based study of hemodialysis (HD) patients to determine which factors are important in predicting the type of <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> initially placed and if a functional <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> is {{in place at the}} start of HD. MethodsSelected characteristics were abstracted from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study (DMMS) Wave 2. Logistic regression was used to estimate the independent contribution of specific characteristics in predicting whether the initial <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> placed was an arteriovenous (AV) fistula compared with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, and in predicting whether <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> (fistula or graft) was in place at the initiation of dialysis. ResultsSixty-seven percent of the patients had an AV graft placed as their first <b>permanent</b> <b>access.</b> Characteristics important in predicting if a fistula was initially placed included age (per decade; aOR = 0. 84, P < 0. 001), female gender (aOR = 0. 52, P < 0. 001), body mass index (per standard deviation; aOR = 0. 70, P = 0. 09), avoiding blood draws (aOR = 1. 96, P < 0. 001), ability to ambulate (aOR = 2. 24, P = 0. 008), underlying renal disease (glomerular compared with diabetes, aOR = 2. 19, P = 0. 009), college education (aOR = 1. 72, P = 0. 002), and sharing in decision making (aOR = 1. 50, P = 0. 02). Thirty-four percent of patients (34. 4 %) had functional <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> at the start of HD. Characteristics important in predicting which patients had functional <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> included serum albumin (per 1 mg/dL increase, aOR = 1. 55, P = 0. 003), erythropoietin prior to starting HD (aOR = 1. 79, P = 0. 002), fewer predialysis nephrologist visits (aOR = 0. 21, P < 0. 001), and when the patient was told they had renal disease (aOR = 0. 33, P = 0. 002). ConclusionsPTFE grafts were the most common initial <b>permanent</b> <b>access.</b> The majority of patients did not have <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> at the start of dialysis. Factors that are thought to compromise identification of adequate veins were important predictors of PTFE graft placement. <b>Permanent</b> <b>access</b> at the start of HD was largely a function of early patient education and early referral to a nephrologist...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the status of initiating pattern of hemodialysis (HD). Five hundred-three patients in 8 University Hospitals were included. Presentation mode (planned vs. unplanned), and access type (central venous catheters [CVC] vs. <b>permanent</b> <b>access)</b> at initiation of HD were evaluated, {{and the influence of}} predialysis care on determining the mode of HD and access type was also assessed. Most patients started unplanned HD (81. 9 %) and the most common initial access type was CVC (86. 3 %). The main reason for unplanned HD and high rate of CVC use was patient-related factors such as refusal of <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> creation and failure to attend scheduled clinic appointments. Predialysis care was performed in 57. 9 % of patients and only 24. 1 % of these patients started planned HD and 18. 9 % used <b>permanent</b> <b>accesses</b> initially. Only a minority of patients initiated planned HD with <b>permanent</b> <b>accesses</b> in spite of predialysis care. To overcome this, efforts {{to improve the quality of}} predialysis care are needed...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether age should inform our approach toward <b>permanent</b> vascular <b>access</b> placement {{in patients with}} chronic kidney disease, we conducted a retrospective cohort study among 11290 non-dialysis patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 25 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 based on 2000 – 2001 outpatient creatinine measurements in the Department of Veterans Affairs. For each age group, we examined the percentage of patients that had and had not received a <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> by 1 year after cohort entry, and the percentage {{in each of these}} groups that died, started dialysis, or survived without dialysis. We also modeled the number of unnecessary procedures that would have occurred in theoretical scenarios based on existing vascular access guidelines. The mean eGFR was 17. 7 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 at cohort entry. Twenty-five percent (n= 2870) of patients initiated dialysis within a year of cohort entry. Among these, only 39 % (n= 1104) had undergone surgery to place a <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> beforehand. As compared with younger patients, older patients were less likely to undergo <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> surgery, but also less likely to start dialysis. In all theoretical scenarios examined, older patients would have been more likely than younger patients to receive unnecessary procedures. If all patients had been referred for <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> surgery at cohort entry, the ratio of unnecessary to necessary procedures after 2 years of follow-up would have been 5 : 1 for patients aged 85 – 100 years but only 0. 5 : 1 for those aged 18 – 44 years. Currently recommended approaches to <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> placement based on a single threshold level of renal function for patients of all ages are not appropriate...|$|R

40|$|Objective We {{aimed to}} {{identify}} trends in vascular access modalities for renal hemodialysis and {{to evaluate the}} influence of service modifications on service performance and patient outcomes. Methods Retrospective analysis of incident and prevalent hemodialysis patients treated by the Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service, Queensland, Australia, between January 2004 and December 2013 was conducted. A comparison of patient demographic characteristics and analysis of trends in access modality and outcomes was performed for each group over the study period. Modifications to service structure and practice changes were also evaluated. Results A total of 1787 patients (456 incident and 1331 prevalent) and 1671 procedures were examined. The proportion of patients starting hemodialysis on a catheter decreased from 79. 2 % to 63. 6 %. Patients starting hemodialysis on a fistula increased from 16. 7 % to a peak of 61. 5 % but fell to 27. 3 % in 2003. Catheter use in prevalent patients decreased from 11. 7 % to 6. 1 %, whilst fistula use increased from 60. 6 % to 88. 5 %. Graft access remained low for the incident group (0. 0 %- 9. 1 %) and was reduced in prevalent patients from 27. 7 % to 4. 9 %. Bloodstream infection rates were reduced from 1. 88 to 1. 60 per 1000 dwelling-days. Endovascular and surgical revision of arteriovenous access was increased. Conclusions Coordinated and multidisciplinary <b>access</b> <b>service</b> provided earlier referral for planned incident access with fewer catheters and increased fistulas with reduced bloodstream infection rates. Modifications to this vascular <b>access</b> <b>service</b> are associated with improved <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> rates for incident and prevalent patients.
