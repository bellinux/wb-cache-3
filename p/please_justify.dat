40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the adolescents’ food preferences during school break. This was a qualitative cross-sectional study with 83 adolescents from a public school in the city of São Paulo. The participants answered the following question: During the school break do you usually eat or drink something? <b>Please</b> <b>justify</b> your answer. The adolescents’ answers were analyzed through a Brazilian qualitative technique called Discourse of the Collective Subject. The ideas were: School Meal Program (36. 2 %), don’t eat anything (26. 7 %), bring from other establishments (20. 1 %) and drink water or juice (17. 1 %). The adolescents who chose the School Meal Program claimed they had no other options. On the other hand, the participants who refused the meal did so because they disliked it and as a result brought snacks from home or food markets. The Discourse of the Collective Subject helps the investigator to understand the ideas related to food and nutrition of a collectivity...|$|E
40|$|What is {{the problem}} under consideration? Why is {{government}} intervention necessary? To date, Patient Choice policies have focussed exclusively on choice on provider for elective care. As such, Choice policy has excluded those patients with Long-term conditions (LTCs). There is an emerging consensus that the extension of choice policy in these sectors- albeit with a different focus to existent choice of provider policies- will be beneficial and important to patients. Government intervention is required to ensure that commissioners attach sufficient priority to the extension of choice in these areas to deliver social inclusion and horizontal equity. What are the policy objectives and the intended effects? The objective of the policy {{is to increase the}} choices available to patients with LTCs over their care. This will be achieved by signalling to commissioners the importance of commissioning a broader range of services for their patients. Enabling greater patient choice and control over their own care by smarter commissioning is intended to deliver benefits- better patient experience; reduction in health inequalities; improved efficiency and effectiveness of care; improved health, well-being and social inclusion- within exisiting budgets. What policy options have been considered? <b>Please</b> <b>justify</b> any preferred option...|$|E

40|$|Country (only if not U. S.) Email address (if available) This article {{illustrates}} {{preparation of}} {{the final version of}} an ASME journal paper submitted for publication using LATEX 2 ε. For the convenience of proofreading and editing, the final version shall be formatted in a single column. This article is formatted based on the contents in the article entitled “An ASME Journal Article Created Using LATEX 2 ε in ASME Format for Testing Your Figures, ” which is a template for preparation of ASME papers submitted for review. An abstract for an ASME paper should be less than 150 words and is normally in italics. Notice that this abstract is to be set in 9 pt Times Italic, single spaced and right <b>justified.</b> <b>Please</b> use this template to test how your figures will look on the printed journal page of the Journal of Mechanical Design. The Journal will no longer publish papers that contain errors in figure resolution. These usually consist of unreadable or fuzzy text, and pixilation or rasterization of lines. This template identifies the specifications used by JMD some of which may not be easily duplicated; for example, ASME actually uses Helvetica Condensed Bold, but this is not generally available so {{for the purpose of this}} exercise Helvetica is adequate. However, reproduction of the journal page is not the goal, instead this exercise is to verify the quality of your figures...|$|R
40|$|Section 2 {{notes that}} a water balance model was {{developed}} to simulate Lake Winnipeg natural outlet capacities and generate outflows and water levels based on the inflows to the lake {{for the period of}} 1977 - 2013. Please provide examples of how this model or a similar one (i. e., spreadsheet based) been used to simulate other large and complex systems. If this model is unique to this situation, <b>please</b> <b>justify</b> the choice of this modeling approach. RESPONSE: The modeling approach used to simulate Lake Winnipeg natural water levels and outflows (LWR Document Appendix 4) is not unique. The water balance model approach is a classical application of reservoir routing, used routinely across the world as standard engineering practice. As a notable and recent local example, this type of modeling approach was employed during the Province’s review of the 2011 Flood to calculate natural water level and outflows for Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin 1. This modeling approach was also used in an earlier study conducted for the Province to assess the impacts of the then-recent construction and operation of LWR on Lake Winnipeg water levels and outflows 2...|$|E
40|$|What is {{the problem}} under consideration? Why is {{government}} intervention necessary? Street works are needed for essential repairs, for example to utilities, but they sometimes overrun. This causes unnecessary disruption and costs to transport users and others and which are estimated by the Department to be at £ 667. 2 million per year. Currently, there are statutory provisions for undertakers of street works to be charged for overruns. However, existing charge levels are not sufficiently high to fully reflect the cost to society of overruns nor incentivise undertakers of street works to minimise overruns. Government intervention is needed to amend these charges so that undertakers of street works bear more of the costs to society of these overruns and so that the charges are more effective. What are the policy objectives and the intended effects? Policy Objective:- To {{reduce the number of}} occasions where utility works in the street take longer than the agreed duration, especially on the most sensitive streets (i. e. those where works are likely to cause the most congestion and disruption). Intended effects:- Reduce the inconvenience and disruption of street works; overrun charges provide an incentive to minimise the number of occasions when works over run. What policy options have been considered, including any alternatives to regulation? <b>Please</b> <b>justify</b> preferre...|$|E
40|$|What is {{the problem}} under consideration? Why is {{government}} intervention necessary? The NHS currently achieves relatively poor healthcare outcomes in certain major healthcare areas when compared to our peer countries. The Department of Health intends to set-up a new NHS Commissioning Board that {{will be responsible for}} securing improved outcomes for NHS patients through the commissioning process. In order to hold this new body to account, it is necessary to set up an accountability framework which should ensure that the Commissioning Board works together with the NHS to deliver better healthcare outcomes. What are the policy objectives and the intended effects? The policy objective is to develop a set of indicators that can be used (i) by the Secretary of State to hold the NHS Commissioning Board to account, (ii) can be used by Parliament to hold the Secretary of State to account for the overall performance of the NHS and (iii) will act as a catalyst for improvement throughout the NHS. The intended effect is to drive forward the improvement in the quality of NHS healthcare and ensure that the right healthcare outcomes for patients are used to hold the NHS to account. What policy options have been considered? <b>Please</b> <b>justify</b> preferred option (further details in Evidence Base) Option 1 : Do nothing. Option 2 : Develop an Outcomes Framework that will allow the Secretary of State to hold the NHS Commissioning Board to account, using indicators selected via a rigorous assessment process When will the policy be reviewed to establish its impact {{and the extent to which}} the policy objectives have been achieved? Are there arrangements in place that will allow a systematic collection of monitoring information for future policy review? It will be reviewed Timing to be determined Ye...|$|E
60|$|We read of Solomon's great {{throne of}} ivory, that {{though there was}} not its like in any kingdom, yet he was not willing that the bow of it should stand before him. It was round behind (1 Kings 10:18-20). O! but God's throne has the bow before, even round about to view, to look upon in sight. Solomon's was but a shadow, and {{therefore}} fit to be put behind; {{but this is the}} sum and substance, and therefore fit to be before, in view, in sight, for God and his people to behold. Thus you see that a rainbow is round about the throne of grace, and what this rainbow is. Look then, when thou goest to prayer, for the throne; and that thou mayest not be deceived with a fancy, look for the rainbow too. The rainbow, that is, as I have said, the personal performances of Christ thy Saviour for thee. Look, I say, for that, it is his righteousness; the token of the everlastingness of the covenant of grace; the object of God's delight, and must be the matter of the justification of thy person and performances before God. God looks at it, look thou at it, and at it only (Psa 71:16). For in heaven or earth, if that be cast away, there is nothing to be found that can <b>please</b> God, or <b>justify</b> thee. If it be said faith pleases God; I answer, faith is a relative grace; take then the relative away, which, as to justification, is this spangling robe, this rainbow, this righteousness of Christ, and faith dies, and becomes, as to what we now treat of, extinct and quenched as tow.|$|R
