40|$|This paper calls {{attention}} {{to the importance of}} social cooperation in irrigation farming. It argues that a mere focus on the technical aspect of irrigation, disregarding its social aspects undermines the long-term benefits of irrigation to rural livelihoods. This assertion draws on lessons from small-irrigation practices in Fogera, in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia, where I conducted fieldwork-based qualitative research. In recent years irrigation farming has drawn a growing interest among farmers in rural Fogera. Farmers practise small-scale irrigation that includes traditional irrigation and <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. Farmers assert that irrigation has brought farming benefits through cultivation of more crops as well as new crops that serve food and cash purposes. Such benefits have particularly spurred the enthusiasm for <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. However, the practice of <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation largely relies on the motor-pump technology, overlooking the social scheme of irrigation. While traditional irrigation involves more social cooperation involving joint activities, water allocations and irrigation schedules, lack of social cooperation and such institutional conditions is widespread in <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. Local classification of irrigation practices also associate the mechanism of irrigation use and management including water use regulations and water use turns with traditional irrigation in contrast to <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. The neglect of social cooperation within current practices of <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation will have significant adverse implications on long-term practices. Farmers have been already concerned about how competitions for water are growing, limiting the duration of water availability and creating water shortage. The study suggests that while farmers’ willingness to practise <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation in Fogera has been stimulated by its livelihood benefits, sustained benefits of this irrigation scheme require social cooperation and feasible institutional conditions that can mediate water usage across user villages...|$|R

40|$|In agriculture, the {{coexistence}} of {{different forms of}} land tenancy or labour contract has been explained so far by several theories related to Marshallian inefficiency, incentives, risk sharing, and transaction costs, including supervision costs. These theories and the empirical evidences have greatly contributed to explain the reasons behind land tenancy or labour contract choice. This study follows up on this. Moreover, it intends to take a further step by focusing particularly on the production technologies at plot level, and by designing and testing a theoretical model based on household profit optimization. This model will {{take into account the}} supervision costs of labour (i) to compare optimum profit derived from plots based on household labour, a sharecropping labour contract, and a wage labour contract, controlling for irrigation equipment (ii) to test the efficiency of the labour contract choice using data from Senegal’s horticultural zone. As expected, the production elasticity of labour decreases when improved irrigation equipment like a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> is used. The technology displays an increasing return to scale on plots without a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> and a constant return to scale on plots irrigated with a <b>motor</b> <b>pump.</b> While on plots without a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> the sharecropping contract is the efficient labour contract choice, leading to a higher optimum profit for the household, on plots irrigated with a <b>motor</b> <b>pump,</b> the wage contract is the best labour contract choice. Consequently, we can conclude from this finding that the use of a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> drives out the sharecropping contract in favour of household labour and the wage labour contract. land tenancy, labour, sharecropping, wage, contract, supervision, household, profit optimization, efficient, irrigation equipment, horticulture, Senegal, Agricultural Finance,...|$|R

The primary objective was {{the development of}} a long life bearings for canned <b>motor</b> <b>pumps.</b> The research project was a joint effort between the University of Virginia, Kingsbury, Incorporated, and Goulds Pump Company. The research team designed, constructed and tested the bearings in a 20 hp, 300 gpm, single stage centrifugal canned <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> running at 3600 rpm. Both magnetic radial and thrust bearings were incorporated in retrofitted bearing housings. Displacement probes sensed the shaft position near the bearings. Control electronics then employed the displacement signal as the feedback signal to control the level of current in the magnets. Proportional-integral-derivative type analog controls were used. The bearings were successfully installed and tested. Performance and vibration tests were conducted on the canned <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> with the original bearings and with the magnetic bearings. No significant change was found in the pump performance but some small changes were observed in the pump vibration characteristics.

40|$|The Ethiopian economy depends {{heavily on}} {{smallholder}} agriculture, and this sector directly affects the country’s economic development, food security and poverty alleviation efforts. The adoption of smallholder irrigation technologies {{as a means}} to tackle these challenges has become an important policy issue in the development agenda of the country. The lack of access to low-cost irrigation technologies is, however, one of the major bottlenecks to increase smallholder irrigation. This paper examines the factors influencing farmers’ decisions to adopt low-cost small <b>motor</b> <b>pumps.</b> The analysis is based on a survey of 800 farm households in four regions of Ethiopia. We use a combination of econometric techniques to find comparable households among adopter and non-adopter sample households. First, we employ a multivariate probit model to check whether a correlation exists between <b>motor</b> <b>pumps</b> and other water lifting technologies (that is, bucket, treadle and electric pumps). A non-parametric matching method is used to identify a counterfactual (control group) among the non-adopter sample households. Finally, a probit model is adopted to model the determinants of farmers’ <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> adoption decisions. Our analysis reveals that gender; age; ownership of oxen; access to extension; access to surface and shallow ground water; social capital and regional differences captured by a regional dummy, all influence farmers’ decision of <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> adoption...|$|R

Moreover, PV pumping is getting more attention in recent days mainly in remote areas where connection to the grid is technically not possible. Power generation by Photovoltaic is reliable.

This study analyses the effects of the determinants of groundwater irrigation technology adoption with a data from 240 smallholder irrigation farmers in Ghana. The empirical results show that household size and membership of farmer-based organizations tend to have positive significant impacts on the probability of adopting groundwater manual irrigation whilst extension contacts and farm size have negative impacts. In addition the age, gender and education of the farmer, household size, access to credit, farm size and owner-cultivation tend to have significant positive effects on the probability of adopting groundwater <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation technology whilst experience in irrigation farming and extension contacts have negative effects. The probability to adopt surface water <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation technology is positively influenced by extension contacts and farm size whilst owner-cultivation has a negative effect. Gross margin analyses indicate higher gross margins for groundwater <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigators. To promote the groundwater irrigation technology adoption, the update of skills and knowledge of the farmers on the existing irrigation technologies must be facilitated through frequent participation in workshops and training programs on irrigation.
