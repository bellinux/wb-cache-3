Due {{to the fact that}} these diagnostic methods are not available in most Brazilian hospitals, the validation of other diagnostic techniques is of fundamental importance. We describe a case of a woman with chronic pulmonary hypertension who experienced a pulmonary thromboembolism event.

40|$|A 27 {{year old}} man with {{hereditary}} haemorrhagic telangiectasia who developed progressive liver dysfunction underwent living related right lobe transplantation. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>arteriography</b> did not reveal arteriovenous malformation or abnormal intrapulmonary venous channels.

40|$|Recurrent {{pulmonary}} emboli ultimately {{may produce}} respiratory insufficiency, severe hypoxemia, and progressive pulmonary hypertension. In many patients this syndrome is silent in its initial phases, and when thrombophlebitis is present {{it is often}} unresponsive to anticoagulant therapy. Unless pulmonary embolectomy is undertaken, most of these patients characteristically succumb with severe respiratory insufficiency. Twenty-five patients with this syndrome have been evaluated at the Duke University Medical Center, and 14 were selected for elective pulmonary embolectomy for relief of severe and incapacitating pulmonary insufficiency. In each patient preoperative <b>pulmonary</b> scans and <b>arteriography</b> demonstrated {{a high degree of}} vascular occlusion. The obstructing lesions affected both lungs in the majority of patients. Bronchial arteriography was found to be a very valuable method for demonstrating patency of the pulmonary arteries distal to occluding lesions by retrograde filling through collateral vessels joining the bronchial and pulmonary circulations. Preoperatively radionuclide angiocardiography revealed severe right ventricular dysfunction with significantly depressed ejection fractions at rest and during exercise. Retrograde pulmonary arterial flow as shown by selective bronchial arteriography was excellent in ten patients, fair in three, and absent in one. Long term follow-up indicated a clear relationship between the magnitude of arterial backflow at the time of embolectomy and the degree of clinical improvement. There were two perioperative deaths, one from massive reperfusion pulmonary hemorrhage and another from intractable right ventricular failure. Eleven patients with this syndrome were unsuitable candidates for embolectomy and of these, nine had severe distal emboli diffusely spread in the small pulmonary arteries and not amenable to direct removal. One patient had severe right ventricular failure with extreme pulmonary hypertension (145 / 45 mmHg) and another was massively obese with severe congestive heart failure and expired in the hospital a week later. In this group of 11 patients, three succumbed and most of the others are currently totally debilitated at rest (NYHA Class IV). Long-term follow-up of the surgically managed patients (1 to 15 years) shows that ten patients improved from NYHA functional Class IV to either I or II, another patient from Class III to Class I, and a final patient was only minimally improved.

40|$|AbstractA 32 -year-old {{man with}} {{progressive}} dyspnea and congenital lymphedema {{was transferred to}} our hospital for evaluation as a lung transplant candidate with the suspected diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension. Evaluation revealed the additional history of previous limb-shortening procedures for the left leg, the presence of syndactyly, long-standing bilateral (left to right) lower extremity varices, as well as soft tissue asymmetry with the left leg and arm larger than the right-sided counterparts.

Methods: The study is a retrospective case series of consecutive patients in whom PE was suspected who were referred to a large, urban tertiary care center for NIVT. The main outcome measures {{of the study were}} the rate of positive results of NIVT, the amount of new information provided by NIVT, and the frequency of management changes that were attributable to NIVT. Results: Forty-one of 450 patients (9 %) had deep venous thrombosis (DVT) by NIVT. The prevalence of DVT by NIVT among patients not evaluated by ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning was 8 %. The prevalence of DVT by NIVT among patients with a high-probability V/Q scan result before NIVT was 39 %, but no management decisions in this group were based on a positive NIVT result and only two decisions were based on negative NIVT results. The prevalence of DVT according to NIVT among patients who had a negative “diagnostic” (low, or very low probability, or normal) result of V/Q scan before NIVT was 2 %. The overall frequency of management changes attributed to NIVT was only 2. 5 %. In the remaining 97 % of patients, management was determined by the result of V/Q scanning or of subsequent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriography.</b> Conclusions: In patients in whom PE is suspected, results of NIVT are usually negative for acute DVT.

Pulmonary {{arteriovenous}} malformations (PAVMs) {{have been}} associated with life-threatening complications, such as stroke and massive hemoptysis, thus posing significant morbidity if left untreated. We report a case of an incidental finding of a PAVM in a trauma patient newly recognized to have suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Case Description. A 34 -year-old man with a history of recurrent epistaxis presented with a sudden fall associated with seizure-like activity. Trauma imaging showed a large subdural hematoma and, incidentally, a serpiginous focus within the right upper lobe with a prominent feeding artery consistent with a PAVM. The patient was diagnosed with a simple PAVM related to possible or suspected HHT, an autosomal dominant trait with age-related penetrance.

40|$|Background: CT {{pulmonary}} angiography is the diagnostic procedure {{of choice for}} non-massive pulmonary embolism. Aim: To assess the diagnostic yield for thromboembolic disease of CT {{pulmonary angiography}} and venography using a 64 - slice multidetector tomography. Material and Methods: Prospective study of patients with a clinical suspicion of thromboembolic disease, subjected to CT pulmonary angiography and venography. The presence and location of pulmonary thromboembolism, of isolated or concomitant deep venous thrombosis and of other significant radiological findings, were registered. Results: A 64 -MDCT scanner was performed to 893 patients and thromboembolic disease was demonstrated in 240. Pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed in 218 patients. It was concomitant with deep venous thrombosis in 79 patients (36 %) and isolated in the rest. Thirty fve of the 218 patients with pulmonary thromboembolism had radiological evidence of right ventricular overload. Twenty two patients (10 %) had an isolated deep venous thrombosis.

40|$|Pulmonary {{embolism}} (PE) is {{an elusive}} diagnosis {{and none of}} the existing imaging modalities have a 100 % diagnostic specificity or sensitivity. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>arteriography</b> (PA) is the most specific test although the improvement of computed tomography technique has made this a commonly used method. Lung scintigraphy often gives ambiguous results. Fibrin split products (D-dimer) are released into the blood in PE were elevated levels can be measured. However, D-dimer levels are elevated in venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease as well as {{in a number of other}} conditions. The aims of this thesis were to evaluate different radiological methods including <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriography,</b> lung scintigraphy and spiral computed tomography for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism and to study if a clinical probability protocol or a simple blood test such as D- dimer could improve the diagnostic accuracy. Study I investigated the complication rate of PA in 707 patients. The overall complication rate was 1. 6 %, which is lower than previously reported. Study II assessed the interobserver variations in PA in 170 patients and compared the consensus results to a final outcome diagnosis. The mean interobserver agreement was 89 %, higher for central vessel emboli, lower for peripheral locations. Study III investigated if the use of a combination of a clinical and scintigraphic protocol in relation to the final outcome could improve the diagnosis in patients with clinical suspicion of acute PE. A low combined probability yielded a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98 %. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 100 % if the combined probability was high. Study IV compared the diagnostic accuracy of contrast medium enhanced spiral computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries (s-CTPA) and a latex agglutination D-dimer assay in patients with suspected acute PE by using PA and clinical follow up as reference method. sCTPA had 95 % NPV and 94 % PPV. If a cut off level of 0. 25 mg/L was used the corresponding figures for D-dimer were 92 % and 63 %. Study V investigated if 441 patients with a negative s-CTPA and without DVT symptoms, venous studies or anticoagulant treatment had a new episode of PE during three months follow up. Only 0. 9 % of the patients had proven PE during the follow up period. To conclude, the results of our studies show that PA is a safe method with good interobserver agreement and low complication rate. By applying a model of combined clinical and scintigraphic probabilities for PE, the diagnosis is ruled in when the combined probability is high, and ruled out when the combined probability is low. However, nearly half of the patients will still have an uncertain diagnosis if lung scintigraphy is used as diagnostic method. A low cut-off level of D-dimer can be used as a screening test to rule out PE, but can not confirm the diagnosis. s-CTPA has a high diagnostic accuracy when compared to PA. The overall results indicate that a negative s-CTPA result safely can rule out the existence of clinically significant, acute PE...|$|E

We aimed to compare the clinical diagnostic values of the Wells score, the revised Geneva score and each of them combined with D-dimer for suspected PE in elderly patients. Methods: Three hundred and thirty-six patients who were admitted for suspected PE were enrolled retrospectively and divided into two groups based on age (≥ 65 or < 65 years old). The Wells and revised Geneva scores were applied to evaluate the clinical probability of PE, and the positive predictive values of both scores were calculated using computed tomography <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriography</b> as a gold standard; overall accuracy was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curve; the negative predictive values of D-dimer, the Wells score combined with D-dimer, and the revised Geneva score combined with D-dimer were calculated. Results: Ninety-six cases (28. 6 %) were definitely diagnosed as PE among 336 cases, among them 56 cases (58. 3 %) were ≥ 65 years old. The positive predictive values of Wells and revised Geneva scores were 65. 8 % and 32. 4 %, respectively (P < 0. 05) in the elderly patients; the AUC for the Wells score and the revised Geneva score in elderly was 0. 682 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 612 - 0. 746) and 0. 655 (95 % CI: 0. 584 - 0. 722), respectively (P = 0. 389). The negative predictive values of D-dimer, the Wells score combined with D-dimer, and the revised Geneva score combined with D-dimer were 93. 7 %, 100 %, and 100 % in the elderly, respectively. Conclusions: The diagnostic value of the Wells score was higher than the revised Geneva score for the elderly cases with suspected PE. The combination of either the Wells score or the revised Geneva score with a normal D-dimer concentration is a safe strategy to rule out PE...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{embolism}} (PE) {{and deep}} venous thrombosis (DVT) are two entities of venous thromboembolism (VTE). PE is a common cause of mortality and morbidity. The symptoms and signs of PE are difficult to interpret, and the diagnosis is difficult to establish. Other diseases can have a similar clinical presentation as PE, increasing the risk for misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. A rapid and prompt diagnosis of PE is crucial and {{has an impact on}} the mortality rate. In Paper I, we studied 90 hemodynamically stable patients with suspected PE. Computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries (CTPA), and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteriography</b> (PA) were performed, the D-dimer was measured, and the diagnostic accuracy of these tests was compared. The prevalence of PE was 37 %. CTPA had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 94 % and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95 %. With a cut-off of D-dimer of 0. 25 mg/L, the PPV was 63 % and the NPV was 92 %. We concluded that CTPA has a higher sensitivity than D-dimer for diagnosing PE, and that a cut-off value of 0. 25 mg/L is sufficient as a screening method, although CTPA is recommended to exclude false positive cases. In Paper II, we retrospectively examined the symptoms and signs in a group of patients with PE (PE/infection, n= 25), who were misdiagnosed initially with pneumonia and compared these with the symptoms and signs of patients with correct diagnoses of PE, (PE/medicine, n= 64) and community-acquired pneumonia, (CAP, n= 54). Dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain as initial symptoms contributed to 76 % (PE/infection), 81 % (PE/medicine) and 9 % (CAP). Fever, chills, or cough contributed to 8 %, 16 %, and 80 %, respectively. Body temperature, Creactive protein (CRP), and the presence of pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-rays were higher in PE/infection and CAP than in PE/medicine. The symptoms did not differ significantly between the two PE groups. Dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain were the predominant initial symptoms in patients with PE whereas fever and cough were the predominant symptoms in patients with CAP. High levels of CRP and the presence of pulmonary infiltrates did not exclude PE. In Paper III, we studied 151 patients with suspected DVT and PE with a Wells pretest probability score ≤ 1. 5 points and a D-dimer < 0. 5 mg/L, to determine whether the score and test safely exclude VTE and whether a follow-up D-dimer test measured 3 - 7 days after admission adds extra information. The patients were followed for three months. A follow-up D-dimer was available for 67 % of the patients and was elevated in 13 %. None of these patients had a VTE diagnosed. All patients were contacted after three months, and none had clinical signs of VTE. We concluded that a low Wells score and a normal D-dimer safely exclude VTE in patients at the emergency department (ED) and that a follow-up D-dimer test adds no extra information. In Paper IV, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Wells score, D-dimer, and PA or CTPA to diagnose 120 patients with an intermediate to high risk of PE. The cut-off D-dimer level of 0. 5 mg/L was adequate with an NPV of 92 %. The combination of the Wells score and D-dimer gave an NPV of 94 %, and a cut-off of Wells score of four points was adequate. We concluded that D-dimer and Wells score are safe methods of ruling out PE in patients with intermediate to high risk of PE, although the specificity is low. Both CTPA and PA can yield false negative and false positive results, which can be difficult to interpret. In Paper V, we compared (a) the level of von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF) on inclusion and after three months in 46 patients with symptomatic PE without signs of DVT, with (b) the level in 45 patients with symptomatic DVT without signs of PE. The mean level of vWF was 1. 87 IU/mL in the PE group and 1. 64 IU/mL in the DVT group at inclusion. Patients with proximal DVT had a mean level of 1. 88 IU/mL and patients with distal DVT had a mean level of 1. 52 IU/mL. After three months, the mean level of vWF was 1. 45 IU/mL (PE), 1. 41 (all DVT), 1. 65 (proximal DVT) and 1. 28 (distal DVT), respectively. These findings suggest that the level of vWF differs between PE and DVT. The levels of vWF is similar in patients with PE and proximal DVT, whose vWF level is significantly higher than in patients with distal DVT. This difference may indicate that vWF reflects the extention of a DVT. Conclusions These studies show that the diagnostic accuracy of CTPA is high and better than D-dimer in diagnosing PE, and that PA and CTPA can produce different results. The initial symptoms of PE are often typical and can be used to discriminate PE from pneumonia. High levels of CRP and body temperature, and findings of pulmonary infiltrates are common in PE. Wells score and D-dimer have a high NPV and can safely exclude PE in patients with suspected PE and DVT. The cutoff of 0. 5 mg/L in D-dimer and four points in the Wells score are ade-quate and can be recommended. A follow up measurement of D-dimer after 3 - 7 days adds no extra information. The vWF level is higher in patients with PE and proximal DVT than in those with distal DVT, indicating the similarity of PE and proximal DVT. The vWF levels can be used to indicate the extension of the thrombus. The levels of vWF decreases after three months in patients with PE and DVT. The diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected PE should comprise an evaluation of symptoms, signs, risk factors, and alternative diagnoses. When the suspicion of PE is high, an evaluation of Wells score is recommended, followed by a D-dimer if the score is low. A low Wells score and a low D-dimer can safely exclude PE. If the Wells score or D-dimer is elevated, a diagnostic test is mandatory. CTPA and PA produce equivalent results, although CTPA is recommended because of its availability...|$|E
