The results {{presented in this paper}} are based on the Agile <b>Projects</b> <b>Governance</b> Survey that collected 129 responses. This paper discuss the deep analysis of this survey, and the main findings suggest that when applying agile software development, the quality of software improves as the organization measures customer satisfaction more frequently, and as the impact of retrospective increases. Project success improves as quality, frequency of measuring customer satisfaction, organization experience in agile development, retrospective impact, the team participation in retrospective and the team contribution to retrospective, increases...|$|R

50|$|<b>Project</b> <b>governance</b> is the {{management}} {{framework within which}} project decisions are made. <b>Project</b> <b>governance</b> is a critical element of any project since while the accountabilities and responsibilities associated with an organization’s business as usual activities are laid down in their organizational governance arrangements, seldom does an equivalent framework exist to govern the development of its capital investments (projects). For instance, the organization chart provides a good indication of who in the organization is responsible for any particular operational activity the organization conducts. But unless an organization has specifically developed a <b>project</b> <b>governance</b> policy, no such chart is likely to exist for project development activity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Project</b> <b>governance</b> {{structures}} are established {{precisely because it}} is recognised that organisation structures do not provide the necessary framework to deliver a project. Projects require flexibility and speed of decision making and the hierarchical mechanisms associated with organisation charts do not enable this. <b>Project</b> <b>governance</b> structures overcome this by drawing the key decision makers out of the organisation structure and placing them in a forum thereby avoiding the serial decision making process associated with hierarchies.|$|E

50|$|Consequently, the <b>project</b> <b>governance</b> {{framework}} {{established for}} a project should remain separate from the organisation structure. It is recognised that the organisation has valid requirements in terms of reporting and stakeholder involvement. However dedicated reporting mechanisms established by the project can address the former and the <b>project</b> <b>governance</b> framework must itself address the latter. What should be avoided is the situation where {{the decisions of the}} steering committee or project board are required to be ratified by one or more persons in the organisation outside of that project decision making forum; either include these individuals as members of the project decision making body or fully empower the current steering committee/project board. The steering committee/project board is responsible for approving, reviewing progress, and delivering the project outcomes, and its intended benefits, therefore, they must have capacity to make decisions, which may commit resources and funding outside the original plan.
