5|$|Although its {{population}} had dropped below a thousand {{by the late}} 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82. Unlike the stage road, it was closed during the winter months. While most of the old route {{was used for the}} new road, a portion of the original grade remains three miles below the <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side. It includes the foundation of the gatekeeper's house and the remains of the gate.|$|E

5|$|At 5a.m., Croatian special police {{advanced}} to the Mali Alan <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Velebit, encountering strong resistance from the ARSK Lika Corps' 4th Light Brigade and elements of the 9th Motorized Brigade. The pass was captured at 1p.m., and Sveti Rok village was captured at about 5p.m. The special police advanced further beyond Mali Alan, meeting more resistance at 9p.m. and then bivouacking until 5a.m. The ARSK 9th Motorized Brigade withdrew to Udbina after being forced out of its positions on the Velebit. In the morning, the special police captured Lovinac, Gračac and Medak.|$|E

5|$|Before {{developing}} the route west of Aspen, the state turned its attention the other way. In 1927 it rebuilt the old stage road over Independence Pass to Twin Lakes and designated {{it part of}} Highway 82, closing it in winters to avoid the maintenance costs. Most of it followed the original route; however in some places it deviated. The largest section of the original remains three miles (5km) below the <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east approach. The foundation of the gatekeeper's house remains, {{as well as some}} of the original toll gate.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey.

5|$|In the 1920s, Wyatt gave Sadie signed legal {{papers and}} filing fees to {{a claim for}} an oil lease in Kern County, California. She gambled away the filing fees and lied to Wyatt about what {{happened}} to the lease, which later turned out to be valuable. Distrustful of her ability to manage her finances, Wyatt made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. Wyatt put oil leases he owned in Henrietta's name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Sadie after his death. Henrietta's three children voided the agreement after their mother's death and did not <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> royalties to her.|$|E

The touchdown helped Kansas City avoid its first shut-out loss at home since 1994. Croyle's last-minute drive made him 6-for-13 for 83 yards and one touchdown.|$|E

5|$|The Ampezzano is {{typically}} Alpine climate, with short summers and long winters that vacillate between frigid, snowy, unsettled, and temperate.

The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{followed}} escalating {{ethnic tensions}} in the Lika region, including attacks on Croatian civilians in Lovinac, {{an attack on a}} Croatian police checkpoint in Žuta Lokva, and skirmishes at the Plitvice Lakes and the Ljubovo <b>Pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Gospić–Plitvička Jezera road. The remainder of 1991 saw further deterioration of the situation in the region, resulting in war crimes against Serbs and Croats in the Gospić and Široka Kula massacres. Fighting in the region remained deadlocked, with little to no territorial gains to either side, until a lasting ceasefire was called with the signing of the Sarajevo Agreement of 2 January 1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain is}} level enough, and the ridge broad enough, {{to allow for}} a 500-foot (150 m) parking lot along the south side of Highway 82 at the height of land.

The Hokies' need for quick points was foiled by an injury to Druckenmiller, who left the game after throwing an incomplete <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first play of the drive. Backup quarterback Al Clark was unable to gain a first down, and neither was Druckenmiller, who {{returned to the}} game for third down.

On the next drive, Cyrus Jones intercepted a Manziel pass in the end zone for a touchback and an Alabama possession. McCarron then threw his third touchdown <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game from 51yards to Kenny Bell and gave the Crimson Tide their first lead of the game, 21–14. Alabama then closed the first half with an 11-play, 93-yard drive capped with a four-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown run for a 28–14 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|An already tense {{situation}} in the Lika region, following 1 April Plitvice Lakes incident when the first fatalities of the Croatian War of Independence occurred, deteriorated further in June when Croatia reaffirmed its sovereignty through a parliamentary declaration. This {{was reflected in the}} rise of violent incidents, setting up of unauthorized road checkpoints and occasional exchanges of small arms fire. On 22 June, three policemen were abducted on the road between Gospić and SAO Krajina-controlled Gračac, and a series of attacks on the Croatian police occurred in various parts of Lika, including Gospić, on 27–28 June. In July 1991, the JNA started to openly confront the Croatian police and the ZNG in Lika. On 1 July, Plitvice police station was surrounded by the JNA, and on 6 July, two ZNG troops were killed and another two wounded in a JNA ambush near Gospić. Further escalation of the fighting was seen at the Ljubovo <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Gospić–Korenica road, where the JNA and SAO Krajina troops fought and pushed the ZNG back on 28–29 July.|$|E

Seconds later, No. 64 Squadron's eight Spitfires turned up, led by Squadron Leader Donald MacDonell. They dived on the Dorniers from high-altitude. Some of the Squadron, including Squadron Leader MacDonell, attacked the Bf 110s, believing them to be Dorniers. MacDonell damaged a Bf 110 flown by Ruediger. Proske crash-landed and was taken prisoner. Several confusing dogfights broke out and lasted for some time.|$|E
