5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his <b>patented</b> <b>technology,</b> raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay, and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) {{or whether it was}} only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its <b>patented</b> <b>technology</b> inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E

The <b>patented</b> maglev <b>technologies</b> originating from Japan are registered in 17 regions. The number of <b>patented</b> <b>technologies</b> registered domestically in Japan account for 78.62 % of all <b>patented</b> <b>technologies,</b> followed by the <b>patented</b> <b>technologies</b> registered in the USA, Germany, at the EPO, and in China, which account for 6.96, 5.15, 3.73, and 2.54 % {{of the total number of}} <b>patented</b> <b>technologies,</b> respectively.

South Korea’s <b>patented</b> maglev <b>technologies</b> are registered in nine countries and regions; 88.22 % of South Korea’s <b>patented</b> <b>technologies</b> are registered domestically, and the <b>patented</b> <b>technologies</b> registered in the USA, China, and with the WIPO account for 3.74, 3.74, and 2.06 % of all <b>patented</b> <b>technologies,</b> respectively. These data show that the major patent-contributing countries have focused on the domestic registration of <b>patented</b> <b>technologies,</b> and have then expanded their coverage based on local research and resource development.|$|R

25|$|Nowadays {{there are}} some crusher buckets with a <b>patented</b> <b>technology</b> which can achieve a higher {{productivity}} (Xcentric Crusher). They are manufactured with a high inertia power train, circular jaw movement and an antiestagnation plate, which prevents large shredding pieces from getting stuck in the bucket's mouth, not allowing them to enter the crushing jaws. They have also the crushing jaws placed in a cross position. This position together with its circular motion gives these crusher buckets the faculty of grinding wet material.|$|E

2500|$|Impedance-based {{single cell}} {{analysis}} systems are {{commonly known as}} Coulter counters. They represent a well-established method for counting and sizing virtually any kind of cells and particles. The label-free technology has recently been enhanced by a [...] "lab-on-a-chip" [...] based approach and by applying high frequency alternating current (AC) in the radio frequency range (from 100kHz to 30MHz) instead of a static direct current (DC) or low frequency AC field. This <b>patented</b> <b>technology</b> allows a highly accurate cell analysis and provides additional information like membrane capacitance and viability.

2500|$|Founded in 2006, Algenol Biofuels is a global, {{industrial}} biotechnology {{company that is}} commercializing its patented algae technology for production of ethanol and other fuels. [...] Based in Southwest Florida, Algenol's <b>patented</b> <b>technology</b> enables {{the production of the}} four most important fuels (ethanol, gasoline, jet, and diesel fuel) using proprietary algae, sunlight, carbon dioxide and saltwater for around $1.27 per gallon and at production levels of 8,000 total gallons of liquid fuel per acre per year. Algenol's technology produces high yields and relies on patented photobioreactors and proprietary downstream techniques for low-cost fuel production using carbon dioxide from industrial sources. The company originally intended on producing commercially by 2014, but was set back when Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a bill in 2013 eliminating the state's mandate of a minimum of 10% ethanol in commercial gasoline. This caused Algenol CEO Paul Woods to scrap a plan for a US $500 million plant to produce commercial amounts of algae biofuels and pursue other job sites. Currently, Algenol is a partner of the US Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies Office, and in 2015 began smaller-scale commercial sales of E15 and E85 ethanol blends to Protec Fuel, a Florida-based fuel distributor.|$|E
