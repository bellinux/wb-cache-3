One day later, on September 11, the Congressional {{delegation}} arrived on Staten Island and met with Admiral Lord Howe for several hours. The meeting came to nothing, as Lord Howe was not authorized to grant terms the Congressional delegation insisted on. It did, however, <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> impending British attack, allowing Washington more time to decide if and where to confront the enemy.|$|E

5|$|With the Red House {{batteries}} out of action, Smyth immediately {{pressed on}} with his invasion plans. However, attempts to embark his 3,000 men ended in chaos; with only 1,200 men managing to board because of a shortage of boats and the artillery taking up an unexpected amount of space on board. Amid torrential rain and freezing cold, a council of war headed by Smyth decided to <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> invasion pending more thorough preparations that would enable the embarkation of whole force.|$|E
5|$|After filming was complete, test {{screenings}} were held, and {{the production}} team became aware of {{a problem with the}} ending. In the original ending, Ru'afo is ejected into space from the Son'a collector ship and de-ages rapidly as he floats amongst the rings of the planet Ba'ku. The revised ending saw the Enterprise swoop in at the last minute to save Picard and destroy the collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. The studio liked the new ending but wanted a bigger space battle. The production team agreed providing they could <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> release to allow enough time for this. Because the studio wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the ending.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} January 2007, the {{government}} declared it would <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> demolition of Queen's Pier until a consensus could be reached on the course of action; consultations with the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, the Hong Kong Institute of Engineers, and the Conservancy Association were held. The Institute of Architects, whose members opposed dismantling the pier, originally maintained the pier should remain untouched. However, {{it was reported that}} after meeting {{the government}}, the Institute and the Conservancy Association were persuaded by the government that the pier could first be dismantled, and then reassembled at another location after completion of the reclamation. This change of heart was heavily criticised by Winston Chu, founder of the Society for Protection of the Harbour. The HKIA clarified that their opposition had not in fact changed.|$|E

The war {{put a stop to}} his education, and Bojić decided to <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> marriage until peace was restored. He remained employed at Pijemont until 1915, when he left Belgrade with his family, never to return. While Todorović remained in the city, the Bojićes moved to the town of Aranđelovac in the Serbian interior. Shortly after, they moved to Niš as it was further from the frontlines. There, Bojić worked as a military censor. He wrote articles for the Niš Gazette (Niški glasnik) to pay his family's bills. In early February 1915, Bojić's mother died of cancer, leaving him {{to take care of his}} younger siblings.|$|E
5|$|Chopra {{also had}} to learn jazz dance {{for one of the}} characters. For another song {{featuring}} all twelve characters, Chopra had to shoot for 22 hours to keep the continuity of the whole musical sequence. She had to change the costumes and makeup for each of the twelve characters while filming the song. At one point, Chopra fainted on the set and Gowariker wanted to <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> filming, but she insisted on finishing the scenes. Her heavy workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements, and performing at live showstook its toll; she was admitted to hospital because of exhaustion and was kept under observation. After spending three days in hospital, she was discharged and immediately resumed filming to avoid delaying her other projects. Filming was completed by the first week of May 2009.|$|E
5|$|General von Toll {{initially}} {{planned to}} order his infantry {{to start the}} assault at 16:00, but Paskevich through his aides ordered him to <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> attack until 16:45. Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already shaken by the fire of the Grand Battery, the Poles abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached. It was a rare example of artillery capturing a fortified position {{without the help of}} other forces. Meanwhile, the fighting for the nearby Fort 22 was heavy. In the end its garrison fell almost to the last man.|$|E

5|$|Having {{observed}} the sessions and received {{feedback from the}} drivers and the teams about the circuit conditions, the series' president of competition Brian Barnhart and course designer Tony Cotman opted to <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> qualification session to race morning, with the running of a third practice session and a Sunday morning warm-up instead of it. Power topped this extra session, ahead of Kanaan and Ryan Hunter-Reay, with Justin Wilson—a new arrival at Dreyer & Reinbold Racing—in fourth position. After the session, track officials started grinding down the concrete {{in order to provide}} a track surface that was suitable for racing the following day. Hunter-Reay topped the Sunday morning warmup before qualifying, setting the fastest lap time by over half a second ahead of second-year driver Mike Conway in another Dreyer & Reinbold car.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, {{the city}} {{government}} proposed that {{the maintenance of the}} new trains be privatized. This resulted in protests from the employees, who campaigned by refusing to work overtime. As a result, after a few weeks, the company lacked 57 trains to provide adequate service. The issue was solved when the socialist opposition parties along with the Liberal Party agreed to <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> matter until after all the new trains were delivered in 2009. As part of the agreement, a new limited company, Oslo Vognselskap, wholly owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by the operating companies. Responsibility for the debt accumulated for buying the trains is to be managed by Oslo Vognselskap, while operation and management of the maintenance contracts was transferred to Oslo T-banedrift.|$|E
5|$|In late 1866, Napoleon {{tried to}} <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> French departure, but the Americans had {{large numbers of}} troops on the north bank of the Rio Grande and Seward held firm. Napoleon {{suggested}} a new Mexican government that would exclude both Maximilian and Juárez; the Americans had recognized Juárez as the legitimate president and were not willing to consider this. In the meantime, Juárez, {{with the help of}} American military aid, was advancing through northeast Mexico. The French withdrew in early 1867, leaving Maximilian, who was soon captured by Juárez's troops. Although both the U.S. and France urged Juárez against it, the deposed emperor was executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867.|$|E

The film later premiered on July 16 at the AMC Lincoln Square Theater in New York City, New York, followed by a European premiere on July 18 at Leicester Square in London, England.

5|$|The Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan in December 1979 and threatened {{boycott of the}} 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow led organizers to consider again postponing the Canada Cup. While Eagleson initially favoured allowing the tournament to go ahead regardless of the political situation, he ultimately agreed that Hockey Canada should again <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> Canada Cup after the Canadian Government joined the Olympic boycott. A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) would participate in such an event.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish premiere was {{originally}} planned for April 18, 2008, but following the positive {{response from the}} festival screenings, the producers decided to <b>postpone</b> <b>the</b> release until autumn, {{to allow for a}} longer theatrical run. At one time there was a plan to release the film for a special series of screenings in Luleå, beginning September 24 and lasting seven days. This was canceled when the Swedish Film Institute announced that Everlasting Moments had been selected over Let the Right One In as Sweden's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The distributors released it on October 24, 2008 in Sweden, Norway, and as a limited release in the United States. In Australia, the film was released on March 19, 2009.
