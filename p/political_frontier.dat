Like the other areas in Khorasan province where there is an Afghan community due to the influx of Afghan refugees coming from Afghanistan in recent years, the demographic explosion of Mashhad continued with the addition of some 296 000 Afghans Refugees to Mashhad, following the communist revolution of 1978. In many cases, they are no longer refugees but should be mentioned as locals (Iran's Ministry of Interior estimates that the total number of Afghans in Iran is now around 3 million. Considering that there were 296000 Afghans Refugees to Mashhad (from 2.5 million in the whole Iran) following the communist revolution of 1978, the number of Afghans in Mashhad cannot be lesser that 296000 people - and so a rate more than 10.8% should be considered). Afghan refugees originate up to 90% from the provinces of Herat, Farah and Nimruz Province, speak in Dari Farsi and familiar with the culture in Mashhad.Even before the <b>political</b> <b>frontier</b> between Iran and Afghanistan, the Persian-speaking inhabitants from the provinces of Herat and Farah in Afghanistan had had kinship, as well as ethnical, religious, or economic relations with the Iranian province of Khorasan (especially Mashhad, where people speak a dialect akin with Harat dialect). According to Khorasan Razavi's General Administration of Nationals and Immigrants, there are 142,000 registered Afghan citizens living in Khorasan, 95 percent of which were identified in Mashhad. The Afghan immigrants have several neighborhoods around the city, especially in a new quarter to the northeast of Mashhad. This new Afghan quarter evokes the traditional relations of Mashhad with the Herat region and Central Asia.One of the districts inhabited by Afghan immigrants is Golshahr.|$|E

5000|$|During the war Aufderbeck was {{in contact}} with the {{resistance}} group around Prof. Theodor Lieser. As the end approached Halle was occupied by US troops on 17 April 1945, and Theodor Lieser was installed by them as the city's Lord Mayor. Although Halle was liberated by Americans, by the time war ended zones of occupation had been agreed which placed Halle in the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany, and in July 1945 the Americans withdrew and were replaced by the Red army. Both under US occupation and under the longer period of Soviet administration which followed, Aufderbeck focused on youth work. He {{was a member of the}} [...] "Archbishop's Council for Imperiled Youth" [...] ("Erziehungsbeirats für gefährdete Jugendliche") and of the [...] "Advisory Council for Public Youth Support". He was the Roman Catholic representative in liaison with the newly formed Free German Youth (FDJ / Freie Deutsche Jugend). The FDJ was the youth wing of the recently renamed and reconstituted ruling party in this part of Germany, which by the later 1940s was in the process of reverting to one-party dictatorship. In 1947 Aufderbeck was appointed by Wilhelm Weskamm, the episcopal commissioner (who later became the Bishop of Berlin) as the permanent representative of the Archbishop's Commission for Youth Work in the Province of Saxony. The context for these developments, and for much of Aufdebeck's subsequent career, was the <b>political</b> <b>frontier</b> which since 1945 had divided the eastern half of the Paderborn archdiocese from Paderborn itself. Although this secular border was initially thoroughly porous, it would become progressively less so after the reinvention, formally in October 1949, of the Soviet occupation zone as the new Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. Because of the way in which FDJ activity was ever more overtly blended into the increasingly ubiquitous political activity of the ruling SED (party), Aufderbeck's contacts with the FDJ were fairly soon abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Many {{scholars}} ask today {{whether there}} is a need for a common <b>political</b> <b>frontier</b> especially in its insistence on such prerequisites as gender. There is the feeling of political amnesia and individual inability to challenge the pervasive and continuously patriarchal power structures of governments, international corporations, and therefore also educational practices. Education is power, beyond doubt, but what kind of education, whose knowledge and whose interests are being represented, we still need to ask. Gender for that matter is not the only variable affecting educational experiences around the world. Now, that the ‘Western ’ notion of global sisterhood, based on the belief that all women share an experience of oppression, has been abandoned, there is little basis for gender solidarity. In the light of such reflection, we attempt to address the feminist pedagogy of location with respect to the meaning of a ‘common ground ’ in feminist knowledge, and how it affects the educational tactics of self-positioning, the very requirement for autonomous subject.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{consequences of a}} <b>political</b> <b>frontier</b> are many and not all have been adequately explored. For a long time the political and administrative boundaries have, in fact, been {{considered one of the}} main sources of costs related to trade. Instead, the study of banking systems in border regions has probably received less attention so far, maybe due to the fragmented nature of available data, which makes it difficult to assess the border effect on the credit framework of these geographic areas. These few notes are intended to provide some insight into this topic, suggesting the impossibility of formulating a general theory on the banking systems along the frontier, which are, instead, more affected by the several variables that contribute to differentiate the individual border regions from each other. In this perspective, the Swiss case is particularly significant in that it is in conflict with the traditional thesis, which argues that frontier regions are sites of penalisation. By comparing three different border areas – Geneva, Basel and especially Ticino, due to its gravitating towards an external economic pole, the Milanese one – the paper highlights the fragility inherent in the economies along the boundaries, but also the strong potential provided by deeper cross-border integration, as historical experience clearly demonstrates, and as the current framework seems to make more and more necessary...|$|E
