40|$|Abstract—The time-domain signals {{representing}} {{the heart rate}} variability (HRV) {{in the presence of}} an ectopic beat exhibit a sharp transient at the position of the ectopic beat, which corrupts the signal, particularly the power spectral density (PSD) of the HRV. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} correction of this type of beat prior to any HRV analysis. This paper deals with the PSD estimation of the HRV by means of the heart timing (HT) signal when ectopic beats are present. These beat occurrence times are modeled from a generalized, continuous time integral <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> model and, from this point of view, a specific method for minimizing the effect of the presence of ectopic beats is presented to work together with the HT signal. By using both, a white noise driven autoregressive model of the HRV signal with artificially introduced ectopic beats and actual heart rate series including ectopic beats, the more usual methods of HRV spectral estimation are compared. Results of the PSD estimation error function of the number of ectopic beats are presented. These results demonstrate that the proposed method has one order of magnitude lower error than usual ectopic beats removal strategies in preserving PSD, thus, this strategy better recovers the original clinical indexes of interest.

40|$|Fine {{control of}} {{microwave}} power radiation in medical and scientific applications is a challenging task. Since a commercial Continuous Wave (CW) magnetron {{is the most}} inexpensive microwave device available today on the market, it becomes the best candidate for a microwave power generator used in medical diathermy and hyperthermia treatments or high efficiency chemical reactions using microwave reactors as well.

40|$|For {{successful}} {{visual perception}} by visual prosthesis using electrical stimulation, {{it is essential}} to develop an effective stimulation strategy based on understanding of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) responses to electrical stimulation. We studied RGC responses to repetitive electrical stimulation pulses to develop a stimulation strategy using stimulation <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation.</b> Retinal patches of photoreceptor-degenerated retinas from rd 1 mice were attached to a planar multi-electrode array (MEA) and RGC spike trains responding to electrical stimulation pulse trains with various pulse frequencies were observed. RGC responses were strongly dependent on inter-pulse interval when it was varied from 500 to 10 ms. Although the evoked spikes were suppressed with increasing pulse rate, the number of evoked spikes were > 60 % of the maximal responses when the inter-pulse intervals exceeded 100 ms. Based on this, we investigated the modulation of evoked RGC firing rates while increasing the pulse frequency from 1 to 10 pulses per second (or Hz) to deduce the optimal pulse frequency range for modulation of RGC response strength. RGC response strength monotonically and linearly increased within the stimulation frequency of 1 ~ 9 Hz. The results suggest that the evoked neural activities of RGCs in degenerated retina can be reliably controlled by <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation,</b> and may be used as a stimulation strategy for visual neural prosthesis...|$|E
