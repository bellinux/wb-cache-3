Called Originea românilor ("The Origin of the Romanians"), its first, 889-page volume appeared in 1925, with the second 829-page one being published in 1928. Volume I, Ce spun izvoarele istorice ("What Historical Sources Say"), deals with the Romanians' ethnogenesis (see origin of the Romanians) and displays Philippide's abilities as an historian. He brings critical analysis to the works of Herodotus, Polybius, Appian, Strabo, Ptolemy and Cassius Dio, focusing on their writings about Dacia and the northern Balkans. The work includes long passages that had never previously appeared in Romanian. At the same time, he details the Latin inscriptions found in the Balkans, <b>paying</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Procopius' De aedificiis but also to other material in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum.|$|E

500|$|Collins has listed {{two main}} sources of {{influence}} in her writing of The Underland Chronicles. First is her M.F.A. in dramatic writing and her experience as a screenwriter.

500|$|Campin, van Eyck and van der Weyden {{established}} naturalism as {{the dominant}} style in 15th-century northern European painting. These artists sought {{to show the world}} as it actually was, and to depict people {{in a way that made}} them look more human, with a greater complexity of emotions than had been previously seen. This first generation of Early Netherlandish artists were interested in the accurate reproduction of objects (according to Panofsky they painted [...] "gold that looked like gold"), <b>paying</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> natural phenomena such as light, shadow and reflection. They moved beyond the flat perspective and outlined figuration of earlier painting in favour of three-dimensional pictorial spaces. The position of viewers and how they might relate to the scene became important for the first time; in the Arnolfini Portrait, Van Eyck arranges the scene as if the viewer has just entered the room containing the two figures. Advancements in technique allowed far richer, more luminous and closely detailed representations of people, landscapes, interiors and objects.|$|E

Accreditation is a two part process; first each facility will conduct a detailed self-evaluation, <b>paying</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the IAC standards and Guidelines.

There are several states in which Medicare and/or private insurance carriers are requiring either the accreditation of the laboratory and/or sonographer credentialing, for reimbursement of echocardiograms.|$|E

2500|$|Joyce Meyer Ministries {{was one of}} six {{investigated}} by the United States Senate inquiry into the tax-exempt status of religious organizations by Senator Chuck Grassley. The inquiry sought to determine if Meyer made any personal profit from financial donations, asking for a detailed accounting {{for such things as}} cosmetic surgery and foreign bank accounts and citing such expenses as the $23,000 commode mentioned earlier. Grassley also requested that Meyer's ministry make the information available by December 6, 2007. In her November 29 response to Grassley, Meyer notes that the commode is a chest of drawers. Meyer writes that {{it was part of a}} large lot of items totaling $262,000 that were needed to furnish the ministry's [...] headquarters purchased in 2001. She said the commode's price tag was an [...] "errant value" [...] assigned by the selling agent and apologized for [...] "not <b>paying</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> specific 'assigned values' placed on the pieces." [...] Joyce Meyer Ministries responded with a newsletter to its e-mail list subscribers on November 9, 2007.

[...] The message also quoted an October 10, 2007, letter from the Internal Revenue Service which stated, [...] "We determined that you [...] continue to qualify as an organization exempt from federal income tax under IRC section 501(c)(3)." [...] The same information was also posted to the ministry website. Joyce Meyer Ministries was one of two ministries to comply with the Senate's requests for financial records. It also made commitments to future financial transparency. Neither party were found to have done any wrongdoing.|$|E
2500|$|Hackworth is {{believed}} to have been influential in the development of the first Stephenson locomotive intended for the Stockton and Darlington Railway during his time at the Forth Street factory. That locomotive, then named Active, now known as Locomotion No 1, was delivered to the railway just before the opening ceremony on 27 September 1825. Three more of the same type (Hope, Black Diamond, Diligence) were delivered in the following months and difficulties in getting them into operating order were such as to risk compromising the use of steam locomotives for years to come, had it not been for Hackworth's persistence. This persistence resulted in his developing the first adequate locomotive adapted to the rigours of everyday road service. The outcome was the Royal George [...] of 1827, an early 0-6-0 Locomotive, that among many new key features notably incorporated a correctly aligned steam blastpipe. Hackworth is usually acknowledged as the inventor of this concept. From 1830 onwards the blastpipe was employed by the Stephensons for their updated Rocket and all subsequent new types. Recent letters acquired by the National Railway Museum would appear to confirm Hackworth as the inventor of the device. Since Trevithick's time, it had long been common practice to turn the exhaust steam from the cylinders into the chimney using [...] "eductor pipes" [...] for convenience and noise reduction, and its effect on the fire certainly had been noticed. Whatever the case, Hackworth was probably the first engineer in history to fully take into account the role of the blast in automatically realising the [...] "perfect equilibrium between steam production and usage" [...] in a locomotive when fitted with a firetube boiler, and to consider the blastpipe as a distinct device, <b>paying</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> its proportions, nozzle size, positioning and precise alignment.|$|E
2500|$|Blomstedt himself died prematurely in 1935, aged 35. The {{significant}} {{vehicle for}} the development of modernism in Finland was his contemporary, Alvar Aalto, who was a friend of Asplund as well as key Swedish architect Sven Markelius. The latter had invited Aalto to join Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), ostensibly run by Le Corbusier. Aalto's reputation as a significant contributor to modernism was endorsed by his involvement in CIAM and by the inclusion of his works in significant architectural journals worldwide as well as significant histories of architecture, notably in the second edition (1949) of Space, Time and Architecture by the secretary-general of CIAM, Sigfried Giedion. Aalto's significant buildings from the early period of Modernism, which basically corresponded to the theoretical principles and architectural aesthetic of Le Corbusier and other modernist architects such as Walter Gropius, include the Turku Sanomat newspaper offices, Turku, Paimio tuberculosis sanatorium (1932) (part of a nationwide campaign for tuberculosis sanatorium construction) and Viipuri Library (1927–35). Central to Functionalism was <b>paying</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> how the building is used. In the case of the Aalto's Paimio tuberculosis sanatorium, the starting point for the design, he himself claimed, was to make the building itself a contributor to the healing process. Aalto liked to call the building a [...] "medical instrument". For instance, particular attention was paid to the design of the patient bedrooms: these generally held two patients, each with his or her own cupboard and washbasin. Aalto designed special non-splash basins, so that the patient would not disturb the other while washing. The patients spent many hours lying down, and thus Aalto placed the lamps in the room out of the patients line of vision and painted the ceiling a relaxing dark green so as to avoid glare. Each patient had their own specially designed cupboard, fixed to the wall and off the floor so as to aid in cleaning beneath it.|$|E

He sat at my mother's right hand; and I wondered, noticing him so ugly and so foolish seeming, how she could be so interested in him, shouting much and often to him; for added to his other disattractions he was very deaf, which necessitated his putting his hand up to his ear at every other observation made to him, crying querulously: [...] "Eh, what?
