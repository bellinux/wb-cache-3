5|$|Mayabazar {{became the}} first Telugu film to be {{digitally}} remastered and colourised, at an estimated cost of 75million (valued at about US$1.7million in 2010), after Hyderabad-based company Goldstone Technologies acquired world negative rights to fourteen films including that of Mayabazar in late November 2007. The updated version was released on 30 January 2010 in 45 theatres in Andhra Pradesh. It was a commercial success that generated mostly positive reviews, one critic only expressing a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> original.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his last stand against the Lancastrians, Richard was a widower without a {{legitimate}} son. After his son's death, he had initially named his nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick, Clarence's young son and the nephew of Queen Anne Neville, as his heir. After Anne's death, however, Richard named another nephew, John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, the son of his elder sister Elizabeth. However, he was also negotiating with John II of Portugal to marry his sister, Joanna, a pious young woman who had already turned down several suitors because of her <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> religious life.|$|E
5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the Muslim {{world had}} {{developed}} four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence (or fiqh), {{each with its}} own interpretations of Sharia: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi and Hanafi. In Arabia, a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hanbali school was advocated by the Wahhabi movement, founded in the 18th century. Wahhabism, a strict form of Sunni Islam, was supported by the Saudi royal family (the Al Saud) and is now dominant in Saudi Arabia. From the 18th century, the Hanbali school therefore predominated in Nejd and central Arabia, the heartland of Wahhabi Islam. In the more cosmopolitan Hejaz, in the west of the peninsula, both the Hanafi and Shafi schools were followed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that <b>the</b> importance of <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> international order {{extend beyond the}} conditions proposed by power transition theory. Specifically, a dissimilarity of <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> international order should affect relations for all states in <b>the</b> international system <b>for</b> all levels of dispute. In essence, I posit that disagreements over the norms and rules that comprise the international order should increase the domain of conflict for all dyads—even when they have neither the ability nor opportunity to directly affect {{the construction of the}} international order. To test the above argument, I propose two new Euclidean-distance measures of dissimilarities of economic and security preferences. Using a series of logits and their predicted probabilities on data from the post-WWII period, I find that a dissimilarity of <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> status quo has an important, incendiary effect on the likelihood of dyadic disputes short of war. In fact, dissimilar <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> economic and security status quo provide greater leverage in explaining disputes short of war than even such traditionally important variables as the lowest level of dyadic democracy and economic interdependence. ...|$|R
5|$|Critics {{have also}} {{frequently}} compared The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy to Pokémon Pinball. Gamekult.com's Usul wrote that The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy had a superior design and richer gameplay experience than Pokémon Pinball. Craig Harris expressed a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> previous Nintendo pinball releases. The game {{was described as}} a remake of Pokémon Pinball by Frank Provo, who expressed disappointment at the absence of Pikachu and other Pokémon. Brett Alan Weiss argued that the cute visuals of The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy was derivative when compared to other pinball games. He wrote that the game would appeal primarily to young girls, while experienced pinball players would prefer Pokémon Pinball.|$|E

5|$|Though {{much of the}} Tamil {{literature}} from this period came from Tamil speaking regions ruled by the feudatory Pandya who gave particular attention on the cultivation of Tamil literature, some poets were patronised by the Vijayanagara kings. Svarupananda Desikar wrote an anthology of 2824 verses, Sivaprakasap-perundirattu, on the Advaita philosophy. His pupil the ascetic, Tattuvarayar, wrote a shorter anthology, Kurundirattu, that contained about half the number of verses. Krishnadevaraya patronised the Tamil Vaishnava poet Haridasa whose Irusamaya Vilakkam was an exposition of the two Hindu systems, Vaishnava and Shaiva, with a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> former.|$|E
5|$|For {{its part}} the government, not {{consulting}} Solidarity, adopted {{a plan of}} economic measures {{that could only be}} implemented by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Casino Royale {{was adapted}} into a parody Bond film {{starring}} David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd.

The {{result of a}} court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of Thunderball titled Never Say Never Again in 1983. The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, {{was not part of}} the Eon series of Bond films. In 1997 the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal, which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to Never Say Never Again from Taliafilm. As of 2015, Eon holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{critically}} {{examine and}} empirically test {{the hypothesis that}} the strong socioeconomic gradients characterising attendance at arts events result from similar gradients in <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arts, in line with existing theories of demand <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arts derived from orthodox consumer theory. To control <b>for</b> <b>preferences,</b> we use individual measures of stated interest in the arts and reports of viewing and listening habits, as distinct from attendance at live events. These variables are strongly associated with attendance, yet despite their inclusion as covariates within a hierarchical logistic regression analysis, strong and significant socioeconomic gradients remain within the estimated models. While it remains possible that our controls do not capture sufficient variation in <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arts, it appears more likely that the socioeconomic composition of live arts audiences is influenced by other factors in addition to individual <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arts...|$|R

5|$|In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Engineer District (the {{military}} {{component of the}} Manhattan Project) surveyed sites around Gallup, Las Vegas, La Ventana, Jemez Springs, and Otowi, and recommended the one near Jemez Springs. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned {{with the possibility of}} flooding. The party then moved on to the Otowi site, the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, he hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> letters of one's own name over {{those of the}} other person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E
5|$|Plectania nannfeldtii is {{typically}} found at higher elevations in coniferous forests growing on wet twigs or other rotting woody debris, often {{in or near}} snow. It often begins its development underneath the snow, reaching maturity as the snowbank recedes to expose it; one source suggests that its metabolic heat may help it melt a path through snow as it grows. It may grow singly, scattered or in clusters, and has been noted to have a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wood of Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa {{as well as other}} conifers. In North America, it is found in the Western United States and Canada, where it fruits from late May to early August; it is common in the Sierra Nevada and in higher elevations of the Pacific Coast Ranges.
