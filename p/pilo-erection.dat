40|$|The {{present study}} {{utilized}} an experimental method consisting of subjective and objective measures to assess physiological and psychological changes occurring during chills induced by music. <b>Pilo-erection</b> C'gooseburnp " formation), skin temperature; and {{galvanic skin response}} (GSR) were used to monitor peripheral nervous system changes during the response. It was hypothesized that significant changes in parameters would coincide with perceived experiences of chills when compared with other sectionsof music where chills were not perceived. Thirty two students (16 musicians and 16 non-musicians) were assessed while listening to music, both familiar and unfamiliar. The experiment then appeared to replicate the general experience of chills induced by music for this population. Results suggested {{that the experience of}} chills corresponded to significant changes in GSR and was associated with <b>pilo-erection</b> in some instances. No significant changes in skin temperature were evident. BACKGROUN...|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Exogenous Dermatology [Â© S. Karger AG, Basel] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] temperature regulation is based upon a physiological system 'designed' for a naked person. Hence, the statement 'man is a tropical animal'. Human thermoregulation can be described as a feedback system with sensors in the body core and the skin, and effectors in the form of skin blood flow (vasoconstriction and dilation), metabolic activity (shivering), <b>pilo-erection</b> and sweating. This system on its own would provide some adjustment capabilities to various environments, but would nevertheless limit man to life in warm environments. It is the behavioural response that is the most powerful additional thermoregulatory effector in humans. People wear clothing, live in houses and have active heating and cooling systems to expand their habitat beyond the original physiological limits. Clothing is an important interface between the human and the environment. Apart from the cultural meaning of clothing it provides insulation against cold, protection against the sun, wind or rain as well as protection from other environmental hazards (chemicals, mechanical). The effect of clothing on thermoregulation depends in the first place on the textile materials used. These provide thermal insulation as well as resistance against vapour (sweat) transfer. However, a garment is more than just the textile layer. Air layers included in the clothing provide additional insulation and the total thermal protection provided by a garment is for a large part based on these enclosed air layers and strongly influenced by the clothing design and fit. Clothing comfort is determined by a number of clothing properties that affect the thermal conditions at the skin. Skin temperatures and the tactile sensation of the skin (e. g. sticky moist clothing) are the main signals that are fed to the brain and lead to an overall sensation of comfort or discomfort...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{refereed}} conference paper. The regulated {{exchange of}} {{heat from the}} human body to the environment is essential in human survival. This exchange is adjusted by our physiological response mechanisms. We are able to sweat profusely to cool the body in exercise and heat exposure, {{and are able to}} fine-tune our body temperatures in moderate environments through variations in skin circulation. In slightly cool environments, we reduce blood flow to our extremities and skin and use our fat layer insulation to conserve central body temperature. We can increase our heat production by shivering and can create a small insulating air layer around our skin by <b>pilo-erection.</b> However, when temperature goes down further, we cannot sustain our body temperature in the long run without behavioural adjustments that include putting on clothing or using heated dwellings. In this context, clothing has allowed mankind to expand its habitat around the world and has had a positive influence on its development. Today, clothing is worn for various reasons. Apart from its functional aspects (insulation, protection), it has a strong cultural and social aspect as well. The latter are on occasion counterproductive in terms of the first. A business suit for instance is hardly functional in a tropical climate, nor is a ladies evening dress in a cold environment. Also, when the function of the clothing is not only protection against heat or cold, as e. g. is the case with chemical protective clothing, the barriers introduced in the clothing to achieve the required protection can cause a conflict between the protective function of the clothing and the thermal functioning of the body. These conflicts can lead to discomfort, but also to physical strain and in extreme cases can put the person at risk from heat or cold injury or illness...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vivo study was to assess a new, putatively {{optimised}} method for mass casualty decontamination ("ORCHIDS protocol") for effectiveness in removing the chemical warfare agent VX from the skin of anaesthetised, domestic white pigs. ORCHIDS protocol consists of a 1. 5 -minute shower with a mild detergent (Argos???) supplemented by physical removal. A standard method of wet decontamination was used for comparison. Experimental animals were divided into four groups (A-D). Two groups were exposed to a supra-lethal percutaneous dose (5 ?? LD(50); 300 ??g kg(- 1)) of VX for 1 h prior to decontamination with either the ORCHIDS (C) or standard protocol (D). A third (B, positive control) group was exposed but not subject to decontamination. Blank controls (A) received anaesthesia and the corresponding dose of normal saline instead of VX. Observations of the clinical signs of intoxication were supplemented by measurements of whole blood cholinesterase (ChE) performed on samples of arterial blood acquired at 30 -minute intervals {{for the duration of}} the study (up to 6 h). Untreated (B) animals displayed typical cholinergic signs consistent with VX intoxication (local fasciculation, mastication, salivation, <b>pilo-erection</b> and motor convulsions) and died 165 - 240 min post exposure. All animals in both decontamination treatment groups (C, D) survived the duration of the study and exhibited less severe signs of cholinergic poisoning. Thus, both the standard and ORCHIDS protocol were demonstrably effective against exposure to the potent nerve agent VX, even after a delay of 1 h. A critical advantage of the ORCHIDS protocol is the relatively short shower duration (1 ?? min compared to 3 min). In practice, this could substantially improve the rate at which individuals could be decontaminated by emergency responders following exposure to toxic materials such as chemical warfare agents...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to confirm the toxicity of a plant implicated in an outbreak in Frankfort, Free State Province, Republic of South Africa. Cows died acutely after being introduced into a camp, where an abundant, green shrublet was noted to be heavily grazed. The plant was subsequently identified as Senecio inaequidens DC. (Asteraceae) by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI). Extraction and chemical analyses for pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA's) in Senecio inaequidens revealed the presence of four different compounds, namely retrorsine and senecionine (known to be hepatotoxic) and two unidentified compounds. The total alkaloid content (free bases plus N-oxides) in the dried, milled S. inaequidens plant material was 0. 18 %. Four (4) male Sprague Dawley rats, aged 8 - 9 weeks were dosed per os. Each rat received a different dose; ranging from 0. 049 mg/g b. w. to 0. 25 mg/g b. w.; of the crude Senecio inaequidens extract. No clinical signs were observed in the rat receiving the lowest dose. Rats receiving higher doses showed depression, an unsteady gait, <b>pilo-erection</b> and jaundice, which was particularly noticeable in the ears. Clinical chemistry evaluation revealed an increase in the activities of ALP, AST (except Rat 1) and GGT in all animals. Total serum bilirubin, creatinine and urea concentrations were also elevated. All rats had low serum globulin concentrations with an A/G ratio above 1. 88 (except Rat 1). Post mortem examination of the rats revealed marked hepatic lesions. Histopathological changes were characterized by necrosis (variable in extent) of the centrilobular and midzonal hepatocytes, sparing the portal hepatocytes, with extensive haemorrhage and congestion. Proliferation of the bile ducts, fibrosis and oedema was also present. Ultrastructural changes in affected rats were characterized by margination of chromatin, the presence of numerous autolysosomes in necrotic hepatocytes, intramitochondrial woolly inclusions and changes in the endoplasmic reticulum. A sheep was also dosed in an attempt to reproduce the intoxication. The sheep did not exhibit clinical signs, clinical chemistry aberrations or macroscopic lesions. Histopathological and ultrastructural changes, although milder, were similar to those displayed by the rats. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids were extracted from the liver and kidneys of the rats and sheep. Retrorsine was also detected in the lungs, urine and bile of the sheep. Dissertation (MSc (Paraclinical Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008. Paraclinical Sciencesunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} of wild Rattus rattus {{living in the}} roofs of the laboratory buildings was studied by supplying food every evening and watching the behaviour of the animals at the feeding place. Some observations were also made on caged animals. The rats were predominantly of the black rattus variety but white-bellied greys appeared now and then. In breeding tests the grey colour behaved as though determined by a single recessive gene. The study covered two periods of approximately 9 months each, separated by an interval of 3 months during which a reduced quantity of food was provided and the rat population underwent a major decline. During the two periods of richer feeding the population first increased and then stabilized at a level where the animals remained in good condition {{and there was no}} starvation. In the first 9 -month period, stabilization was achieved by emigration of young adults who colonized neighbouring buildings. Towards {{the end of the second}} period, stabilization was achieved by limitation of breeding. The rats accepted a wide variety of foods, including meat, and a number of instances of predation were seen. Small vertebrates as well as insects were killed and eaten. Small pieces of food were usually eaten in situ but large bits were taken up to the nests in the roof. Such differential treatment in relation to size may be a factor of some importance in the evolution of hoarding. The rats visiting the feeding place formed a unit with a definite social structure. A single dominant male and never more than one, was always present and in certain circumstances a linear male hierarchy was formed. There were usually two or three mutually tolerant top ranking females who were subordinate to the top male but dominant to all other members of the group. Within the group attacks were directed downwards in the social scale. An attacked subordinate either fled or appeased and serious fights therefore did not develop. The most essential component of the appease. ment appeared to be a mouth to mouth contact which may be derived from the infantile pattern of 'mouth suckling'. Appeasement permitted superior rats to maintain their status without the necessity of carrying attacks on subordinates to the point where actual hurt was inflicted. A group territory round the feeding place was defended against interlopers. Both sexes took part in chasing out intruders but since males showed inhibition in attacking females, the exclusion of strange females was due principally to the activities of the home females. The point at which pursuit of an intruder stopped was regarded as the territorial boundary. This was also the limit beyond which a group member would not allow himself to be chased but it was not a prison wall. When agonistic tendencies were not aroused the animals no longer always I turned back at the boundary and foraging beyond its limits allowed them to become familiar with an area larger than the territory. Although intruders were normally driven out, it was occasionally possible for a particularly determined animal of either sex to force its way in and ultimately become a member of the group. The patterns of behaviour seen are described, particularly those concerned with hostile encounters and with mating. Scent marking with urine drip trails was not seen but adults of both sexes marked by rubbing the cheeks and ventral surface on branches. The circumstances in which tooth gnashing was heard suggest that this behaviour is not a form of threat but a response to unfamiliar auditory or visual stimuli. There was some evidence that it functioned as an alarm signal within the group. <b>Pilo-erection</b> and a gait or posture with the hind legs much extended ('stegosauring') are considered to function as threats. <b>Pilo-erection</b> occurred in situations where there was little to suggest conflict and is considered to represent a form of threat which has undergone emancipation. Various forms of displacement and ambivalent behaviour were seen. Rapid vibration of the tail occurred in thwarting situations, either during mating or when a defeated opponent suddenly vanished. There was no evidence that it acted as a signal. The common form of amicable behaviour was social grooming. Another amicable action was sitting together with the bodies in contact. Animals reared in cages remained shy and wary and even hand reared young developed the usual alarm responses to movement and noises. Females had their first litters at ages of 3 to 5 months. For first litters gestation periods were 21 to 22 days but in females that were simultaneously lactating they ranged from 23 to 29 days. Eight was the commonest litter number and ten the highest recorded. At birth the tail is very much shorter than the body but has outstripped it by the time the youngster emerges from the nest. This was found to be the result of a period of extremely rapid tail growth immediately preceding emergence. In Rattus norvegicus the peak in tail growth rate was found to be later and less striking. The difference is interpreted as related to the importance of the tail in climbing in the more arboreal R. rattus. During the second week of life an edge response (retreat from a declivity) and a clinging response made their appearance: these have the function of preventing accidental falls from a nest situated above ground level. Mouth suckling was seen only during a period of a few days towards the end of lactation. Play developed within a few days of emergence from the nest: locomotor and fighting play were the common types. Older animals occasionally joined in play with the young. In problem solving tests, first solutions were not insightful but once a solution had been found, the successful technique was at once adopted and subsequently perfected. There was no evidence of learning by imitation but the rats did learn from each other's behaviour that food could be obtained at a certain location and thus the solution of a problem by one rat accelerated its independent solution by others. The reasons for the differences between the behaviour of the free living population and the caged animals studied by other authors are discussed...|$|E
