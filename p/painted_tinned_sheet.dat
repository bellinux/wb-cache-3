40|$|In {{this highly}} {{competitive}} market where {{the demand for}} the products is increasing gradually, {{it is essential for}} a manufacturing company to reduce the production cycle time and cost accordingly. One of the methods for this is to increase the availability of process. This paper attempts to identify and quantify the causes of machine downtime in a manufacturing company. For this a four-prong approach is taken: Firstly, the major causes for the low availability of process are determined, where bearing failure is found to be the major causes of low availability. Second, combining desirability function approach and data envelopment analysis are performed to identify the sensitive input variables that affect the bearing failure. Thirdly, ordinary linear regression is used to validate the results of DEA. Lastly, some managerial implications to reduce the downtime were suggested. We have considered an electrolytic tinplating line process in a <b>tin</b> <b>sheet</b> manufacturing company as a case study. data envelopment analysis; DEA; linear regression; machine availability; machine downtime; desirability function; bottleneck identification; bottlenecks; manufacturing equipment; bearing failure; electrolytic tinplating; <b>tin</b> <b>sheet</b> manufacturing. ...|$|R

50|$|The most {{critical}} elements of any tubular grate heater are: 1) Safety - construction material and method, design and features. 2) Material - quality steel that enhances thermal conductivity, is safe (e.g. galvanized steel sweats lead), and resists thermal deterioration (e.g., <b>tin</b> <b>sheet</b> metal offers little resistance against thermal deterioration). 3) BTU rating - {{the combination of}} the unit's fire burning efficiency and the system's ability to deliver high-volume, high-temperature forced air heating into your home.|$|R
