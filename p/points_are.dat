30|$|As {{defined in}} Section  2.2, an {{interior}} grid <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a neighboring <b>point</b> when it <b>is</b> {{not in the}} contact set but one of its adjacent grid <b>points</b> <b>is</b> in the contact set. Thus the neighboring <b>points</b> can <b>be</b> found more effectively as follows. Visit each point in the contact set; if any one of its four adjacent <b>points</b> <b>is</b> not in the contact set, then the non-contacting <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a neighboring <b>point.</b> The set of all neighboring <b>points</b> <b>is</b> the neighboring set N_h.|$|R
5|$|<b>Points</b> <b>are</b> {{awarded for}} each color change (25), {{defeating}} Coily with a flying disc (500), remaining discs {{at the end}} of a stage (at higher stages, 50 or 100) and catching green balls (100) or Slick and Sam (300 each). Bonus <b>points</b> <b>are</b> also awarded for completing a screen, starting at 1,000 for the first screen of Level 1 and increasing by 250 for each subsequent completion. Extra lives are granted for reaching certain scores, which are set by the machine operator.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other formats used for bouldering {{competitions}}. Some competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of attempts at each {{problem with a}} timed rest period in between each attempt, unlike the IFSC format, in which competitors can use their allotted time however they choose. In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed {{amount of time to}} complete as many problems as possible. More <b>points</b> <b>are</b> awarded for more difficult problems, while <b>points</b> <b>are</b> deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem.|$|E

5|$|Cantor {{developed}} important {{concepts in}} topology and {{their relation to}} cardinality. For example, he showed that the Cantor set is nowhere dense, but has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers, whereas the rationals are everywhere dense, but countable. He also showed that all countable dense linear orders without end <b>points</b> <b>are</b> order-isomorphic to the rational numbers.|$|E
5|$|Constructors' Championship <b>points</b> <b>are</b> {{calculated}} by adding points scored in each race by any driver for that constructor. Up until , most seasons saw only the highest-scoring driver in each race for each constructor contributing points towards the Championship.

5|$|Each level {{starts with}} the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined. If all of the pigs are {{eliminated}} after the last bird is launched, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed, the level is incomplete and must be repeated. <b>Points</b> <b>are</b> scored for each pig killed {{as well as for}} damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus <b>points</b> <b>are</b> awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received. Players may re-attempt unlocked levels as many times as they wish in order to complete them successfully or to earn additional points to get more stars.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010 Ski Flying World Cup season, {{beginning}} in Oberstdorf, and from thereon used at all ski flying and ski jumping events, a supplementary points system was introduced. This system {{takes into account}} the wind speed and direction during each jump, as well as mid-round start gate adjustments, in order to enable a more fair contest. If a headwind is present, this is deemed an unfair advantage and <b>points</b> <b>are</b> therefore deducted as 'compensation'; if a tailwind is present, this is deemed to be a disadvantage and additional <b>points</b> <b>are</b> awarded instead. The amount of deduction or addition is calculated via coefficient using complex instrumentation which analyses the wind conditions at the time of a jump, and the value of the points themselves are in minimum increments of 0.1.|$|E

The point (1, 0, 0, …, 0), which is on the equator of all the spheres, works well for geometric spheres; the (collapsed) rim of the disk is another obvious choice.|$|E
