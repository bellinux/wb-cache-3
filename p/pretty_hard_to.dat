500|$|Mr. Brownlee, we {{have listened}} to you {{with a great deal}} of {{attention}} and the answers you have given seem <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> meet. But I have one more question... I'm selling my wheat at 25 cents a bushel. If I tried to sell a steer tomorrow I'd probably hardly get enough to pay the freight. I get three cents a dozen for eggs. I'm lucky to get a dollar for a can of cream. Will you tell me what I've got to lose? ...|$|E

500|$|In the Ancient Psychic Tandem Warcast podcast, Zack Smith and Supernatural {{writer and}} {{producer}} Jenny Klein review the episode. Both Smith and Klein expressed an appreciate for Marceline {{as well as}} her voice actress, with the former noting that, [...] "it's <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get past the awesomeness that is Olivia Olson." [...] Klein compared the relationship between Marceline and Finn in this episode to the interactions between Kim Kelly (Busy Philipps) and Sam Weir (John Francis Daley), characters from the short-lived sitcom Freaks and Geeks. Klein also commended the [...] "House Hunting Song", applauding {{the fact that it was}} sung by Pendleton Ward; she argued that it was an example of the author speaking directly to the audience, akin to listening to an audiobook.|$|E

500|$|The song {{has been}} {{referred}} to as an [...] "indecent behavior anthem" [...] due to its lyrical content. Ken Capobianco of the Boston Globe said that [...] "Say Aah" [...] was one of the [...] "popping tracks" [...] which parent album Ready was built around. Commenting on the song's lyrics, Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy stated that, [...] "Its over-abundance of hooks ('we don't buyyyy no drinks at the bar' being a personal favorite) makes it <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> dislike. And the verse from Brooklyn's Fabolous will bring in even the most hardened of fun-haters." [...] Vibe called the song [...] "the official birthday song of the year", claiming that it was better than Jeremih's [...] "Birthday Sex". The song was nominated for [...] "Viewers' Choice" [...] and [...] "Best Collaboration" [...] at the 2010 BET Awards.|$|E
500|$|Looking back on {{the play}} years later, Regiels said [...] "I was embarrassed when I {{realized}} what I had done. I wanted a hole {{to open in the}} ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> lie out of it."

2500|$|Gardiner {{was also}} known for {{controlling}} consideration of issues until the political time was right. The Bloor-Danforth subway was proposed by the City in 1956, but Gardiner stalled it until 1958 by starting three successive studies.

The last thing the United States wants to see is a resumption of nuclear testing or the proliferation of nuclear weapons – and it is the last thing Australia wants to see. By refusing to ratify this treaty, the United States Senate has done a lot to undermine the arms control agenda that the international community, including Australia, has been working on.|$|E
2500|$|The Earthstar {{entry in}} the New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock {{describes}} the wall of sound on {{the second and third}} albums: [...] " [...] Wuest's vision propels these two albums, his desire apparently is to create music that doesn't necessarily suggest a particular instrument, rather creates a new texture. Therefore, though there are credits for flute, guitar, bass, violin, viola, French horn, sitar and vocals, it's <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> distinguish any of these..." [...] Earthstar's style on French Skyline has been compared to Wolfgang Bock, Sangiuliano, and Klaus Schulze's own recordings. [...] Other albums have a softer style with more distinct instrumentation.|$|E

2500|$|ERICKSON: Well, if the kid {{came in to}} see me, {{the first}} thing I would {{do would be to}} want to examine the cross. And I would want to improve it in a very minor way.

2500|$|On May 8, 2007, Electronic Arts CEO John Riccitiello {{said that}} the release of Spore is [...] "right on the bubble with Q4 , if not, for Q1 fiscal 09 [...] ". CFO Warren Jenson stated that the game will not be {{included}} in the company's financial plan for its current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2008. Later that year, on August 1, 2007, Riccitiello reaffirmed his previous statements in another conference call, saying the release [...] "is sort of squarely targeted against March, April, May of next year", but cautioning that [...] "intellectual properties like this and games like these are so large and so complex that we chose not to put it in our fiscal year guidance because these things are <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> predict, and the outcomes can be volatile [...] So our best guess right now is Q1 of next fiscal, but we're not actually providing guidance for next fiscal at this point." [...] Maxis VP Patrick Beuchner revealed on July 10, 2007 during a G4TV interview that the Nintendo DS and mobile phone versions would ship the same day as the PC version. In October, Wright stated that Spore would be ready in roughly six months (around April 2008).|$|E
2500|$|There is {{some debate}} about whether art for the Führermuseum was {{primarily}} stolen or purchased. Hanns Christian Löhr argues in Das Braune Haus der Kunst: Hitler und der [...] "Sonderauftrag Linz" [...] ("The Brown House of Art and the 'Sonderauftrag Linz'") {{that only a small}} portion of the collection – possibly 12 percent – came from seizures or expropriation. Moreover, another 2.5% was derived from forced sales. However, Jonathan Petropoulos, a historian at Loyola College in Baltimore and an expert in wartime looting, argues that most of the purchases were not [...] "arm's length" [...] in nature. , a Dutch historian, said those sales amounted to [...] "technical looting," [...] since the Netherlands and other occupied countries were forced to accept German Reichsmarks that ultimately proved worthless. Aalders argues that [...] "If Hitler's or Goering's art agent stood on your doorstep and offered $10,000 for the painting instead of the $100,000 it was really worth, it was <b>pretty</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> refuse." [...] He adds that Nazis who encountered reluctant sellers threatened to confiscate the art or arrest the owner. Birgit Schwarz, an expert on the Führermuseum, in her review of Löhr's book, pointed out that the author focused on the purchases which were held in the Führerbau in Munich and ignored the deposits of looted art in Upper Austria in Thürntal, Kremsmünster and Hohenfurt/Vyssi Brod.|$|E
