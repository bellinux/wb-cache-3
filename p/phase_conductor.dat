50|$|The {{current drawn}} by {{non-linear}} loads, such as fluorescent & HID lighting and electronic equipment containing switching power supplies, often contains harmonics. Triplen harmonic currents (odd multiples {{of the third}} harmonic) are additive, resulting in more current in the shared neutral conductor than {{in any of the}} phase conductors. In the absolute worst case, the current in the shared neutral conductor can be triple that in each <b>phase</b> <b>conductor.</b> Some jurisdictions prohibit the use of shared neutral conductors when feeding single-phase loads from a three-phase source; others require that the neutral conductor be substantially larger than the phase conductors. It is good practice to use four-pole circuit breakers (as opposed to the standard three-pole) where the fourth pole is the neutral phase, and is hence protected against overcurrent on the neutral conductor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The Korean {{distribution}} system consists of overhead ground wire (OHGW), <b>phase</b> <b>conductors</b> and neutral wire. Especially, OHGW is installed over the <b>phase</b> <b>conductors</b> to protect {{distribution system}} from the lightning surge. The flashover rate and the magnitude of lightning overvoltage on distribution system can be affected by grounding condition of OHGW such as grounding resistance and grounding interval. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of lightning overvoltage and flashover rate according to the grounding condition of OHGW. The distribution system and lightning surge are modeled by using ElectroMagnetic Transient Program (EMTP). Also, the Monte Carlo method is applied to consider random characteristics of lightning, and the flashover rate {{is calculated based on}} IEEE std. 1410.

50|$|The zero {{sequence}} represents the {{component of the}} unbalanced phasors that is equal in magnitude and phase. Because they are in phase, {{zero sequence}} currents flowing through an n-phase network will sum to n times {{the magnitude of the}} individual zero sequence currents components. Under normal operating conditions this sum is small enough to be negligible. However, during large zero sequence events such as lightning strikes, this nonzero sum of currents can lead to a larger current flowing through the neutral conductor than the individual <b>phase</b> <b>conductors.</b> Because neutral conductors are typically not larger than individual <b>phase</b> <b>conductors,</b> a large zero sequence component can lead to the overheating of neutral conductors and to fires. One way to prevent large zero sequence currents is to use a delta connection which appears as an open circuit to zero sequence currents.|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} we discuss the {{question}} of eddy currents induced in screens of a symmetrical three-phase singlepole gas-insulated transmission line (GIL).

In the non-conducting external and internal area of the screen we use Laplace equation for the magnetic field strength taking into account the reverse reaction of eddy currents induced in the screen. In the conducting screen we apply Helmholtz equation for eddy currents density. Using classical boundary conditions we determine the density of the currents. The solutions obtained are used to determine the total eddy currents induced in all the screens of the GIL under consideration...|$|E

As a second order system, the electrical {{transmission line}} is potentially experiencing the resonance phenomena if the natural frequency reaches the 50 Hz operation frequency. This paper explains the study of resonance phenomena in Extra High Voltage (EHV) 500 kV transmission line between two 500 kV Substation in West Java Region by the modeling and simulation. The results show that the transmission line is very vulnerable to the resonance phenomenon which is indicated by the existence of voltage up to 800 kV when this transmission line is not yet energized and causing one of the line arrester broken. The results also show that under the resonance phenomena, single pole auto reclose process is potentially failed. This study is expected to increase the concern for the resonance phenomena in the transmission lines...|$|E

40|$|The {{apparent}} impedance to single- phase {{earth fault}} place is obtained applying the classical algorithm of distance protection. Thanks {{to a complex}} character of this impedance, the expression for the algorithm decomposes into two equations, allowing two unknowns to be calculated: the reactance to the fault place and the fault resistance, provided the faulty phase voltage and current as well as ground current or zero sequence current are known. To do this, a special mathematical procedure called here the apparent impedance method is employed, which implies the use of specific line parameters. For high voltage two-terminal and radial lines of distribution networks the iterative procedure could be applied {{under the condition that}} the faulty phase voltage is measured in a distribution network with sufficient precision. Among other specific line parameters, the inconsistency of specific resistance of the <b>phase</b> <b>conductor</b> deserves special attention because of its unpredictable nature and wide range of deviations causing inadmissible errors in distribution networks. To cope with this shortcoming, the temperature of <b>phase</b> <b>conductor</b> wire should be known at the moment of fault inception. Otherwise, the single-phase earth fault current should be increased to the level above the half of the line load current. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—High-impedance bus {{differential}} relays {{have been}} applied successfully for decades. These relays are preferred for many reasons, including their speed, security, and ease of setting and wiring, {{as well as the}} high number of breakers that can be included in the zone of protection. However, these relays present challenging application considerations. The relationship between the CT knee-point voltage and the relay setting voltage remains mysterious to many. This paper provides a review of the high-impedance differen-tial principle. It details the performance of CTs used in high-impedance applications and shares the CT and relay current waveforms experienced during primary high-current laboratory testing. The paper explains the resulting digitally filtered signal used by the relay. It also investigates dependability for internal faults, including sensitivity for low-magnitude faults, and secu-rity for external faults. Throughout the paper, practical application guidelines are provided for common and challenging applications. I.
