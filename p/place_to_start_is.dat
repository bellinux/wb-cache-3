50|$|In {{order to}} reduce failures, a precise {{knowledge}} of bond strength quality measurement during product design and subsequent manufacture is of vital importance. The best <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>is</b> with the failure mode. This {{is based on the}} assumption that there is a particular failure mode, or range of modes, that may occur within a product. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the bond test should replicate the mode, or modes of interest. However, exact replication is not always possible. The test load must be applied to some part of the sample and transferred through the sample to the bond. If this part of the sample is the only option and is weaker than the bond itself, the sample will fail before the bond.|$|E

It's a liberation struggle, not only in the political sense, but in every sense. And the Honduran women have been active participants in the resistance against the Honduras coup d'etat.

[...] "I {{want to make the}} experience something that audiences benefit from, that makes people want urgently to go to the theatre.

[...] "I see it as my responsibility to put the most exciting work on stage that I possibly can. ... Some of it will be new, but we will do classic plays if they have a new spin on them, plays that will tour around Scotland and be strong enough to tour internationally." [...] Nonetheless, the focus would be local. [...] "This is my vision," [...] she said. [...] "I want the scale of show that Britain today rarely exports. But I think the <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>is</b> home.

[...] Working with Scotland's existing theatre community would be [...] "about finding ways of putting people together to come up with ideas, and then supporting those ideas, making a series of connections that create chemistry." [...] Featherstone retrospectively summarised her vision for the NTS in 2012, [...] "For me, when I started, the task was to prove Scotland could create and sustain an outward-looking, modern, contemporary national theatre, and that is what my task was." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{trackbed}} remains remarkably intact, {{although some}} {{is now on}} private land. The most convenient <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>is</b> near Coalville's Morrisons outlet (at [...] ) where the trackbed into Whitwick has been made a public right of way. This footpath meanders {{along the edge of}} the Hermitage Lake (a former clay quarry), past the modern leisure centre and then under the South Street bridge before passing the Whitwick station building and platform (although unfortunately the platform is unkempt and overgrown). This footpath along the trackbed ends at a T-junction just after Whitwick station, while the line went straight on over another bridge. The trackbed is less clear here, as it is now under someone's garden, who has carried out many alterations. At the other side of the garden however, the trackbed still retains its original ballast and is in remarkably good condition for a short distance, passing through an area known as 'Happy Valley', until the growth of vegetation starts again. It is still clear where it went, but less easy to follow due to vegetation. The line still has ballast here. For reference, we are now passing under Whitwick's [...] "Dumps Road" [...] bridge. The trackbed is still obvious here, yet it becomes less clear as we pass through Thringstone. Alterations to the surroundings make it hard to tell. The trackbed can be readily picked up near Thringstone Wood, which will take you across the aforementioned viaduct, and bring you past the priory and to the edge of a missing bridge, and a busy road below. The bridge here was demolished in 1967. Across this gap, the trackbed continues and soon turns into private land owned by a nearby farm. Large parts of the trackbed are used by the farm as roads for their machinery, though it is still an obvious railway trackbed (there is no ballast here). West of Shepshed the trackbed has been converted to a footpath, popular with dog walkers and boys practicing their skills on mountain bicycles. The footpath starts at Charnwood Road in Shepshed (...) and finishes in a dead-end about 2 km to the west (...)
