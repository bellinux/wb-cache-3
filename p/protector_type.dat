5000|$|A network <b>protector</b> is a <b>type</b> of {{electric}} protective device used in electricity distribution systems. The network protector automatically disconnect its associated power transformer from the secondary network {{when the power}} starts flowing in reverse direction. Network protectors are used on both spot networks and grid networks. The secondary grid system improves continuity of service for customers, since multiple sources are available to supply the load; a fault with any one supply is automatically isolated by the network protector and does not interrupt service from the other sources. Secondary grids are often used in downtown areas of cities where there are many customers in a small area.|$|R
50|$|Most {{disposable}} earplugs are elastic ones made {{of memory}} foam, that is typically rolled into a tightly compressed cylinder (without creases) by the user's fingers and then {{inserted in the}} ear canal. Once released, the earplug expands until it seals the canal, blocking the sound vibrations that could reach the eardrum. Other disposable plugs simply push into the ear canal without being rolled first. Sometimes earplugs are connected with a cord to keep them together when not in use. Other common material bases for disposable earplugs are viscous wax or silicone. Custom moulded earplugs fall into two categories: Laboratory made and Formed in Place. Laboratory made requires a carefully professionally taken impression {{be made of the}} ear canal and outer ear that is sent to a laboratory to be checked and made into a hearing protector. Formed in place uses the same style of process to make an impression of the ear canal and outer ear and then turns that impression into the <b>protector.</b> Both <b>types</b> of custom moulded earplugs are non-disposable with the laboratory made typically lasting for 3 - 5 years and the formed in place lasting for 1 - 2 years.|$|R

40|$|Their {{combination}} of large continuous energy ratings and very large time constants allows supercapacitors {{to be used}} in surge protection circuits. This fact, supported by recent research publications and laboratory tests, has assisted the authors to propose a new surge protection circuit topology known as the supercapacitor-assisted surge absorber (SCASA). This technique utilizes a multi-winding transformer, common surge protector devices such as metal oxide Varistors (MOV) and/or semiconductor types combined with a supercapacitor sub-circuit to absorb part of the surge energy usually expected to dissipate within the MOV or the semiconductor. The paper presents design details and test results for a differential mode surge protector based on the SCASA technique where the test device was subjected to lightning-type surges defined in international standards for Class-A and Class B <b>type</b> <b>protectors.</b> The performance of a prototype based on Class-B waveforms of up to 6. 6 kV surges generated from a lightning surge simulator are discussed in the paper.

40|$|Electronic textiles, {{known as}} {{computational}} fabrics, offer an emerging method for constructing wearable and large area applications. Because e-textiles are battery-driven and fault-prone systems, {{there is a}} need for developing a dependable infrastructure of the electric networks for e-textiles. In this paper, a new infrastructure of the power networks for e-textiles, Flexible Power Network (FPN), is presented. Instead of drawing power from a fixed battery as in the conventional electric networks, the power consuming nodes in a FPN can obtain power energy from one of the choices of batteries available with the help of the battery selectors. We also introduce the over current protectors into the battery nodes (BN) to protect the batteries from wasting the charge when short-circuit faults occur. The electric features of battery selectors and over current <b>protectors,</b> the two <b>types</b> of important electric devices used in FPNs, are illustrated in the paper. We have performed simulation experiments and the results show that our FPNs are more dependable than some common electric networks published before in the cases of short- and open-circuit faults. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevention}} of fractures amongst older people consists of (i) {{prevention and treatment}} of osteoporosis, (ii) {{prevention of}} falling and (iii) prevention of fractures using injury-site protection. As {{the great majority of}} hip fractures are caused by a side-ways fall with direct impact on the greater trochanter of the proximal femur, one approach to prevention is the use of an ade-quately configured padded, firm-shield external hip <b>protector.</b> With this <b>type</b> of two-part design, the impacting force and energy are, {{at the time of the}} fall-impact, first weakened by the padding part of the protector and then diverted away from the greater trochanter by the shield part of the same. Following this line, a series of consecutive studies by the Accident & Trauma Research Center at the UKK Institute, Tampere, Finland, found that a padded, strong-shield hip protector was effective in preventing hip fractures. In the context of the wider literature on hip protectors, these more encouraging results suggest the need for a more rigorous regulation of protector design and characteristics. Alongside inadequacies of design, the other most frequent general problem with hip protectors is compliance. Not all elderly people with a high risk of hip fracture will agree to use hip protectors and in those who do, long-term adherence may decrease. Caregiver motivation and involve-ment appear therefore to be crucial...|$|R

40|$|Recreational music {{exposure}} {{is a potential}} risk factor for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Augmented hearing protectors have been designed with modified attenuation characteristics to combine hearing protection and listening comfort. However, to date, only a few independent studies have assessed the performance of those augmented protectors in realistic exposure conditions. This study compares the listening experience and temporary effects on cochlear status with different types of earplugs after exposure to contemporary club music. Five different types of commercially available hearing protectors were worn, all commonly used during leisure-time music exposure. Four of them were augmented premolded earplugs and the fifth type was an inexpensive, standard earplug frequently distributed for free at music events. During five different test sessions of 30 min each, participants not professionally involved in music wore one particular <b>type</b> of <b>protector.</b> Contemporary club music was played at sound pressure levels (SPLs) representative of concerts and bars. After each listening session, a questionnaire on sound quality and general appreciation was completed. In addition, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were measured directly before and after music exposure. The reported appreciation clearly differed depending on the addressed characteristics and the specific earplug type. In this test group, the reported appreciation mainly depended on comfort and looks, while differences in sound quality were less noticeable. The changes in OAE amplitude before and after noise exposure were small in terms of clinical standards. Nevertheless, the observed temporary shifts differed systematically for the different <b>types</b> of hearing <b>protectors,</b> with two <b>types</b> of musician earplug showing a more systematic decline than the others.

40|$|OBJETIVO: analisar o conforto do protetor auditivo {{individual}} como parte de uma intervenção para prevenção de perdas auditivas em trabalhadores expostos a elevados níveis de ruído, por meio da utilização de um questionário de avaliação de conforto. MÉTODO: realizou-se análise dos documentos da empresa, investigação do ruído e uso de protetor auditivo individual anterior, seleção do protetor auditivo individual, atividades educativas, aplicação de questionário e realização audiometrias. A população foi composta de 20 trabalhadores expostos a ruído acima de 80 dB(A). Os trabalhadores utilizaram protetores tipo inserção e concha, cada um durante 15 dias e responderam ao questionário de avaliação do conforto em duas ocasiões. RESULTADOS: dentre os participantes 85 % eram homens e 15 % mulheres, idade média 35 anos. O Índice de Conforto do protetor tipo inserção foi 4, 6 e concha 6, 1, com tempo médio de utilização de 6 horas 40 minutos. Dentre as razões negativas ao uso do equipamento destacaram-se: interferência com a comunicação (20 %), diminuição da audição (10 %) e não sentir necessidadede usar (10 %). CONCLUSÃO: os protetores auriculares estudados tiveram seus escores cotados em níveis aceitáveis, sendo considerados ambos confortáveis. Contudo, existiu uma diferença significante no Índice de Conforto entre protetores de diferentes tipos (inserção e concha). Com isso, pôde-se concluir que, o protetor auditivo individual tipo concha foi considerado o mais confortável e melhor aceito pela população estudada. PURPOSE: {{to analyze}} {{the comfort of the}} individual hearing protectors as part of an intervention for prevention of hearing loss in workers exposed to high noise levels, using a questionnaire of comfort assessment. METHOD: company safety and health records were reviewed, noise measurements were performed, new HPDs were selected, the comfort of the devices was evaluated and audiometric tests were conducted. The study population was 20 workers exposed to noise levels above 80 dB(A). The workers used two types of HPD (earplugs and earmuffs), each for 15 days, followed by an application of the questionnaire after each trial period. RESULTS: 85 % of the participants were males and 15 % females and their average age was 35 years old. The comfort index for the studied earplug was 4. 6, and for the studied earmuff was 6. 1.
