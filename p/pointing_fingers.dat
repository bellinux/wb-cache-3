Without <b>pointing</b> <b>fingers</b> at the Soviet Union, Mao criticized their ideological ally, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, while the Soviets returned the favour by proxy via criticizing the Party of Labour of Albania, a Chinese ally. In 1963, the Chinese Communist Party began to openly denounce the Soviet Union, publishing a series of nine polemics against its perceived revisionism, {{with one of them}} being titled On Khrushchev's Phoney Communism and Historical Lessons for the World, in which Mao charged that Khrushchev was not only a revisionist but also increased the danger of capitalist restoration. Khrushchev's downfall from an internal coup d'état in 1964 also contributed to Mao's fears of his own political vulnerability, particularly because of his declining prestige amongst his colleagues following the Great Leap Forward.|$|E

[...] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, [...] "t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers.

40|$|Abstract: The {{immobilization}} of non-rigid objects {{is currently}} an active research area in robotics. This paper explores {{the problem by}} studying the immobilization of serial chains of rigid polygons connected by rotational joints. The chain is to be immobilized at a given placement by frictionless <b>point</b> <b>fingers</b> that may contact the polygons only along edge inte-riors or at concave vertices. In earlier work we established that any serial chain of n 6 = 3 polygons without parallel edges can be immobilized with n+ 2 frictionless <b>point</b> <b>fingers.</b> This paper establishes {{that this is the}} minimal number of frictionless <b>point</b> <b>fingers</b> required for the immobilization of such chains. The paper also establishes that serial chains of n = 3 polygons are indeed exceptional and require six rather than five <b>point</b> <b>fingers</b> for their immobilization. The paper next introduces a robust version of immobility, which requires that immobilization be maintained with respect to small finger placement errors. The paper describes how to robustly immobilize any serial chain of n polygons without parallel edges at the cost of only one additional frictionless <b>point</b> <b>finger.</b> The immobilization procedures described in the paper are constructive and readily implementable as part of grasp and manipulation planners. ...|$|R

[...] He regretted not stressing his plan to appoint [...] "a 35-member representative council to help him run the nation" [...] and to hold assembly elections in 90 days and a presidential election (in which he would not run) in December. He said he had suspended the assembly [...] "because the new government would never have accomplished its goals with a congress so stacked to favor one party." [...] He also denied any link to Carlos Andrés Pérez. [...] "There is no connection between me and him," [...] Carmona said. [...] "I did not receive one cent from him. I am not manipulated." [...] "There was no rebellion or coup" [...] Carmona told The New York Times after the counter-coup. [...] "There was simply a vacuum of power that came about after the military announced the resignation of the president." [...] Carmona said he had accepted the interim presidency because he was told by military officers that Chávez had resigned. [...] "I was called by them to fill that role," [...] he said. [...] "I was called by officers and others to take over. And I had the courage to take that step." [...] He told The Guardian that he took [...] "full responsibility" [...] for the actions he made, emphasizing that [...] "there was no premeditation, no conspiracy" [...] behind the coup and his elevation to the presidency. He said that after the April 11 march on Miraflores, he had been phoned by someone (whom he would not name) who said that Chávez had quit and offered him the presidency. [...] "Everything happened so fast that mistakes were made," [...] Carmona said. [...] "If I could go back in time, I would have had a triumvirate, the power would have been shared – but everything was so quick." [...] When asked if he had been [...] "used by the military," [...] he replied: [...] "There might have been people who used me, you never {{know what is going on}} underground," [...] but he insisted that he [...] "acted purely in the higher interests of the country." [...] One Western diplomat told The Miami Herald that during Carmona's brief presidency [...] "everybody was saying what a great guy he was, professional, straight, ethical" [...] but that after his ouster [...] "everyone is <b>pointing</b> <b>fingers</b> at him for being a dope."

Already before the fog lifted a fast galleass had brought the news down Channel that the Spanish were on the sea, and the King's fleet was under way. Now their long array of sails, gay with the coats and colors of the towns which had furnished them, lay bright against the Kentish coast from Dungeness Point to Rye. Nine and twenty ships were there from Southampton, Shoreham, Winchelsea, Hastings, Rye, Hythe, Romney, Folkestone, Deal, Dover and Sandwich. With their great sails slued round to catch the wind they ran out, whilst the Spanish, like the gallant foes that they have ever been, turned their heads landward to meet them. With flaunting banners and painted sails, blaring trumpets and clashing cymbals, the two glittering fleets, dipping and rising on the long Channel swell, drew slowly together.|$|E
