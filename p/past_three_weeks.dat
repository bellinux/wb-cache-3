25|$|Handicap International {{estimates}} {{that up to}} 50 percent of people injured during the attacks have sustained severe injuries that will require rehabilitation to prevent permanent disability. Of the 1.5 million {{people living in the}} Gaza Strip, international and national agencies working in disability and rehabilitation estimate that, even before the military operation, over 10 percent had moderate or severe impairments. They estimate that as many as half of the 5,380 men, women and children injured over the <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of conflict may suffer lifelong impairment, exacerbated by the inability of rehabilitation workers to provide early intervention. These agencies has highlighted the importance of providing early intervention for those newly injured, especially those discharged prematurely from health facilities; re-establishing and strengthening the capacity of rehabilitation services and disabled peoples organizations to respond to the increased need. This is especially critical given that the main provider of specialist rehabilitation services in Gaza sustained severe damage and is not yet fully operational. Even before 27 December, {{the first day of the}} attacks, there was already a back-log of people waiting for specialised services including rehabilitation and surgery.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} games, God of War: Ascension {{is set in}} an alternate version of ancient Greece populated by the Olympian Gods, Titans, and other beings from Greek mythology. Game events are set six months after Kratos killed his family, and ten years before the original God of War (2005); Chains of Olympus (2008) takes place some time between Ascension and God of War. The game's narrative takes place over four weeks; it shifts between the present (the fourth week) and <b>past</b> (the preceding <b>three</b> <b>weeks),</b> while the player controls Kratos in both. Several locations, including the Prison of the Damned and some real-world locations—including the village Kirra, the city Delphi, and the island Delos—are explored in the game.|$|R

40|$|Glucose {{molecules}} {{are joined}} to protein molecules to form stable ketoamines, or fructosamines, through glycation, a nonenzymatic mechanism involving a labile Schiff base inter-mediate and the Amadori rearrangement. The amount of fructosamine in serum is increased in diabetes mellitus {{owing to the}} abnormally high concentration of sugar in blood. The concentration of fructosamine in serum thus reflects the degree of glycemic control attained by the diabetic patient and is useful in monitoring the effectiveness of therapy in diabetes {{over a period of}} several weeks, in a manner analogous to the determination of glycated hemoglobin. 01 the analytical approaches used to measure fructosamine, affinity chromatography with m-aminophenylboronic acid and the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction method appear to be the most practical means for clinical chemists to assay fructosa-mine quickly, economically, and accurately. Fructosamine values can readily distinguish normal individuals and diabetic patients in good glycemic control from diabetics in poor control. Unlike glycated hemoglobin, which reflects the aver-age blood sugar concentration over the past six to eight weeks, fructosamine reflects the average blood sugar con-centration over the <b>past</b> two to <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> Thus a clinical advantage is that fructosamine responds more quickly to changes in therapy, thereby allowing for improved glycemic control. Used in conjunction with determinations of blood sugar and (or) of glycated hemoglobin, or by itself, the fructosamine assay can provide clinically useful information for the detection and control of diabetes.
