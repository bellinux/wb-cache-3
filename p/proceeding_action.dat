40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} the disruptive effect of <b>proceeds</b> of crime <b>action</b> on criminal activity, and to identify factors associated with successful <b>proceeds</b> of crime <b>action.</b> Executive summary Illicit drug trafficking {{is a source of}} funds for further trafficking and for supporting the lifestyles of criminals. Drug trafficking has been closely linked with organised crime and with social harms. This project had two main aims: • To identify the disruptive effect of <b>proceeds</b> of crime <b>action</b> on criminal activity. The project attempted to measure the disruptive effect by developing an economic model that estimated the multiplier impact of the reinvestment of the profits of drug trafficking. • The project also attempted to identify factors associated with successful <b>proceeds</b> of crime <b>action.</b> There are two main audiences for the findings of this study. Senior police, police intelligence, policymakers and researchers will be interested primarily in measuring the disruptive effect of <b>proceeds</b> of crime <b>action.</b> Police responsible for managing proceeds of crime investigations and senior investigators will be interested in the practical applications of findings relating to success factors in financial investigations. The results of the project should improve agencies’ ability to target trafficking and increase the seizure of proceeds of crime. The proposed index of the disruptive effect of proceeds of crime action—the Proceeds of Crime Drug Disruption Index (POCDDI) —will also allow agencies to provide both the Government and the community with a more accurate assessment of the value of their proceeds of crime initiatives...|$|R

2500|$|Utilitarianism is {{typically}} taken {{to assess the}} rightness or wrongness of an action by considering just {{the consequences of that}} action. Bentham very carefully distinguishes motive from intention and says that motives are not in themselves good or bad but can be referred to as such on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or pain. He adds that, [...] "from every kind of motive, may <b>proceed</b> <b>actions</b> that are good, others that are bad, and others that are indifferent." [...] Mill makes a similar point and explicitly says that [...] "motive {{has nothing to do with}} the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the agent. He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble." ...|$|R
