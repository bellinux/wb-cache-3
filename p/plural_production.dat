40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effects of}} {{quantity and quality of}} input on bilingual children's acquisition of complex plural morphology in Welsh. Study 1 {{explored the}} quality of adult input and revealed target-like marking of plural forms in naturalistic adult speech. Study 2 presented eighty-eight 7 â�� 11 -year-old children, across three bilingual language groups (L 1 Welsh, 2 L 1, and L 2 Welsh), with a <b>plural</b> <b>production</b> task. Results revealed performances approaching L 1 adult norms among L 1 Welsh-speaking bilinguals, but delayed progression among 2 L 1 and L 2 Welsh bilinguals, although analyses of errors revealed various levels of structural knowledge. Forms requiring the addition of a plural suffix were less difficult to acquire than those involving alterations to the root, with each type acquired with greater levels of accuracy with increasing levels of exposure to the language. The implications of these findings for our understanding of bilingual acquisition of complex structures under minority language conditions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The correct {{use of an}} affix, such as the English plural or {{past tense}} suffixes, is {{generally}} assumed to reflect mastery of the relevant morphological process. An alternate view holds {{that the use of}} an affix reflects not only morphological competence, but also additional factors including syntactic, semantic and phonological abilities. The present paper reports on a set of experiments in support of this latter view specifically examining the role of phonology on English-speaking children’s ability to produce the <b>plural.</b> <b>Plural</b> <b>productions</b> were elicited from two-year-olds for nouns with different codas, or endings (e. g. dogs vs. keys). The results provide evidence that the <b>production</b> of the <b>plural</b> morpheme –s is partly governed by children’s developing ability to articulate or perceive the phonological form of the plural. This supports a model of language learning in which the acquisition of different components of grammar interact with each other versus a model that is exclusively modular...|$|R
40|$|The English plural {{is about}} the number of {{individuals}} in a set of like kinds. Two year old children use the plural but do not do so in all obligatory contexts. The present report asks whether the limitations on their use of the plural in any way related to meaning. Experiment 1 elicited <b>plural</b> <b>productions</b> from 2 -year olds (n= 26) for sets of size two and four and for instances of basic level categories that were either similar or identical. Children {{were much more likely to}} produce the plural of these well known nouns when there were four rather than two and when the instances were identical rather than merely similar. Experiment 2 examined spontaneous productions of parents speech to two-year-olds (n = 16). They showed a comparable similarity effect, but not a number effect. The results provide new evidence on children’s acquisition of the English plural, showing that children’s early productions are not just limited by knowledge of the noun and its plural form but also is limited by properties of the labeled sets in ways that are relevant to the underlying meaning of the plural...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Some {{variability}} in children's early productions of grammatical morphemes reflects phonological factors. For example, production of 3 rd person singular -s is increased in utterance-final versus utterance-medial position, and in simple versus cluster codas (e. g., sees vs. hits). Understanding {{the factors that}} govern such variability {{is an important step}} toward modeling developmental processes. In this study, the authors examined the generality of these effects by determining whether position and coda complexity influence production of plural -s, which phonologically manifests the same as 3 rd person singular -s. Method: The authors used an elicited imitation task to examine the speech of 16 two-year-olds. Eight plural nouns (half contained simple codas, half contained cluster codas) were elicited utterance-medially and utterance-finally. Acoustic analysis of each noun was used to identify acoustic cues associated with coda production. Results: Results showed that <b>plural</b> <b>production</b> was more robust in utterance-final versus utterance-medial position but equally robust in simple versus cluster codas. Conclusions: These findings extend positional effects on morpheme production to plural -s. An effect of coda complexity was not observed for plural but was observed for 3 rd person singular, which raises the possibility that the morphological representation proper influences the degree to which phonological factors affect morpheme production. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop the}} view that {{inflection}} is driven partly by non-phonological analogy and that non-phonological information is of particular importance to the inflection of non-canonical roots, which {{in the view of}} [Marcus, G. F., Brinkmann, U., Clahsen, H., Wiese, R., & Pinker, S. (1995). German inflection: the exception that proves the rule. Cognitive Psychology, 29, 189 - 256. ] are inflected by a symbolic rule process. We used the Dutch plural to evaluate these claims. An analysis of corpus data shows that a model using non-phonological information (orthography) produces significantly fewer errors on plurals of non-canonical Dutch nouns, in particular borrowings, than a model that includes only phonological information. Moreover, we show that a double default system, as proposed by Pinker [Pinker, S. (1999). Words and rules. London: Phoenix. ], does not offer an advantage over the latter model. A second study, examining the use of orthography in an online <b>plural</b> <b>production</b> task, shows that, in Dutch, the chosen pseudoword plural is significantly affected by non-phonological information. A final simulation study confirms that these results are in line with a model of inflectional morphology that explains the inflection of non-canonical roots by non-phonological analogy instead of by a default rule process...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} nature of {{contemporary}} sculptural practices {{in relation to the}} broader field of installed sculpture (which deploy articulated, interrelated, but autonomous components) and in the context of recent approaches to both curation and display. The artistic work and attendant commentary constitute a response to the issues of sculptural agency and display raised by both the practice-based outcomes and key works of several contemporary artists: Gabriel Kuri, Gedi Sibony, Melanie Counsell, Marc Camille Chaimowicz and Michael Dean. In a number of exhibitions ‘post-installation’ practices and the function of ‘montage’ sculpture is examined. Through outlining the current landscape of sculptural production and medium specificity a progressive notion of the monument is established. The sculptural artwork is seen to retain a political resistance, as both art-object and thing in the world. An assessment is made of how sculptures produce space within and through their exhibition context, directly related to the production of space as a whole (a social morphology posited by Henri Lefebvre). Applying a conception of time in reference to spatial production opens up the artwork’s potential to draw on complex codes of mnemonic function, which can potentially generate emancipatory agency from ideological issues in late-capitalism. Re-readings of key installed works by Marc Camille Chaimowicz and Mark Dean, through contexts derived from Nietzsche and Mark Fisher, reveal how sculptures can activate specific mnemonic codes, or collective memory. Such art works utilise a ‘forgetful memory’ – a reflexive process of positing, junking and reimagining relationships to cultural information. The body of artistic work produced for this research, intertwined with its critical reflection, makes an original contribution to knowledge by interrogating theoretically and experientially the potentials of ‘the sculptural’, as part of the <b>plural</b> <b>production</b> of art and exhibition-making. By means of practice and its outcomes, the research engages the current dynamics of spatial production and radicality of sculptural objecthood. The work examines the complex relationships between social memory and historicity, with which sculpture in an exhibition environment can engage...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>production</b> of German <b>plural</b> nouns by two aphasic {{participants}} with non-fluent speech production. Experimental tasks included two production tasks: (1) picture naming of single and multiple objects, and (2) an elicitation task of singular and plural nouns. Materials were controlled for regularity and predictability of plural form, and for dominance of number, {{referring to the}} relative difference in word form frequency between a singular and its corresponding plural form. Both regularity and number dominance {{have been shown to}} affect <b>plural</b> noun <b>production</b> in both unimpaired and aphasic speakers, but the underlying functional origin of these effects is still a matter of debate. The results point to differences in the lexical representation and processing of regular and irregular German plural nouns. Thus, the data are in line with the dual mechanism account. 20 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Children’s {{early use}} of {{grammatical}} morphemes is notoriously variable. Recent {{findings indicate that}} some variability in early productions is systematically related to speech planning factors, suggesting that variability in morpheme production is not solely the consequence of impoverished syntactic representations. For example, {{research has shown that}} plural -s is produced more reliably in utterance-final compared to utterance-medial position. Here we examined the locus of the positional effect for <b>plural</b> -s. <b>Productions</b> of eight <b>plural</b> nouns in utterance-medial and utterance-final position were elicited from three groups of 2 -year-olds. Across the groups, we manipulated articulatory difficulty of the medial context such that it consisted of a stop consonant (e. g., dogs bark), a stressed vowel (e. g., dogs eat), or an unstressed vowel (e. g., dogs arrive). Results showed a robust positional effect for the difficult context created by the stop consonant. The positional effect was not observed for the simple articulatory context created by the stressed vowel. However, planning difficulty for the unstressed vowel was sufficiently increased such that the positional effect again emerged in this context. These results suggest that production of grammatical morphemes is influenced by articulatory planning factors, which points to specific constraints for theoretical accounts of language acquisition. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|What {{happens when}} fiction is {{considered}} as a space for art, and when art is {{considered as a}} space for fiction? This thesis addresses these questions through a practice-led study of the fictional writings of Don DeLillo. DeLillo has been publishing novels since 1971, each of which have engaged with aspects of art production and art criticism. The formal implications of this have played a polarising role in the criticism that has gathered around his work, with some critics reading DeLillo's fictional artworks as evidence of a highly post-modem and <b>plural</b> <b>production,</b> whilst others have seen these works as more modernist reflections on the writing process. In this thesis propose that by reading DeLillo's writing through the art-historical oeuvre of Thomas Crow, and his notion of the 'advanced-artwork', that {{a new model of}} practice can be defined, where writing becomes the site for the production of visual art, and visual art becomes the site for writing. The 'advanced-artwork', according to Crow is formed by multiple practices that operate within a single work, and incorporates elements of critical thought within its physical production - qualities in DeLillo's fiction that have energised his critics, but have yet to be analysed using an analogous model from another field. After a review of the aspects of DeLillo criticism that that set the ground for these questions, and a parallel review of Crow's art-historical writings, I address the potential for synthesising these areas on two fronts. Firstly, by a detailed study of DeLillo's 1988 novel Libra, reading it through art-theory and proposing that the novel fulfils many of the criteria of the advanced-artwork, as well as showing how this reading allows many of the problematic questions in existing DeLillo criticism to be addressed. My second means of approaching Libra in these terms is the practical component of my thesis. This {{takes the form of a}} vi sual artwork made up of wri ting, produced in response to an archive ofDeLillo's drafts and working papers. Using a manual typewriter, like DeLillo himself, I reproduce successive drafts of sections of the novel that are conceptually related to the questions that in the rest of the thesis I have addressed in theoretical terms. In using this dual method of questioning of art's potential relationship to writing, I have attempted to use the work of a single author to reflect on the possibilities of writing as a medium for contemporary art-practice, and the potential of art to become a site of literary criticism. But by grounding my critique of DeLillo's fiction in the raw materials of the medium I have also attempted to question the space of the page in wider terms, as an expansive site of inter-disciplinary practice that allows its component parts to be set in critical discourse.

40|$|Many English-speaking {{children}} use plural nominal {{forms in}} spontaneous speech {{before the age}} of two, and display some understanding of <b>plural</b> inflection in <b>production</b> tasks. However, results from an intermodal preferential study suggested a lack of comprehension of nominal plural morphology at 24  months of age (Kouider, Halberda, Wood, & Carey, 2006). The goal {{of the present study was}} to reexamine this issue using a phonologically and morphologically controlled set of stimuli. The results show that 24 -month-olds do demonstrate understanding of nominal plural morphology, but only for the voiceless plural allomorph /s/, not /z/. Further study suggests that this result is not driven by input frequency, but rather by the longer duration of the /s/allomorph, which may enhance its perceptual salience. The implications for learning grammar more generally are discussed. 16 page(s...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe role {{of number}} {{dominance}} (singular vs. <b>plural)</b> in word <b>production</b> has revealed contrasting results in Dutch and English. Here, {{we compared the}} production of Dutch regular plural forms that are more frequent than their stems (plural-dominant plurals) to plurals that are less frequent than their stems (singular-dominant plurals) in a spoken picture-naming paradigm. Moreover, the role of inflectional entropy during spoken word production was assessed. The results revealed that singular-dominant singulars were produced significantly faster and more accurately than their corresponding plurals, independently of inflectional entropy. However, the <b>production</b> of plural-dominant <b>plurals</b> and singulars was modulated by inflectional entropy, and a plural disadvantage only found if the inflectional variants were not uniformly distributed. Critically, uniformly distributed variants showed a plural advantage in this condition. Our findings suggest that singular-dominant and plural-dominant plurals are processed differently, which we discuss {{in the context of}} morphological processing theories in spoken language production...|$|R
