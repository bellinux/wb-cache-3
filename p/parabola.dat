5|$|Galileo {{showed a}} modern {{appreciation}} for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the <b>parabola,</b> {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the <b>parabola</b> was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a <b>parabola,</b> but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a <b>parabola</b> would be only very slight.|$|E
5|$|Besides the ellipse {{with the}} centre at the focus, Newton also applied Proposition 6 to the {{hyperbola}} (Proposition 12), and the <b>parabola</b> (Proposition 13). Also, to the ellipse with {{the centre of}} force at {{the centre of the}} ellipse (Proposition 10), to the equiangular spiral (Proposition 9), and to the circle, with the centre of force not coinciding with the centre, and even on the circumference (Proposition 7).|$|E
25|$|Curves with closed-form {{solutions}} for arc length include the catenary, circle, cycloid, logarithmic spiral, <b>parabola,</b> semicubical <b>parabola</b> and straight line.

25|$|When a <b>parabola</b> is rolled along a {{straight}} line, the roulette curve traced by its focus is a catenary. The envelope of the directrix of the <b>parabola</b> {{is also a}} catenary. The involute from the vertex, that is the roulette formed traced by a point starting at the vertex when a line is rolled on a catenary, is the tractrix.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} paper, we propose a new {{definition}} of discrete <b>parabolas,</b> the so-called arithmetic discrete <b>parabolas.</b> We base our approach on a non-constant thickness function and characterized the 0 -connected and 1 -connected <b>parabolas</b> {{in terms of}} thickness function. This results extend the well-known characterization of the κ-connectedness of arithmetic discrete lines, depending on the norm || ·||∞ and || ·|| 1 of their normal vector...|$|R

The Blue dotted line shows the corresponding control polygon of a B-spline curve in 3D homogeneous coordinates, formed by multiplying the NURBS by the control points by the corresponding weights. The blue <b>parabolas</b> are the corresponding B-spline curve in 3D, consisting of three <b>parabolas.</b> By choosing the NURBS control points and weights, the <b>parabolas</b> are parallel to the opposite face of the gray cone (with its tip at the 3D origin), so dividing by w to project the <b>parabolas</b> onto the w=1 plane results in circular arcs (red circle; see conic section).|$|R

25|$|It {{is often}} said that Galileo thought the curve of a hanging chain was parabolic. In his Two New Sciences (1638), Galileo says that a hanging cord is an {{approximate}} <b>parabola,</b> and he correctly observes that this approximation improves as the curvature gets smaller and is almost exact when the elevation is less than 45°. That the curve followed by a chain is not a <b>parabola</b> was proven by Joachim Jungius (1587–1657); this result was published posthumously in 1669.|$|E

25|$|Within the scatter, {{there are}} sets of {{parabolic}} patterns {{with a high}} density of points and all their foci at the origin, opening up in all four directions. Different parabolas intersect at the axes and appear to reflect off the axis with an incidence angle of 45 degrees, with a third <b>parabola</b> entering in a perpendicular fashion. Within this quadrant, each arc centered on the origin shows that section of the <b>parabola</b> that lies between its tip and its intersection with its semi-latus rectum.|$|E
25|$|The area of {{a segment}} of the <b>parabola</b> cut from it by a {{straight}} line is 4/3 the area of the triangle inscribed in this segment.|$|E
50|$|This axiom is {{equivalent}} to finding a line simultaneously tangent to two <b>parabolas,</b> and can be considered equivalent to solving a third-degree equation as there are in general three solutions. The two <b>parabolas</b> have foci at p1 and p2, respectively, with directrices defined by l1 and l2, respectively.|$|R
50|$|In geometry, two conic {{sections}} {{are called}} confocal, {{if they have}} the same foci. Because ellipses and hyperbolas possess two foci, there are confocal ellipses, confocal hyperbolas and confocal mixtures of ellipses and hyperbolas. Remarkably, in the mixture of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas, any ellipse intersects any hyperbola orthogonally. <b>Parabolas</b> possess only one focus, so, by convention, confocal <b>parabolas</b> have the same focus and the same axis of symmetry. Consequently, any point not on the axis of symmetry lies on two confocal <b>parabolas</b> which intersect orthogonally (see below).|$|R
5000|$|Two conic {{sections}} are congruent {{if their}} eccentricities {{and one other}} distinct parameter characterizing them are equal. Their eccentricities establish their shapes, equality of which is sufficient to establish similarity, and the second parameter then establishes size. Since two circles, <b>parabolas,</b> or rectangular hyperbolas always have the same eccentricity (specifically 0 {{in the case of}} circles, 1 in the case of <b>parabolas,</b> and [...] in the case of rectangular hyperbolas), two circles, <b>parabolas,</b> or rectangular hyperbolas need to have only one other common parameter value, establishing their size, for them to be congruent.|$|R
