40|$|The {{experimental}} study on performance formulation {{and analysis of}} pineapple <b>pulp</b> fortified <b>cake</b> considering physical, chemical, sensorial and microbial quality. Cake was fortified with 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % pineapple pulp incorporated into wheat flour. The pineapple pulps used in the cake preparation were analyzed for proximate composition. The {{physical and chemical properties}} of cakes were analyzed. Quantitive microbial analysis of food samples were done on the basis of total viable count. Bacterial load range from 1. 22 × 102 (cfug- 1) to 9. 54 × 103 (cfug- 1) on different storage condition. Zero present pineapple <b>pulp</b> incorporated <b>cake</b> sample showed the highest microbial load 9. 54 × 103 (cfug- 1). Total fungal count ranged from 0. 97 × 102 to 5. 04 × 103 (cfug- 1) on different storage conditions. Fortified cake with 10 % pineapple pulp contains lowest amount of fungi and bacteria after 8 days. So its shelf life will be enhanced about 6 - 7 days. Further 5 %, 15 %, and 20 % pineapple <b>pulp</b> incorporated <b>cake</b> sample contain high microbial load, hence they will get shelf life of 5 - 6 days. Fortification of cake with 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, pineapple pulp increasedthe value of ash, fiber and moisture in comparing with control cake. The statistical analysis of organoleptic test response of sensory attributes revealed that color, flavor, texture and overall acceptability were decreased with the increase of pineapple <b>pulp</b> in the <b>cake</b> formulation. Symmetry, crust and crumb quality, crust color and consistency,color,texture of the crumb and microbial load of the cakes containing 10 % pulp were better than those of cakes containing above 10 % pineapple pulp...|$|R

The general formula of feed blocks includes binders, a preservative, a mixture of ingredients that contain the desired nutrients (nitrogen, minerals, vitamins) and one of many energy rich agro-industrial by-products, such as molasses. The levels of these substances may vary, as well as the main component of the block, in different regions or countries. The main ingredient may vary from date pulp, rice bran and poultry waste in Iraq, tomato <b>pulp</b> and olive <b>cake</b> in Tunisia, brewery grains and olive cake in Jordan or molasses in Morocco. Feed blocks aid small scale farmers as conventional feed, such as barley grain or bran, are often expensive.|$|R
40|$|The residue in {{sunflower}} oil is a dispersed phase consisting of particulate products grinding sunflower {{seeds in the}} form of particles of the <b>pulp,</b> oil <b>cake,</b> meal, residual quantities of metals, pesticides. In the recycling process they are in the oil in suspension and negatively affect its quality. For research an experimental setup was developed allowing to change the angle of inclination of the filter element. The regularities of filtration were determined without preliminary purification of {{sunflower oil}} by centrifugation and after centrifugation. It is established, the contamination of centrifuged oil in the initial period is 14. 6 times lower. After 10 minutes of treatment, it decreases by 62 %, after 20 minutes – by 79. 4 %. With a 30 -minute treatment, particles of 0. 005 - 0. 1 mm in size are removed to 90 %, which is approximated to the refined oil in terms of contamination. The influence of vibration-acoustic action on sunflower oil during its filtration is shown. At the last stage of production, the peroxide index is reduced to 2 - 3 moles of active oxygen, and after 3 months of storage – from 11. 8 to 7. 7, which according to GOST corresponds to the highest-grade oil.

With a heating value about 14 MJ/kg (dried basis), {{this type of}} biomass had a potential as an alternative energy source. Unfortunately, it had an ash content of 27. 6 % and a moisture content of 80 %. For reducing moisture content with minimum energy consumption, a combination of mechanical dewatering and thermal drying was studied previously. Meanwhile, experiments on isothermal pyrolysis had been carried out for further improvement on ultimate and proximate analysis of solid fuel. Final mass of char obtained from pyrolysis at 500 o C was {{not significantly different from}} that of 700 o C, so pyrolysis was considered to be optimum at 500 o C. A char obtained from pyrolysis at temperature of 500 o C had a pore surface area of 77. 049 m 2 /g (highest among other temperatures). Kinetic of isothermal pyrolysis was well represented with a first order modified volumetric model with a frequency factor of 0. 782 1 /s and an activation of 34. 050 kJ/mol. </em...|$|R
40|$|N° ISBN - 978 - 2 - 7380 - 1284 - 5 International audienceSheep farming plays a {{vital role}} in food safety in Tunisia. This paper aims to reflect the current status of sheep farming through an {{analysis}} of their food availability and limits. A study of the possibilities for improving the local feeding resources is then made identifying the innovations in this field. Results show that the decrease in pasture areas is caused by the over-grazing, the frequent droughts and the expansion of cereal crops and tree plantations. Use of concentrates becomes more frequent in livestock industry. These concentrates are heavily based on imported ingredients whose prices have tripled over the last two decades. Consequently, a renewed interest has been given to the use of local feed resources and looking for alternatives such as their partial or total replacement of the imported raw materials. The use of the local barley and field beans in the sheep feeding could ensure acceptable animal performances. In the arid and semi-arid Tunisian zones, thousands of hectares of fodder shrubs have been established, especially spineless cactus, Atriplex nummularia and Acacia cyanophylla. Other innovations in animal feeding demonstrated the effectiveness of alternative feed resources like using feed blocks which could represent a promising nutritional tool especially when animals are grazing on poor pastures, the use of multi-purpose shrubs, or several agricultural and agro-industrial by-products (treated straws, <b>cakes,</b> <b>pulps</b> [...] .). A lack of adequate co-ordination and synergy between the different stakeholders is inhibiting the progress and implementation of transversal approaches that are necessary for the delivery of integrated sustainable policies...|$|R
40|$|The Government of Syria is {{determined}} to become less dependent on the imports of large volumes of concentrates for ruminant livestock feeding for which {{a large amount of}} scarce foreign currency is required. For this reason there is an increased interest in the incorporation of a variety of agricultural residues and animal wastes in ruminant livestock diets, without having any adverse effects on performance. Therefore, this project was designed to provide national staff with the requisite training on by-product processing and feeding aimed at applying on private farms technology that has proved safe, simple and economical. The project also provided the institutions/stations participating in the work it's full support in terms of technical assistance and of equipment to implement project activities. A major goal of the project was to develop simple, safe and low cost technology for processing and storing agricultural by-products and feeding them to ruminants. The crop residues and by-products most widely studied were cereal straws (wheat and barley), poultry excreta, grape marc, fresh sugarbeet <b>pulp</b> and olive <b>cake.</b> Some studies were also done on preservation methods and the nutritional values of corn stalks and cottonseed hulls. In {{the first year of the}} project the new technology was developed/tested on state farms before applying the promising aspects in on-farm-tests (OFT) using the facilities of private farmers. On state farm demonstrations resulted not only in the development of the new technology but also in reliable data collection under local conditions. Counterpart staff gained valuable knowledge and experience through instruction, demonstration and supervised participation in the work programme. Technology found to be simple, safe and economical was applied on private farms (46) during the second year. A work plan for year 3 was jointly prepared by the NPD and the CTA and was presented at the second TPR meeting held in March 1992. Unfortunately, only part of the proposed work plan was implemented. In the Interim report it was stated that, concerning the Development Objectives, it was too early to assess the project's achievements. But the expressed interest by companies/organisations and farmers to invest in the new technologies and the fact that all farmers who adopted the project's products/technologies were willing to continue applying them indicated that the project could meet its Development Objectives. The implementation of the work plan of the 3 rd year is certainly an obstacle to the project achieving its development objectives and, if no corrective action is taken, there is a danger of loosing what the project has so far achieved. The outputs were realised for meeting the immediate objectives of the project document. The project developed during the first two years safe, simple and low cost methods of processing and upgrading agricultural by-products. Despite the fact that the project's promising findings were applied on private farms from the second year and the continued interest of farmers and state organisations to apply the new knowledge there has been a disappointing discontinuation of project activities in year 3. Urea-treatment of straw was more widely applied compared to the other technology due to the promotion of this technique by other sources (Mashreq project, Regional Network) demonstrating the promotional benefits of project findings Despite the discontinuation of work in the third year and limited contacts between project personnel and farmers/ organizations/ agricultural companies there is still interest in investing in the technology developed by the project. Several useful technologies generated and/or introduced by the project should be further extended to farmers: Every effort should be made to implement the work plan presented in February - March 1992. The Government of the SAR should appoint a new project manager, preferably experienced in extension work, who, in close co-operation with the of the APRD, will supervise/promote the commercial introduction of UB/MUB, ammonification of straw and pre-processing (mixing of litter with pulp prior to ensiling) poultry excreta/high moisture content by-products (i. e. sugarbeet pulp). The MAAR should encourage farmers to collect/store straw surpluses in good years for subsequent use during bad years; this operation should start in areas where the straw is produced and/or in neighbouring provinces. Project findings show that the additional expenses due to treatment are more than covered by the improved animal productivity; it is recommended, therefore, to promote ammonification of straw. Ammonia-gas can be the choice of treatment for large scale operations; the establishment of mobile straw treatment units that will visit private/state farms to process and treat straw with ammonia gas should be among the priorities of a follow-up phase. Urea treatment, on the other hand, should be the choice of smal...|$|R
