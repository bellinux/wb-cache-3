40|$|Efficient {{and safe}} protein {{nanoparticles}} for the targeted delivery of small molecule, protein and oligonucleotide based drugs {{will play a}} key role in the field of science in the upcoming years. Whereas viral and liposomal formulations have been extensively tested throughout the last two decades, their inherent and in the case of viruses sometimes even fatal obstacles not seldom seem impossible to conquer. The time for the development of a new therapeutic option in form of an advanced drug delivery system within pharmaceutical technology, biopharmacy and clinical studies has come. In our eyes gelatin based nanoparticles with polysaccharide and peptide modifications are an optimum to fulfil this need and will therefore be the center of the research presented in this work. Basically, nanoparticles with a size from 150 to 300 nm were prepared by desolvating a clear solution of gelatin through dropwise addition of an organic anti-solvent under heavy stirring. A subsequent destabilization of the water soluble protein chains resulted in round particles with a homogenous size distribution and an even surface. Initially, the polymers used for the formulation of the nanoparticles were characterized by such methods like asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, established measurement and calculation algorithms were revised into state-of-the-art technology and applied as so called automatic microviscosimetry for in- depth protein analysis. The development of novel nanoparticle formulations based on these polymers was done in a second step using diethyl-amino-ethanol-dextran, polysorbate and polyethylene glycol, as well as methylation and acetylation chemistry. While the modified dextran mainly increased the zeta potential of the nanoparticles, the other modifications were intended to change the pharmacokinetic distribution patterns towards e. g. prolonged circulation times. In novel nanoparticle cytology science the use of a flow chamber device for cell cultivation allowed us to study the interaction patterns of nanoparticles with adherent cells under near to physiological conditions simulating blood vessels, junctions and shear stress. This in-vitro model can be used for online preclinical and high-throughput screenings of new nanoparticle and protein formulations with cell monolayers. The hindrances in traditional static cell culture models were shown to be overcome by comparing several nanoparticle formulations in a static and in a flow model. Proper nanoparticle formulations were tested further in innovative preclinical in-vivo models like the hamster dorsal skin fold chamber and the mouse cremaster model to elucidate their body distribution and targeting properties with a focus on kinetics, blood cell interaction and novel fluorescence detection techniques. In addition, the potential of gelatin nanoparticles as therapeutic options in a model for antigen induced arthritis was demonstrated. Finally, hybrid (sandwich) nanoparticles were formulated by combining gelatin nanoparticle <b>preformulations</b> with the endosomolytic peptide Melittin from bee venom and loading them with small interfering RNA molecules against VEGFR 2 and luciferase. The novel hybrid carriers were extensively tested in cell cultures towards their efficiency to induce a protein knock-down based on RNA interference.

40|$|Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} prevalent infectious diseases and is mainly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The first step of the infection cycle, the adhesion of UPEC to urothelial cells, is mediated by the lectin FimH, which is located at the tip of bacterial type 1 pili. Its interaction with the mannosylated glycoprotein uroplakin Ia (UPIa) on urothelial cells can be prevented by glycomimetic antagonists. Thus, alpha-D-mannopyranosides derivatives with nanomolar affinity offer a potential therapeutic approach for prevention and treatment of UTI. To achieve oral availability as well as a therapeutic concentration in the bladder over an extended period of time, a number of key issues have to be fulfilled. •	Stability of the antagonist against various gastrointestinal conditions (pH, enzymatic activity) is required. •	Sufficient solubility is a prerequisite for successful absorption. •	To reach circulation, the intestinal mucosa has to be permeated. •	In case of a prodrug approach, hepatic first pass metabolism is requested. •	To reach the therapeutic target in the bladder, renal excretion is required. These various properties can be predicted based on lipophilicity (log D 7. 4), stability in different gastrointestinal fluids, kinetic and thermodynamic solubility, metabolic stability (liver microsomes), and permeability (parallel artificial membrane permeability assay and Caco- 2 cells assay), methods implemented in the PADMET platform (physicochemical properties, absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity) of our research group. The aim of this thesis is to develop in vitro assays to provide information regarding the factors influencing the pharmacokinetic properties of glycomimetics and to predict their oral bioavailability. For this purpose, we developed our PADMET platform. The focus was on glycomimetic FimH antagonists and the evaluation of their structural, physicochemical, and biochemical properties. Besides in vitro assays to determine their solubility and potential passive permeability, assays predictive for pKa, stability in gastrointestinal fluids, and carrier-mediated permeability were implemented into our PADMET platform. As a result, low passive membrane permeability constraint oral absorption of mannosidic FimH antagonists with para-carboxy-biphenyl aglycone. With ester prodrugs permeability could be improved and the hydrolysis by carboxylesterase released the active principle within minutes. Unfortunately, the ester prodrugs suffer from low solubility. For early in vivo trials, the solubility issue was addressed with phosphate prodrugs or with appropriate <b>preformulations</b> using co-solvents, surfactants, and complexing agents. In addition, phosphate and ester prodrugs were stable in gastrointestinal fluids, whereas a prodrug with acylation in the C- 6 position of the mannose moiety showed instability in intestinal fluids due to the enzyme pancreatin. Furthermore, interactions of FimH antagonists with carrier-mediated transporters were observed and require further investigations. In a collaborative project with the research group of Prof. Horst Kessler (Technical University of Munich, Institute for Advanced Study) the in vitro permeability of cyclic hexapeptides was evaluated with log D 7. 4, PAMPA, and Caco- 2 cells. The cyclic hexapeptides were synthesized in the research group of Prof. Dr. Horst Kessler and permeability experiments were performed in our laboratory. As a result, di-N-pentyl alkylation of cyclic hexapeptides improved passive permeability. In addition, differential Caco- 2 permeability was measured for enantiomers suggesting the involvement of carrier-mediated transporters. ...|$|R

The conformational changes of a humanized monoclonal antibody have been characterized by intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence measurements m aqueous solutions of pH 3 to 8 in the temperature range of 5 °C to 70 °C. 1 - anilinonapthalene 8 -sulfonate (ANS) was employed as a polarity-sensitive extrinsic probe. ANS is a compound that fluoresces strongly in hydrophobic non- aqueous environments, but is almost non-fluorescent in water. Because of these characteristics, it {{has proved to be a}} very useful probe of accessible protein interior. Changes in the fluorescence spectrum of the protein are observed with increasing temperature. The intensity of the trytophan peak decreased linearly with temperature. Additionally, the tryptophan emission peak displayed a red shift from 335 nm to about 345 nm over the temperature range studied. The onsets of temperature of transition for the protein were estimated at each pH. The protein at pH 6, 7 and 8 was characterized by an onset of transition of about 60 °C, which was higher than at pH 3 to 5. Since higher onset of transition temperature reflects greater thermal stability, the <b>preformulation</b> studies suggest the protein is likely to be most thermally stable in an aqueous solution formulated at pH 6, 7, and 8...|$|E
40|$|Nifedipine is a {{dihydropyridine}} {{calcium channel}} antagonist {{effective in the}} clinical management of cardiovascular disease. Due to nifedipine's poor water solubility and erratic bioavailability, complexation with selected cyclodextrins was studied in order to overcome these limitations. The aim {{was to develop a}} quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) to identify cyclodextrin molecular properties important in complex formation and provide a predictive tool which would be valuable during <b>preformulation</b> studies. The QSPR developed indicates that the major driving forces for nifedipine complexation, in addition to cyclodextrin concentration, are hydrophobicity and Van der Waals interactions (3 D solubility parameters, hydrophilic surface area and differential connectivity index) ...|$|E

40|$|Candidate active {{pharmaceutical}} ingredients (APIs) {{are routinely}} tested to determine such parameters as physical stability, chemical stability, and bioavailability. <b>Preformulation</b> analysis of APIs does not currently attemept {{to determine whether}} they will perform to an acceptable level once they have been formulated. In practice, the APIs are subjected to extensive in vitro testing of their performance in a formulation, combined with optimisation of the formulation. This formulation testing is both time-consuming and expensive. In the field of pulmonary drug delivery from dry powder inhalers (DPIs), the API has to be aerosolized effectively in order to penetrate the lunfs and reach its deposition target. In a conventional ternary DPI fromulation, the API is combined with carrier lactose and fine lactose particles. The inter-particle forces between these three components and the bulk properties of the formulation determine the structure of the formulation and the aerolization performance of the API. In this study, physicochemical properties of salbutamol base and several of its salts were investigated both quantitatively and qualitatively. The in vitro deposition characteristics of the formulated APIs were also determined. The relationship between these parameters and the deposition was analysed to establish if a rapid <b>preformulation</b> screening technique could be applied to the APIs with respect to predicting the deposition performance of the formulated API. A clear relationship between the deposition of the unformulated API and the formulated API was observed that could be exploited as a screening technique.

Phytopharmaceuticals having a base of such origin offer high advantages as they come with safety profiles, and often allow extrapolation of the HOSU data, under certain circumstances. However, while current pharmaceutical technologies are being adopted by the industry to make phytopharmaceuticals with such origin, there is a need for <b>preformulation</b> research and development (R and D) during formulation. Some suggestions for R and D studies in case of aqueous extracts known in Ayurveda, converted on an industrial scale to obtain a phytopharmaceutical, and formulated as a solid dosage form (granules, tablets, or capsules) are discussed...|$|E
