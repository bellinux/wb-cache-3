40|$|In {{order to}} study the <b>propagation</b> <b>mechanism</b> of {{business}} cycles, in particular to investigate how the intensity of competition affects market structure and output persistence over business cycles, this paper presents a real business-cycle model with imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale. This analysis considers the markups of price over cost to be endogenous. With endogenous markups, two standard forms of oligopolistic competition - Bertrand and Cournot - are considered. Results show that: (1) the <b>propagation</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{in the sense of}} output persistence is greater under Cournot; (2) the <b>propagation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is unequivocally greater with imperfect competition, regardless of whether markups are endogenous or not; and (3) under imperfect competition, the <b>propagation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is greater with endogenous markups than with exogenous markups. Overall, these results suggest that more intense competition produces lower persistence in output growth and, thus, a weaker <b>propagation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In a calibration exercise, these differences were also found to be quantitatively important. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Three groups of measurements are employed to verify the model in different tunnels at different frequencies.

The measurement system merges a high-resolution spatio-temporal wireless channel sounder with a new field reconstruction technique to provide complete knowledge of the wireless channel's impulse response throughout a 2 -dimensional region. This wealth of data may be combined with space-time filtering techniques to isolate and characterize individual <b>propagation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The utility of the spatio-temporal measurement system is demonstrated through a measurement-based investigation of diffraction around building corners. These measurements are combined with space-time filtering techniques and a new linear wedge diffraction model to extract the first semi-mpirical diffraction coefficient. Specific contributions of this thesis are: * The first ultra-wideband single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel sounder based upon the sliding correlator architecture. * A quasi 2 -dimensional field reconstruction technique based upon a conjoint cylindrical wave expansion of coherent perimeter measurements. * A wireless channel ``filming' technique that records the time-domain evolution of the wireless channel throughout a 2 -dimensional region. * High-resolution measurements of the space-time wireless channel near a right-angled brick building corner. * The application of space-time filtering techniques to isolate the edge diffraction problem from the overall wireless channel. * An approximate uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD) -style linear model describing diffraction by an impedance wedge. * The first-ever semi-empirical diffraction coefficient extracted from in situ measurement data. This thesis paves the way for several new avenues of research. The comprehensive measurement data provided by channel "filming" will enable researchers {{to develop and implement}} powerful space-time filtering techniques that facilitate measurement-based investigations of radio wave propagation.
