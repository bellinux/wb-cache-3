We have identified and characterized two distinct monopartite begomoviruses and associated beta satellite DNA causing <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease of radish (Raphanus sativus) in India. Results We demonstrate that RaLCD {{is caused by a}} complex of two Old World begomoviruses and their associated betasatellites. Radish <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus-Varanasi is identified as a new recombinant species, Radish <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus (RaLCV) sharing maximum nucleotide identity of 87. 7 % with Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Bangladesh virus-[Bangladesh: 2] (Accession number AF 188481) while the virus causing radish <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease-Pataudi is an isolate of Croton yellow vein mosaic virus-[India] (CYVMV-IN) (Accession number AJ 507777) sharing 95. 8 % nucleotide identity. Further, RDP analysis revealed that the RaLCV has a hybrid genome, a putative recombinant between Euphorbia <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus and Papaya <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus. Cloned DNA of either RaLCV or CYVMV induced mild <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> symptoms in radish plants. However, when these clones (RaLCV or CYVMV) were individually co-inoculated with their associated cloned DNA betasatellite, symptom severity and viral DNA levels were increased in radish plants and induced typical RaLCD symptoms. To further extend these studies, we carried out an investigation of the interaction of these radish-infecting begomoviruses and their associated satellite, with two tomato infecting begomoviruses (Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gujarat virus and Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> New Delhi virus). Both of the tomato-infecting begomoviruses showed a contrasting and differential interaction with DNA satellites, not only in the capacity to interact with these molecules but also in the modulation of symptom phenotypes by the satellites.

40|$|Begomoviruses are plant-infecting viruses, {{which are}} {{transmitted}} by the whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci. They have a genome of single-stranded DNA {{that consists of}} either a single (monopartite) or two components (bipartite) with a component size of approximately 2. 8 kb. Many monopartite begomoviruses in the Old World {{have been found to}} be associated with betasatellite and alphasatellite molecules, which are about half the size of their helper begomovirus genome. Betasatellites have been shown to be necessary for inducing severe disease symptoms. In Cameroon, B. tabaci has been associated with suspected begomovirus infections in many crop and weed species. Despite their growing importance, only begomoviruses infecting cassava have been studied in Cameroon in any detail. Thus, there was a need for additional information on diversity and distribution of begomoviruses and satellites in vegetable crops and dictyledonous weeds, which likely serve as virus reservoirs. In field studies carried out in this study, a high incidence of okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease was found in Cameroon. Sequencing of viral genomes showed that the okra plants were infected by viruses of two previously known begomovirus species (Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gezira virus and Okra yellow crinkle virus) as well as a new recombinant begomovirus species (Okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon virus). In addition, a betasatellite (Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gezira betasatellite) and two alphasatellites (Okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Mali alphasatellite and Okra yellow crinkle Cameroon alphasatellite) were identified. Tomato plants with <b>leaf</b> <b>curling</b> were shown to contain isolates of a new begomovirus, Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon virus, and an alphasatellite, Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon alphasatellite (ToLCCMA). To study the potential begomovirus complexes infecting weeds, begomoviruses and satellites in plants of the weed Ageratum conyzoides with <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> symptoms were characterized. Sequence analyses showed that they were infected by isolates of a new begomovirus (Ageratum <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon virus), two new betasatellites (Ageratum <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon betasatellite and Ageratum <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Buea betasatellite), an alphasatellite (ToLCCMA) and two types of defective recombinants between a begomovirus and ToLCCMA. Putative recombinations were detected in begomovirus genomes for all three plant species studied, indicating that recombination is an important mechanism for their evolution. A close relationship between the begomoviruses infecting tomato and A. conyzoides, and the detection of the same alphasatellite in them support the idea that weeds are important reservoirs for begomoviruses and their satellites. This study has revealed a huge complexity of begomoviruses and DNA satellites previously largely unknown in West Africa and Central Africa.

40|$|P. M. H. and M. P. contributed {{equally to}} the work. ABSTRACT Taphrina deformans is a fungus {{responsible}} for <b>peach</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl,</b> an important plant disease. It is phylogenetically as-signed to the Taphrinomycotina subphylum, {{which includes the}} fission yeast and the mammalian pathogens of the genus Pneu-mocystis. We describe here the genome of T. deformans {{in the light of}} its dual plant-saprophytic/plant-parasitic lifestyle. The 13. 3 -Mb genome contains few identifiable repeated elements (ca. 1. 5 %) and a relatively high GC content (49. 5 %). A total of 5, 735 protein-coding genes were identified, among which 83 % share similarities with other fungi. Adaptation to the plant host seems reflected in the genome, since the genome carries genes involved in plant cell wall degradation (e. g., cellulases and cutinases), secondary metabolism, the hallmark glyoxylate cycle, detoxification, and sterol biosynthesis, as well as genes involved in the bio-synthesis of plant hormones. Genes involved in lipid metabolismmay play a role in its virulence. Several locus candidates for putativeMAT cassettes and sex-related genes akin to those of Schizosaccharomyces pombewere identified. A mating-type-switching mechanism similar to that found in ascomycetous yeasts could be in effect. Taken together, the findings are consistent with the alternate saprophytic and parasitic-pathogenic lifestyles of T. deformans. IMPORTANCE <b>Peach</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> is an important plant disease which causes significant losses of fruit production.

The first objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the accuracy of a weather-driven model for predicting infection by Taphrina deformans in different peach-growing areas. In 12 peach-growing areas in the Prefecture of Imathia, Greece, and over two years, the timing of initial infections differed depending on differences in the microclimate (mainly in temperatures and leaf wetness). There was a difference up to 9 days in the date of disease onset predicted by differences in the microclimate between regions. The model accurately predicted the observed differences in date of first symptom appearance. There was also a good correlation between predicted risk and observed disease severity. In addition, differences were observed among areas in the level of risk and the intensity of symptoms with a trend that areas at higher risk having a higher intensity of symptoms. The second objective {{of this study was to}} investigate advantages arising from using the model for scheduling fungicide applications against <b>peach</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl.</b> In five years of trials, the use of the model reduced the number of sprays compared to conventional spray program while achieving similar level of control.

The germinated spores develop a hypha which penetrates into the leaf. Peach shoots become receptive when the buds open and remain so during the active growth stage. Low air temperatures and heavy rain favour the spread of infection. Given these weather conditions, the infection may spread to the young fruit, but these infections tend to be of minor importance. When the ascospores are released, they enter a saprophytic stage and produce new blastospores ensuring {{the survival of the}} fungus in summer. At this stage, appropriate fungicide treatment diminishes the risk of repeated infections...|$|E
40|$|Taphrina deformans is {{a fungus}} {{responsible}} for <b>peach</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl,</b> an important plant disease. It is phylogenetically {{assigned to the}} Taphrinomycotina subphylum, which includes the fission yeast and the mammalian pathogens of the genus Pneumocystis. We describe here the genome of T. deformans {{in the light of}} its dual plant-saprophytic/plant-parasitic lifestyle. The 13. 3 -Mb genome contains few identifiable repeated elements (ca. 1. 5 %) and a relatively high GC content (49. 5 %). A total of 5, 735 protein-coding genes were identified, among which 83 % share similarities with other fungi. Adaptation to the plant host seems reflected in the genome, since the genome carries genes involved in plant cell wall degradation (e. g., cellulases and cutinases), secondary metabolism, the hallmark glyoxylate cycle, detoxification, and sterol biosynthesis, as well as genes involved in the biosynthesis of plant hormones. Genes involved in lipid metabolism {{may play a role in}} its virulence. Several locus candidates for putative MAT cassettes and sex-related genes akin to those of Schizosaccharomyces pombe were identified. A mating-type-switching mechanism similar to that found in ascomycetous yeasts could be in effect. Taken together, the findings are consistent with the alternate saprophytic and parasitic-pathogenic lifestyles of T. deformans. IMPORTANCE: <b>Peach</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> is an important plant disease which causes significant losses of fruit production. We report here the genome sequence of the causative agent of the disease, the fungus Taphrina deformans. The genome carries characteristic genes that are important for the plant infection process. These include (i) proteases that allow degradation of the plant tissues; (ii) secondary metabolites which are products favoring interaction of the fungus with the environment, including the host; (iii) hormones that are responsible for the symptom of severely distorted leaves on the host; and (iv) drug detoxification enzymes that confer resistance to fungicides. The availability of the genome allows the design of new drug targets as well as the elaboration of specific management strategies to fight the disease...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{demand for}} new {{fungicides}} to control plant diseases {{has led to}} experimentation with both previously used and newly developed fungicides. Silver, an older but little used fungicide, was selected for evaluation because of its high toxicity to microorganisms. Silver nitrate and a silver electrolytic cell were tested as potential sources of silver ions. The cell discharged 0. 17 ppm silver ions into 750 ml of distilled water during a ten-minute period. A bioassay was used to detect silver ion concentrations. Approximately 1. 5 ppm silver ion per 100 ml of cell effluent was lost from the electrode under constant flow conditions. The cost of producing 1000 gallons containing 1 ppm of silver with the silver electrolytic cell was 1. 11 vs. 0. 20 for silver nitrate. The effluent from the electrolytic cell remained fungitoxic {{for at least five}} days after preparation, after which time toxicity gradually diminished. Ionic silver was not phytotoxic to sword-fern fronds or potato tubers at concentrations much greater than the level required to control dry rots of fern and potato. The concentration of silver nitrate necessary to effectively control the spread of dry rot of fern stored at 34 ° F was 1. 0 ppm. This disease is caused by a complex of a Fusarium sp. and a Pseudomonas sp. and is particularly severe at elevated temperatures. The most effective method of applying silver to fronds was by dip treatment of frond bundles. Undiluted silver effluent (0. 17 ppm) effectively controlled dry rot of potatoes caused by the fungus, Fusarium roseum. However, ionic silver discharged from the silver electrolytic cell was not effective as a pre-harvest treatment for the control of apple scab and <b>peach</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> diseases...|$|E

About 1, 900 tomato and common bean samples were analyzed from which 111 isolates were characterized genetically based on a genome sequence that comprises coding and non-coding regions. Isolates of three distinct begomoviruses previously described were found (Tomato yellow <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus, TYLCV, Tomato yellow <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Sardinia virus, TYLCSV, and Tomato yellow <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Málaga virus, TYLCMalV), together with a novel recombinant virus. Mixed infections were detected in single plants, rationalizing the occurrence of recombinants. Except for TYLCV-type strain, single, undifferentiated subpopulations were present for each virus type, probably the result of founder effects. Limited genetic variation was observed in genomic regions, with selection against amino acid change in coding regions...|$|R
