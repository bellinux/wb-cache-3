5000|$|In telecommunications, {{a system}} that {{supports}} simultaneous voice and data (SVD) is one that can [...] transceive both voice and primary data concurrently over one <b>PSTN</b> <b>modem.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: 12 early ISA 8 bit and 16 bit PC network cards. The lower {{right-most}} card is {{an early}} wireless network card, and the central card with partial beige plastic cover is a <b>PSTN</b> <b>modem.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "modem" [...] {{stands for}} [...] "modulator-demodulator". A {{satellite}} modem's main {{function is to}} transform an input bitstream to a radio signal and vice versa. There are some devices that include only a demodulator (and no modulator, thus only allowing data to be downloaded by satellite) that are {{also referred to as}} [...] "satellite modems." [...] These devices are used in satellite Internet access (in this case uploaded data is transferred through a conventional <b>PSTN</b> <b>modem</b> or an ADSL modem).|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the term}} has {{historically}} been used to indicate the traditional [...] "analog" [...] <b>PSTN</b> software <b>modems,</b> there are some software-based DSL modems or even routers, which work on the same principles as their PSTN ancestors, only on a larger bandwidth and on a more complex signal. One of the first software based DSL modem chipsets was Motorola's SoftDSL chipset, for which similar considerations as [...] "ordinary" [...] <b>PSTN</b> <b>modems</b> can be made. The term WinDSL has shown up on technology sites like Slashdot regarding this trend. [...] DSL softmodems generally require the same interfaces as PSTN softmodems, such as USB or PCI.|$|R
50|$|As <b>PSTN</b> {{hardware}} <b>modem</b> technology advanced, the modulation and encoding schemes {{became increasingly}} more complex, thus forcing the hardware {{used by the}} modems themselves to increase in complexity.|$|R
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and recording, a scrambler (also {{referred to as}} a randomizer) is a device that manipulates a data stream before transmitting. The manipulations are reversed by a descrambler at the receiving side. Scrambling is widely used in satellite, radio relay communications and <b>PSTN</b> <b>modems.</b> A scrambler can be placed just before a FEC coder, or it can be placed after the FEC, just before the modulation or line code. A scrambler in this context {{has nothing to do with}} encrypting, as the intent is not to render the message unintelligible, but to give the transmitted data useful engineering properties.|$|R
50|$|Having {{most of the}} {{modulation}} functions {{delegated to}} software does serve to provide the advantage of easier upgradeability to newer modem standards. However, this is hardly an advantage as of 2005, with the latest V.92 56K protocol practically bearing the maximum achievable performance for a normal <b>PSTN</b> <b>modem</b> and telephone line and no significant future improvements/advancements seeming possible. Nevertheless, this is not yet {{the case with the}} more recent software-based DSL modems, whose easy upgradeability can still be an advantage. More commonly, however, softmodem drivers are enhanced in regard to their performance and to eliminate possible software bugs.|$|E
50|$|There was {{a choice}} of {{different}} speeds of PSS lines; the faster the line the more expensive it cost to rent it. The highest and lowest speed lines were provided by the Megastream and Kilostream services, 2M (Mega) bit/s and 256K (kilo) bit/s respectively. On analog links 2400 bit/s, 4800 bit/s, 9600 bit/s and 48 kbit/s were offered. Individual users could link into PSS, on a pay as you go basis, by using a 110, 300, 1200/75, 1,200 or 2,400 bit/s <b>PSTN</b> <b>modem</b> to connect a Data Terminal Equipment terminal into a local PSS exchange. Note: in those days 2,400 bit/s modems were quite rare; 1,200 bit/s was the usual speed in the 1980s, although 110 and 300 bit/s modems were not uncommon.|$|E
50|$|In data communication, a {{physical}} network node may either be data communication equipment (DCE) {{such as a}} modem, hub, bridge or switch; or data terminal equipment (DTE) such as a digital telephone handset, a printer or a host computer. If the network in question is a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), every LAN or WAN node (that are at least data link layer devices) must have a network address, typically one for each network interface controller it possesses. Examples are computers, packet switches, xDSL modems (with Ethernet interface) and wireless LAN access points. Note that a hub constitutes {{a physical}} network node, but does not constitute a LAN network node, since a hubbed network logically is a bus network. Analogously, a repeater or <b>PSTN</b> <b>modem</b> (with serial interface) is a physical network node but not a LAN node in this sense.|$|E

40|$|A {{system based}} on the {{integration}} of innovative surveying and monitoring approaches has been developed and tested over an area characterized by particular geomorphological processes. Several methods have been experimented and specific procedures have been applied, checked and implemented, including real-time monitoring of movements by Global Positioning System (GPS) permanent stations, detection of surface deformations by surveying monumented points, generation and comparison of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The study area, located in the Reno River Valley (40 km South of Bologna, Italy), extends for about 2, 500, 000 square metres, 70, 000 of which represented by landslide deposits. Landslides can be mainly classified as multiple rotational and rotational-translational slides with subsequent earth-flow like movements, affecting an average slope of 13 ° facing to NNE. A local geodetic reference network to register all the data has been established, setting up stations in stable zones outside landslide areas. A procedure for the real-time monitoring of landslide surface movements has been exploited, tested and implemented. GPS permanent stations (the reference station sited outside the landslide zones {{and the other one}} in the headscarp) have been planned, monumented and continuously observed using standardized procedures. Collected data are automatically downloaded from remote receivers to a server in our LAN using GSM and <b>PSTN</b> <b>modems.</b> In order to define the velocity of the monitored point, observations have been routinely analyzed; the achievable accuracy results of a few millimetres in planimetry and centimetric in altimetry. Moreover, a method to identify displacements of significant points distributed over landslide areas has been verified. GPS rapid static surveys have been periodically performed over several vertices, placed on natural boulders partially embedded in the slope or monumented by special iron-pegs inserted in the terrain, obtaining accurate coordinate time-series. The accuracy is sub-centimetric in planimetry and of a few centimetres for altimetric values. Finally, multitemporal DEMs of the study area have been obtained by means of digital photogrammetric applications, terrestrial laser scanning and GPS kinematic surveys. Taking into account relevant factors linked to different DEMs precision, a series of procedures for detecting dynamic surface deformations, morphological evolution and mass volumes variations have been applied and teste...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Providing remote health {{monitoring}} to specific groups of patients represents {{an issue of}} great relevance for the national health systems, because of the costs related to moving health operators, the time spent to reach remote sites, and {{the high number of}} people needing health assistance. At the same time, some assistance activities, like those related to chronical diseases, may be satisfied through a remote interaction with the patient, without a direct medical examination. Methods Moving from this considerations, our paper proposes a system architecture for the provisioning of remote health assistance to older adults, based on a blind management of a network of wireless medical devices, and an interactive TV Set Top Box for accessing health related data. The selection of TV as the interface between the user and the system is specifically targeted to older adults. Due to the private nature of the information exchanged, a certified procedure is implemented for data delivery, through the use of non conditional smart cards. All these functions may be accomplished through a proper design of the system management, and a suitable interactive application. Results The interactive application acting as the interface between the user and the system on the TV monitor has been evaluated able to help readability and clear understanding of the contents and functions proposed. Thanks to the limited amount of data to transfer, even a Set Top Box equipped with a traditional <b>PSTN</b> <b>modem</b> may be used to support the proposed service at a basic level; more advanced features, like audio/video connection, may be activated if the Set Top Box enables a broadband connection (e. g. ADSL). Conclusions The proposed layered architecture for a remote {{health monitoring}} system can be tailored to address a wide range of needs, according with each patient’s conditions and capabilities. The system exploits the potentialities offered by Digital Television receivers, a friendly MHP interface, and the familiar remote control, to make the service effective and easy to use also for elderly people. </p...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} few decades, analog {{voiceband}} modems have been used extensively to carry digital information over the Public Switched Telephone Network (<b>PSTN).</b> Conventional voiceband <b>modems</b> treat the <b>PSTN</b> as an analog communication channel. However, today’s PSTN is mostly a digital network except for the basic telephone services provided via analog subscriber lines. The conventional model of analog voiceband channels is no longer adequate to characterize the physical connection between terminals with direct digital access to the network and voiceband modems connected to analog subscriber lines. Such a connection requires a different model in each direction. There are now international modem standards which support rates of up to 56 kbits/s for the down-stream channel. This dissertation examines the more challenging part of the voiceband communication channel, i. e., the up-stream direction connecting an analog subscriber to the digital network. The major source of distortion on the up-stream channel is quantization error caused by analog-to-digital conversion performed {{as part of the}} encoding to Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM) process.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{liberalization}} and deregulation of electricity generation and distribution, {{as well as}} introduction of regional electricity markets {{all around the world}} impose new requirements to the automatic metering systems for electricity. Following new developments in the mentioned area, as well as planned introducing of South-East European electricity market, the two Macedonian companies dealing with the electricity Electric Power Company of Macedonia (ESM) and Macedonian Electric Power System Operator (MEPSO) introduce new fully automatic measuring systems for electricity. The systems will acquire data from all meters installed in generation, transmission and distribution facilities within both companies and from the meters in the industry. Also around 6000 meters will be changed with new digital meters and half of them have possibility for remote reading. The two systems have identical three level architecture communication devices, hardware and software. The differences between systems are only the size and the capacity of hardware and software licenses, which is on the ESM side. The hardware of metering systems comprises three servers, for data acquisition and processing, for database management and for visualization of the meter data. On the communication side there are three types of <b>modems</b> (<b>PSTN,</b> GSM and ISDN) which communicate with the meters. The software level meets the requirements of the liberalized energy market...|$|R
40|$|An {{international}} {{standard for the}} exchange of continuous-tone color and gray-scale images has been approved {{under the auspices of}} the International Telecommunications Union – Telecommunications Sector (ITU-T, formerly known as CCITT). After reviewing the highlights of the new capabilities, we report on our experience in implementing this standard and testing the protocol. We believe the quality of images transmitted with color facsimile is sufficient for many communication tasks of people working in the various color areas. 1 Overview of the color-facsimile standard Research and development of color facsimile can be dated prior to World War II [5]. This effort has resulted in expensive and proprietary systems for special applications, such as the transmission of color photographs by news delivery services. Three breakthroughs have occurred that will soon make color facsimile as ubiquitous as plain paper facsimile is now. The first break-through has occurred in electronic imaging. New lossy data compression algorithms that discard image data that cannot be perceived allow considerable reduction of the image data size in bytes. This size reduction makes it viable to transmit images over the public-switched telephone network (<b>PSTN)</b> using ordinary <b>modems.</b> The second breakthrough is in the cost of hardware. High performance processors, color scanners, and color printers have become so economical that they can be assembled into a color facsimile machine with a very accessible purchase price. Last but not least, an {{international standard}} has been sanctioned [3, 4]. This means that users can universally exchange color images with remote users without bothering about the manufacturer or type of the facsimile stations...|$|R
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1994, the {{performance}} of an experimental mobile satellite communication system was demonstrated to industry and government representatives by the NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The system {{was based on the}} advanced communications technology satellite (ACTS) and consisted of a K-/Ka-band active monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) phased array antenna system, ACTS mobile terminal (AMT) and link evaluation terminal (LET). A LeRC research aircraft, Learjet model 25, was outfitted with the active MMIC phased array antenna system and AMT and served as the experimental 20 / 30 Ghz aeronautical terminal. The LET at LeRC in Cleveland, OH, was interfaced with portions of fixed-AMT equipment and together provided the gateway station functions including ACTS interface and public service telephone network (PSTN) interface. The ACTS was operated in its microwave switch matrix (MSM) mode with a spot beam for the Learjet and another spot beam dedicated to the LET. The Learjet was flown over several major cities across the US and demonstrated the feasibility of a full-duplex compressed voice links for an aeronautical terminal through the 20 / 30 Ghz ACTS channel. This paper presents a technical description of the system including the MMIC phased array antenna system, AMT, Learjet, LET, and ACTS. The array antenna system consists of a 30 Ghz transmit array (LeRc/Texas Instruments) and two 20 Ghz receive arrays (USAF Rome Lab., Boeing, and Martin Marietta), each one very small with sufficient performance for a satellite voice link. The AMT consists of 2. 4 / 4. 8 / 9. 6 Kbps voice coder/decoder, <b>modem,</b> <b>PSTN</b> interface and RF/IF converters.

A bandpass filter prior to the PCM encoder restricts the bandwidth while the sampling rate of the PCM encoder is predetermined by the network. Signalling in the presence of such constraints lead to theoretical problems as well as practical concerns in modem design. Communication models that characterize PCM voiceband channels are developed. We investigate modulation design and related issues including index mapping, constellation design and constellation probability assignment to match the pre-determined structure of the detector at the receiver, i. e., the PCM encoder at the central office. We develop a framework for transmitter structures that can avoid or reduce Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) at the receiver in order to sidestep the limited bandwidth of the up-stream channels and the fixed sampling rate of the up-stream channel. Techniques employed include linear filtering, spectral shaping and precoding to reduce the ISI, while limiting the average transmitted signal power. A filterbank structure for pre-equalizing channels with spectral nulls is also described. A new method for pulse shaping design is proposed. The new pulse shaping filters provide a compatible design {{that can be used for}} the up-stream PCM channel as well as to the cascade of the up-stream and the down-stream channels. Compared to conventional modem design, the proposed modulation and pre-equalization techniques together allow for an increase of the data transmission rates in the up-stream direction of up to 50 %...|$|R
