5|$|Although {{assault by}} the heavily armed sloop HMS Dart proved successful, the fireships {{achieved}} little {{and various other}} British craft involved in the operation {{had little effect on}} the eventual outcome. The French response was disorganised and ineffectual, losing one frigate captured.

Although all three frigates were refloated and returned to service, the operation had cost the French heavy casualties. The British force suffered minimal losses, although the exact totals are uncertain. Many of the British officers involved were highly praised and rewarded with <b>promotions</b> <b>and</b> prize money.|$|E

5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German language: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its {{variants}} {{were the}} highest awards in the military of the Third Reich. Recipients are grouped by grades of the Knight's Cross. During or shortly after World War II, 318 German sailors and servicemen of the Kriegsmarine received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Of these, 316 presentations were formally made. Two recipients received the award after 11 May 1945, when Großadmiral Karl Dönitz ordered a cease of <b>promotions</b> <b>and</b> illegalized subsequent awards. The final two recipients are therefore considered to have received the medal without legal authority.|$|E

40|$|In {{most of the}} world's {{professional}} sport leagues, {{the worst}} teams in better leagues are demoted while the best teams in weaker leagues are promoted. This article examines the economics of <b>promotion</b> <b>and</b> relegation, using data from English football (soccer). The crucial findings are as follows: players earn higher wages under <b>promotion</b> <b>and</b> relegation, <b>promotion</b> <b>and</b> relegation has a net positive effect on attendance, {{and the effect of}} <b>promotion</b> <b>and</b> relegation on competitive balance is ambiguous. The unbalancing effect arises because the system places some teams in leagues in which they have no realistic chance to afford a winning team, thereby causing teams to spend less on players during their (brief) stay in a higher league than they spent while trying to be promoted from as lesser league. The article concludes with an analysis of how <b>promotion</b> <b>and</b> relegation might be implemented in North America. Sports...|$|R

5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security.

5|$|Billy Bonds is {{the only}} manager to have managed both clubs.

He guided them to two <b>promotions</b> <b>and</b> one relegation. He resigned in August 1994. He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis— an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance. Bonds, from south London, had several family members who were Millwall fans; a fact which meant some supporters felt he should be given a chance. After a good start, the team narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 18th in the Second Division. Bonds was sacked in May 1998, having been in charge of the side for only 53 games.|$|E

Using estimates of these decision-making processes, we examine two important public policy questions: Do Navy <b>promotion</b> <b>and</b> retention rates differ across race and sex?
