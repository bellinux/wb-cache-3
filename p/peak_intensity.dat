The three initiator species were formed by reacting n-butyllithium and sec-butyllithium with D 3 in nonpolar solvent. The mass spectral results showed that sec-butyllithium and n-butyllithium form different populations of initiator species under the same conditions and that the measured mass spectral <b>peak</b> <b>intensities</b> do not accurately represent the population of siloxanolate initiator species prior to propagation.

The <b>peak</b> <b>intensities</b> exhibit a Gaussian distribution as shown in Fig. 11B. The fluorescent signals without SSAW focusing are shown in Fig. 11C as a negative control for comparison. Because the non-focused particles have different trajectories in the microchannel, {{a large number of}} them miss the excitation light spot or moved in different planes along the vertical direction, resulting in a much lower number of peaks detected with a larger non-uniformity in <b>peak</b> <b>intensities.</b> The SSAW-based 3D focusing enabled microfluidic cytometer does not require any sheath flows or complex structures, and it allows for simple operation over a wide range of sample flow rates.

5|$|Cyclone Geralda (also {{known as}} Intense Tropical Cyclone Geralda) was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that caused catastrophic damage in Madagascar in late January 1994, among the strongest to hit the country. It originated from an {{area of low pressure}} over the Indian Ocean on January25. Over the following few days, the depression underwent gradual intensification, reaching its <b>peak</b> <b>intensity</b> with ten-minute sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph) on January 31. Cyclone Geralda made landfall near Toamasina, Madagascar after weakening from its <b>peak</b> <b>intensity.</b> Within hours of moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened, and by February5, Geralda had degenerated into a land depression, and it became extratropical three days later.|$|E

Using the Dvorak technique, the <b>peak</b> <b>intensity</b> of the cyclone was estimated at T-number of 7.5 according to the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), yet the Advanced Dvorak Technique of the CIMSS automatically estimated at T8.0, the highest ranking on the Dvorak Scale.

40|$|Motivation: Protein {{abundance}} in quantitative proteomics is {{often based on}} observed spectral features derived from LC-MS experiments. <b>Peak</b> <b>intensities</b> are largely non-Normal in distribution. Furthermore, LC-MS data frequently have large proportions of missing <b>peak</b> <b>intensities</b> due to censoring mechanisms on lowabundance spectral features. Recognizing that the observed <b>peak</b> <b>intensities</b> detected with the LC-MS method are all positive, skewed and often left-censored, we propose using survival methodology to carry out differential expression analysis of proteins. Various standard statistical techniques including non-parametric tests such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum tests, and the parametric survival model, accelerated failure time model with the Weibull distribution were used to detect any differentially expressed proteins. The statistical operating characteristics of each method are explored using both real and simulated data set. Results: Survival methods have greater statistical power than standard differential expression methods. In particular, the accelerated failure time model with left-censoring provides a more powerful method to the standard testing techniques for detecting differentially expressed proteins.

At the time of <b>peak</b> <b>intensity,</b> a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm recorded flight-level winds up to 168mph (270km/h) while dropsondes measured surface winds up to 175mph (280km/h). One of the readings from a dropsonde, that was disregarded, recorded winds of 191mph (307km/h) in the lower-levels of the eyewall. This reading was disregarded by the hurricane hunters as it seemed too high and not representative of the actual intensity of Georges. The Hurricane Hunters also noted a large increase in the radius of tropical storm-force winds, prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Lesser Antilles.

40|$|A {{functional}} form I_max(R) =kR^-α, where R is the {{radial distance}} of spacecraft, was usually used {{to model the}} radial dependence of <b>peak</b> <b>intensities</b> I_max(R) of solar energetic particles (SEPs). In this work, the five-dimensional Fokker-Planck transport equation incorporating perpendicular diffusion is numerically solved to investigate the radial dependence of SEP <b>peak</b> <b>intensities.</b> We consider two different scenarios for the distribution of spacecraft fleet: (1) along the radial direction line, (2) along the Parker magnetic field line. We find that the index α in the above expression varies in a wide range, primarily depending on the properties (e. g., location, coverage) of SEP sources and on the longitudinal/latitudinal separations between the sources and the magnetic footpoints of the observers. Particularly, the situation that whether the magnetic footpoint of the observer is located inside or outside of the SEP source is a crucial factor determining the values of index α. A two-phase phenomenon {{is found in the}} radial dependence of <b>peak</b> <b>intensities.</b> The "position" of the breakpoint (transition point/critical point) is determined by the magnetic connection status of the observers. This finding suggests that a very careful examination of magnetic connection between SEP source and each spacecraft should be taken in the observational studies. We obtain a lower limit of R^- 1. 7 ± 0. 1 for empirically modelling the radial dependence of SEP <b>peak</b> <b>intensities.</b> Our findings in this work can be used to explain the majority of the previous multispacecraft survey results, and especially to reconcile the different/conflicting empirical values of index α in the literature.

40|$|International audienceDifferent {{procedures}} of voltammetric <b>peak</b> <b>intensities</b> determination, {{as well as}} various experimental setups were systematically tested on simulated and real experimental data {{in order to identify}} critical points in the determination of copper complexation parameters (ligand concentration and conditional stability constant) by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). Varieties of titration data sets (Cu(measured) VS. Cu(total)) were fitted by models encompassing discrete sites distribution of one-class and two-class of binding ligands (by PROSECE software). Examination of different procedures for <b>peak</b> <b>intensities</b> determination applied on voltammograms with known preset values revealed that tangent fit (IF) routine should be avoided, as for both simulated and experimental titration data it produced an additional class of strong ligand (actually not present). <b>Peak</b> <b>intensities</b> determination by fitting of the whole voltammogram was found to be the most appropriate, as it provided most reliable complexation parameters. Tests performed on real seawater samples under different experimental conditions revealed that in addition to importance of proper <b>peak</b> <b>intensities</b> determination, an accumulation time (control of the sensitivity) and an equilibration time needed for complete complexation of added copper during titration (control of complexation kinetics) are the keypoints to obtain reliable results free of artefacts. The consequence of overestimation and underestimation of complexing parameters is supported and illustrated by the example of free copper concentrations (the most bioavailable/toxic specie) calculated for all studied cases. Errors up to 80 % of underestimation of free copper concentration and almost two orders of magnitude overestimation of conditional stability constant were registered for the simulated case with two ligands.
