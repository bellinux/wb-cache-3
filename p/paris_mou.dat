40|$|Port State Control {{has become}} an {{important}} aspect in the enforcement of international regulations. The practice of Port State Control was implemented in recognition {{to the fact that}} certain flag states were unable or unwilling to enforce international rules and standards on vessel in their register. Since the start of the regional cooperation under Paris Memorandum of Understanding in Europe has the regime of <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> seen much development? The means of assuring that foreign vessels are in compliance with international regulations range from detaining substandard vessels to using information systems to raise awareness with the general public and also as a warning system for substandard vessels. Through the <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> website can any person access information on the results of an inspection of a vessel, which has been inspected by a member state of <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU.</b> This information has an impact on a shipping company commercial position, as charterers can easily access the inspection record on any vessel. With the high stakes following an inspection is it not unlikely that conflicts can emerged between the two parties, the authority and the ship owner? This thesis explores the different perceptions on conflicts around Port State Control inspections. The available Appeal procedures for ship owners in the member states and <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> have been mapped to examine the means for a ship owner to raise concerns in case a mistake has been made in an inspection. The findings show a high difference on the perceptions. The authorities which participated in the research indicated no conflicts, while the participating shipping company and shipping association gave the opposite view and an indication of unreported cases are common. Plausible causes for conflicts has been identified as interpretation of regulations and improperly trained crews and Port State Control Officers. Following these findings was the development of <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> and the STCW code examined. The examinations showed that <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> has developed vastly in recent time while the STCW code has not seen any major developments in the competences connected to ensuring compliance with legislative requirements. Recommendations to ship owners has been identified which includes internal education and utilization of coming <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> publications.

40|$|Despite an {{extensive}} system of Port state controls (PSC) on ships, inspection loopholes in European control functions have been reported. Furthermore, risk {{factors associated with}} fatigue, stress and a poorly developed safety culture on board ships {{have been identified in}} earlier research. These combined risk factors may pose a serious threat to maritime safety. With this as a point of departure, this thesis aims to investigate the perceived work situation for Swedish inspectors from an inspector’s point of view concerning professional challenges, status and identity for inspectors and the perceived quality of <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> inspection system and the Swedish inspection organization. In this study, the activities of Swedish PSC inspectors are viewed as a profession and the inspectors are viewed as bureaucrats. One of the principals for bureaucracy is that its servants should exercise their authority according to the common good, be autonomous, rational, reliable and responsible. The results indicate that organizational and management reforms have put the PSC bureaucrat under pressure to become more market oriented. Due to the responsibilities inherent in the profession of inspector within the complex structure of shipping, these organizational and management reforms conflict with the PSC inspector’s autonomy and professional role. Inspectors perceive that their expertise and integrity are vital for the success of their work. They also consider the high degree of control that the Swedish inspection organization exercises on the inspectors’ work as limiting to their autonomy and ability to make professional decisions. Some level of control may fulfil a need of support from the Swedish inspection organization, but too much control hampers the professional self-sufficiency and freedom of action. The inspectors in this study reveal considerable ambivalence towards the quality and complexity of ship safety inspections carried out in Sweden and within the <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> system. The research has been funded by, the Swedish Mercantile Marine Foundation. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Maritime Labour Convention 2006 (MLC, 2006) {{has entered}} into force in August 2013. Shipowners, flag States and port State {{authorities}} {{have an important}} role in the successful implementation of the MLC, 2006. Port State control (PSC) is responsible for ensuring that ships are in compliance with the requirements of the MLC, 2006. In cases of significant non-compliance ships are detained. This paper analyses the MLC, 2006 -related deficiencies that were marked as a ground for detention of ships inspected in areas under the jurisdiction of the <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> in the period 20 August 2013 until 31 December 2014. 390 recorded detainable deficiencies were related to 33 items, mostly belonging to areas “Accommodation, recreational facilities, food and catering” and “Conditions of employment”. The fact that 220 ships were detained (a total of 39 based solely on the MLC, 2006 -related deficiencies) in 18 port States, suggests that PSC is becoming effective in detecting unacceptable working and living conditions for seafarers on-board. Detention rates on the MLC, 2006 ground vary significantly between port States, indicating that there is a room for harmonisation of PSC procedure...|$|E
40|$|Driven by {{the global}} nature of shipping, {{maritime}} governance {{is characterized by a}} long history of intergovernmental decision making with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as central locus of authority. Since the 1980 s, maritime governance for the European Union (EU) and its member states is subject to processes of regionalization, especially in the environmental domain. Dissatisfaction with the ambition level of the IMO as well as lack of effective implementation and enforcement of IMO standards has driven the emergence of four regionally-based initiatives: the use of special areas in IMO Conventions, the adoption of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Port State Control, the development of the European Union shipping policy domain and the emergence of market based initiatives by ports and cargo-owners. This article analyses how each of these regional initiatives are based on cooperation between a regional group of actors and how each initiative has become integrated in maritime governance. The article concludes that although IMO remains a central locus of authority, the emergence of the <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> on PSC and EU legislation for shipping has resulted in a move from a centralized, intergovernmental maritime governance system between the 1950 s and 1980 s to a more polycentric governance system for EU member states today...|$|E
40|$|The {{succession}} of maritime accidents {{in the last}} decades of the 20 th Century caused a strong political and public outcry for more stringent maritime safety regulations and measures. One {{of the most significant}} developments in this regard was the establishment of several regional agreements on Port State Control (PSC) with the specific objective of fighting substandard shipping through coordinated and harmonised inspection procedures. This article is based on results from 32, 206 PSC inspections carried out by the European Union and European Free Trade Association Member States within the <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> region from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015 to assess whether discrepancies among Member States exist after the entry into force of Directive 2009 / 16 /EC and the introduction of the New Inspection Regime. Further, the study proceeds by investigating whether PSC team composition and inspector’s background influence inspection outcomes. The study has identified that differences in detecting at least one deficiency and/or detaining a vessel are significant among Member States. With regard to team composition and background, it appears that the former correlates to the number of deficiencies and detentions and the latter, though the significance is not always consistent, to detecting a certain type of deficiencies according to the specific inspector’s backgrounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 (hereafter: MLC 2006) have long been familiar to many states, but for some it has brought with it increased expectations in improving working conditions for seafarers. This study aims to analyse the early figures provided by Paris Memorandum of Understanding’s (hereafter: <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU)</b> {{on the number of}} deficiencies and detentions in before and after the implementation of the MLC 2006, as well as the ILO Committee of Experts 2014 Report, which marks the first full year of MLC 2006 compliance in the first ratifying states.

40|$|This {{article is}} based on a {{combined}} dataset of 183, 819 port state control (PSC) inspections from various port state control regimes around the world. In theory, there should be no differences in treatments of inspections to determine if a vessel is substandard or not no matter where the inspection was performed. This article uses correspondence analysis in order to investigate whether there are differences and if so, visualizes them for easier interpretation. The results of this analysis confirm that treatment of vessels across port state control regimes differ although some groupings of regimes across the ownership groups can be found. Association can be found between the <b>Paris</b> <b>MoU</b> and the ViÃ±a del Mar Agreement and between the Caribbean MoU and the Indian Ocean MoU while the USCG and AMSA are always apart from the rest. With respect to the distribution of deficiency codes towards regimes, only areas such as structural safety, radio communications or safety and cargo operational areas show similarities while ISM related deficiencies only show strong association with one regime. The differences clearly show that there is room for harmonization across port state control inspections in all inspection areas. Harmonization could be achieved by increasing cooperation amongst the regimes. A good starting point would be the acceleration of the harmonization of inspection procedures, combined training of port state control officers and the use of combined datasets across regimes, in particular in the concept of the development of the Global Integrated Ship Information System (GISIS) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). ...|$|E

The overall {{objectives}} of the Code are to establish an international framework involving co-operation between contracting governments, government agencies, local administrations and the shipping industry to detect maritime security threats and take pro-active measures against potential terrorist attacks against ships and/or port facilities which are the vital instruments of the international trade. The Code aims to reduce the vulnerability of port facilities and merchant ships to terrorist attacks and to increase the secur ity awareness of the industry. The ISPS Code, is the first ever internationally and widely agreed proactive regulatory framework to safeguard the maritime industry, seaborne trade, and the world economy from terrorism. In this study the success level of implementation of the ISPS Code already achieved by the ship managers is analysed through the port state control databases of the major regional maritime administrations and MOUs such as the <b>Paris</b> <b>MOU,</b> the Tokyo MOU, the Black Sea MOU and the United States Coast Guard (USCG).

The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the objectives and the implementation process for the shipping company and her assets, the ships. The responsibilities and the authorities arising from the Safety Management System (SMS), adopted by each company, for all the individuals ashore and aboard highlighted in Chapter 2. As important is to establish a well understood, feasible SMS, as vital is to establish procedures for the control and the inspection of the proper implementation from the Administrations. The objective of the audits, as dealt with in Chapter 3, is to seek information about the SMS and to determine the degree of compliance with the applicable rules and regulations, over a reasonable period of time. Chapter 4 is concemed with the purpose of the vessels boarding program, which is to monitor and inspect vessels to ensure they are operated in a safe manner and, are in compliance with the state and the international rules.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to perform an {{overview}} of the denotation and the use of the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) method in shipping industry and to analyze the performance of a specific company in Port State Control (PSC) KPI. This is accomplished by describing Key Performance indicators, their necessity, their structure, and the requirements during the design and the field of application. A brief historical reference in KPIs is also carried out and furthermore, it is also described reason and method this model was introduced in shipping industry. The established Shipping KPI model is presented in detail, as supported and developed by BIMCO, which is the world largest international shipping association. The model is a global tool for defining, measuring and reporting information on a ship's operational performance in order to boost performance improvements with companies engaged in ship operation activities and to provide an efficient communication platform on ship operation performance to internal and external stakeholders. In addition to the above, this paper reviews and analyzes the performance of a specific shipping Company in port state control inspections carried out on board managed vessels for the period of 2012 - 2016. The company has a fleet of containers and bulk carriers of variable size, age, type, classification society and flag. Through the examination of port state control inspections, results are scrutinized with regards to specific characteristics of the ships, in an effort to establish trends affecting port state control inspections of the company. The results are further analyzed in order to connect detentions with average deficiencies and those with specific vessels’ characteristics, such as age, vessel type, flag and classification societies and the connection of those. Further examination is performed trying to benchmark company’s performance in Tokyo and <b>Paris</b> <b>MOU</b> and US Coast Guard, and evaluate all necessary actions needed in order same to be improved.

Because {{seaborne trade}} is cheap and safe, {{it has been}} main stay of the international trade. As seaborne trade has increasing annual volumes, the requirement for inspection of ships has raised. In this context, to consider historical development of the inspection forms in the world, it is required to review 13. - 14. century. In these centuries, state control started by intervention to ship loading boundaries, and then developped by the inspection of the captains information, seasons to put out to sea, rules for ship building and eligibility to sea during the centuries; which then {{laid the groundwork for}} state responsibility and control with royal mandates, commandments, court decisions and laws. Because of the increasing volumes in seaborne trade, international community had to co-operate to provide sea safety and to protect marine environment. On the protection of enviroment, international contracts and administration leaded by IMO contributed much to international efforts, intensely in 1970 s. With one of these agreements, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982), flag states were charged with life and property safety of ships; and provide and perpetuate protection of marine environment. In this context, under the control of flag states, the eligible ships are allowed to navigate, and those which are not eligible are allowed to navigate only if they provide the completion of their imperfection. Thereby; by protection of marine environment, marine safety, and perfection of living and working conditions within the ships; minimization of accident risk is provided. Although flag states were authorizated for the compliance inspections of the ships to the international standards of the agreements.; flag states started losing their inspection and control functions over the ships due to various reasons, as: - Fast growth in world navigation fleet, - Deployment of Flag of Convenience applications, - Ships working in long distance, away from flag states, - Lack of experience, - Lack of sources, Due to those reasons, to prevent marine pollution and to provide navigation safety; implementation and agreements in operation were reviewed and changed. Additionally, to  correct the problems of Flag State Controls, Port State Controls were introduced. By Port State Controls, it was aimed to debug flag state controls which was insufficient to inspection eligibility of the ships to international standards, and to apply sanctions to ships not providing  those standards. While struggling against the sub-standart ships, insufficiency of national implemetations on its own, demanded co-operation. It was conclued that, according to the Port State Control,  regional cooperation was is the most functional co-operation type. Thus, standardization of Port State Controls, prevention of unfair trade between the ports, and performing more efficient inspections of the neighbouring states on the ships visiting their regions were provided. In this context, with the aim of detection of the ships which do not provide the standards and to apply sanctions for those, first memorandum of understanding, <b>Paris</b> <b>MOU</b> was signed in 1982 with the participation of 14 countries. Currently, 9 regional MOU exists including world seas. - <b>Paris</b> <b>MOU</b> -   Tokyo MOU -   Vina del Mar MOU -   Caribbean MOU -   Abuja MOU -   Black Sea MOU -   Mediterranean MOU -   Indian Ocean MOU -   Riyadh MOU USA, did not take place within regional agreements made out under Port State Control scope, instead, adopted one-side control precautions by USCG. However, in this Port State Control, due to insufficient number of inspector, parametric differences in targeting systems, etc. several problems occured like non-standard implementations between regions. In recent years, additional to the two applications mentioned above, aiming detection of sub-standart ships and transfer of the shipments by better/well kept and problem-free ships; inspections of the ships are executed in the context of Vetting Inspection by various firms within the sector. These inspections can be performed by: - Individual oil/chemical companies or terminals, - Accredited SIRE inspectors under the SIRE system, - Accredited CDI inspectors under the CDI system, By reason of the inspection, it is not decided whether the ship can pass fail an inspection, however the inspection forms are considered during selection process. The final decision is taken due to various variables as: Port State Control records, terminal reports, the information about ship owner, loading/unloading ports, longevity of the navigation and directions.   In this context, CDI {{is one of the most}} applied Vetting Inspection, which is a Holland establishment, conducting the operation from England. It is a non-profit organization with 83 members and  facilitates 7 / 24 access to inspection reports by database. It is divided into two as CDI-M and CDI-T; and at present 150 inspector and reporters are performing inspections all over the world. Another application is SIRE program, established by OCIMF in 1993, to provide a tank ship risk evaluation tool about ship safety to renters, ship operators, terminal administrators and public authorities and to resolve the issue of sub-standard transportation. It is also a non-profit organization with 70 members and  facilitates 7 / 24 access to inspection reports by database. Beginning from the date the program entered into force, over 180. 000 inspections were performed. In this study, in the context of SIRE, which takes place under Vetting Inspections, a questionnaire form was sent to Turkish firms and data collected for the inspections held between years 2006 - 2014. In this context, 393 inspections held in 16 firms were  reviewed. The inspections were held in 9 MOU, 40 different seaports and made by 14 different inspector firms. The data obtained was analyzed and evaluated by SPSS, the results of the inspections were reviewed and the defects and root causes of the defects were investigated.   As a result of this study, the findings are as followed: - It is determined that, the firms inspected have similar imperfection ratios per inspection, - The detects determined by the inspections; * In general framework, are intensely in Chapter 5 (Safety Management), Chapter 8 (Petroleum, Chemicals, LPG and LNG) and Chapter 11 (Engine and Steering Compartments) * The situation is similar yearly, (In 2007 Chapter 5, in 2010 Chapter 11, in 2011 Chapter 8, in 2012 Chapter 8 and Chapters 11, in 2014 Chapter 8 was not in top 3 grade, in the following years, Chapter 5, Chapters 8 and Chapters 11 were in top 3 grade), however, although imperfection ratio regarding Chapter 13 decreased in recent years, total number of defects are high, * The critics of inspector firms are intensely in Chapters 5, Chapter 8 and Chapter 11, but similar to the issue above, also the critics are dense in Chapter 13. - It was determined that, the ratio of imperfection per inspection has decreased yearly, which shows preparation for the inspections were fulfilled and firms are more conscious of the inspections, - There is not any meaningful difference between defects ratio per inspection according to the regions - Firms detected 3 - 5 defects on average per inspection between 2012 - 2014.
