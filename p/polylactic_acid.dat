In the present study, rabbit models of 10 -mm sciatic nerve defects were prepared. The rabbit models were repaired with autologous nerve, a <b>polylactic</b> glycolic <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, or a <b>polylactic</b> glycolic <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells + extracellular matrix gel. After 24 weeks, mechanical testing was performed to determine the stress relaxation and creep parameters. Following sciatic nerve injury, the magnitudes of the stress decrease and strain increase at 7, 200 seconds were largest in the <b>polylactic</b> glycolic <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells + extracellular matrix gel group, followed by the <b>polylactic</b> glycolic <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells group, and then the autologous nerve group. Hematoxylin-eosin staining demonstrated that compared with the <b>polylactic</b> glycolic <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells group and the autologous nerve group, a more complete sciatic nerve regeneration was found, including good myelination, regularly arranged nerve fibers, and a completely degraded and resorbed conduit, in the <b>polylactic</b> glycolic <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells + extracellular matrix gel group. These results indicate that bridging 10 -mm sciatic nerve defects with a <b>polylactic</b> glycolic <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells + extracellular matrix gel construct increases the stress relaxation under a constant strain, reducing anastomotic tension. Large elongations under a constant physiological load can limit the anastomotic opening and shift, which is beneficial for the regeneration and functional reconstruction of sciatic nerve. Better regeneration was found with the <b>polylactic</b> glycolic <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells + extracellular matrix gel grafts than with the <b>polylactic</b> glycolic <b>acid</b> conduit + bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells grafts and the autologous nerve grafts...|$|R

C. glutamicum is used in industry to produce amino acids such as glutamate and lysine (Hermann et al. 2003). Engineered strains of C. glutamicum produce high levels of succinic acid (Okino et al. 2008 a) used to synthesize polymers as well as l-lactic acid (Okino et al. 2005) and d-lactic acid (Okino et al. 2008 b), which serve as precursors of <b>polylactic</b> <b>acids.</b> Engineered strains of C. glutamicum also produce the polymer precursor C 5 -diamine cadaverine (Tateno et al. 2009) and GABA, which is a precursor of synthetic C 4 -biodegradable polyamides (Takahashi et al. 2012; Okai et al. 2014).

40|$|This study {{presents}} the synthesis and physical characterization {{of a series}} of structurally well-defined star-shaped <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acids).</b> Polymer stars are prepared from a series of multifunctional alcohol cores including flexible polyols pentaerythritol and dipentaerythritol (four-armed and six-armed cores, respectively) and rigid substituted arenes tri(hydroxymethyl) benzene and hexa(hydroxymethyl) benzene. Utilizing a tin(II) octanoate catalyst, arms of 10 monomer units long are built from rac-lactide and l-lactide to form atactic and isotactic star polymers. Polymers were subsequently characterized by means of NMR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. Our results support previous work that suggests that the length of the individual arms, not the total molecular weight, correlates to physical characteristics including glass, melt, crystallization, and decomposition temperatures. In addition, differences between core molecules suggest that the chemical nature of the core can significantly alter the physical properties of the star polymer. Trends in crystallization and glass transition temperatures relative to the core used merit further study and correlate closest to the molecular weight and the number of arms emanating from the star core.

Silk fibroin contains hydrophobic Beta sheet blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the beta-sheets contribute much to the high mechanical strength of silk fibers, which achieves 740 MPa, tens of times that of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> and hundreds of times that of collagen. This impressive mechanical strength has made silk fibroin very competitive for applications in biomaterials.

25|$|This {{technique}} {{does not}} require the use of a solid porogen like SCPL. First, a synthetic polymer is dissolved into a suitable solvent (e.g. <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> in dichloromethane) then water is added to the polymeric solution and the two liquids are mixed in order to obtain an emulsion. Before the two phases can separate, the emulsion is cast into a mold and quickly frozen by means of immersion into liquid nitrogen. The frozen emulsion is subsequently freeze-dried to remove the dispersed water and the solvent, thus leaving a solidified, porous polymeric structure. While emulsification and freeze-drying allow for a faster preparation when compared to SCPL (since it {{does not require}} a time consuming leaching step), it still requires the use of solvents. Moreover, pore size is relatively small and porosity is often irregular. Freeze-drying by itself is also a commonly employed technique for the fabrication of scaffolds. In particular, it is used to prepare collagen sponges: collagen is dissolved into acidic solutions of acetic acid or hydrochloric acid that are cast into a mold, frozen with liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Chronic osteomyelitis, or bone infection, {{is a major}} {{worldwide}} {{cause of}} morbidity and mortality, as it is exceptionally hard to treat due to patient and pathogen-associated factors. Successful treatment requires surgical debridement together with long-term, high antibiotic concentrations that are best achieved by local delivery devices, either made of degradable or non-degradable materials. Areas covered: Non-degradable delivery devices are frequently constituted by polymethylmethacrylate-based carriers. Drawbacks are the need to remove the carrier (as the carrier itself may provide a substratum for bacterial colonization), inefficient release kinetics and incompatibility with certain antibiotics. These drawbacks {{have led to the}} quest for degradable alternatives, but also devices made of biodegradable calcium sulphate, collagen sponges, calcium phosphate or <b>polylactic</b> <b>acids</b> have their specific disadvantages. Expert opinion: Antibiotic treatment of osteomyelitis with the current degradable and non-degradable delivery devices is effective in the majority of cases. Degradable carriers have an advantage over non-degradable carriers that they do not require surgical removal. Synthetic poly(trimethylene carbonate) may be preferred in the future over currently approved lactic/glycolic acids, because it does not yield acidic degradation products. Moreover, degradable poly(trimethylene carbonate) yields a zero-order release kinetics that may not stimulate development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to the absence of long-term, low-concentration tail-release. ...|$|R

25|$|Solvent casting and {{particulate}} leaching (SCPL) {{allows for}} the preparation of structures with regular porosity, but with limited thickness. First, the polymer is dissolved into a suitable organic solvent (e.g. <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> could be dissolved into dichloromethane), then the solution is cast into a mold filled with porogen particles. Such porogen can be an inorganic salt like sodium chloride, crystals of saccharose, gelatin spheres or paraffin spheres. The size of the porogen particles will affect {{the size of the}} scaffold pores, while the polymer to porogen ratio is directly correlated to the amount of porosity of the final structure. After the polymer solution has been cast the solvent is allowed to fully evaporate, then the composite structure in the mold is immersed in a bath of a liquid suitable for dissolving the porogen: water in the case of sodium chloride, saccharose and gelatin or an aliphatic solvent like hexane for use with paraffin. Once the porogen has been fully dissolved, a porous structure is obtained. Other than the small thickness range that can be obtained, another drawback of SCPL lies in its use of organic solvents which must be fully removed to avoid any possible damage to the cells seeded on the scaffold.|$|E

In this sense, this work studies the thermo-rheological properties of commercial biodegradable polyesters: two <b>polylactic</b> <b>acids</b> (PLAs), a polycaprolactone (PCL) and a PLA/PCL blend. A comprehensive material characterization by means of thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), frequency sweep tests and polarized light microscopy was carried out. The results {{have shown that the}} material thermal/thermo-rheological properties and, therefore, its microstructure, are strongly dependent on its thermal history. This fact arises from the slow recrystallization kinetics shown by PLA. Interestingly, PCL may play the role of nucleating agent for the PLA crystallization, making it faster.

40|$|In recent time, {{the quest}} for {{renewable}} materials {{for the development of}} packaging items is constantly increasing. The class of <b>polylactic</b> <b>acids</b> (PLAs) is the most promising one, although a broader scale commercial expansion of these polymers cannot leave unceasing enhancement of their functional properties aside, especially toughness and thermal stability. Similarly, continuous innovation in prototyping competitive easy-route solutions for material processing is another key to successful industrial applications of PLAs. In this respect, this study deals with the design and formulation of innovative custom-built PLAs for injection and compression molding, which are compostable, suitable for food contact, and characterized by a good compromise of mechanical properties and thermal resistance. Therefore, a commercial grade PLA was modified by reactive compounding extrusion with maleic anhydride (MAH) -grafted PLA (PLA-MA) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) -grafted PLA (PLA-GMA) and micro-lamellar talc. Material structure and thermal response of the compounds were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The experimental findings show that material structure and, especially, crystallization of the PLA can be controlled by fine-tuning the compound formulation. In addition, achievement of the appropriate crystallization degree in the polymer can lead to compostable composite materials with good thermal stability. Accordingly, the custom-built PLA formulations feature the potential to expand significantly the fields of application of compostable biopolymers, thus posing a valid alternative to both durable not compostable bioplastics and conventional plastics in injection and compression molding process...|$|R

Surgeons have typically used autologous nerve grafts, which have several drawbacks including the need for multiple surgical procedures and loss of function at the donor site. As an alternative, the use of nerve guidance channels {{to bridge the gap}} between severed nerve ends is being explored. In this paper, the electrically conductive polymer—oxidized polypyrrole (PP) —has been evaluated for use as a substrate to enhance nerve cell interactions in culture as a first step toward potentially using such polymers to stimulate in vivo nerve regeneration. Image analysis demonstrates that PC- 12 cells and primary chicken sciatic nerve explants attached and extended neurites equally well on both PP films and tissue culture polystyrene in the absence of electrical stimulation. In contrast, PC- 12 cells interacted poorly with indium tin oxide (ITO), poly(l-lactic <b>acid)</b> (PLA), and <b>poly(lactic</b> acid-co-glycolic <b>acid)</b> surfaces. However, PC- 12 cells cultured on PP films and subjected to an electrical stimulus through the film showed a significant increase in neurite lengths compared with ones that were not subjected to electrical stimulation through the film and tissue culture polystyrene controls. The median neurite length for PC- 12 cells grown on PP and subjected to an electrical stimulus was 18. 14 μm (n = 5643) compared with 9. 5 μm (n = 4440) for controls.

[...] This hydrophobicity inhibits their biocompatibility, which makes them less effective for in vivo use as tissue scaffolding. In order to fix the lack of biocompatibility, much research has been done to combine these hydrophobic materials with hydrophilic and more biocompatible hydrogels. While these hydrogels have a superior biocompatibility, they lack the structural integrity of PLA, PCL, and PGA.

Twenty fractured scaphoid waist specimens were randomly divided into experimental and control groups (n= 10 /group). Reduction and internal fixation of the scaphoid were achieved with either Kirschner wires (K-wires) or ASS. A moving target simulator was used to test palmar flexion and dorsal extension, with the range of testing (waist movement) set from 5 ° of palmar flexion to 25 ° of dorsal extension. Flexion and extension were repeated 2, 000 times for each specimen. Fracture gap displacements were measured with a computerized tomography scanning. Scaphoid tensile and bending strengths were measured by using a hydraulic pressure biomechanical system. Results: Prior to biomechanical fatigue testing, fracture gap displacements were 0. 16 ± 0. 02  mm and 0. 22 ± 0. 02  mm in the ASS and K-wire groups, respectively. After fatigue testing, fracture gap displacements in the ASS and the K-wire groups were 0. 21 ± 0. 03 mm and 1. 52 ± 0. 07  mm, respectively.

The weight ratio of Paclitaxel to PLGA/PEG blends was 10 : 90, 20 : 80, and 30 : 70. Pre- and post-expansion surface morphologies of the Paclitaxel-eluting copolymer coating stents were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The quantitative analysis of Paclitaxel release in vitro and hemocompatibility by hemolysis ratio and dynamic clotting time measurement also were investigated...|$|R
