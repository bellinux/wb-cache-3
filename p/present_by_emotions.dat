Investigations of other reflexes are limited. Recently, research suggested that the postauricular reflex {{in response to a}} startling noise was modulated <b>by</b> <b>emotion.</b> In particular, pleasant stimuli enhanced the postauricular reflex. However, these first investigations were limited: One experiment demonstrated only a marginal difference between the pleasant stimuli and neutral stimuli and the other lacked the typical neutral scene comparison. The present experiment was designed to assess whether sig-nificant emotion versus neutral differences would occur. Results demonstrated that pleasant stimuli, regardless of arousal level, evoked larger postauricular reflex activation than neutral and unpleasant emotional stimuli.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that processing of conflict is facilitated <b>by</b> <b>emotion.</b> Emotional stimuli signal significance in a situation. Thus, when an emotional stimulus is task relevant, more resources may {{be devoted to}} conflict processing to reduce the time that an organism is unable to act. In the present electroencephalography and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) studies, we employed a conflict task and manipulated the emotional content and prosody of auditory target stimuli. In line with our hypothesis, reaction times revealed faster conflict resolution for emotional stimuli. Early stages of event-related potential conflict processing were modulated <b>by</b> <b>emotion</b> as indexed in an enhanced frontocentral negativity at 420 ms. FMRI yielded conflict activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), a crucial part of the executive control network. The right ventral ACC (vACC) was activated for conflict processing in emotional stimuli, suggesting that it is additionally activated for conflict processing in emotional stimuli. The amygdala was also activated <b>by</b> <b>emotion.</b> Furthermore, emotion increased functional connectivity between the vACC and activity in the amygdala and the dACC. The results support the hypothesis that emotion speeds up conflict processing and suggest a new role for the vACC in processing conflict in particularly significant situations signaled <b>by</b> <b>emotion...</b>|$|R

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and {{is not to be}} disseminated broadly. Alcohol myopia (AM) has {{emerged as one of the}} most widely researched theories of alcohol’s effects on emotional experience. Given this theory’s popularity, it is notable that a central tenet of AM has not been tested—namely, that alcohol creates a myopic focus on the present moment, limiting the extent to which the <b>present</b> is permeated <b>by</b> <b>emotions</b> derived from prior experience. We tested the impact of alcohol on moment-to-moment fluctuations in affect, applying advances in emotion assessment and statistical analysis to test this aspect of AM without drawing the attention of participants to their own emotional experiences. We measured emotional fluctuations using autocorrelation, a statistic borrowed from time-series analysis measuring the correlation between successive observations in time. High emotion autocorrelation is termed emotional inertia and is linked to negative mood outcomes. Social drinkers (N � 720) consumed alcohol, placebo, or control beverages in groups of 3 over a 36 -min group formation task. We indexed affect using the Duchenne smile, recorded continuously during the interaction (34. 9 million video frames) according to the Facial Action Coding System (P. Ekman, W. V. Friesen, & J. C. Hager, 2002). Autocorrelation of Duchenne smiling emerged as the most consistent predictor of self-reported mood and social bonding when compared with Duchenne smiling mean, standard deviation, and linear trend. Alcohol reduced affective autocorrelation, and autocorrelation mediated the link between alcohol and self-reported mood and social outcomes. Findings suggest that alcohol enhances the ability to freely enjoy the <b>present</b> moment untethered <b>by</b> past experience and highlight the importance of emotion dynamics in research examining affective correlates of psychopathology...|$|R
