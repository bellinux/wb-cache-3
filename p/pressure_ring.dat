5000|$|The {{turntable}} plinth has {{a precision}} 16 gauge steel stamped top plate. The base {{appears to be}} a heavy composite plastic material with steel bars or plates added for additional weight. The platter is die-cast aluminum having a thickness of 0.110". At the center of the underside of the platter a 3.520" [...] diameter, 0.210" [...] thick, ceramic magnetic ring bonded to the platter is used to magnetically secure the platter to a 3.800" [...] diameter steel plate on the spindle assembly. Two large finger holes in the platter are provided for lifting the platter off of the spindle. The platter and ceramic magnet assembly weighs 1.84 lbs. The integrated aluminum tonearm assembly includes the tonearm counterweight with stylus <b>pressure</b> <b>ring,</b> rest/clamp, lift lever, lift adjustment, plus calibrated anti-skate control, height, height lock, and tracking force adjustments. The tonearm rest/clamp and adjustment dials are plastic. The die-cast metal headshell is of the standard removable type. A generously sized LCD display on the Pro models indicates speed setting, play/pause, pitch, quartz lock, and direction of platter rotation. The ground wire and audio output leads are permanently attached. A removable, hinged plastic dust cover was included.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the initial}} launch the Numark units {{received}} mixed reviews, with several flaws and inadequate quality assurance being pointed out. Some found the tonearm as supplied was not accurately calibrated or properly {{aligned with the}} platter, {{but it can be}} tweaked and adjusted to perform well. The platter in some cases exhibited noticeable warp or axial run-out, which appears to be in part due to the ceramic ring magnetic that secures the platter to the spindle not being glued correctly to the underside of the platter. Some reviewers complained that the pitch system was not calibrated accurately, although not off by much. On later production models, probably the Pro TT-2 only, it is reported that access holes are provided {{on the bottom of the}} turntable base to permit pitch calibration using a screwdriver. Others considered the LCD display to be of little practical value since the pitch value shown is not precise. Also, in some cases the stylus <b>pressure</b> <b>ring</b> on the tonearm counterbalance weight assembly turns much too freely. And, unfortunately, the dust cover hinges eventually fail due to cracking at the bottom of the plastic housing for the counterbalance spring which is under the constant load of the stiff spring. One failed hinge keeps the dust cover from staying open when raised.|$|E

These key design differences were evaluated and compared using ANSYS FLUENT to conduct a conjugate heat transfer analysis on each design.

As a result, the innermost fibers of a high-pressure vessel (3) made of composite material are subjected to appreciably less stress, which has a beneficial effect on the life of the high-pressure vessel (3), and all fibers of the wall are utilized effectively.

40|$|Methane is {{the second}} most serious {{greenhouse}} gas next to carbon dioxide contributing to global warming and climate change. As part of the national greenhouse gas emissions inventory, methane emission data have to be reported to the European Union (EU) and to the UN Climate Secretariat. Until 2004 the methane emissions from gas distribution in the Netherlands were quantified by a gas consumption based average emission factor approach, a so-called IPCC Tier 1 method. The gas distribution utilities in the Netherlands have had several objections against the IPCC Tier 1 method for principal reasons. The IPCC Tier 1 method was based on the amount of gas consumption and was not source-specific. Instead, a IPCC Tier 3 method was proposed, a rigorous source-specific approach. The IPCC Tier 3 method is composed of detailed inventories of the amount and types of process infrastructure and typical design and operating practices.

Focusing attention on field saturated hydraulic conductivity, the in-site measurement techniques by tension disc and <b>pressure</b> <b>ring</b> infiltrometers are considered, pointing out the main indications for the correct use of each measuring approach; laboratory techniques are also considered. Statistical data analysis showed that the measurements performed by tension disc infiltrometer supplied values of hydraulic conductivity which are on average lower and more homogeneous than the values provided by the other measurement techniques considered. Sensitivity analysis was then carried out by Monte Carlo simulation on the parameter sampling achieved by field measurement techniques in order to evaluate the influence of any possible small measurement errors on the data. Sensitivity analysis showed that both ring and disc infiltrometer are tools reliable enough for the in situ measurements of field saturated hydraulic conductivity.

The cluster center displays signs of powerful AGN feedback, which has cleared the central regions (r< 7. 5 kpc) of dense, X-ray emitting ICM.

40|$|Global {{growth in}} the sales of {{light-duty}} diesel-powered vehicles is effectively driven by diesel engines superior fuel economy though concerns implicating emission formations and usage of non-renewable fossil still persist. Such obstacles present a need for {{better understanding of the}} diesel combustion, which will help improve engine efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions. To address this issue, experimental study of in-cylinder combustion processes is conducted in a light-duty diesel engine with focus on flame development transience. A new experimental research facility has been designed and constructed to study transient behaviour of diesel flames during combustion. The facility houses a modified single-cylinder diesel engine that allows optical access to the combustion chamber at realistic engine environment and ambient conditions. Two distinctly different diesel combustion regimes are investigated: one with short injection duration and the other with long injection duration. The first of the combustion regimes consists of short injection duration and long ignition delay ultimately resulting in a positive ignition dwell (fuel injection completes prior to ignition). In this regime, the overall combustion is dominated by premixed burn phase whereby further improvement of efficiency is limited by a drastic increase in in-cylinder pressure. If the problem is severe, undesirable <b>pressure</b> <b>ringing</b> follows the initial pressure rise, which is called diesel knock. The first part of this thesis addresses this issue of knocking in a light-duty diesel engine. In the optical engine, high-speed natural hot soot luminosity imaging was performed to visualise flame behaviour during the knocking cycles. It is found that the diesel flame oscillates against the normal swirl direction and the oscillation frequency matches the frequency of in-cylinder <b>pressure</b> <b>ringing,</b> which is the first observation of such correspondence in a diesel engine. Experimentation with pilot injection showed a remedial effect through elimination of <b>pressure</b> <b>ringing</b> and dampening of flame oscillation. Such results are connected with a short ignition delay and less intense premixed combustion as shown through a lower pressure rise rate and negative ignition dwell (i. e. mixing-controlled combustion). The second regime investigated in this thesis presents long injection duration through a single-hole injector resulting in a negative ignition dwell (combustion starts prior to the end of injection). This regime is dominated by mixing-controlled combustion phase corresponding to high-load engine operating conditions. Opposed to the short-injection regime with positive ignition dwell, this long-injection regime is characterised by a lifted flame that is under the strong influence of jet-wall interaction during and after the fuel injection. Therefore, the focus of last half of this thesis is on the jet-wall interaction and its impact on lift-off length (i. e. distance between the nozzle to the first detectable flame base within a specified spatial range with respect to the jet trajectory) that is known {{to play an important role}} in pollutants formation. Interaction between the reacting jet and the wall was visualised through hot soot luminosity and hydroxyl radical (OH*) chemiluminescence imaging. An interesting finding from these imaging diagnostics is shortening of the lift-off length against the incoming jet momentum during the fuel injection. This trend is reversed (i. e. the lift-off length increases) only after the end of injection when the jet momentum diminishes. Detailed analysis of temporal evolution of the lift-off length and parametric studies of injection pressure and addition of neighbouring jet suggest that a potential cause for the shortening of the flame base is the redirection of hot combustion gases that are entrained back to the incoming jet, i. e. re-entrainment. The findings in this thesis help understand the current constraints in improving engine efficiency and reducing pollutant formation in light-duty diesel engines. It is suggested that at low-load operating conditions, engine developers should limit the pressure rise rate below a certain level so that problematic diesel knock can be avoided. By contrast, at high-load operating conditions, injection pulse width should be controlled to reduce jet-wall interaction as otherwise the pollutants formation would increase with decreasing lift-off length...|$|R

Likewise, a variable focus membrane lens was presented which focused {{on the problem of}} theoretical evaluation of the surface shape using the generalized nonlinear differential equation [7]. In addition, a liquid-filled tunable focus microlens was designed by using a membrane with different thickness between the central and peripheral region [8]. Besides, many kinds of liquid-filled lens with different actuators or control strategies were also designed in recent years, furthermore, the liquid tunable aspherical lenses are formed by liquid sealed with a non-uniform thickness membrane which could alleviate the edge clamping effect and reduce spherical aberration [9 – 15]. In order to decrease the influence of gravity to the performance of liquid lens, one of a method is using an in-plane pretention force to a membrane {{to take the place of}} surface tension and the other is using a non-uniform thickness profile of the flexible membrane [16, 17]. However, one of the common disadvantages of these liquid-filled lenses is that the focus could be adjusted in one region or only have one focus. Therefore, to suit different groups of people under different conditions, a liquid progressive multifocal lens with a non-uniform thickness elastic membrane is designed in this paper.|$|E

MethodsFrom 1990 to 1999, 790 patients (mean age 65 ± 12 years, 51 % New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, and mean right ventricular systolic pressure 56 ± 18 mm Hg) underwent tricuspid valve annuloplasty for functional regurgitation using 4 techniques: Carpentier-Edwards semi-rigid ring, Cosgrove-Edwards flexible band, De Vega procedure, and customized semicircular Peri-Guard annuloplasty. Of these patients, 89 % had concomitant mitral valve surgery. A total of 2245 follow-up transthoracic echocardiograms were retrieved. Tricuspid regurgitation was analyzed, and risk factors for worsening regurgitation were identified, by multivariable ordinal longitudinal methods. ResultsTricuspid regurgitation 1 week after annuloplasty was 3 + or 4 + in 14 % of patients. Regurgitation severity was stable across time with the Carpentier-Edwards ring (P =. 7), increased slowly with the Cosgrove-Edwards band (P =. 05), and rose more rapidly with the De Vega (P =. 002) and Peri-Guard (P =. 0009) procedures. Risk factors for worsening regurgitation included higher preoperative regurgitation grade, poor left ventricular function, permanent pacemaker, and repair type other than ring annuloplasty. Right ventricular systolic <b>pressure,</b> <b>ring</b> size, preoperative New York Heart Association functional class, and concomitant surgery were not risk factors. Tricuspid reoperation was rare (3 % at 8 years), and hospital mortality after reoperation was 37 %. ConclusionsTricuspid valve annuloplasty did not consistently eliminate functional regurgitation, and across time regurgitation increased importantly after Peri-Guard and De Vega annuloplasties. Therefore, these repair techniques should be abandoned, and transtricuspid pacing leads should be replaced with epicardial leads...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The present investigation advances a rotordynamic analysis of an automotive turbocharger with floating ring bearings. Each fluid film of the floating ring bearing is analyzed using a finite element model. The model includes the effects of lubricant heating and bearing clearance changes due to bearing power consumption. The floating ring bearing analysis provides both floating ring speeds and bearing force coefficients for use in a linear rotordynamic model. The linear rotordynamic evaluation yields predictions of system stability as well as response to imbalance. The linear analysis employs a 27 -station finite element model to capture the flexibility of the shaft. The analysis evidences several modes that become unstable at very low speeds, including cylindrical and conical modes for both inner and outer fluid films. Typically, the frequencies of the unstable modes are close to half the ring speed or half the ring plus rotor speeds. These results are supported by a non-linear transient analysis of the rotor-bearing system. The transient predicts the amplitude of the limit cycle motion for the unstable modes. Non-linear transient predictions are generated for a range of lubricant supply conditions with varied supply temperature and <b>pressure.</b> <b>Ring</b> speed and shaft motion predictions are compared to measurements taken on an automotive turbocharger test apparatus. Eddy-current proximity probes measure the shaft motion {{at both ends of the}} shaft, while fiber optic probes measure the ring speeds. The non-linear transient predicts the frequency content of the measured response with fair accuracy, but it usually over-predicts the amplitude of the response. In particular, the analysis fails to predict the effect of increasing lubricant supply pressure. In general, increasing the lubricant supply pressure reduces shaft motion amplitude. This investigation also attempts to identify through shaft motion measurements the effects of aerodynamic loading of the compressor, if any. Shaft motion measurements taken with the compressor housing re-oriented (in order to re-direct the aerodynamic load) showed that the aerodynamic load impacted the static displacement of the rotor, but the dynamic response showed little deviation from the original measurements...|$|E

Octane number increased in <b>pressure</b> <b>rang</b> 8 - 12 bar, liquid hour space velocity 2 and temperature 480 - 5000 C. The synthetic zeolite (Y) raised the octane number from (40 to 93. 5). The natural zeolite (scolecite) also showed good properties and increased the octane number from (40 to 87. 9). It needs more purification and modification to reach the synthetic. The study explained that the two zeolites (natural, synthetic) are successful for application in reforming process. ...|$|R
50|$|Inlays are {{the result}} of {{combining}} or two or more metals into one ring. It is {{not to be confused with}} alloying. The process of inlaying involves crushing the metals into channels, which are then trapped under <b>pressure.</b> On a <b>ring,</b> this usually results in metals sitting side-by-side on the surface - for example, a strip of gold running through the middle of an otherwise titanium ring.|$|R
40|$|Water impact drop {{tests were}} {{performed}} on the space shuttle solid rocket boosters (SRB). Peak water impact pressures and pressure/time traces were measured for various impact velocities using a two-dimensional, full-scale SRB aft skirt internal ring model. Passive burst disc-type pressure transducers were calibrated for use on flight SRB's. The effects on impact <b>pressure</b> of small <b>ring</b> configuration changes and application of thermal protection system cork layers {{were found to be}} negligible...|$|R

Characteristic intracellular bacilliform inclusions {{were identified in}} a brain biopsy. Clinical improvement followed treatment with parenteral antibiotics for two weeks and long term sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. As CNS relapse of Whipple's disease may occur after several years, long term treatment should include antibiotics {{that are able to}} cross the blood-brain barrier...|$|R
