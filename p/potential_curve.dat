5000|$|Based on the MIMS model, a {{schematic}} <b>potential</b> <b>curve</b> was {{proposed for the}} K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) and illustrated in the right figure. In the [...] "electronically-cold" [...] highly compressed plasma, a K-shell core ion with a hole, K1, collides with another core ion without a hole, K0, to form a near-dissociative K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) and its excess energy transforms into the vibration energy. Such a vibrationally hot K-MIMS in the plasma is denoted here by K1 + K0. Subsequently, a Rydberg-like pseudo-L-shell forms around the K-MIMS core ions that are proposed {{to go through a}} rapid relaxation into the lowest vibrational state by ionizing a number of electrons in the pseudo-L-shell. [...] The vibrationally cold K-MIMS without an L-shell hole is denoted by K1K0L0. The vibrational energy is quenched by ionizing the bound K1K0L0 MIMS into a higher ionic state K1K0Ln with n holes in the pseudo-L-shell, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 8. Because the n holes can be distributed among 2s and 2p orbits, thus the maximum value of n is 8. [...] The statistically distributed K-MIMS decays into the lower L-shell MIMS (L-MIMS), K0K0L1,by emitting an x-ray photon, and subsequently the L-MIMS dissociates into two atomic ions.|$|E

The term values [...] for a harmonic oscillator are given bywhere v is a vibrational quantum number, ωe is the harmonic wavenumber. In the next approximation the term values are given bywhere χe is an anharmonicity constant. This is, in effect, a better approximation to the Morse potential near the potential minimum. The spacing between adjacent vibrational lines decreases with increasing quantum number because of anharmonicity in the vibration. Eventually the separation decreases to zero when the molecule photo-dissociates into a continuum of states. The second formula is adequate for small values of the vibrational quantum number. For higher values further anharmonicity terms are needed as the molecule approaches the dissociation limit, at the energy corresponding to the upper (final state) <b>potential</b> <b>curve</b> at infinite internuclear distance.|$|E

We show that excited <b>potential</b> <b>curves</b> for H$_{ 3 }$, including a crossing with the ground state, can be accurately reproduced using {{a small fraction of}} the FCI space. A recently introduced error measure for <b>potential</b> <b>curves</b> [J. P. Coe and M. J. Paterson, J. Chem.

The seam of conical intersections for CH$_{ 2 }$ found by Yarkony [J. Chem. Phys., 104, 2932 (1996) ] is used as a test for SA-MCCI and we compare <b>potential</b> <b>curves</b> from SA-MCCI with FCI results for this system for the first three triplet states. We then demonstrate the improvement from using SA-MCCI on the dipole of the $ 2 $ $^{ 1 }A_{ 1 }$ state of carbon monoxide.

Silva-Junior, S. P. A. Sauer, and W. Thiel, J. Chem. Phys., 128, 134110 (2008) ]. We finally see if the SA-MCCI results for these excitation energies can be improved by using MCCIPT 2 with approximate natural orbitals when the PT 2 space is not onerously large.
