40|$|Advances in {{ecological}} stoichiometry, {{a rapidly}} expanding research field investigating the elemental composition of organisms and their environment, have shed {{new light on}} the impacts of climate change on freshwater and marine ecosystems. Current changes in the Earth's climate alter the availability of carbon and nutrients in lakes and oceans. In particular, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will rise to unprecedented levels {{by the end of this}} century, while global warming will enhance stratification of aquatic ecosystems and may thereby diminish the supply of nutrients into the surface layer. These processes enrich phytoplankton with carbon, but suppress nutrient availability. Phytoplankton with a high carbon-to-nutrient content provide poor-quality food for most zooplankton species, which may shift the species composition of zooplankton and higher trophic levels to less nutrient-demanding species. As a consequence, climate-driven changes in <b>plankton</b> <b>stoichiometry</b> may alter the structure and functioning of entire aquatic food webs. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe 3 D {{hydrodynamic}} Model for Applications at Regional Scale (MARS 3 D) was {{coupled with}} a biogeochemical model developed with the Ecological Modular Mechanistic Modelling (Eco 3 M) numerical tool. The three-dimensional coupled model {{was applied to the}} NW Mediterranean Sea to study the dynamics of the key biogeochemical processes in the area in relation with hydrodynamic constraints. In particular, we focused on the temporal and spatial variability of intracellular contents of living and non-living compartments. The conceptual scheme of the biogeochemical model accounts for the complex food web of the NW Mediterranean Sea (34 state variables), using flexible <b>plankton</b> <b>stoichiometry.</b> We used mechanistic formulations to describe most of the biogeochemical processes involved in the dynamics of marine pelagic ecosystems. Simulations covered the period from September 1, 2009 to January 31, 2011 (17 months), which enabled comparison of model outputs with situ measurements made during two oceanographic cruises in the region (Costeau- 4 : April 27 -May 2, 2010 and Costeau- 6 : January 23 -January 27, 2011) ...|$|E
40|$|Differences in {{relative}} availability of nitrate vs. phosphate {{may contribute to}} regional variations in <b>plankton</b> elemental <b>stoichiometry.</b> As {{a representative of the}} globally abundant marine Synechococcus, strain WH 8102 was grown in 16 chemostats up to 52 [*]d at a fixed growth rate with nitrogen–phosphorus ratios (N : Psupply) of 1 – 50. Initially, the phosphate and nitrate concentrations in the vessel decreased when the respective nutrient was limiting. Cell growth generally stabilized, although several chemostats had apparent oscillations in biomass. We observed extensive plasticity in the elemental content and ratios. N : Pcell matched the supply values between N : Psupply 5 and 20. The C : Pcell followed a similar trend. In contrast, the mean C : Ncell was 6. 8 and did not vary as a function of supply ratios. We also observed that induction of alkaline phosphatase, the fraction of P allocated to nucleic acids, and the lipid sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol : phosphatidyglycerol ratio inversely correlated with P availability. Our results suggest that this extensive plasticity in the elemental content and ratios depends both on the external nutrient availability as well as past growth history. Thus, our study provides a quantitative understanding of the regulation of the elemental stoichiometry of an abundant ocean phytoplankton lineage...|$|R
