5000|$|The {{specimen}} chamber sustaining the high-pressure gaseous environment {{is separated from}} the high vacuum of the electron optics column {{with at least two}} small orifices customarily referred to as pressure-limiting apertures (PLA). The gas leaking through the first aperture (PLA1) is quickly removed from the system with a pump that maintains a much lower pressure in the downstream region (i.e. immediately above the aperture). This is called differential pumping. Some gas escapes further from the low pressure region (stage 1) through a second <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> aperture (PLA2) into the vacuum region of the column above, which constitutes a second stage differential pumping (stage 2). A [...] shows the basic ESEM gas pressure stages including the {{specimen chamber}}, intermediate cavity and upper electron optics column. The corresponding pressures achieved are p0>>p1>>p2, which is a sufficient condition for a microscope employing a tungsten type of electron gun. Additional pumping stages may be added to achieve an even higher vacuum as required for a LaB6 and field emission type electron guns. The design and shape of a <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> aperture are critical in obtaining the sharpest possible pressure gradient (transition) through it. This is achieved with an orifice made on a thin plate and tapered in the downstream direction as shown in the accompanying [...] of a gas flowing through the PLA1. This was done with a computer simulation of the gas molecule collisions and movement through space in real time. We can immediately see in the figure of the isodensity contours of gas through aperture that the gas density decreases by about two orders of magnitude over the length of a few aperture radii. This is a quantitatively vivid demonstration of a first principle that enables the separation of the high-pressure specimen chamber from the low pressure and vacuum regions above.|$|E

This addition may act as a “guard” electrode, and by varying its bias independently from the SE electrode, the image contrast can be controlled purposefully. Alternative control electrodes are used such as a mesh between anode and cathode. A multipurpose array of electrodes below and above the specimen and above the <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> aperture of the ESEM has also been described elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The air {{compressor}} {{is driven by}} the engine either by crankshaft pulley via a belt or directly from the engine timing gears. It is lubricated and cooled by the engine lubrication and cooling systems. Compressed air is first routed through a cooling coil and into an air dryer which removes moisture and oil impurities and also may include a pressure regulator, safety valve and smaller purge reservoir. As an alternative to the air dryer, the supply system can be equipped with an anti-freeze device and oil separator. The compressed air is then stored in a reservoir (also called a wet tank) from which it is then distributed via a four way protection valve into the front and rear brake circuit air reservoir, a parking brake reservoir and an auxiliary air supply distribution point. The system also includes various check, <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting,</b> drain and safety valves.|$|E
5000|$|A further {{alternative}} {{that has been}} implemented at the laboratory stage is by {{the application of a}} high bias at the anode but by pickup of the signals from the cathode at floating ground, as shown in the [...] Concentric electrodes (E2, E3, E4) are made on a copper-coated fiberglass printed circuit board (PCB) and a copper wire (E1) is added {{at the center of the}} disk. The anode is made again from the same PCB with a conical hole (400 micrometres) to act as a <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> aperture in the ESEM. The exposed fiberglass material inside the aperture cone together with its surface above are coated with silver paint in continuity with the copper material of the anode electrode (E0), which is held at high potential. The cathode electrodes are independently connected to ground amplifiers, which, in fact, can be biased with low voltage directly from the amplifier power supplies in the range of ±15 volts without any further coupling required. On account of the induction mechanism operating behind the GDD, this configuration is equivalent to the previous diagram, except for the inverted signal that is electronically restored. While electrode E0 is held at 250 V, meaningful imaging is done as shown by a [...] with composition of signals from various electrodes at two pressures of supplied air. All images show part of the central copper wire (E1), exposed fiber-glass (FG, middle), and copper (part of E2) with some silver paint used to attach the wire. The close resemblance of (a) with (b) at low pressure and (c) with (d) at high pressure is a manifestation of the principle of equivalence by induction. The purest SE image is (e) and the purest BSE is (h). Image (f) has prevailing SE characteristics, whilst (g) has a comparable contribution of both SE and BSE. Images (a) and (b) are dominated by SE with some BSE contribution, whilst (c) and (d) have comparable contribution by both SE and BSE.|$|E

Injecting pressurized cold CO 2 into a reservoir will trigger two geomechanically coupled phenomena, hydro- and thermomechanical coupling, which should be taken into account when determining the maximum sustainable <b>pressure</b> <b>limit.</b> In this regard, we briefly introduce poroelastic and thermally induced stresses as cold fluid is injected into a geologic formation.

The suggested equations are tested for a case study in the literature in which the maximum <b>pressure</b> <b>limit</b> was estimated based on complex numerical simulations.

40|$|In this dissertation, an {{analytical}} investigation on active, semi-active and passive vibration control mechanisms {{is presented in}} order to achieve improved shock and vibration isolation of mechanical systems, especially ground vehicle applications. A hybrid active vibration isolation system, incorporating an electro-magnetic force generator along with passive damping and spring elements, is mathematically modeled based on fundamental physical laws and taking into account the generator dynamics. Complete vibration isolation characteristics of the hybrid active control system are evaluated for various feedback variables and control schemes, using numerical simulations. Influence of the force generator dynamics on vibration isolation performance is illustrated through the simulation results. A concept of tunable <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> modulation is proposed in hydraulic damper systems. A hydraulic orifice damper is modified by using the proposed tunable <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> modulation to achieve variable damping in vibration isolation systems, without requiring any external energy source, sophisticated control devices and feedback instrumentation that are essential for active and semi-active isolators. The fluid flow equations are employed to develop the nonlinear mathematical model of the hydraulic damper, incorporating the fluid and mechanical compliance, and the dynamics of the <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> mechanism. The computer simulation reveals that the shock and vibration isolation performance of the tunable pressure limited hydraulic damper systems is comparable to that of the semi-active 'on-off' vibration control systems. A generalized harmonic linearization technique, based on a principle of energy similarity of dynamic elements, is proposed to derive equivalent linear representations of both nonlinear damping and spring elements, in the frequency domain. An analysis of the nonlinear in-plane vehicle model, with air-springs, orifice damping and <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> modulation due to tunable hydraulic shock absorbers, is carried out to establish the stochastic response to random road inputs in terms of power spectral density, and to illustrate the improved vehicle ride performance due to tunable shock absorbers.

The present paper deals with the effects of two additional constraints, namely, a dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>limit</b> and specified final time. Nine different switching structures involving zero-thrust arcs, full-thrust arcs, singular-thrust arcs, and state-constrained arcs are obtained when the value of the dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>limit</b> is varied between zero and infinity and the final time is specified between the minimum possible time within which all of the fuel can be burned and the natural final time that emerges for the problem with final time unspecified.
