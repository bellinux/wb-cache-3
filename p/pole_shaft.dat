3000|$|Variants on the prick image are needle, pin, thistle, hook, horn, bugle (originally {{made from}} the horn of an ox), pencil, and pen. These give rise to {{the metaphor of the}} tailor as the male partner and {{stitching}} for “copulating” in numerous folk songs; and the doctor giving his lover a shot with his needle in many blues songs. Other metaphors are machine, instrument, tool, hammer, poker, pipe, knob, <b>pole,</b> <b>shaft,</b> staff, stand, oar, bone(r), hard, stiff and [get] wood. There is also the once very common yard: Is this male fantasy or a variant of hard? [...]...|$|E
50|$|Mockernut hickory is {{used for}} tool handles {{requiring}} high shock resistance. It {{is used for}} ladder rungs, athletic goods, agricultural implements, dowels, gymnasium apparatus, <b>poles,</b> <b>shafts,</b> well pumps, and furniture. Lower grade lumber is used for pallets, blocking, and so on. Hickory sawdust, chips, and some solid wood are often used by packing companies to smoke meats, and mockernut is the preferred wood for smoking hams. Though mockernut kernels are edible, because of their size they are rarely eaten by humans.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaders are}} all the animals {{in front of the}} wheelers. As they are also in front of the <b>pole</b> or <b>shafts</b> they cannot provide any braking effort.|$|R
2500|$|The {{animals in}} a large team have {{different}} tasks. [...] The wheelers are the pair (or in tandem, the single animal) closest to the vehicle. [...] They provide the main braking effort, slowing the vehicle and controlling it downhill by pulling back on the <b>pole</b> or <b>shafts.</b> [...] The strength of the wheelers is often the limiting factor in determining the maximum safe load for a vehicle [...] while all the animals can pull uphill, only the wheelers can hold the vehicle downhill. [...] For this reason, the strongest pair in a team may be chosen as the wheelers. [...] Wheelers also steer the vehicle by turning the <b>pole</b> or <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|While pole sitting, Kelly {{was said}} to have subsisted mainly on coffee and cigarettes. He learned how to nap while sitting upright, and never was secured by more than a simple leg strap. He once claimed that he doesn't [...] "take as many chances as a window cleaner." [...] Journalist Jay Maeder wrote that [...] "The {{newspapers}} were regularly full of pictures of Shipwreck Kelly, matter-of-factly brushing his teeth and shaving his face, hundreds of feet in the air." [...] He said {{that he was able to}} sleep while pole sitting by putting his thumbs in holes in the <b>pole</b> <b>shafts.</b> If he swayed, the pain in his thumbs would force him to right himself without waking him up.|$|R

50|$|Marathon {{carriage}} {{is a type}} of modern-day carriage that {{is designed}} and used for driving competitions. The carriage is designed to carry a driver and a groom (navigator). The driver drives the horse(s) through the course while the groom counterbalances the carriage on tight turns and helps the driver with direction and upcoming hazards. The carriage consists of four wheels, two to four wheel disk brakes, suspension (either air or spring), a fifth wheel for turning tight corners and either a <b>pole</b> or <b>shaft</b> depending on the number of horses used for the event.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the mace is derived from an ancient battle weapon and the Roman fasces. The {{ceremonial}} mace is 46 inches high and consists of 13 ebony rods - representing the original 13 states of the Union - bound together by silver strands criss-crossed over {{the length of the}} <b>pole.</b> Atop this <b>shaft</b> is a silver globe on which sits an intricately cast solid silver eagle.|$|R
50|$|The Buckeye Manufacturing Company was {{a company}} {{originally}} formed to manufacture horse and buggy parts. It {{was started in}} the later part {{of the nineteenth century}} and by {{the early part of the}} twentieth century was making parts and materials for the Buckeye gasoline buggy automobile as well as for the Union automobile and the Lambert automobile. The company was organized in 1884 in Union City, Ohio, originally under the name of Lambert Brothers and Company. One of the subsidiaries was the Pioneer <b>Pole</b> and <b>Shaft</b> Company, which was run by George A. Lambert, the son of John W. Lambert. Other subsidiaries were the Union Automobile Company, Lambert Automobile Company, and the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company - run by John W. Lambert.|$|R
50|$|Bullock teams also {{dragged the}} heavy logs from some very steep, rough {{country to be}} loaded onto a jinker for hauling to a saw mill. Teams of up to thirty {{bullocks}} hauled large flat-top wagons or jinkers fitted with a single <b>pole</b> instead of <b>shafts.</b> Timber jinkers were of a four-wheel type were capable of carrying large logs up to seven feet in diameter. The less common two wheeled jinkers bore and carried the front of log, leaving the end to trail along behind. Two jinkers could also be connected, with the back jinker linked by a log which would be chained to the front jinker. Jinkers {{were used in the}} transport of “Red Gold,” Australian red cedar (Toona ciliata), and other logs to sawmills or to a river for further transport.|$|R
2500|$|In a {{story told}} by Dominic Charlie in 1965, he related {{about the first}} origins of his people. Their very first {{ancestor}} was a man named X̱i7lánexw , translated as The First One. He {{was born in a}} village near Squamish, British Columbia. [...] X̱i7lánexw [...] did not know that his wife was with child, but he knew that someone or something was coming. He knew of something coming because of a bird that goes ahead of three supernatural men. These three men, called the Transformers, told the Rave, [...] "You go tell everybody we are coming." [...] The first man understand the bird and he responded by getting ready with his canoe. Near the mouth of the Cheakamus River, is a small mountain, and a little bay that fit his canoe. He tied his canoe here and took out his <b>pole,</b> a long <b>shaft</b> used to pull along the river. He put moss around the pole, then placed the pole down. So when the fish touch the pole, their slime was wiped on the moss. He knew that the Transformers were coming further down river. He grabbed the pole and waited for a fish to touch it, then would pull out the pole and see where the salmon touched. He took the slime {{and put it in a}} wooden plate and put his pole down again. Then he heard the three brothers coming. Then the apocalypse came.|$|R
60|$|On Wednesday morning, {{the morning}} of the great St. Leger, it becomes {{apparent}} {{that there has been a}} great influx since yesterday, both of Lunatics and Keepers. The families of the tradesmen over the way are no longer within human ken; their places know them no more; ten, fifteen, and twenty guinea-lodgers fill them. At the pastry-cook's second-floor window, a Keeper is brushing Mr. Thurtell's hair--thinking it his own. In the wax- chandler's attic, another Keeper is putting on Mr. Palmer's braces. In the gunsmith's nursery, a Lunatic is shaving himself. In the serious stationer's best sitting-room, three Lunatics are taking a combination-breakfast, praising the (cook's) devil, and drinking neat brandy in an atmosphere of last midnight's cigars. No family sanctuary is free from our Angelic messengers--we put up at the Angel--who in the guise of extra waiters for the grand Race-Week, rattle in and out of the most secret chambers of everybody's house, with dishes and tin covers, decanters, soda-water bottles, and glasses. An hour later. Down the street and up the street, as far as eyes can see and a good deal farther, there is a dense crowd; outside the Betting Rooms it is like a great struggle at a theatre door--in the days of theatres; or at the vestibule of the Spurgeon temple--in the days of Spurgeon. An hour later. Fusing into this crowd, and somehow getting through it, are all kinds of conveyances, and all kinds of foot-passengers; carts, with brick- makers and brick-makeresses jolting up and down on planks; drags, with the needful grooms behind, sitting cross-armed in the needful manner, and slanting themselves backward from the soles of their boots at the needful angle; postboys, in the shining hats and smart jackets of the olden time, when stokers were not; beautiful Yorkshire horses, gallantly driven by their own breeders and masters. Under every <b>pole,</b> and every <b>shaft,</b> and every horse, and every wheel as it would seem, the Gong-donkey--metallically braying, when not struggling for life, or whipped out of the way.|$|R
