40|$|ABSTRACT Tests {{of visual}} {{reproduction}} {{are used to}} assess visual memory. However, when the test is based on geometrical elements results could be influenced by schooling. Objective: To evaluate the influence of different schooling levels on performance of a visual reproduction task. Methods: A sample of 253 individuals (66 male and 187 female), aged 60 to 92 years were evaluated on a visual reproduction task comprising three geometric pictures of increasing complexity. Each individual was shown a picture for 8 to 10 seconds and a drawing of it was then immediately elicited. Four groups were defined according to the following schooling levels: illiterate, 1 to 4 years, 5 to 8 years and over 8 years. Individual performance was measured by summing the items correctly reproduced for the three pictures. Results: A significant difference for age {{was found between the}} illiterate and other three schooling groups. The reproduction of picture one was better reproduced than pictures 2 and 3 for all schooling levels (p< 0. 001). Pictures 2 and 3 did not differ among the schooling levels. <b>Picture</b> <b>reproduction</b> among the schooling levels showed that the group with over 8 years of schooling performed better on pictures 1 and 2 (p< 0. 001) but not on picture 3.

40|$|In {{most recent}} couple of decades, image {{processing}} specialists {{has been using}} image mosaicing as a testing field in real time applications. It has wide utilization in the 3 D <b>picture</b> <b>reproduction,</b> field of satellite imaging, computer vision fields and a few therapeutic fields also. Movement recognition & tracking, mosaic-based localisation, resolution enhancement, generating substantial FOV, augmented reality, and so forth are also some of its application fields. In this exploration work, feature based image mosaicing procedure has been proposed. There are five essential steps in feature based procedures: feature extraction, feature matching, transformation model estimation, image re-sampling and transformation, and image blending. The achievement of image mosaicing can be accounted by the feature identification algorithms such as Harris corner detector, SURF, FAST and FREAK. But each of these algorithms has their own particular impediments and preferences {{as indicated by the}} applications concerned. The proposed strategy first compares the above mentioned four feature extraction algorithm on the basis of accuracy and computational time and determines FREAK to be the most optimum one and then utilizes this FREAK descriptor algorithm for feature detection. All the distinctive features detected in an image and the feature descriptors are shaped around the corners. Matching between the feature descriptors from both the images is done to achieve best closeness and all the features other than the ones with higher degree of resemblance are rejected. Now, the features with higher degree of resemblance are used for computing the transformation model and correspondingly, the warping of the image is done. The warping of the picture is done on a typical mosaic plane after estimation. The removal of the intensity seam in the neighbourhood of the boundary of the images and to modify the image grey levels at the junction joint to obtain a smooth transition between the images is the final step. Alpha blending technique is utilized for the purpose of image blendin...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes the analysis, design and implementation of a high performance DSP-based servo drive for a limited-angle torque motor used in thermal imaging applications. A limited-angle torque motor is an electromagnetic actuator based on the Laws' relay principle, and in the present application the rotation required was from - 10 ° to + 10 ° in 16 ms, with a flyback period of 4 ms. To ensure good quality <b>picture</b> <b>reproduction,</b> an exceptionally high linearity of ± 0. 02 ° was necessary throughout the forward sweep. In addition, the drive voltage to the exciting winding of the motor should be less than the + 35 V ceiling of the drive amplifier. A research survey shows that little literature was available, {{probably due to the}} commercial sensitivity of many of the applications for torque motors. A detailed mathematical model of the motor drive, including high-order linear dynamics and the significant nonlinear characteristics, was developed to provide an insight into the overall system behaviour. The proposed control scheme uses a multicompensator, multi-loop linear controller, to reshape substantially the motor response characteristic, with a non-linear adaptive gain-scheduled controller to compensate effectively for the nonlinear variations of the motor parameters. The scheme demonstrates that a demanding nonlinear control system may be conveniently analysed and synthesised using frequency-domain methods, and that the design techniques may be reliably applied to similar electro-mechanical systems required to track a repetitive waveform. A prototype drive system was designed, constructed and tested {{during the course of the}} research. The drive system comprises a DSP-based digital controller, a linear power amplifier and the feedback signal conditioning circuit necessary for the closed-loop control. A switch-mode amplifier was also built, evaluated and compared with the linear amplifier. It was shown that the overall performance of the linear amplifier was superior to that of the switch-mode amplifier for the present application. The control software was developed using the structured programming method, with the continuous controller converted to digital form using the bilinear transform. The 6 - operator was used rather than the z-operator, since it is more advantageous for high speed sampling systems. The gain-scheduled control was implemented by developing a schedule table, which is controlled by the DSP program to update continuously the controller parameters in synchronism with the periodic scanning of the motor. The experimental results show excellent agreement with the simulated results, with linearity of ± 0. 05 ° achieved throughout the forward sweep. Although this did not quite meet the very demanding specifications due to the limitations of the experimental drive system, it clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The discrepancies between simulated and experimental results are analyzed and discussed, the control design method is reviewed, and detailed suggestions are presented for further work which may improve the drive performance...|$|E
