5|$|D. On August 15, 2008, the International Olympic Committee {{announced}} North Korean shooter Kim Jong-su {{had tested}} positive for the banned substance propranolol and was stripped of his two medals. He had won a bronze medal in the 10 metre air <b>pistol</b> and silver in the 50 metre <b>pistol.</b> After Kim Jong-su was disqualified, the bronze medal in the 10 metre air <b>pistol</b> went to Jason Turner of the United States; in the 50 metre <b>pistol,</b> the silver medal went to Tan Zongliang of China, and the bronze medal to Vladimir Isakov of Russia.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated <b>pistol</b> first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his <b>pistol</b> first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his <b>pistol</b> to continue firing.|$|E

50|$|Pairs of duelling <b>pistols</b> can {{be easily}} {{confused}} with holster <b>pistols</b> and traveling <b>pistols.</b> These types are similar to duelling <b>pistols</b> {{in that they are}} large, muzzle-loading weapons, that were often expensively made and came in matched, cased pairs with a set of accessories. Traveling <b>pistols,</b> also known as overcoat <b>pistols,</b> were intended for use by travelers to protect themselves from highwaymen and footpads; unlike dueling <b>pistols,</b> they were commonly rifled. Holster <b>pistols</b> were carried in pairs in a leather holster slung across a horse's saddle. Although best suited for military use, they were often owned by civilians. Although their purpose was self-defense, holster <b>pistols</b> were used on occasion to fight duels.|$|R

5|$|The Enfield-designed <b>pistol</b> {{was quickly}} {{accepted}} under the designation <b>Pistol,</b> Revolver, No. 2 Mk I, and was adopted in 1932, followed in 1938 by the Mk I* (spurless hammer, double action only), {{and finally the}} Mk I** (simplified for wartime production) in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Walsh got {{his start}} with {{firearms}} shooting clothespins off of his aunt's laundry line. In 1935 he joined the FBI <b>pistol</b> team. Within three years of joining the FBI, he had been presented with two marksmanship trophies from director J. Edgar Hoover. In 1939, at Camp Ritchie, he set the world record in <b>pistol</b> shooting with 198 points {{out of a possible}} 200 and won the individual eastern regional <b>pistol</b> championships in 1939 and 1940 and placing second in 1941 after leading for most of the tournament. He placed 12th in the Men's Free <b>Pistol,</b> 50 metres competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, England. At the 1952 ISSF World Shooting Championships, he won a gold medal with the United States team in the 25 m Center-Fire <b>Pistol</b> event and a silver in the individual version of that event. After winning many tournaments within the United States Marine Corps, he became commander of their marksmanship training, a position that he held for many years, until he retired in the 1970s. In total, he was selected five times for the All-American <b>Pistol</b> Shooting Team.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} ISSF events, the target for air <b>pistol</b> was reduced in size in 1989, also {{lowering}} the scores (although not by much), and thereby resetting all records. The development after this shows a contrast to that of air rifle shooting: whereas in air rifle the winning score of the 1989 World Championships would not have reached the final 17 years later, the same result increase has not occurred in air <b>pistol,</b> and Sergei Pyzhianov's world record of 593 points, set in the first World Cup Final with the new targets, remained unbeaten for almost 20 years.|$|E
50|$|Typically service <b>pistols</b> are revolvers or {{semi-automatic}} <b>pistols</b> {{issued to}} officers, non-commissioned officers, and rear-echelon support personnel for self defense, though service <b>pistols</b> {{may also be}} issued to special forces as a backup for their primary weapons. <b>Pistols</b> are not typically issued to front-line infantry.|$|R

The P99Q has also been ordered by the police forces of Hamburg (8,000 <b>pistols),</b> Bremen (2,000 <b>pistols)</b> and Schleswig-Holstein (8,000 <b>pistols)</b> with deliveries between 2009 and 2017.|$|R
50|$|Dave Goodman and Kim Thraves owned a {{rehearsal}} studio with 4-track recording facilities where the Sex <b>Pistols</b> recorded some early demos. Goodman owned a PA system {{and became the}} Sex <b>Pistols</b> regular live sound engineer until 1977. Goodman produced the recordings that formed the Spunk album. Goodman's collection of very poor live sound recordings of the Sex <b>Pistols</b> have been released as Live Worldwide (Konexion Records, Belgium) and other titles. Some of these titles contain live Sex <b>Pistols</b> recordings interspersed with recordings of the Ex <b>Pistols</b> making it appear that these tracks were performed by the Sex <b>Pistols.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{in other}} ISSF <b>pistol</b> events, special {{supportive}} clothing and shoes are not permitted. Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the <b>pistol,</b> which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their usefulness in shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E
5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the <b>pistol</b> supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his <b>pistol</b> at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his <b>pistol.</b> As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his <b>pistol</b> and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a <b>pistol</b> out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E

Goebel later told newspapers that he spent the hours trying to build a rapport with Demeke, who admitted to having spent several months planning the hijacking.

5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of collateral damage than conventional <b>pistol</b> bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional <b>pistol</b> bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd). This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not conversely considered to be disadvantageous.|$|E
5|$|The {{handheld}} personal defense weapon (<b>pistol)</b> was {{to weigh}} less than 1kg (2.2lb), although a weight of 700g (1.5lb) was deemed desirable; {{it was to}} have a magazine capacity of at least 20 rounds.|$|E

In the first round, Daniel scored 98 points; in the second round, 95; in the third, 92; in the fourth, 94; in the fifth, 96; and the sixth and final, 96. Daniel tied four other athletes for the third greatest number of points in the first round, and received least number of points in the third round of any participating athlete. Overall, during the August 9 course of events, Daniel earned 571points, ranking 37th out of the 49 participating athletes.
