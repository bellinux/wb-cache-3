30|$|Under complex roof conditions, the {{function}} of rock bolt <b>pretension</b> was greatly emphasized in the United States (Song and Stankus 1997).

At present, the bolt <b>pretension</b> used in American coal mines is generally 100  kN, accounting for 50  %– 70  % of the bolt yield load.

40|$|Purpose Graft <b>pretensioning</b> {{is used in}} {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction to prevent secondary slackening. Its effects on collagen fibrillar ultrastructure are not known. In this study, we hypothesized that graft <b>pretensioning</b> in ACL reconstruction creates ultrastructural changes detectable in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Methods A prospective comparative study was carried out on 38 ACL reconstructions using a 4 -strand semitendinosus graft. Samples were harvested intra-operatively before and after <b>pretensioning</b> for 30 s, 2 or 5 min. The images produced in SEM were analyzed using an original semi-quantitative «CIP» score taking into account collagen cohesion, integrity, and parallelism. Intra- and inter-tester reliability for the CIP score were tested. Results The CIP scores decreased by 3. 5 (1. 6) points after <b>pretensioning</b> (P < 0. 05). Significant {{differences were found in}} the 5, 2 min and 30 s subgroups for the global CIP score. Relative decrease (Delta CIP) was significantly higher in the 2 and 5 min subgroups after <b>pretensioning</b> in comparison with the 30 s subgroups. Intra- and inter-tester reliability for the CIP score were 0. 85 and 0. 92 (P < 0. 05). Conclusion <b>Pretensioning</b> ACL grafts resulted in alteration of the collagen fibrillar ultrastructure, detectable using SEM.

40|$|Abstract. Under {{the acid}} rain {{corrosion}} condition, the shear-bearing {{capacity of the}} <b>pretension</b> prestressed concrete beam will attenuate gradually with the stirrup corrosion and concrete deteriorate.

40|$|Recent {{deterioration}} of prestressed concrete bridge beams in New Zealand {{and around the}} world highlights an escalating problem. 1 – 3 Corrosion of <b>pretensioned</b> reinforcement is especially critical because of the highly stressed nature of these structures; a small amount of corrosion of a <b>pretensioned</b> strand results in a considerable reduction in the structural capacity of the member. The Tiwai Point Bridge is located in a highly aggressive coastal environment in the South Island of New Zealand. The structure was opened to traffic in 1969 and replaced in 2009 – 2010 because of severe corrosion of the <b>pretensioned</b> reinforcement. Nineteen of the 42 -year-old beams were set aside as test specimens for a destructive and nondestructive testing program. This paper forms part of a larger study that aims to develop a methodology for nondestructive assessment of the resid-ual strength of beams that have experienced corrosion of <b>pretensioned</b> reinforcement.

30|$|Rock bolting in Chinese {{coal mines}} {{has gone through}} a process from low strength, high strength, to high <b>pretension</b> and extra high strength.

The bolting theory with high <b>pretension</b> and extra high strength was proposed, which emphasizes the decisive roles of bolt <b>pretension</b> and its spreading into rocks. The bolting system with high <b>pretension</b> and extra high strength can reinforce complex roadways once for all.

40|$|Bolted {{connections}} are generally used to reversibly join two thick-walled components made of fibre reinforced plastics. Fields of application {{for many decades}} by now are multi-stage rockets for transportation of satellites, connection of aircraft wing and fuselage, or the root connection of rotor blades of wind turbines. Due to their anisotropic material properties, bolted connections of composite structures are significantly {{more sensitive to the}} failure mode bearing. Especially when high static and cyclic loads are to be transferred this sensibility leads to an increase in material mass and costs, because the wall-thickness at the connection has to be increased to reduce the stresses. It is state of the art to axially <b>pretension</b> a bolt by means of a bolt head and a nut to increase the load-transfer capacity of the joint. A novel connection concept is to apply a radial <b>pretension</b> between the hole and the bolt by means of clamping bushes. This concept principle is similar to shrink-fit joints of metallic components. The clamping bushes are used to expand the borehole to a defined diameter and thereby create a radial <b>pretension.</b> The diameter-related tolerance between bolt and borehole thereby is completely compensated, which lowers the requirement for drilling or milling the borehole to an exact diameter. The radial <b>pretension</b> can be combined with an axial <b>pretension</b> or an axial support of the composite structure’s borehole. Finite element calculations and first experiments show, that a radial <b>pretension</b> significantly increases the fatigue bearing strength of structures made of glass-fibre reinforced plastic. Axial <b>pretension</b> mainly increases the static bearing strength. A combination of radial and axial <b>pretension</b> has not been tested yet, but is supposed to both increase static and fatigue bearing strength. For further investigation of this concept the following parameters will be investigated in detail: level of <b>pretension,</b> choice of material (glass and carbon fibre, different layups) and design of small, simple and strong clamping bushes...|$|R
30|$|Previous {{experimental}} studies reported that bolt <b>pretensioning</b> greatly increases the initial stiffness and load-carrying capacity of bolted joints. It {{is also a}} matter of great importance to structural designers to understand the effect of <b>pretension</b> on the load-carrying capacities of bolted joints, and this study presents an extended yield model that considers the fastener’s <b>pretension</b> force. In the extended yield model, the load-carrying capacity {{was defined as the}} load at a slip of 15 mm. The ultimate fastener bending angle at the yielded cross section equivalent to this joint slip, which was affected by the fastener’s axial force, was iteratively evaluated in numerical analyses. The introduction of bolt <b>pretensioning</b> largely increased the joint slip resistance at initial loading, but it decreased the ultimate fastener bending angle. This decrease of fastener bending angle resulted in a relatively low stiffness hardening (or secondary stiffness), which is caused by secondary axial forces associated with embedment of steel plates into the wood member. Prediction was verified by the tests of 36 steel-to-timber joints under three different <b>pretension</b> forces and two loading directions relative to the grain. Some of the observed load-carrying capacities of the joints, particularly in loading perpendicular to the grain, however, were not as high as those expected by the numerical analyses considering the given <b>pretension</b> forces.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{prestressing}} {{forces in}} prestressed tendons undergo {{a process of}} reduction {{over a period of}} time. A common assumption is that prestress loss is constantly distributed throughout the span of a simply supported <b>pretensioned</b> concrete beam. The purpose of this work is to investigate the accuracy of this assumption. The types of prestressed concrete beams investigated in this work include the following three typical types of tendon profile: (I) straight strands, (II) single-point depressed, and (III) two-point depressed. The major findings derived from this work are: (1) The total prestress loss is not constantly distributed throughout the span of a simply supported <b>pretensioned</b> concrete beam with any of the three types of tendon profiles, (2) The variation of prestress loss along the span of a <b>pretensioned</b> beam caused by elastic shortening of concrete or creep of concrete is much more significant than that caused by shrinkage of concrete or relaxation of tendons, and (3) The type of tendon profile in a simply supported <b>pretensioned</b> concrete beam has significant effects on the pattern of prestress loss distribution along the beam...|$|E

40|$|High Strength Concrete (HSC) {{is defined}} as a {{concrete}} with a 28 -day characteristic compressive strength of 50 MPa or more. This paper presents the results of an experimental study on <b>pretensioned</b> beams made of HSC with characteristic compressive strengths at 28 days of 55, 75, 85 and 105 MPa and compares with Normal Strength Concrete (NSC) <b>pretensioned</b> beams (in this case 35 MPa concrete). Nine, fully prestressed concrete beams having 8 mm diameter plain steel wire or 7. 9 mm diameter 7 -wire steel strand with stirrups at both ends (to one third of the span) were constructed and tested. The experimental results were compared with the theoretical calculations according to the current Codes of Practice, such as ACI- 3 18 and AS 3600. The curvature of <b>pretensioned</b> beams tested decreased with increasing concrete strengths from 55 to 105 MPa over the entire loading range from service to ultimate load. The final failure of the beams in all cases occurred by yielding of tendons and conventional reinforcements followed by crushing of the concrete in the constant moment region. The beam reached large curvatures prior to failure and hence appeared to be ductile enough in terms of rotation. However, a comprehensive evaluation of ductility of these beams is still required. With this in mind, the ductility indices, currently used for reinforced and prestressed concrete beams are reviewed and an index based on moment of resistance, total energy and elastic energy, suitable for <b>pretensioned</b> beams is presented. <b>Pretensioned</b> beams made of HSC up to 105 MPa are sufficiently ductile in terms of large deformations, rotations and total energy.

During the fire which approximated the ISO 834 temperature curve, temperatures were recorded inside the building and the elements. Most of the elements only suffered from limited spalling, except the <b>pretensioned</b> girder for which spalling depths up to 8 cm were noticed, resulting in naked prestressing strands and penetrations through the web. After the fire, the precast elements were visually inspected for spalling and submitted to a loading test up to failure. For a small <b>pretensioned</b> beam, the bearing resistance is calculated based on the residual material properties obtained from drilled cores and by taking into account the reduction in cross-section due to spalling. Additionally, the resisting bending moment is calculated based on the 500 °C isotherm method. An adequate agreement is found between the experimental and calculated results...|$|E
