5|$|Icke met {{his first}} wife, Linda Atherton, in May 1971 at a {{dance at the}} Chesford Grange Hotel near Leamington Spa; she {{was working as a}} van driver for a garage. Shortly after they met, Icke had another of the huge rows he had started having with his father—always a domineering man, his father was upset that Icke's {{arthritis}} was interfering with his football career—so he <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> bags and left home. He moved into a bedsit and worked in a travel agency, travelling to Hereford twice a week in the evenings to play football.|$|E
5|$|On the Red Sox Opening Day roster for {{the first}} time in his career in 2005, Youkilis found himself on the way back down to Pawtucket on April 13 as the team needed to {{activate}} Curt Schilling, and Youkilis happened to still have minor league options; but told that he would be back, Youkilis decided to keep his Boston apartment and commute to Pawtucket. Up and down all season as the Red Sox made use of his options, he got a call-up—prompted by Bill Mueller having back spasms in batting practice—one August day as he was in Pawtucket's clubhouse before a game. Without changing out of the same white pants that he wore for both Boston and Pawtucket home games, he <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> car, drove the 40 miles to Boston, walked into the Red Sox clubhouse, changed his jersey and cleats, and was ready to play.|$|E
25|$|The palace persuaded Marshal Plaek {{to appoint}} Khuang Aphaiwong as figurehead {{civilian}} Prime Minister. In subsequent elections on January 29, 1948, the Democrats won the majority {{for the first}} time, and reappointed Khuang as Premier. Khuang <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> cabinet with palace allies, much {{to the consternation of}} the military. The military later, claiming that they were supporters of constitutional monarchy, demanded that Khuang resign. Marshal Plaek replaced Khuang as Prime Minister.|$|E

While incubating a desire to move there the fifteen-year-old Stewart was prevailed upon by Lamb to gain some business experience by earning money as a grocer in Belfast. Quickly wearying of the work, Stewart <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> bags in the spring of 1818 and left for New York with the $500 he had earned as a bag boy.|$|E
25|$|Newkirk {{helped her}} mother {{out in the}} leper colony—packing pills and rolling bandages, {{stuffing}} toys for orphans, and feeding strays—and says that this informed her view that anyone in need, including animals, was worthy of concern, along with her mother's advice that it doesn't matter who suffers, but how. She {{tells the story of}} an early experience of trying to rescue an animal, when she heard laughter in the alleyway behind the family home in New Delhi. A group of people had bound a dog's legs, muzzled him, then lowered him into a muddy ditch, laughing as they watched him try to escape. Newkirk asked her servant to bring the dog to her, and {{tried to get him to}} drink some water, but someone had <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> throat with mud, and he died in her arms. She told the Financial Times that it was a turning point.|$|E
25|$|Simpson's initial {{claim that}} he was asleep {{at the time of}} the murders was refuted by several {{different}} accounts. According to defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential alibi witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's Spanish-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house {{at the time of the}} murders. But Lopez's testimony, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense cross-examination by Clark, when Lopez was forced to admit that she could not be sure of the precise time she saw Simpson's white Bronco outside his house.|$|E

25|$|Having {{rolled up}} his tent and <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> luggage, Whymper wished to hasten to Zermatt {{to attempt to}} reach the summit from that side, but he could find no porters. A young Englishman arrived with a guide. Whymper made himself known to him, and learnt that he was Lord Francis Douglas, who had lately ascended the Ober Gabelhorn; he told him the whole story, and confided his plans to him. Douglas, declaring himself in his turn most anxious to ascend the Matterhorn, agreed to give him his porter, and {{on the morning of}} the 12th they started {{together}} for the Theodul pass. They descended to Zermatt, sought and engaged Peter Taugwalder, and gave him permission to choose another guide. When they returned to the Monte Rosa Hotel, they encountered Michel Croz who had been hired by Charles Hudson. They had come to Zermatt with the same intention, to attempt to ascend the Matterhorn. Hudson and his friend Douglas Hadow decided to join Whymper and Douglas and that same evening everything was settled; they were to start immediately, the very next day.|$|E
25|$|Taishi Ci <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> {{equipment}} {{and had a}} full meal. At dawn, he brought his bow and a quiver of arrows with him, and rode out of the fortress. He was accompanied by two riders, each carrying a target stand for archery practice. When the rebels saw Taishi Ci {{coming out of the}} fortress, they immediately readied themselves for battle. To their surprise, Taishi Ci took the two stands, placed them in the ditch around the fortress, fired some arrows at them, and then returned to the fortress. The following day, he repeated the entire process. Some of the rebels stood up and prepared for battle upon seeing him, while others ignored him and remained relaxed. On the third day, when Taishi Ci came out again, the rebels thought {{that he was going to}} practise archery again, so they paid no attention to him. Taishi Ci then seized the opportunity to break out of the siege. By the time the rebels realised what was going on, Taishi Ci had already escaped and killed several rebels along the way. None of them dared to pursue him.|$|E
500|$|Wood changed clothes, <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> bags, {{and left}} the house shortly afterwards, leaving the weapon he used, an [...]38 Enfield revolver, {{in the kitchen with}} one live round left. The police went to the mansion on the evening of 22 September 1986 after {{receiving}} a telephone call from Wood; finding all the doors and windows locked, they broke down the door. [...] Christopher was rushed to Sheffield Children's Hospital with severe head injuries and was placed on life support after surviving without medical attention for 21 hours.|$|E

500|$|Early in August, FitzRoy {{discussed}} this position with Beaufort, {{who had a}} scientific network of friends at the University of Cambridge. At Beaufort's request, mathematics lecturer George Peacock wrote from London to Professor John Stevens Henslow about this [...] "rare opportunity for a naturalist", saying that an [...] "offer {{has been made to}} me to recommend a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition", and suggesting the Reverend Leonard Jenyns. Though Jenyns nearly accepted, and even <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> clothes, he had concerns about his obligations as vicar of Swaffham Bulbeck and his health, so declined. Henslow briefly thought of going, but his wife [...] "looked so miserable" [...] that he quickly dropped the idea. Both recommended the 22-year-old Charles Darwin who had just completed the ordinary Bachelor of Arts degree which was a prerequisite for his intended career as a parson, and was on a geology field trip with Adam Sedgwick.|$|E

[...] After obtaining permission {{to stay in the}} temple, the young Seongcheol started to meditate intensively. [...] Later in life, he would say that he attained the state of Dongjeong Ilyeo (see Teachings below, Hangul: 동정일여, Hanja: 動靜一如) at this early point in his life in only forty-two days.|$|E

2500|$|From July 1866 to November 1871 {{he was at}} North Camp at Aldershot, {{first as}} brigade major then as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General. Having just written to propose to his future wife, he read in 1867 that “General Napier” was to lead an {{expedition}} to Abyssinia; he <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> bags and went to London to volunteer, but then learnt {{that this was not}} to be William Napier, but General Robert Napier, whom he did not know and who was unlikely to grant him a staff position. [...] With a young family to support but not hopeful of getting a staff position, Wood also studied law, enrolling at the Middle Temple on 30 April 1870.|$|E
2500|$|Another popular Murphy story {{involved}} Stephen Chase, {{a leading}} sprinter from Dartmouth. Chase {{was sent to}} work with Murphy at Travers Island in 1895 {{in preparation for the}} International Games with England's best athletes. At the evening meal, Chase was disappointed to discover that pie was not to be served at the camp, <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> bags, and placed them on a bus headed to the train station. Realizing that the consumption of pie was part of the training regimen that led Chase to set a world record, Murphy ran to the kitchen, got a large cut of apple pie, and ran down the roadway with [...] "a piece of pie deftly balanced on a plate, all the time calling, 'Here it is Chase. I got it for you.'" [...] According to the story, Chase came back [...] "and was a world beater, and on pie, too." ...|$|E

[...] Baldwin was the better placed rider in the overall, 3:19 down on race leader Janier Acevedo (...) , and became the virtual leader at one point as the gap culminated to 3:30. Stemper won the first intermediate sprint in Santa Paula, as Baldwin was first to cross {{the line of the}} Category 4 Dennison Grade and at the intermediate sprint after the descent in Ojai. The 21-year-old Brown was aggressive on the last climb of the day, breaking away to take maximum points, and the group reformed on the descent.|$|E

2500|$|The Associated Press dubbed Lavy a survivalist; {{his family}} denied {{he had any}} such leanings. CQ Press claimed that Lavy was an alleged white supremacist, based on {{unsubstantiated}} reports that [...] "Neo-Nazi" [...] literature may {{have been found in}} his vehicle. In the 1970s, Lavy worked as a radio repairman for Motorola in Oklahoma City. He also lived in Troy, Missouri before taking a job as an electrician for an oil company on the Alyeska Pipeline in Valdez, Alaska. In the autumn of 1992, he visited his sister Betty Krieg and her husband Bill in Harvester, Missouri, and told them that he hoped to retire and purchase a small property where he could raise chickens and tend a garden. Several months later, he announced that he had found the perfect place, a cottage on six acres of land in Onia, Arkansas. Lavy <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> belongings for the move south in April 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Thanks to {{his army}} {{upbringing}} Barrington was very neat in his dress and carefully ironed and <b>packed</b> <b>his</b> clothes, and took great {{care of his}} cricket equipment. While waiting to bat he would watch the play or prowl the dressing room with a cigarette and would reflect with another cigarette after his dismissal. He rarely drank and preferred to retire early, especially on nights preceded match days. He was brought into cricket when social class and the hierarchy between amateur and professional was still the norm and retained some degree of politeness to his superiors, even {{at the end of}} his career. At home he could ill afford to hire mechanics or decorators and as a result become an accomplished car-repairman for his friends and colleagues, his own car was always kept spotless and in perfect working order, and was a keen DIY man. He was always careful with his money and frequently called up the management of a hotel if the room was not up to standard and argued if they charged too much. Barrington was a well known sayer of malapropisms such as; [...] "If you pitch it there you put the batsman in two-mans land", [...] "That was good bowling in anyone's cup of tea", [...] "The press went through the food like a swarm of lotuses" [...] and [...] "high-philosophy bullets".|$|E
