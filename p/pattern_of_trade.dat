50|$|Empirical {{models that}} attempt to {{estimate}} the public investment and economic growth link involve a wide variety including: the Cobb-Douglas production function; a behavioral approach cost/profit function which includes public capital stock; Vector Auto Regression (VAR) models; and government investment growth regressions. These models nonetheless contend with reverse causality, heterogeneity, endogeneity, and nonlinearities in trying to capture the public capital and economic growth link. New Keynesian models, though, analyze the effect of government spending through the supply side rather than traditional Keynesian models that analyzes it through the demand side. Therefore, a temporary surge of infrastructure investment yields an expansion of output, and vice versa that dwindling infrastructure, like in the 1970s, hamper longer-term movement in productivity. Furthermore, new research on regional growth (as opposed to national growth with GDP) shows a strong positive relationship between public capital and productivity. Both fixed costs and transport costs lower with expanded infrastructure in localities and the resulting cluster of industries. As a result, economic activity grows along its <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> Therefore, the importance of regional clusters and metropolitan economies comes into effect.|$|E

Using {{formulae}} for orbital variations developed by Urbain Le Verrier (which had led {{to the discovery of}} Neptune), Croll developed a theory of the effects of variations of the Earth's orbit on climate cycles. His idea was that decreases in winter sunlight would favour snow accumulation, {{and for the first time}} coupled this to the idea of a positive ice-albedo feedback to amplify the solar variations. Croll further argued that the accumulation of snow would change the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> winds, leading to the deflection of warming currents like the Gulf Stream, and finally a self-sustaining ice age. He suggested that when orbital eccentricity is high, then winters will tend to be colder when the Earth is farther from the sun in that season and hence, that during periods of high orbital eccentricity, ice ages occur on 22,000-year cycles in each hemisphere, and alternate between southern and northern hemispheres, lasting approximately 10,000 years each.|$|E

50|$|China's <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> with Mozambique {{differs from}} that with their major trading {{partners}} on the African continent, such as Angola, Nigeria, and Sudan. China mainly imports agricultural and fisheries products from Mozambique, but few raw materials, while exporting manufactured goods and machinery. Between 2004 and 2006, bilateral trade tripled in value from US$70 million to US$210 million, making China one of Mozambique's three largest trading partners, behind South Africa and Portugal. China has also become a major buyer of Mozambican timber; despite local regulations forbidding the export of unprocessed logs, which aim to force foreign countries hoping {{to gain access to}} Mozambican resources to invest in setting up processing facilities in the country, many logs are exported illegally. Chinese businessmen are not typically involved in the actual practise of logging; instead, it is performed mainly by locals, who then bring the logs to buyers in port cities. China has also become an increasingly important player in Mozambique's construction industry; over one-third of Mozambique's new road construction is now carried out by Chinese contractors. Contractors from other countries, who have been losing out on business due to their higher costs, complain that the Chinese contractors make no effort to transfer skills or technology to locals, and do not make use of local or regional labour subcontractors, instead preferring to import and manage their own workers. However, Chinese-run construction sites are better-organised and have a lower rate of pilferage. In the first 10 months of 2012, the value of trade was US$1.1 billion, with Mozambique being the 23rd largest trading partner of China.|$|E

As Goetzmann et al. (2002) show, these strategies have the unfortunate attribute that they can expose the fund investor to significant downside risk. Weisman (2002) uses the term “informationless investing” to describe this behavior, and argues that these strategies are “peculiar to the asset management industry in general, and the hedge fund industry in particular” and that these strategies “can produce the appearance of return enhancement without necessarily providing any value to an investor. ” We devise a simple procedure {{to determine whether a}} given <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> is consistent with informationless investing and apply it to a unique database of daily transactions and holdings of a set of forty successful Australian equity managers.
