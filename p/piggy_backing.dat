40|$|Mobile {{devices are}} the {{building}} blocks of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). They are typically characterized by limited resources, high mobility, transient availability, and lack of direct access to the data source (server). In MANET environments, data caching is essential because it increases the ability of mobile devices to access desired data, and improve overall system performance. In this paper client data cache invalidation mechanism is proposed, it is a client-based cache consistency scheme that is implemented {{on the top of a}} previously proposed architecture for caching data items in MANETs, namely cooperative and adaptive caching system (COACS) [16]. It is a special node that cache the queries and the address of the nodes that store the responses to these queries. Previously a server-based consistency scheme i. e., smart server update mechanism (SSUM) was proposed which is server based, where as in this paper client data cache invalidation mechanism is proposed that is totally client-based. Client data cache invalidation mechanism is a pull-based algorithm that implements adoptive time to live (TTL), <b>piggy</b> <b>backing,</b> and pre-fetching, and provides near strong consistency capabilities, client data cache invalidation mechanism is analyzed to assess the delay and bandwidth gains (or costs) when compared to polling every time and push-based scheme...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Human motion {{indexing}} and retrieval {{is important}} for animators due {{to the need to}} search the databases for motions which can suitably be blended and concatenated. Most of the previous researches of human motion indexing and retrieval compute the Euclidean distance of joint angles or joint positions. Such approaches are difficult to apply for cases in which multiple characters are closely interacting with each other, as the relationships of the characters are not encoded in the representation. In this research, we propose a topology-based approach to index the motions of two human characters in close contact. We compute and encode how the two bodies are tangled based on the concept of rational tangles. The encoded relationships, which we define as TangleList, are used to determine the similarity of the pairs of postures. Using our method, we can index and retrieve motions such as one person <b>piggy</b> <b>backing</b> another, one person assisting another in walking, and two persons dancing/wrestling. Our method is useful to manage a motion database of multiple characters. We can also produce motion graph structures of two characters closely interacting with each other by interpolating and concatenating topologically similar postures and motion clips, which are applicable to 3 D computer games and computer animation.

40|$|Mental {{disorders}} in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC) do not attract global health policy attention. This {{article is based}} on a selective review of research on mental {{disorders in}} adults in LAMIC since 2001 and recent analyses of disease burden in developing countries. Mental disorders account for 11. 1 % of the total burden of disease in LAMIC. Unipolar depressive disorder is the single leading neuropsychiatric cause of disease burden. Alcohol use disorders account for nearly 4 % of the attributable disease burden in LAMIC. Mental disorders are closely associated with other public health concerns such as maternal and child health and HIV/AIDS. Poverty, low education, social exclusion, gender disadvantage, conflict and disasters are the major social determinants of mental disorders. Clinical trials demonstrate that locally available, affordable interventions in community and primary care settings are effective for the management of mental disorders. Mental health resources are very scarce and investment in mental health is, 1 % of the health budget in many countries. The majority of people with mental disorders do not receive evidence-based care, leading to chronicity, suffering and increased costs of care. Strengthening care and services for people with mental disorders is a priority; this will need additional investment in human resources and <b>piggy</b> <b>backing</b> on existing public health programmes.

40|$|In this dissertation, after {{reviewing}} the new paradigm in the optical switching network invoked by the DWDM technology and studying the changes of the schemes, we design the new optical burst switching networks, analyze {{the performance of the}} proposed scheme and interpret the analysis results. For design point of view, the fairness guaranteeing scheme and burst blocking reduction schemes in the mesh networks, loss less burst transmission scheme in DWDM metro ring networks are considered. As a future broad band optical alternative, optical burst switching has been receive much focus. We review the property of the optical switching technologies such as optical packet switching, optical circuit switching, and optical burst switching. The benefits of the optical burst switching is illustrated. Even though optical burst switching has several advantage, it has intrinsic technology barrier. We study the research activities to remove the basic problem of optical burst switching. Optical deflection, optical burst segmentation, burst cloning, and burst <b>piggy</b> <b>backing</b> scheme is considered. To improve the network performance, we design optical burst switching network in mesh networks and metro ring networks. We also implement the proposed network by our own developed network test bench. We verify the proposed network performance by analyzing the network mathematically in terms of blocking rate, delay and throughput. The theoretical results are compared with the simulation results. The verification shows that our proposed schemes outperform those of the conventional scheme. Our mathematical models are also matched to the simulation results. The interpretation of the verification shows that our assumption and theoretical analysis is well designed. The results illustrate that the difference between the simulation results and mathematical results is within the considerable margin. The contribution of the thesis is that the performance improvement schemes in both of the mesh network and ring network are proposed and analyzed. By considering feasibility of the future optical networks, proposed scheme in this thesis is more deployable in commercial network in terms of the burst blocking rate and delay as well as the network stability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Strategy (IMCI), {{developed}} by WHO/UNICEF, aims {{to contribute to}} reducing childhood morbidity and mortality (MDG 4) in resource-limited settings. Since 1996 more than 100 countries have adopted IMCI. IMCI case management training (ICMT) {{is one of three}} IMCI components and training is usually residential over 11 consecutive days. Follow-up after ICMT {{is an essential part of}} training. We describe the barriers to rapid acceleration of ICMT and review country perspectives on how to address these barriers. Methods A multi-country exploratory cross-sectional questionnaire survey of in-service ICMT approaches, using quantitative and qualitative methods, was conducted in 2006 - 7 : 27 countries were purposively selected from all six WHO regions. Data for this paper are from three questionnaires (QA, QB and QC), distributed to selected national focal IMCI persons/programme officers, course directors/facilitators and IMCI trainees respectively. QC only gathered data on experiences with IMCI follow-up. Results 33 QA, 163 QB and 272 QC were received. The commonest challenges to ICMT scale-up relate to funding (high cost and long duration of the residential ICMT), poor literacy of health workers, differing opinions about the role of IMCI in improving child health, lack of political support, frequent changes in staff or rules at Ministries of Health and lack of skilled facilitators. Countries addressed these challenges in several ways including increased advocacy, developing strategic linkages with other priorities, intensifying pre-service training, re-distribution of funds and shortening course duration. The commonest challenges to follow-up after ICMT were lack of funding (93. 1 % of respondents), inadequate funds for travelling or planning (75. 9 % and 44. 8 % respectively), lack of gas for travelling (41. 4 %), inadequately trained or few supervisors (41. 4 %) and inadequate job aids for follow-up (27. 6 %). Countries addressed these by <b>piggy</b> <b>backing</b> IMCI follow-up with routine supervisory visits. Conclusions Financial challenges to ICMT scale-up and follow-up after training are common. As IMCI is accepted globally as one of the key strategies to meet MDG 4 several steps need to be taken to facilitate rapid acceleration of ICMT, including reviewing core competencies followed by competency-driven shortened training duration or 'on the job' training, 'distance learning' or training using mobile phones. Linkages with other 'better-funded' programmes e. g. HIV or malaria need to be improved. Routine Primary Health Care (PHC) supervision needs to include follow-up after ICMT. </p...|$|E

To report visual and functional outcomes of various types of contact lenses in keratoconus patients at a tertiary referral centre. Methods: Study design: Prospective Cohort Study. 100 eyes of 51 patients with keratoconus were fitted with contact lenses with follow up at one and six months and evaluated. Statistical analysis: Paired t test, Chi Square test. Results: Best contact lens corrected visual acuity was better than best spectacle corrected visual acuity (p= 0. 000). 78 % patients were fitted with RGP, 12 % with Rose K, 6 % Soft, 2 % <b>Piggy</b> <b>Back</b> and 2 % with Kerasoft IC lenses. Soft lens were preferred in mild keratoconus, RGP for moderate and Rose K, <b>Piggy</b> <b>Back</b> and Kerasoft IC lenses for severe keratoconus. The mean daily wear among the lenses was 7. 59 hours per day with Rose K lenses having maximum wearing time of 8. 33 hours.
