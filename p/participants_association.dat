40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between sociodemographic, pregnancy related variables and psychological and verbal intimate partner abuse (PIPA), as well as determine which of these variables, are predictors of PIPA during pregnancy. BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence is a significant health issue, with severe implications to both mother and foetus. However, {{much of the research}} to date focuses on the outcomes of physical abuse. This article addresses the dearth in literature by examining {{the association between}} sociodemographic, pregnancy related variables and PIPA during pregnancy. DESIGN: A survey research design was used. METHOD: Three hundred postnatal women were recruited by convenience, non-proportional quota sampling technique. The WHO Violence Against Women Instrument was self-administered by <b>participants.</b> <b>Association</b> between categorical variables was assessed using Pearson's Chi-square, strength of association using Cramer's V and the phi coefficient, and identification of predictor variables for psychological and verbal abuse using Logistic regression. RESULTS: Four predictors were identified for psychological abuse namely i. e., low education level in women, an unplanned pregnancy, experiencing two or more pregnancy related health problems and living with an unemployed partner. Whilst unemployment in women, an unplanned pregnancy, fear of partner, and a low education level of partner, were identified as predictors of verbal abuse. CONCLUSION: This study identified a number of variables which strongly predict PIPA during pregnancy; however, it extends the available literature by identifying a low standard of education in males, unemployment and fear of the intimate partner as significant predictors of PIPA...|$|E

Unlike larger companies, they may not have the expertise or resources necessary to build effective programs. The goal {{of this study is to}} gather information about what motivates small businesses to implement safety 2 ̆ 6 health management systems and identify any issues/barriers that are unique to small-sized companies. Members of the Voluntary Protection Program <b>Participants</b> <b>Association</b> (VPPPA) and the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP) were selected for the survey because they have already been through the process of implementing safety 2 ̆ 6 health management systems and possess a wealth of information on what it takes to build and run a successful safety 2 ̆ 6 health management system in a small business. Unfortunately, there were problems getting access to accurate and up–to-date contact information for VPP and SHARP members. However, those companies who did participate provided similar responses to the research questions. Their main motivators in pursuing VPP or SHARP were to reduce injuries and lower worker’s compensation rates. Emphasizing the return on investment in safety and health is an effective driver for small businesses. The primary concern with implementation was the amount of time and paperwork. Also, with fewer employees, it can be difficult to meet the employee participation requirements for VPP because there is no safety expert; safety is delegated to those who have job duties in addition to safety and health. Compliance, the foundation of a good safety and health management system, is a large hurdle in itself for small business...|$|E

Methods In the follow up of the Burden of Lung Disease (BOLD) study in London, acceptable postbronchodilator spirometric, pulse rate, pulse wave velocity and blood pressure data were obtained from 108 participants. Blood samples for measurement of cardio-metabolic and inflammatory markers were also collected from these <b>participants.</b> <b>Association</b> of lung function and volume with the different biomarkers was examined in multivariable linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Results Following adjustment for age, sex, height, and ethnicity, TLC (adjusted coefficient= - 1. 53; 95 % CI:- 2. 57,- 0. 49) and FVC (adjusted coefficient= - 2. 66; 95 % CI:- 4. 98,- 0. 34) were inversely associated with pulse wave velocity, and further adjustment for smoking status, pack-years and body mass index (BMI) did not materially change these results. FEV 1 was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure, and adjustment for smoking status, pack-years and BMI made this association stronger (adjusted coefficient= - 9. 47; 95 % CI:- 15. 62,- 3. 32).

40|$|The Protein C {{anticoagulant}} pathway regulates blood coagulation {{by preventing}} the inadequate formation of thrombi. It has two main plasma components: protein C and protein S. Individuals with protein C or protein S deficiency present a dramatically increased incidence of thromboembolic disorders. Here, we {{present the results}} of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for protein C and protein S plasma levels in a set of extended pedigrees from the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia (GAIT) Project. A total number of 397 individuals from 21 families were typed for 307, 984 SNPs using the Infinium® 317 k Beadchip (Illumina). Protein C and protein S (free, functional and total) plasma levels were determined with biochemical assays for all <b>participants.</b> <b>Association</b> with phenotypes was investigated through variance component analysis. After correcting for multiple testing, two SNPs for protein C plasma levels (rs 867186 and rs 8119351) and another two for free protein S plasma levels (rs 1413885 and rs 1570868) remained significant on a genome-wide level, located in and around the PROCR and the DNAJC 6 genomic regions respectively. No SNPs were significantly associated with functional or total protein S plasma levels, although rs 1413885 from DNAJC 6 showed suggestive association with the functional protein S phenotype, possibly indicating that this locus {{plays an important role in}} protein S metabolism. Our results provide evidence that PROCR and DNAJC 6 might play a role in protein C and free protein S plasma levels in the population studied, warranting further investigation on the role of these loci in the etiology of venous thromboembolism and other thrombotic diseases. © 2011 Athanasiadis et al...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide-association {{studies have}} {{identified}} numerous {{body mass index}} (BMI) -associated variants, but {{it is unclear how}} these relate to weight gain in adults at different ages. METHODS: We examined the association of a genetic risk score (GRS), consisting of 31 BMI-associated variants, with an annual weight change (AWC) and a substantial weight gain (SWG) of 10 % by comparing self-reported weight at 20 years (y) with baseline weight (mean: 58 [*]y; s. d. : 8 [*]y) in 21407 participants from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS), and comparing baseline weight to weight at follow-up (mean: 73 [*]y; s. d. : 6 [*]y) among 2673 <b>participants.</b> <b>Association</b> between GRS and AWG and SWG was replicated in 4327 GLACIER (Gene x Lifestyle interactions And Complex traits Involved in Elevated disease Risk) participants (mean: 45 [*]y; s. d. : 7 [*]y) with 10 [*]y follow-up. Cohort-specific results were pooled by fixed-effect meta-analyses. RESULTS: In MDCS, the GRS was associated with increased AWC (β: 0. 003; s. e: 0. 01; P: 7 × 10 (- 8)) and increased odds for SWG (odds ratio (OR) 1. 01 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 00, 1. 02); P: 0. 013) per risk-allele from age 20 y, but unexpectedly with decreased AWC (β: - 0. 006; s. e: 0. 002; P: 0. 009) and decreased odds for SWG OR 0. 96 (95 % CI: 0. 93, 0. 98); P: 0. 001) between baseline and follow-up. Effect estimates from age 20 [*]y to baseline differed significantly from those from baseline to follow-up (P: 0. 0002 for AWC and P: 0. 0001 for SWG). Similar to MDCS, the GRS was associated with decreased odds for SWG OR 0. 98 (95 % CI: 0. 96, 1. 00); P: 0. 029) from baseline to follow-up in GLACIER. In meta-analyses (n= 7000), the GRS was associated with decreased AWC (β: - 0. 005; s. e. m. 0. 002; P: 0. 002) and decreased odds for SWG OR 0. 97 (95 % CI: 0. 96, 0. 99); P: 0. 001) per risk-allele. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide convincing evidence for a paradoxical inversed relationship between a high number of BMI-associated risk-alleles and less weight gain during and after middle-age, in contrast to the expected increased weight gain seen in younger age.

40|$|A THESIS Submitted to the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa in {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, 2014 Introduction: An increase in the prevalence of eating disorders, body image dissatisfaction, low self-esteem and unhealthy weight control behaviors have been reported among adolescents worldwide, and are a public health concern with physical and psychological consequences. Although underweight and stunting still persists in South Africa, overweight and obesity is increasing in all ages, gender, and ethnic groups. Obesity is a biological risk factor for body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem and eating disorders among adolescents, {{all of which have}} been found to be associated with various weight change behaviors and strategies. South Africa being a culturally diverse country is undergoing rapid political, socioeconomic, nutrition and epidemiological transitions, and therefore offers a unique opportunity to investigate this area of research. Study design: There are two study components: (1) A cross-sectional study to determine gender and ethnic (black and white) differences in eating attitudes, self-esteem and body satisfaction in 13, 15 and 17 year-old boys (n= 391) and girls (n= 340) living in urban Johannesburg; (2) A longitudinal survey of the Birth-to-Twenty (Bt 20) cohort at ages 13 and 17 years (n= 1435) to compare eating attitudes, body-esteem and weight control behaviors between black and mixed ancestry adolescents, to examine the changes over time in these variables, and to investigate ethnic differences in the male and female perceptions of female body silhouettes at age 17 years. These ages were selected to provide a diverse sample of adolescents (early, mid and late adolescence). Methods: Anthropometric measurements were performed on all participants. Overweight and obesity were determined using age-gender specific cut-offs for BMI for children aged up to 17 years. Eating attitudes test- 26 (EAT- 26) scores were used to determine an increased risk of developing an eating disorder. The total EAT- 26 score is the sum of the 26 items and scores range from 0 to 78. Participants who score more than 20 are considered to be at greater risk of developing an eating disorder, and represent more unhealthy attitudes towards food, body weight and eating. Body-esteem was measured using a body esteem scale. It consists of a set of 21 questions which measure 1) global feelings about one’s body e. g. “I like what I see when I look in the mirror”, 2) satisfaction with one’s weight e. g. “I really like what I weigh” and 3) positive evaluations about one’s body and appearance e. g. “People my own age like my looks”. The body-esteem assessment uses a 5 -point scale ranging from “never” (1) to “always” (5) and the higher the score the more satisfied the participant is with their body. Total scores are divided into three categories; low body esteem (score 1 to 21), average body-esteem (score 22 to 42), and high body esteem (score > 43). The Rosenberg self-esteem tool was used to measure general self-esteem of the participants. Body image satisfaction tool was used to rate participants satisfaction with different parts of their body whereas, the body esteem scale was used to assess participant’s attitudes and feelings about their body and appearance. A series of randomly placed female silhouettes were used to assess <b>participants</b> <b>association</b> with different attributes. They were also asked to associate a series of randomly placed female silhouettes, with specific words or phrases including clumsy, happy, worst, strong, happiest, best, less respect, more respect, unhappy. All participants were asked a number of questions about their attempts to change their weight. Girls and boys were asked the following questions: “During the past year have you done anything to try to lose weight?”, “During the past year have you done anything to try to gain muscle?” If participants answered positively they were asked to give reasons, which included; health and cosmetic reasons e. g. to look better, clothes too tight, too fat, unhappy with self, and want to be a model. They were further asked about the methods they used to lose weight, and their responses were categorized into three groups: (i) healthy weight control behaviors (e. g. to exercise, eat more fruits and vegetables, and to eat less high fat foods and less sweets) [20] unhealthy weight control behaviors (e. g. fasting, eating very little food, skipping meals, cigarette smoking and use of food substitutes (iii) extreme weight control behaviors (e. g. use of diet pills, self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives and diuretics). Descriptive analyses were completed and stratified according to gender and ethnicity. For normally distributed data we used t-tests and ANOVAs, and for data that was not normally distributed Wilcoxon rank test was done to determine significant difference. Chi-square tests were used to determine differences between categorical data. Pearson correlation test was done to determine linear associations. A p-value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In the non-cohort sample, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in the white girls and boys compared to their black peers, significantly more black than white adolescents of both genders reported an EAT- 26 score ≥ 20 (predisposition to an eating disorder). Although the prevalence of low self-esteem was greater in the white compared to black girls, in the study of the male adolescents, the low self-esteem was more prevalent in the black compared to the white boys. Significantly more black than white girls had high body image dissatisfaction (38. 8 vs. 16. 7...|$|E
