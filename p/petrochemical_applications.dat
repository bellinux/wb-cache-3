40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this thesis {{presents}} an introduction to sol-gel methodology whose usefulness as a synthetic route will be demonstrated with two applications in chromatography. The first application involves the fabrication of a capillary micro-extraction (CME) device by coating a phenyl functionalized extracting phase on the inner surface of a fused silica capillary for analyte pre-concentration. The device was coupled on-line to a RP-HPLC system and practicality was demonstrated using allergens as target analytes. The allergens chosen as model analytes are typically found in fragrance products and food. Most of the 26 fragrance allergens that are monitored by various government authorities have a phenyl organic moiety (a strong chromophore), thus making them appropriate probes for exploring the extraction efficiency of the coating using a UV detector. The CME device showed ppt level limit of detection which makes it suitable for trace analyses of allergens and similar compounds {{in a variety of}} matrices. The second application explores the feasibility of using sol-gel derived chromia-based stationary phase in gas chromatographic columns. The organic moiety of the stationary phase was derived from Ucon 75 -H- 90, 000 while the inorganic backbone was prepared using chromium(III) dichloride hydroxide - methacrylic acid - aqua complex, 40 % in isopropanol/acetone. Usefulness of prepared chromia-based GC stationary phase was examined for <b>petrochemical</b> <b>application.</b> Promising results were obtained using aliphatic-aromatics, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, BTEX test mixture, cycloalkanes, branched alkanes and akylbenzenes. The column was able to perform without degradation despite being rinsed multiples times sequentially with the following solvents: dichloromethane, methanol, water and finally methanol again. Maximum theoretical plate number calculated is around 2, 400 plates/m. The plate number clearly needs improvement but is a promising result for the newly explored chromia-based stationary phase.

30|$|There {{are three}} main issues called the {{constraint}} triangle for maximizing propylene production; {{the effects of}} existing FCC technology, operation variables and catalysts on product quality and quantity [47]. Since the alteration of the FCC unit configuration and catalyst development is not {{the focus of this}} work, even though they are very important in FCC unit optimization, only the operation variables are manipulated to maximize the yield of propylene lump (C 3 ’s). Higher propylene production comes at the expense of gasoline. For traditional refiners, maximizing gasoline yield {{is more important than the}} propylene yield, while for those interested in <b>petrochemical</b> <b>applications,</b> the target is operating at maximum propylene yield [7].|$|E
30|$|By {{taking into}} {{consideration}} the operating conditions and yields of the FCC, the propylene yield pattern can be represented {{in the form of}} a continuum varying from operating severity to process design and these can be optimized to suit the refinery specific economics [32]. The optimum process design provides refiners with the flexibility to move up or down the optimal economic range of the propylene yield curve as shown in Fig.  3. From Fig.  3, it can be seen that higher propylene production comes at the expense of gasoline. For traditional refiners, maximizing gasoline yield is more important than the propylene yield, while for those interested in <b>petrochemical</b> <b>applications,</b> the target is operating at maximum propylene yield.|$|E

It involves spraying sodium cyanide solution, of a concentration of 200 – 600  ppm, on piles of ground ore. Gold reacts with cyanide to form a water-soluble compound.

30|$|In {{this paper}} an {{external}} surface temperature measurement system for ethylene cracking furnace tubes was proposed. The system realizes both a dual-phase drive synchronization method and temperature processing algorithm. The dual-phase drive synchronization method enables the thermodetector to automatically measure tube temperatures in batches {{and measure the}} temperature of a single tube from multiple points and angles, thereby providing numerous data points for more accurate analysis and calculation of temperatures. Furthermore, the temperature processing algorithm allows the thermodetector to differentiate between temperatures of the furnace tube and furnace wall, filter out abnormal temperatures, select high-quality temperatures, and determine the final result. Comparing the results to actual temperature measurements of an ethylene cracking furnace tube, {{the effectiveness of the}} automatic temperature measurement system and measurement method was demonstrated. Moreover, measurements were shown to be more accurate and stable than traditional manual method, thus reducing costs and human resources. Moreover, successfully applying this system will provide a basis for tube temperature measurements in other <b>petrochemical</b> industry <b>applications.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{comparison}} to conventional duplex stainless steels (DSS), lean duplex SS {{are characterized by}} restricted nickel and molybdenum contents and by incremented manganese and nitrogen percentages, added to stabilize the austenitic phase. A lower nickel percentage in these materials determines cost savings when they are used in place of conventional duplex grades or austenitic stainless steels, such as AISI 304 and 316. They may also substitute advantageously carbon steels when maintenance costs are significant.

40|$|Among {{protective}} coatings for components used in <b>petrochemical</b> <b>applications,</b> plasma sprayed alloys containing chromium, nickel, and molybdenum have potential to provide functional surfaces with good {{resistance to corrosion}} and wear. They could offer a cost effective solution by limiting the use of expensive bulk materials such cls Inconel or Hastelloy superalloys or highly alloyed chromium stainless steels, since a low cost base material could be selected to give the required mechanical strength combined with suitable corrosion resistance from its modified surface. To limit fabrication costs of coating deposition. air plasma spraying techniques can be proposed, but proper optimisation of the plasma processing parameters is required to increase coating performance. In this paper: coatings based on Ni-Cr-B-Si and Mo alloys have been deposited following (I design of experiment methodology.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{engineering}} applications involve the flow of particulate multiphase systems, featuring discrete liquid droplets dispersed in a continuous gas phase. Specific industrial examples range from fuel injection technologies over the optimization of multiphase segregation processes commonly encountered in <b>petrochemical</b> <b>applications</b> to aircraft in-flight icing control. A detailed understanding of dispersed phase characteristics such as local droplet velocity and volumetric fraction is required for design purposes and may be obtained from a numerical solution of the equations governing droplet motion. A fundamental choice between Lagrangian and Eulerian reference frames presents itself {{in the formulation of}} the governing equations. While the physically intuitive Lagrangian approach treats the dispersed phase as a set of discrete particles that are individually tracked through the computational domain, the Eulerian formulation considers the dispersed phase as a continuum. The use of an Eulerian formulation to describe the evolution of discrete particles may appear counter-intuitive from a physical standpoint; however, advantages with respect to computational effort, numerical accuracy and accommodation of geometric complexity strongly suggest the use of an Eulerian formulation. In order to accurately predict droplet behavior in the vicinity of a solid system boundary, droplet-wall interactions must be accounted for in the governing mathematical model. Due to current limitations in computational capacity, an industrially viable simulation is necessarily based on a semi-empirical description of the droplet-wall interaction process. Since empirical correlations are inherently Lagrangian in nature, the associated information must be transformed from a Lagrangian to an Eulerian frame of reference. This transformation, however, is not obvious and as a consequence no Eulerian impact models {{have been reported in the}} published scientific literature to date. A detailed derivation of an Eulerian model of the droplet-wall interaction process is presented along with a comparison of numerical and experimental results demonstrating the model's current simulation capabilities and suggested future improvements...|$|E

Alloy 800 H and related alloys have extensive use in coal flue gas environments, {{as well as for}} tubing or structural components in chemical and <b>petrochemical</b> <b>applications.</b> The main concept of the project was make small, deliberate elemental microalloying additions to this Fe-based alloy to produce, with proper processing, fine stable carbide dispersions for enhanced high temperature creep-strength and rupture resistance, with similar or better oxidation/corrosion resistance. The project began with alloy 803, a Fe- 25 Cr- 35 NiTi,Nb alloy recently developed by INCO, as the base alloy for modification. Smaller commercial developmental alloy heats were produced by Special Metal. At the end of the project, three rounds of alloy development had produced a modified 803 alloy with significantly better creep resistance above 815 C (1500 C) than standard alloy 803 in the solution-annealed (SA) condition. The new upgraded 803 alloy also had the potential for a processing boost in that creep resistance for certain kinds of manufactured components that was not found in the standard alloy. The upgraded 803 alloy showed similar or slightly better oxidation and corrosion resistance relative to standard 803. Creep strength and oxidation/corrosion resistance of the upgraded 803 alloy were significantly better than found in alloy 800 H, as originally intended. The CRADA was terminated in February 2003.

40|$|Measurement {{and control}} of the fluid {{parameters}} play a very important role in industry applications such as in the petrochemical industrial processing, where there is an increasing demand for real-time determination of dielectric parameters in relation to the product quality. Furthermore, in such a context, additional stringent requirements frequently deal with the spatial localization of non-miscible-layered liquids, like water layers often present in the bottom of tanks during the refinery industrial processing. Recently, reflectometry has become a very attractive method for monitoring applications, thanks to its accuracy and flexibility performance. In this paper, the design of a suitable probe configuration and an associated calibration structure, both leading to an optimal experimental set-up for practical reflectometry measurements in <b>petrochemical</b> industrial <b>applications,</b> are illustrated. Moreover, starting from frequency-domain reflectometry data, a robust optimization procedure is implemented and experimentally tested, thus allowing the accurate evaluation of the frequency-dependent dielectric properties and of multiple levels in different stratified liquids. Results derived through the simple time-domain technique are compared with those achieved through two different frequency-domain approaches, involving the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) of time-domain reflectometry (TDR) data and direct vector network analyzer (VNA) measurements, respectively. It is demonstrated that the frequency-domain approaches can significantly enhance the measurement accuracy, allowing the estimation of fuel level with an uncertainty lower than 0. 5 mm. Furthermore, it is also shown that a low-cost TDR system, combined with an appropriate FFT-based algorithm, can be successfully adopted for the simultaneous measurement of permittivity and levels, without substantially affecting the measurement accuracy performance when compared to the direct frequency-domain VNA measurements...|$|R

The microporous polymer had a BET surface area based on nitrogen adsorption of 260 m 2 g− 1. A freshly prepared sample exhibited excellent gas permeation properties: (i) CO 2 permeability of 40 Barrer {{coupled with a}} CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 55 and (ii) H 2 permeability of 94 Barrer with a H 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 129. Physical aging over 250 days resulted in significantly enhanced CO 2 /CH 4 and H 2 /CH 4 selectivities of 75 and 183, respectively with only ~ 25 % loss in CO 2 and H 2 permeability. Aged TDA 1 -APAF exhibited 5 -fold higher pure-gas CO 2 permeability (30 Barrer) and two-fold higher CO 2 /CH 4 permselectivity over conventional dense cellulose triacetate membranes at 2 bar. In addition, TDA 1 -APAF polyimide had a N 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 2. 3, thereby making it potentially possible to bring natural gas with low, but unacceptable nitrogen content to pipeline specification. Gas mixture permeation experiments with a 1 : 1 CO 2 /CH 4 feed mixture demonstrated higher mixed- than pure-gas selectivity and plasticization resistance up to 30 bar.

For this study we therefore have taken a molecular approach. Looking at the size of possible end markets for the molecules that can be based on carbohydrates a number of main products come into view: dialcohols, dioic acids, 2, 5 furan dicarboxylic acid and ethanol.
