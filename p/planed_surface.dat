40|$|Observations of Hylotrupes bajulus in {{kiln-dried}} timber {{are very}} rare. In Germany, this {{has often been}} attributed to a preventive effect of the drying process. Commonly assumed explanations for a preventive effect are the loss of substances that attract the insects and the decline in nutrients caused by kiln drying. A {{review of the literature}} has been undertaken and these explanations are not well supported. Seemingly, the main direct effect of kiln drying at temperatures below 100 °C is the killing of all larvae present in the timber before drying. Some indirect effects may also contribute to the reduced risk of infestations in kiln-dried timber, namely kiln-dried timber is often free of wane and therefore free of outer sapwood; it shows a low number of cracks and has a <b>planed</b> <b>surface.</b> Especially the absence of wane may contribute to the scarcity of Hylotrupes in kiln-dried timber...|$|E

The samples of beech-wood were cut from steamed beech-wood and from thermally modified beech-wood (212 oC). The specimens were machined by planing in radial directions with two knives at 6, 12, 18 and 24 m/min feed speed. The cutting depth of 2. 0 mm was constant and knife rake angle was 15 o.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{comprehensive}} three-year study of the Harr Ice Piedmont, Anvers Island, Antarctica are presented. The piedmont stands on a low coastal platform ranging from slightly below sea level to 200 m. a. s. l. Ice thickness ranges from 60 to 80 m. at the coastal cliffs to more than 600 m. inland. Annual accumulation is high. There is a strong relationship between elevation and accumulation rates and a marked variation of accumulation rates from year to year. Surface ice velocities range from 14 m/year to 218 m/year and there is considerable ice streaming {{as a result of}} the subglacial topography. The mass balance of a representative part of the piedmont is considered to be in equilibrium or possibly, slightly positive. A study of a peripheral ramp shows annual fluctuations of balance and it is hypothesised that there may be a long-term tendency towards a positive regime. Ice core studies indicate that there is no dry snow facies but all other facies are identified. The saturation line lies at approximately 600 m. a. s. l. and the equilibrium line ranges from 60 to 120 m. a. s. l. Englacial ten-metre temperatures range from - 0. 8 ºC near the coast to - 4. 9 ºC inland. Deformation velocities have been calculated and basal sliding velocities inferred. It is hypothesised that basal conditions are not everywhere the same and that parts of the piedmont are frozen to bedrock. It is suggested that basal sliding and erosion are related and that the piedmont is selectively eroding its bed and accentuating the subglacial topography. Evidence of erosion, debris-rich ice, exists in the piedmont but is below sea level at the coastal cliff.

E. do Buriti, atravÃs da anÃlise de palinomorfos de uma turfeira, caracterizaÃÃo das formaÃÃes superficiais e dataÃÃo pelo mÃtodo do 14 C. Ao longo de um testemunho de 130 cm, foram identificados 37 tÃxons diferentes, os quais foram separados em cinco categorias ecolÃgicas (Ãrvores, arbustos, ervas terrestres, algas e esporos de pteridÃfitas). A dataÃÃo estimada sugere que a base da turfeira formou-se Ã aproximadamente 13. 700 anos A. P, perÃodo relacionado ao Ãltimo MÃximo Glacial (UMG). Nessa Ãpoca a cabeceira de drenagem nÃo teria uma ligaÃÃo canalizada com a rede de drenagem do rio IndependÃncia, nÃvel de base local. De acordo com os dados obtidos, pode-se afirmar que na regiÃo da Ãrea de estudo, durante a passagem do Pleistoceno/Holoceno atÃ o presente, nÃo hÃ registros de cerrado, apenas de Ãreas campestres no Pleistoceno, inferido pela presenÃa de ervas terrestres, principalmente Asteraceae e Borreria encontrados em 12. 700 anos A. P. (est.) e total ausÃncia de algas e grÃos de pÃlen de espÃcies arbÃreas, sugerindo regime hidrolÃgico mais seco. Eventualmente, fenÃmenos de alta precipitaÃÃo ocorreram nas encostas e promoveram a degradaÃÃo dos horizontes de solo na alta encosta (nose), promovendo a deposiÃÃo de camadas coluviais atÃ o novo regime hÃdrico, mais Ãmido, propiciando a instalaÃÃo de uma vegetaÃÃo herbÃcea acompanhada de pteridÃfitas, principalmente nas Ãreas mais baixas. HÃ cerca de 10. 600 anos A. P. 14 C (est.), a manutenÃÃo da elevaÃÃo de umidade se estabelece e altos Ãndices de precipitaÃÃo fizeram com que o lenÃol freÃtico aflorasse no hollow constantemente, acelerando a hidromorfizaÃÃo do paleohorizonte A hÃmico e desenvolvendo, nas estaÃÃes chuvosas, uma pequena lagoa no eixo central da cabeceira. Fato evidenciado pela presenÃa de algas e por uma expansÃo significativa de Araucaria angustifolia, a qual necessita de um regime pluviomÃtrico {{superior}} a 1. 400 mm. ano- 1, sem estaÃÃo seca definida. A vegetaÃÃo predominante passa a ser de Floresta OmbrÃfila Mista e Floresta Pluvial AtlÃntica composta por gÃneros arbÃreos, ervas terrestres e pteridÃfitas. A mÃxima expansÃo da Floresta OmbrÃfila Mista Ã registrada a cerca de 6. 880 anos A. P. (est.), face o aumento de todos os tÃxons registrados, principalmente Araucaria. A presenÃa de algas ficou mais acentuada, sugerindo novamente a ocorrÃncia de uma lÃmina de Ãgua, conservada por um regime pluviomÃtrico abundante e regular. Nos anos que se seguiram, provavelmente Ã 1. 060 anos A. P. (est.), ocorreu uma reduÃÃo da vegetaÃÃo de modo generalizado, modificando-se apenas no presente com o plantio de araucÃrias apÃs a criaÃÃo da A. R. I. E. do Buriti. Em algum momento desse perÃodo o hollow da cabeceira de drenagem passou a desenvolver canais de drenagem perenes, que permitiram a drenagem eficiente na cabeceira, diminuindo os nÃveis de umidade da turfeiraThis study identifies paleoenvironmental {{records in}} the remaining at <b>planed</b> <b>surface</b> VIII, in Pato Branco (SW PR), more precisely in conservation area (A. R. I. E. do Buriti) by analysis of palynomorphs in a bog, characterization of the surface formations and the 14 C dating method. Throughout the testimony of 130 cm, 37 different taxa were identified, which were separated into five ecological categories (trees, shrubs, ground herbs, algae and fern spores). The dating estimated suggests that {{the base of the}} bog was formed approximately 13, 700 years BP, a period related to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). At that time the head of drainage would not have a connection to the piped drainage waterway of Independence river, local base level. According to the data obtained, we can affirm that in the region of the study area during the transition from the Pleistocene / Holocene to the present, there are no records of savannah, only grassland areas in the Pleistocene, inferred by the presence of ground herbs, especially Borreria and Asteraceae found in 12, 700 years BP 14 C (estimated) and total absence of algae and pollen grains of tree species, suggesting drier hydrological regime. Occasionally, high precipitation phenomeno occurred on the slopes and promoted the degradation of soil horizons in the upper slope (nose), promoting the deposition of colluvial layers until the new water regime, wetter, allowing the establishment of a herbaceous vegetation accompanied by ferns, mainly in the lower areas. In about 10, 600 years BP 14 C (est.), maintenance of high humidity is established and high precipitation caused the water table surface in the hollow constantly accelerating the hidromorfization paleohorizonte A humic, and developing in the rainy seasons, a small pond in the central axis of the headboard. Fact evidenced by the presence of algae and a significant expansion of Araucaria angustifolia, which requires an annual rainfall exceeding 1, 400 mm. yr- 1, without a dry season. The predominant vegetation is replaced by the Araucaria Forest and Atlantic Rain Forest composed of genres trees, ground herbs and ferns. The maximum expansion of the Araucaria Forest is logged about 6, 880 years BP 14 C (est.), face the increase of all taxa recorded, mainly from Araucaria. The presence of algae was more pronounced, again suggesting the occurrence of a blade of water conserved by an abundant and regular rainfall. In the years that followed, probably to 1, 060 years BP 14 C (est.), a reduction of vegetation as a general rule, changing only in the present with the planting of araucaria after the creation of A.

Sometime in this period, the hollow head of the drainage began to develop perennial drainage channels, allowing efficient drainage at the head of drainage, reducing moisture levels in the bo...|$|E

Higher current rating with quicker workpiece feed rate effectively reaches the fast improvement of the surface roughness of the workpiece.
