5|$|Expo 67 {{opened to}} the public on the morning of Friday, April 28, 1967, with a space age-style countdown. A {{capacity}} crowd at Place d'Accueil participated in the atomic clock-controlled countdown that ended when the exhibition opened <b>precisely</b> <b>at</b> 9:30a.m. EST. An estimated crowd of between 310,000 and 335,000 visitors showed up for opening day, as opposed to the expected crowd of 200,000. The first person through the Expo gates at Place d'Accueil was Al Carter, a 41-year-old jazz drummer from Chicago, who was recognized for his accomplishment by Expo 67's director of operations Philippe de Gaspé Beaubien. Beaubien presented Carter with a gold watch for his feat.|$|E

25|$|At about 3 a.m. {{the morning}} of 25 July 1909 Blériot's team noticed {{a break in the}} weather, awakened him, {{prepared}} the aircraft, and waited for dawn to make the attempt if the favourable conditions still held. Levavasseur and the rest of Latham's team, however, slept the night through and failed to notice the opportunity, a lapse which was rigorously criticised by Latham’s supporters.

25|$|If an {{observable}} {{is measured}} {{and the result}} is a certain eigenvalue, the corresponding eigenvector is the state of the system immediately after the measurement. The act of measurement in matrix mechanics 'collapses' the state of the system. If one measures two observables simultaneously, the state of the system collapses to a common eigenvector of the two observables. Since most matrices don't have any eigenvectors in common, most observables can never be measured <b>precisely</b> <b>at</b> the same time. This is the uncertainty principle.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary reason}} for the re-creation of a county around Coimbra, {{separate}} from the northern County of Portugal, ruled by Sisnando, who had not attachments in northern Iberia, was to weaken {{the independence of the}} Portuguese magnates and expand central royal Leonese administration into newly conquered territories. Sisnando is first recorded ruling in Coimbra only on 1 May 1070, in a document that has come under suspicion. It is possible that his appointment to the countship was not made by Ferdinand in 1064 but rather was connected with his first appearance at Alfonso VI's court in 1075. In Portugal Sisnando built or rebuilt the castles of Coimbra, Lousã, Montemor-o-Velho, Penacova, and Penela. He also played some role in the foundation of a diocese in central Portugal, <b>precisely</b> <b>at</b> Coimbra.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss how}} {{integrity}} consistency constraints between different UML models can be <b>precisely</b> defined <b>at</b> a language level. In doing so, we introduce a formal object-oriented metamodeling approach. In the approach, integrity consistency constraints between UML models are {{defined in terms}} of invariants of the UML model elements used to define the models at the language-level. Adopting a formal approach, constraints are formally defined using Object-Z. We demonstrate how integrity consistency constraints for UML models can be <b>precisely</b> defined <b>at</b> the language-level and once completed, the formal description of the consistency constraints will be a precise reference of checking consistency of UML models as well as for tool development...|$|R
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the time}} of day or night in Paris was largely {{announced}} by the church bells; in 1789 there were 66 churches, 92 chapels, 13 abbeys and 199 convents, all of which rang their bells for regular services and prayers; sometimes a little early, sometimes a little late. A clock had also been installed in a tower of the palace on the Île de la Cité by Charles V in about 1370, and it also sounded the hour. Wealthy and noble Parisians began to have pocket watches, and needed a way to accurately set the time, so sundials appeared around the city. The best known-sundial was in the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. In 1750, the Duke of Chartres had a cannon installed there which, following the sundial, was fired <b>precisely</b> <b>at</b> noon each day.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of May 28, 1965, the Viet Cong marched into their {{designated}} positions around Ba Gia; the 90th Battalion took up their position at Minh Thanh, the 60th Battalion at Vinh Loc 1, the 40th Battalion at Duyen Phuoc, and the 45th Battalion at Vinh Khanh. The 271st Regimental Headquarters set up camp at Nui Thanh, while the 83rd Local Force Battalion was ordered to encircle the administrative centre at Nghia Hanh. <b>Precisely</b> <b>at</b> 5.45am on May 29, elements of the Viet Cong 271st Regiment launched a surprise attack on Phuoc Loc, a small village located south of Ba Gia. Within 10 minutes of fighting, the two platoons of South Vietnamese Regional Force defending Phuoc Loc were subdued, and the Viet Cong quickly consolidated the battlefield around the area. At around 6:00am ARVN Captain Nguyen Van Ngoc, commander of the 1st Battalion, 51st Infantry Regiment, led his unit from Go Cao south toward Phuoc Loc to stage a counter-attack against the lead element of the enemies’ 271st Regiment.|$|E
25|$|To access this region, two provincial roads: Provincial Route No. 28 (gravel), {{linking the}} towns of Tanti with Taninga (near the town of Salsacate). After {{traveling}} nearly 40km from Tanti, and climb over 1,700 meters you reach the far north of the region, more <b>precisely</b> <b>at</b> {{the foot of the}} massif 'Los Gigantes'. From there you can follow the same route to the town of Taninga. The second option is the provincial route RP 34 (tarmac), located about 30km south of the former. It crosses the city of Villa Carlos Paz, crossing {{the towns of}} San Antonio de Arredondo, Villa Icho Cruz, Mayu Sumaj, Cuesta Blanca, and deposited us in the Pampa de Achala. This road is also known as Camino de las Altas Cumbres or route Jorge Raúl Recalde, in tribute to this rally racer. Continuing along the same route, it accesses the Traslasierra Valley. While these are the two most relevant options, there are regional roads and tourist access to reach specific sectors within the region. As mentioned above, except for these two alternatives, the other, in most cases are suitable only for special vehicles, and yet they can not access certain areas.|$|E

Brownbill, Barbara Yorke, Frank Stenton and Cyril Hart, have generally agreed that the Tribal Hidage originated from Mercia at around this time, although they have different theories for the identity of the Mercian overlord under whom the list was compiled.

Both sides exchanged fire, and the outpost was destroyed by a grenade while the Hmong soldier guarding the post retreated. Shortly afterwards, a soldier from Cell 1 fired an RPG-7 grenade which destroyed the TACAN antenna. Within 15 minutes, Cells 1 and 2 had secured the communications site. Signaled by the explosion of Cell 1’s RPG-7 round, Cell 3 immediately attacked the TACAN installation by firing one of their own RPG-7s, which destroyed the electrical generators.|$|E
