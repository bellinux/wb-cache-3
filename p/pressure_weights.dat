40|$|Introduction. Hypertension {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{diseases}} in the world and a major risk factor for cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic diseases. It seems that hypertension and overweight in children are a growing epidemic. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hypertension in school-aged children in Tehran. Materials and Methods. In a cross-sectional study, blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were performed on school-aged children in Tehran from 2008 to 2009. Children aged 7 to 11 years from 5 public schools in Tehran were included. Blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>weight,</b> and height measurement were performed at the school. At each screening, 3 seated blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>weight,</b> and height measurements were made and at least after 3 minutes of rest and choosing proper cuff, blood pressure was measured by a pediatric nephrologist and a pediatric assistant. Results. A total of 425 school-aged children were included. Twenty-four percent of the primary school children had hypertension and 12 % were shown to be overweight. Hypertension was more common in students of the north of Tehran in comparison to other geographic parts of Tehran. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of hypertension between girl students of north of Tehran and girls of the other parts of Tehran. Conclusions. We concluded that hypertension is a common problem in school-aged children. Our study re-emphasized the need for prevention and control of high blood pressure in children to manage the global diseases burden due to hypertension. </p...|$|R
