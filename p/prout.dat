The new student center opened in 1958, {{after four years}} of construction at a cost of $2.75 million. In the years 2012-2014, the residence hall was renovated and remodeled.

5|$|The {{numbering}} of {{the movements}} shown here is {{in accordance with}} the Novello vocal score (1959), edited by Watkins Shaw, which adapts the numbering earlier devised by Ebenezer <b>Prout.</b> Other editions count the movements slightly differently; the Bärenreiter edition of 1965, for example, does not number all the recitatives and runs from 1 to 47. The division into parts and scenes is based on the 1743 word-book prepared for the first London performance. The scene headings are given as Burrows summarised the scene headings by Jennens.|$|E
5000|$|The {{guerrilla war}} {{was not as}} intense in <b>Prout's</b> {{south-eastern}} command as elsewhere but his troops came in for considerable criticism for indiscipline and inefficiency. A National Army report of October 1922 stated, [...] "Prout is too weak as well as too guilless to handle traitorous or semi-mutinous incompetents". In December a number of posts under <b>Prout's</b> command, including Carrick on Suir, surrendered to an anti-Treaty column under Tom Barry, giving up their arms and equipment. Commandant General Eamon Price, sent to investigate the incident, backed <b>Prout's</b> plea for more arms and transport for his command and blamed <b>Prout's</b> subordinate officers for the reverse.|$|R

5|$|Diamond Rio is an American {{country and}} Christian country music band.

The organization is secret and contains six members, two each for sophomore, junior and senior classes.
