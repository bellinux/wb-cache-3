It has long been believed that cryopreservation of <b>plant</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> is best performed with cells at the late lag or early exponential growth phase.

This belief was based on studies using conventional slow prefreezing protocols and survival determined with fluorescein diacetate staining or 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride assays.

5000|$|Cambium {{is a type}} of {{meristem}} {{with thin}} walls which minutely exist in small populations within a plant. Due to this structural characteristic, once physical force is applied to it, it is easily damaged in the very process of isolation, losing its stem cell characteristics.

[...] This highly vulnerable feature has made studies on cambial structure and ultrastructure difficult to achieve with conventional methods.

Furthermore, their genomic stability was evaluated by correlating DNA content and genome size with cell size and complexity, protein content, and elicitation effects using multiparameter flow cytometry.
