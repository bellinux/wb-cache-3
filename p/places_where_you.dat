500|$|The next night, rioting again {{surrounded}} Christopher Street; participants remember differently which {{night was}} more frantic or violent. Many {{of the same}} people returned from the previous evening—hustlers, street youths, and [...] "queens"—but they were joined by [...] "police provocateurs", curious bystanders, and even tourists. Remarkable to many was the sudden exhibition of homosexual affection in public, as described by one witness: [...] "From going to <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> had to knock on a door and speak to someone through a peephole in order to get in. We were just out. We were in the streets." ...|$|E
500|$|Aarhus has {{a robust}} and diverse nightlife. The action tends to {{concentrate}} {{in the inner}} city, with the pedestrianised riverside, Frederiksgade, the Latin Quarter and Jægergårdsgade on Frederiksbjerg as the most active centres at night, but things are stirring elsewhere around the city too. The nightlife scene offers everything from small joints with cheap alcohol and a homely atmosphere to fashionable night clubs serving champagne and cocktails or small and large music venues with bars, dance floors and lounges. [...] A short selection of well-established <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> can have a drink and socialise, include the fashionable lounge and night club of Kupé at the harbour front, the relaxed Ris Ras Filliongongong offering waterpipes and an award-winning beer selection, Fatter Eskild with a broad selection of Danish bands playing mostly blues and rock, the wine and book café of Løve's in Nørregade, Sherlock Holmes, a British-style pub with live music and the brew pub of Sct. Clemens with A Hereford Beefstouw restaurant across the cathedral. [...] There are several clubs, discos and cafés aimed at gays and lesbians, including Danish D-lite (sports), Gbar (nightclub) and Gaia Vandreklub (hiking club).|$|E
2500|$|Some translators {{render the}} T–V {{distinction}} in English with [...] "thou" [...] and [...] "you", particularly in <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{appears in the}} place of expected thou, or vice versa. This practice has largely fallen out of use. Ernest Hemingway, in his novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, uses the forms [...] "thou" [...] and [...] "you" [...] in order to reflect the relationships between his Spanish-speaking characters and to better represent in English the Spanish language in which both formal (usted) and familiar (tú) second-person pronouns still exist.|$|E

2500|$|Simcha Jacobovici, {{involved}} {{in the production of}} a documentary on Freund's work for the National Geographic Channel, stated that the biblical Tarshish (which he believes is the same as Tartessos) was Atlantis, and that [...] "Atlantis was hiding in the Tanach". Aren Maeir, a professor of archeology at Bar-Ilan University said [...] "a lot of people have made many crazy claims about Atlantis – it’s one of those classic <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> have a lunatic fringe looking for all types of things. And Richard Freund is known as someone who makes 'sensational' finds. I would say that I am exceptionally skeptical about the thing, but I wouldn’t discount it 100% until I see the details, which haven’t been published as far as I know...every few years we hear something like this from him... And the fact that it’s on National Geographic doesn’t mean much. Unfortunately, over the past years they’ve had many questionable programs.".|$|E
