50|$|Frequent urination, or urinary {{frequency}} (<b>Pollakiuria</b> is {{the scientific}} terminology for the same), {{is the need}} to urinate more often than usual. It is often, though not necessarily, associated with urinary incontinence and polyuria (large total volume of urine). However, in other cases, urinary frequency involves only normal volumes of urine overall.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of cause, {{there is}} a common set of symptoms, which {{includes}} frequent trips to the litter box (<b>pollakiuria),</b> prolonged squatting and straining during attempts to urinate (dysuria), small amounts of urine voided in each attempt, blood in the urine (hematuria) and urinating outside of the litter box. Owners with outdoor cats {{may not be able to}} observe the symptoms associated with litter box use and should watch for unusual behavioral changes.|$|E
50|$|The {{morbidity}} {{associated with}} the Wertheim-Meigs operation is substantial. The most important complications are ureteral, ureterovaginal, and vesicovaginal fistulae, appearing during the immediate postoperative convalescence period or later mainly in patients who received subsequent radiotherapy. Other complications are described: intraoperative hemorrhage due to pelvic large vessel lesion, ureter or bladder accidental section, abdominal wall dehiscence, ureteral obstruction causing hydronephrosis and renal exclusion, disorders such as urinary incontinence, <b>pollakiuria,</b> vesical atony, often accompanied by urinary tract infection and hematuria.|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{describe}} the rarely reported characteristics of <b>pollakiuria</b> {{in children with}} tic disorders (TD). Methods: During a period of one year, all patients visiting our Tourette Syndrome (TS) Clinic with TD were studied for presentation of <b>pollakiuria.</b> Results: We found that nine (1. 9 %) out of 467 children with TD had pollakiuria: 407 boys and 60 girls, {{with a mean age}} of 8. 7 years. Of these nine children, there were eight boys and one girl, and their mean age was 7. 4 years. Five had transient TD, one had chronic motor TD and the remaining three had TS. Their <b>pollakiuria</b> recovered within two to six months, except for two male patients aged six and 19 years, whose <b>pollakiuria</b> persisted for more than a year. Factors precipitating anxiety were identified in only three children. Obsessive compulsive behaviors could be traced in eight patients. Conclusions: <b>Pollakiuria</b> occurring in children with TD is not frequently encountered. It usually has a benign course, as it does in those without tics. However, some-times the <b>pollakiuria</b> waxed and waned over years, as do tics. Pollakiuri...|$|E
40|$|Background: Urination {{disorders}} {{are common in}} Parkinson′s disease (PD) and respond poorly to medication. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors for urination disorders in PD. Methods: Ninety-one patients with PD (aged 34 - 83 years old) were recruited. Patients were assessed with the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr stage, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Micturition number was recorded, and Type B ultrasound {{was used to evaluate}} residual urine. Statistics was performed using binary logistic regression, bivariate correlations, and Chi-square and t-tests. Results: Of 91 patients, urinary dysfunction occurred in 55. 0 %. Among these, 49. 5 % suffered with nocturia, 47. 3 % with <b>pollakiuria.</b> Nocturia number had a positive linear relationship with HAMA score (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 340, P = 0. 001), HAMD score (OR = 0. 323, P = 0. 002), duration of L-dopa medication (OR = 0. 328, P = 0. 001), dose of L-dopa (OR = 0. 273, P = 0. 009), UPDRS-II (OR = 0. 402, P = 0. 000), UPDRS-III score (OR = 0. 291, P = 0. 005), and PSQI score (OR = 0. 249, P = 0. 017). Micturition number over 24 h was positively associated with HAMA (OR = 0. 303, P = 0. 004) and UPDRS-II scores (OR = 0. 306, P = 0. 003). Of patients with residual urine, 79. 3 % had a volume of residual urine < 50 ml. Residual urine was present in 44. 4 % of the patients with nocturia, 46. 5 % of the patients with <b>pollakiuria,</b> and 80. 0 % of the patients with dysuria. More men than women had residual urine (35. 2 % male vs. 13. 3 % female; P = 0. 002). Conclusions: Nocturia and <b>pollakiuria</b> were common micturition symptoms in our participants with PD. Nocturia was associated with depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and severity of PD. <b>Pollakiuria</b> was associated with anxiety and severity of PD. Male patients were more prone to residual urine and <b>pollakiuria...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is rare {{soft tissue}} tumor, and it occurs most {{commonly}} in the pleura. Retroperitoneal SFT is generally found by palpable mass or abdominal distention. Here we report {{a case of}} SFT presenting <b>pollakiuria.</b> Case presentation A 64 -year-old man was referred to our hospital for <b>pollakiuria.</b> Contrasted-enhanced computed tomography revealed a heterogeneously enhanced pelvic tumor of approximately 10 [*]×[*] 8 [*]×[*] 7 [*]cm. Invasion of the surrounding organs, distal metastasis, and lymph node swelling were absent. Therefore, surgical resection was performed. The resected specimen was a 13 [*]×[*] 8 [*]×[*] 5. 5 -cm encapsulated elastic hard tumor weighing 420 [*]g. Histologically, the tumor consisted of oval or spindle cells growing in a random manner in a collagenous matrix. Immunohistochemically, the specimen was positive for CD 34, bcl- 2, as well as vimentin and negative for c-kit. On {{the basis of these}} findings, a retroperitoneal solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) of the pelvis was diagnosed. Conclusion Surgery is the primary treatment for SFT, and pathologically negative margins are important for good prognosis. </p...|$|E

40|$|Polyuria {{is defined}} as the passage of large volumes of diluted urine {{secondary}} to an abnormality of urine concentration. This disorder can result either from deficient secretion of vasopressin (cranial diabetes insipidus), or from renal resistance to vasopressin (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), primary polydipsia, osmotic diuresis, electrolytic disorders or drugs. Suspicion of impaired renal concentration ability can be confirmed by a fluid deprivation test. The administration of exogenous vasopressin allows to clarify the pathogenetic mechanism. Once the mechanism responsible for polyuria has been clarified it is mandatory to search for underlying causes. Treatment of polyuria should be causal, if its origin is known, and/or symptomatic in order to prevent severe dehydration. Symptomatic treatment of cranial diabetes insipidus consists of administering exogenous vasopressin. Salt restriction associated to a combined administration of hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride or hydrochlorothiazide/indomethacin can reduce urine output by 20 to 50 % in case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. <b>Pollakiuria</b> {{is defined as}} a daytime urinary frequency. It can be isolated or may be a manifestation of lower urinary tract infections, bladder instability, nephrolithiasis or concentrated acidic urines. Detailed history and physical examination represent major clues to diagnostic. Therapy of <b>pollakiuria</b> can be causal or symptomatic using anticholinergic drugs or reeducation in case of bladder instability. Nocturia is characterized by voluntary nocturnal micturitions secondary to conditions inducing impaired renal concentration ability, or to heart failure...|$|E

40|$|Establishment of {{asymptomatic}} bacteriuria (ABU) with Escherichia coli 83972 is {{a viable}} prophylactic alternative to antibiotic therapy {{for the prevention of}} recurrent bacterial urinary tract infection in humans. Approximately 2 × 10 (8) viable E. coli 83972 cells were introduced into the bladder of six healthy female dogs via a sterile urinary catheter. The presence of pyuria, depression, stranguria, <b>pollakiuria</b> and haematuria was documented for 6 weeks and urinalysis and aerobic bacterial cultures were performed every 24 - 72 h. Pyuria was present in all dogs on day 1 post-inoculation and 4 / 6 dogs (67 %) had a positive urine culture on this day. Duration of colonization ranged from 0 to 10 days (median 4 days). Four dogs were re-inoculated on day 20. Duration of colonization following the second inoculation ranged from 1 to 3 days. No dog suffered pyrexia or appeared systemically unwell but all dogs initially exhibited mild <b>pollakiuria</b> and a small number displayed gross haematuria and/or stranguria. By day 3 of each trial all clinical signs had resolved. Persistent bacteriuria was not achieved in any dog but two dogs were colonized for 10 days following a single inoculation.

30|$|Bladder {{symptoms}} are divided in irritative and obstructive. The first ones can be presented as an overactive bladder syndrome, which involves an overexcited detrusor muscle, which cause urgency, <b>pollakiuria,</b> nocturia and urgency incontinence. Obstructive {{symptoms are}} related to a pseudo-obstructive bladder, which represent a late phase of the diabetic neuropathy and are characterized by low uroflowmetry, high postmictional residue, and a hypotonic bladder in the cystometry. The last one reflects a myogenic alteration of the neuronal and microvasculature. These pseudo-obstructive symptoms include a decreased size and strength of the voiding flow, terminal dribbling, decreased sensation of a full bladder and high post void residual urine (very similar to those seen in the benign prostate hyperplasia) (Daneshgari et al. 2009; Liu and Daneshgari 2006).|$|E
