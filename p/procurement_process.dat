5|$|After a whistle-blower {{reported}} that the MSDF's preference had been improperly changed an investigation was launched. On December 16 2016 the Japanese Ministry of Defense (the Defense Agency having been upgraded to a ministry in 2007) stated {{that it had not}} confirmed lobbying efforts but the ministry admonished Tomohisa Takei, the JMSDF chief of staff, for mentioning the MCH-101 by name during the <b>procurement</b> <b>process</b> to his subordinates.

The public tender was launched in May 2005, and on 22 December 2006 the contract was signed with Nokia Siemens Networks. The project is the largest single information technology contract ever awarded in Norway. The Directorate for Emergency Communication was established on 1 April 2007.|$|E

It was passed, in 2001, by {{the city and county}} councils, as well as the Norwegian Parliament. Oslo Package 2 allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and toll road revenue to finance, among other things, new trains for the metro. The initial order by Oslo Sporveier was for 33 units (or 99 cars), and was approved by the board on 28 June 2003. The initial order cost NOK1.6 billion, and included options for further orders. Five other manufactures had been rejected during the <b>procurement</b> <b>process.</b> Combined with other investments in the network, the new trains will allow faster travel times on the metro.|$|E

5|$|The TSR-2 was {{the victim}} of ever-rising costs and inter-service squabbling over Britain's future defence needs, which led to the {{controversial}} decision to scrap the programme in 1965. With the election of a new government, the TSR-2 was cancelled due to rising costs, in favour of purchasing an adapted version of the General Dynamics F-111, a decision that itself was later rescinded as costs and development times increased. The replacements included the Blackburn Buccaneer and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, both of which had previously been considered and rejected early in the TSR-2 <b>procurement</b> <b>process.</b> Eventually, the smaller swing-wing Panavia Tornado was developed and adopted by a European consortium to fulfil broadly similar requirements to the TSR-2.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as an}} SDSR, the Conservative Party pledged in 2010 to {{undertake}} a fundamental and far reaching review of the <b>procurement</b> <b>process</b> and how defence equipment is provided in Britain.

25|$|When {{it became}} clear that new {{helicopters}} were desperately needed to replace the Sea King, the Liberal government began a slow <b>procurement</b> <b>process</b> that critics accused of being deliberately tailored to prevent the selection of the EH-101. The government continually modified the replacement project's terms, dubbed the Maritime Helicopter Project. The project was divided into two sections, with distinct airframe and integrated mission systems components. The two-parts approach was attacked from all sides; opponents insisted that separating the major MHP components would only raise total costs. Public Works insistence on “lowest-cost compliant” bids failed to help the situation. In December 2002, the new Minister of National Defence, John McCallum, reversed ‘two-part’ approach, opting “to proceed with a single contract rather than two”. However, this decision was criticized, often by the same elements who had attacked the earlier decision to split the MHP contest, as the <b>procurement</b> <b>process</b> was forced to restart.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{organizations}} often {{deal with}} a <b>procurements</b> <b>process</b> when purchasing system solutions from different suppliers. Many of these organizations either lack the knowledge, experience, or {{the time needed to}} successfully manage <b>procurements</b> <b>processes.</b> This research addresses the role of brokers in such processes, i. e., organizations mediating knowledge between customers and IT suppliers. A main concern for these brokers is managing knowledge flow across boundaries between different stakeholders. The management of knowledge is particularly challenging in requirements engineering processes involving different stakeholders who have distinctive understandings and perspectives of information system development. This thesis presents findings from a single case study in which a consulting firm providing broker services for eliciting and translating client's requirements in <b>procurement</b> <b>processes</b> of system solutions has been investigated. The empirical investigation was conducted through interviews with seven consultants from the firm North Consulting. It focused on formal processes, perceived key challenges, and applied problem solving methods. The contributions of the thesis lie primarily in three important findings: identification of competencies required to successfully broker knowledge in <b>procurement</b> <b>processes,</b> challenges in managing such processes, and, explication of methods, tools, and documents applied to overcome the challenges.   The external partner has choosen to cooperate anonymously. / Den externa samarbetspartnern har valt att delta anonymt. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{scrapping}} of B-36s {{began in}} February 1956. Once replaced by B-52s, they were flown directly from operational squadrons to Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, where the Mar-Pak Corporation handled their reclamation and destruction. Defense cutbacks in FY 1958 compelled the B-52 <b>procurement</b> <b>process</b> {{to be stretched}} out and the B-36 service life to be extended. The B-36s remaining in service were supported with components scavenged from aircraft sent to Davis-Monthan. Further update work was undertaken by Convair at San Diego (Specialized Aircraft Maintenance, SAM-SAC) until 1957 to extend the life and capabilities of the B-36s. By December 1958 only 22 B-36Js were still operational.|$|E
