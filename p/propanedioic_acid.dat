40|$|AbstractButylmalonate (butyl <b>propanedioic</b> <b>acid)</b> is a slow-binding {{inhibitor}} of porcine renal aminoacylase I (EC 3. 5. 1. 14), causing transients {{of activity}} with half-times {{of more than}} 10 min. At 25 °C and pH 7. 0, the dissociation rate of the complex is approximately 6 × 10 − 4 s− 1, while the rate constant of complex formation is {{in the order of}} 20 M− 1 ·s− 1.

40|$|Decomposition of aqueous monochloropropionic acids (MCPAs) was {{investigated}} {{by means of}} anodic contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE). With the decay of MCPAs, the corresponding total organic carbon (TOC) also decreased smoothly. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} chlorine atoms in the MCPAs were released as chloride ions. As the main by-products, oxalic acid and formic acid were detected. The acetic acid (CA), monochloroacetic acid (MCA), and <b>propanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> (PDA) were also detected as the primary intermediates for decomposition of the corresponding MCPAs. The decay of both MCPAs and TOC obeyed the first-order kinetics, respectively. The apparent rate constant for the decay of MCPAs increased with the increase in pKa values of MCPAs, while that for the decay of TOC was substantially unaffected. The reaction pathway involving the successive attack of hydroxyl radical and the carbon chain cleavage were discussed based on the products and kinetics...|$|E
40|$|Evasion of complement-mediated {{killing is}} a common {{phenotype}} for {{many different types of}} pathogens, but the mechanism is still poorly understood. Most of the clinic isolates of Edwardsiella tarda, an important pathogen infecting both of human and fish, are commonly found serum-resistant. To explore the potential mechanisms, we applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) -based metabolomics approaches to profile the metabolomes of E. tarda EIB 202 in {{the presence or absence of}} serum stress. We found that tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was greatly enhanced in the presence of serum. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and enzyme activity assays validated this result. Furthermore, exogenous succinate that promotes the TCA cycle increased serum resistance, while TCA cycle inhibitors (bromopyruvate and <b>propanedioic</b> <b>acid)</b> that inhibit TCA cycle, attenuated serum resistance. Moreover, the enhanced TCA cycle increased membrane potential, thus decreased the formation of membrane attack complex at cell surface, resulting serum resistance. These evidences suggested a previously unknown membrane potential-dependent mechanism of serum resistance. Therefore, our findings reveal that pathogen mounts a metabolic trick to cope with the serum complement-mediated killing...|$|E

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{concentrations of}} 47 carboxylic acids in the semivolatile and particle phases are quantified in the Los Angeles area, {{as part of}} a larger study of the vapor-phase, semivolatile, and particle-phase organic compounds. Variations in the spatial and temporal distributions of acid concentrations are analyzed to determine whether atmospheric formation or primary emissions are responsible for the observed levels. Relatively low molecular weight aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (e. g., butanedioic acid, hexanedioic acid, and <b>propanedioic</b> <b>acid)</b> and some n-alkanoic acids (e. g., n-octanoic acid and n-nonanoic acid) are found at an offshore sampling location at levels comparable to urban area concentrations indicating that these compounds or their atmospheric precursors may be derived from long-range transport or natural background sources. Some aromatic carboxylic acids (e. g., benzoic acid and 1, 2 -benzenedicarboxylic acid) have spatial and temporal distributions suggesting that formation from anthropogenic emissions of gaseous precursors dominates their atmospheric concentrations. Additionally, the distributions of aliphatic carboxylic acid concentrations known to be emitted from primary sources (e. g., hexadecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid) are consistent with direct emissions as the dominant source of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Scent-marking is {{the most}} {{effective}} method of communication in {{the presence or absence of}} a signaler. These complex mixtures result in a multifaceted interaction triggered by the sense of smell. The objective was to identify volatile organic compound (VOC) composition and odors emitted by total marking fluid (MF) associated with Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica). Siberian tiger, an endangered species, was chosen because its MF had never been analyzed. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) for headspace volatile collection combined with multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry for simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses were used. Thirty-two VOCs emitted from MF were identified. 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline, the sole previously identified compound responsible for the “characteristic” odor of P. tigris MF, was identified along with two additional compounds confirmed with standards (urea, furfural) and four tentatively identified compounds (3 -methylbutanamine, (R) - 3 -methylcyclopentanone, <b>propanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> and 3 -hydroxybutanal) as being responsible for the characteristic aroma of Siberian tiger MF. Simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses improved characterization of scent-markings and identified compounds not previously reported in MF of other tiger species. This research will assist animal ecologists, behaviorists, and zookeepers in understanding how scents from specific MF compounds impact tiger and wildlife communication and improve management practices related to animal behavior.

40|$|Background/Aims: Motility is {{a feature}} of many {{pathogens}} {{that contributes to the}} migration and dispersion of the infectious agent. Whether gentamycin has a post-antibiotic effect (PAE) on the swarming and swimming motility of Escherichia coli (E. coli) remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to examine whether short-term pretreatment of sub-inhibitory concentrations of gentamycin alter motility of E. coli and the mechanisms involved therein. Methods: After exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations (0. 8 μg/ml) of gentamicin, the swarming and swimming motility of E. coli was tested in semi-solid media. Real-time PCR was used to detect the gene expression of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). The production of SDH and fumarate by E. coli pretreated with or without gentamycin was measured. Fumarate was added to swarming agar to determine whether fumarate could restore the swarming motility of E. coli. Results: After pretreatment of E. coli with sub-inhibitory concentrations of gentamycin, swarming motility was repressed in the absence of growth inhibition. The expression of all four subunits of SDH was down-regulated, and the intracellular concentration of SDH and fumarate, produced by E. coli, were both decreased. Supplementary fumarate could restore the swarming motility inhibited by gentamycin. A selective inhibitor of SDH (<b>propanedioic</b> <b>acid)</b> could strongly repress the swarming motility. Conclusion: Sub-inhibitory concentrations of gentamycin inhibits the swarming motility of E. coli. This effect is mediated by a reduction in cellular fumarate caused by down-regulation of SDH. Gentamycin may be advantageous for treatment of E. coli infections...|$|E

40|$|In conjoining the {{disciplines}} of ethology and chemistry {{the field of}} Ethochemistry has been instituted. Ethochemistry is an effective tool in conservation efforts of endangered species and the understanding of behavioral patterns across all species. Chemical constituents of scent-markings have an important, yet poorly understood function in territoriality, reproduction, dominance, and impact on evolutionary biology, especially in large mammals. Scent-markings are comprised of semiochemicals which are the key components in biota signaling. Sensory analyses of scent-markings could address knowledge gaps in ethochemistry and provide an insight into the animal‘s sensory perception. The overall objective {{of this research is}} to determine the chemical constituents of the African lion (Panthera leo) and Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) marking fluid scent-markings using simultaneous, state-of-the art chemical and sensory analyses. The specific objectives of this study were to: 1) develop a novel method for the simultaneous chemical and scent identification of lion and tiger marking fluid in its totality and 2) identify the characteristic odorants responsible for the overall scent of lion and tiger marking fluid. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for scent collection from mixed MF and urine and multidimensional gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (mdGC-MS-O) for analyses were used. Simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses with chromatography-olfactometry hyphenation could potentially aid conservation efforts by linking perceived odor, compounds responsible for odor, and resulting behavior. To date, no study reported scent and composition of marking fluid (MF) from P. leo or P. tigris altaica. 2, 5 -Dimethylpyrazine, 4 -methyl phenol, and 3 -methylcyclopentanone were isolated and identified as the three compounds responsible for the characteristic odor of lion MF. Twenty-eight volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from lion MF were identified, adding a new list of compounds previously unidentified in lion urine. In addition, chemicals in nine new compound groups were identified: ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, amines, aromatics, sulfur containing compounds, phenyls, phenols, and acids. Eighty-nine VOCs emitted from tiger MF were identified. Additional odorants besides 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline, i. e. 3 -methylbutanamine, R- 3 -methylcyclopentanone, <b>propanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> urea, furfural, and 3 -hydroxy-butanal were also identified as contributing to the characteristic MF odor. Simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses improved characterization of scent-markings and identified new MF compounds not previously reported in other tiger species. This research will assist animal ecologists, behaviorists, zoo keepers, and conservationists in understanding how scents from specific MF compounds impact great cat communication and improve management practices related to animal behavior in captivity and in the wild. The analytical approach for simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses can be applicable to unlock scent-marking information for other species and potentially aid conservation and management. Likewise, the analytical approach for simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses can be useful to many aspects of animal production systems, such as breeding and behavior...|$|E
40|$|Cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses occur {{across a}} wide {{latitudinal}} range, from temperate to tropical locations in both hemispheres. In the tropics, this association provides {{the foundation for the}} development of highly diverse coral reef ecosystems. Tropical associations are particularly sensitive to thermal variability, however, leading to dysfunction of the relationship and eventual expulsion of the symbiont, known as ‘coral bleaching’. In contrast, temperate associations maintain stable symbiotic relationships in highly fluctuating thermal environments. The reason behind the relative thermal tolerance of temperate associations is still unclear, though the ability to maintain cellular homeostasis through adjustments to metabolic processes is likely a core feature of their resilience. Both a field study and laboratory experiment were conducted to determine the metabolic responses to thermal change of the symbiosis between the temperate anemone Anthopleura aureoradiata and the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. For the field component, A. aureoradiata were collected from Point Halswell in Wellington Harbour in both summer and winter. For the laboratory experiment, specimens collected at Pautahanui inlet were thermally acclimated in the laboratory, after which temperatures were altered over the course of one week to either 8 °C (cold) or 28 °C (hot) and maintained at these temperatures for six weeks. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was then employed to determine the identity and relative quantity {{of a wide range of}} metabolites involved in primary metabolism including organic acids, fatty acids, amino acids and sugars. Based on these data, pathway activity profiling was used to determine the activity of different metabolic pathways both between seasons and in response to cold and heat treatment. A wide range of changes to metabolic processes were observed in both host and symbiont. Photosynthetic capacity was reduced in the symbionts at low temperatures and increased at high temperatures. The only organic acid to be significantly impacted was <b>propanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> which increased in the host in response to cold treatment, potentially related to increased translocation from the symbiont. Altered fatty acid content in both host and symbiont was related to the role of fatty acids as energy sources and storage compounds and in cell signalling processes. Changes in fatty acid-associated metabolic pathways were exemplified by arachidonic acid and linoleic acid metabolism. Alterations to free amino acids and amino acid related pathways in both host and symbiont were associated with their role as antioxidants and osmoprotectants and the catabolism of amino acids for the production of energy. In symbionts only, altered amino acid content was associated with the role of amino acids in the production of alkaloids. Changes in a number of sugar derivatives in both host and symbiont were associated with their role as antioxidants and osmoprotectants. Altered sugar metabolism in the symbiont clearly indicated an increase in the production of energy rich sugar molecules and production of cellular energy in summer/hot conditions and a decrease in winter/cold conditions. Notably impacted pathways included the Calvin cycle, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and oxidative phosphorylation. Patterns of sugar related pathway activity in the host were generally opposite to that observed in the symbiont. Overall, prominent but opposing changes in the host and symbiont were detected in the central carbohydrate and energy metabolic pathways. In general, the activity of these pathways increased in the host in winter/cold conditions and decreased in summer/hot conditions, while in the symbiont the pattern was the opposite. These findings highlight the role of metabolic processes in enabling the persistence of a temperate cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis in the face of large temperature fluctuations. This work provides a foundation upon which a deeper understanding of metabolic functioning in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis can be built and provides a comparative platform for studies of the more thermally sensitive tropical associations...|$|E
