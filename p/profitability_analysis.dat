However, the learning cost associated to this seems to be that many students are unable to understand either the interrelations between the chapters in a financial statement analysis textbook, or the origins of financial information (i. e., financial statements) in applied finance. Thus, the underlying motivation of this teaching note is to highlight the purpose of <b>profitability</b> and growth <b>analysis</b> in financial statement analysis by incorporating the point of value relevance in applied finance. We hope this reduced presentation of valuation and <b>profitability</b> and growth <b>analysis</b> will help students to understand these interrelations.
