5000|$|Back in class, Miss Lawrence {{calls on}} the {{children}} to recite their recitations, {{but it turns out}} that Alfalfa is the only one willing to recite. He stands to recite [...] "The Charge of the Light Brigade," [...] revealing the firecrackers in his back pocket. Using the magnifying glass, Porky trains the light on Alfalfa's <b>pocket,</b> <b>setting</b> off the firecrackers so that by the time Alfalfa reaches the [...] "Cannons to the left of me/Cannons to the right of me/Volleyed and thundered" [...] verses of the poem, the poor boy's backside is on fire. Alfalfa runs around the classroom and then outside where he puts his rear out in a washtub full of cold water. With his mouth hanging open and his eyes closed, he dunks his rear end into the cold water over and over again. He does this as the rest of the class looks on and begins to laugh at the situation. At first he does not notice them, but then he looks over as he continues to dunk. When Alfalfa sees the whole class staring at him, he turns red and is VERY embarrassed, but can't stop dunking because it feels so good.|$|E

Understanding {{the pricing}} behaviour of medical providers in private clinics {{is important for}} the effective regulation of the private sector and ensuring that there is no extortion of patients. There is a global trend to encourage delivery of health services by the private sector reducing the public role to stewardship. Understanding the factors that inﬂuence the price of medical services in an out of <b>pocket</b> <b>setting</b> is important in designing strategies necessary to control the price of medical care. The study investigated the factors that inﬂuenced the price of medical services in Kampala district, Uganda. The respondents reported cost of drugs given to patients (type and dose of drug), other overhead expenditures, type of disease, income status of the patient and need to make proﬁt as factors which influence the price of medical services. On regression analysis, it was found that rent was a signiﬁcant factor on the price of medical services across all disease conditions. It was concluded that governments need to put in place effective regulatory mechanisms to ensure proper functioning of the private health sector...|$|E

The theory was first suggested by Rudy Rucker in his Infinity and the Mind. The details set out in this entry are due to the American mathematician Randall M. Holmes.|$|R

Furthermore, the axiom of infinity guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, namely a set containing the natural numbers. There are alternative set theories, e.g. [...] "general set theory" [...] (GST), Kripke-Platek <b>set</b> theory, and <b>pocket</b> <b>set</b> theory (PST), that deliberately omit the axiom of power set and the axiom of infinity and do not allow the definition of the infinite hierarchy of infinites proposed by Cantor.|$|R

60|$|A {{poor man}} in the town nearest to Knollingwood Hall, who {{combined}} the art of sign-painting with ingenious mechanical occupations, was sent for by Lord Uplandtowers {{to come to the}} Hall on a day in that week when the Countess had gone on a short visit to her parents. His employer made the man understand that the business in which his assistance was demanded was to be considered private, and money insured the observance of this request. The lock of the cupboard was picked, and the ingenious mechanic and painter, assisted by the schoolmaster's sketch, which Lord Uplandtowers had put in his <b>pocket,</b> <b>set</b> to work upon the god-like countenance of the statue under my lord's direction.
