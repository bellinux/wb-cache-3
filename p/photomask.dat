25|$|Initially PCBs were {{designed}} manually {{by creating a}} <b>photomask</b> on a clear mylar sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were {{laid out on the}} mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on dry transfers of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. To fabricate the board, the finished <b>photomask</b> was photolithographically reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copper-clad boards.|$|E
25|$|Photoengraving uses a <b>photomask</b> and {{developer}} to selectively {{remove a}} UV-sensitive photoresist coating and thus create a photoresist mask. Direct imaging techniques are sometimes used for high-resolution requirements. Experiments {{were made with}} thermal resist.|$|E

50|$|Lithographic <b>photomasks</b> are {{typically}} {{transparent fused silica}} blanks covered with a pattern defined with a chrome metal-absorbing film. <b>Photomasks</b> are used at wavelengths of 365 nm, 248 nm, and 193 nm. <b>Photomasks</b> have also been developed for other forms of radiation such as 157 nm, 13.5 nm (EUV), X-ray, electrons, and ions; but these require entirely new materials for the substrate and the pattern film.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{intends to}} develop a {{measurement}} system to characterize <b>photomasks</b> for 193 nm lithography applications. Based on the VUV spectrophotometer at the Fraunhofer IOF institute, some modifications have been addressed to fulfil these special measurements.

25|$|Microlithography and {{nanolithography}} refer {{specifically to}} lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography {{is one of}} these methods, often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated <b>photomask</b> or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.|$|E
25|$|Reducing defects on extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) masks is currently {{one of the}} most critical issues to be addressed for commercialization of EUV lithography. Defects can be buried underneath or within the multilayer stack or be on top of the multilayer stack. Mesas or protrusions form on the sputtering targets used for multilayer deposition, which may fall off as particles during the multilayer deposition. In fact, defects of atomic scale height (0.3–0.5nm) with 100nm FWHM can still be printable by exhibiting 10% CD impact. IBM and Toppan reported at <b>Photomask</b> Japan 2015 that smaller defects, e.g., 50nm size, can have 10% CD impact even with 0.6nm height, yet remain undetectable.|$|E
2500|$|Masks can be {{fabricated}} {{in several}} fashions. [...] The most accurate and expensive masks are those created by electron beam lithography, which provides resolutions {{as fine as}} [...] in resist [...] thick and [...] features in resist [...] thick. [...] An intermediate method is the plated <b>photomask</b> which provides [...] resolution and can be outsourced at a cost {{on the order of}} $1000 per mask. [...] The least expensive method is a direct <b>photomask,</b> which provides [...] resolution in resist [...] thick. [...] In summary, masks can cost between $1000 and $20,000 and take between two weeks and three months for delivery. [...] Due to the small size of the market, each LIGA group typically has its own mask-making capability. [...] Future trends in mask creation include larger formats, from a diameter of [...] to , and smaller feature sizes.|$|E

50|$|Lam {{presently}} {{serves as}} Chairman of Multibeam Corporation, which pioneered {{the development of}} CEBL (complementary electron beam lithography) and DEW (direct electron writing) systems. As conventional optical lithography reaches its limits, the required <b>photomasks</b> become very expensive. CEBL systems {{can be incorporated into}} existing optical lines {{to reduce the number of}} expensive <b>photomasks</b> required for certain critical layers.|$|R
50|$|The {{possibility}} of copying by photographing each layer {{of an integrated}} circuit and preparing <b>photomasks</b> for its production {{on the basis of}} the photographs obtained is a reason for the introduction of legislation for the protection of layout-designs. The Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 established intellectual property protection for <b>photomasks</b> used to produce integrated circuits.|$|R
2500|$|EUVL is a {{significant}} departure from the deep ultraviolet lithography standard. All matter absorbs EUV radiation. Hence, EUV lithography requires a vacuum. All optical elements, including the <b>photomask,</b> must use defect-free Mo/Si multilayers that act to reflect light by means of interlayer interference; any one of these mirrors absorb around 30% of the incident light.|$|E

5000|$|It is also {{possible}} for an entirely above-board corporation's technology base to be covertly and untraceably tainted by external agents (hackers), though this level of sophistication is thought to exist mainly {{at the level of}} nation state actors. For example, if a <b>photomask</b> obtained from a <b>photomask</b> supplier differs in a few gates from its <b>photomask</b> specification, a chip manufacturer would be hard-pressed to detect this if otherwise functionally silent; a covert rootkit running in the <b>photomask</b> etching equipment could enact this discrepancy unbeknown to the <b>photomask</b> manufacturer, either, and by such means, one backdoor potentially leads to another.

50|$|A contact printer, the {{simplest}} exposure system, puts a <b>photomask</b> in {{direct contact with}} the wafer and exposes it to a uniform light. A proximity printer puts a small gap between the <b>photomask</b> and wafer. In both cases, the mask covers the entire wafer, and simultaneously patterns every die.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, a <b>photomask</b> is purchased/generated, which {{consists}} of opaque Chromium patterns on a transparent glass plate. A sample (or [...] "substrate") is coated with a thin film of UV-sensitive photoresist. The sample is then placed underneath the <b>photomask,</b> and pressed into [...] "contact" [...] against it. The sample is [...] "exposed", during which UV light is then shone from the top side of the <b>photomask.</b> Photoresist lying beneath transparent glass is exposed, and becomes able to be dissolved by a developer, while photoresist lying under Chrome did not receive any UV exposure and will remain intact after developing.Thus the pattern may be transferred from the <b>photomask</b> to a sample, {{in the form of}} photo-sensitive resist. The pattern may then be permanently transferred into the substrate via any number of microfabrication processes, such as etching or lift-off. A single <b>photomask</b> may be used many times to repeatably reproduce a pattern onto different substrates.A [...] "Contact Aligner" [...] is generally used to perform this operation, so that previous patterns on a substrate may be aligned to the pattern one wants to expose.|$|E

A particular application of the feedback system is towards the production of beam-shaping masks. When placed in the unfocussed path for the photomask-patterning system, they can improve {{the consistency of the}} grayscale patterns by altering the laser to have a more uniform “top-hat ” power distribution. The feedback system aids the production of beam-shaping masks since the processes of patterning, verifying, and using the mask are all performed using the same wavelength. In developing the feedback system, two methods were examined for verifying grayscale patterns. The first utilizes the mask-patterning system’s focused beam along with two photodiode sensors; the second utilizes image analysis techniques on lower resolution microscope images. The completed feedback design would also account for drifts in the laser power used to pattern the bimetallic thin-film <b>photomasks...</b>|$|R
