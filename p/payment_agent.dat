40|$|While {{software}} {{agents have}} been employed in payment protocols, they are largely passive entities, i. e., {{they participate in}} the payment protocol but do not make decision. In this paper, we propose an agent-assisted payment protocol called LITESET/A+ that empowers the <b>payment</b> <b>agent</b> (PA) to perform encryption operation for its owner. This is realized by introducing a Trusted Third Party (TTP) in the payment system based on the SET protocol (Secure Electronic Transaction) and a novel signcryption-threshold scheme. In LITESET/A+, the PA and TTP collaborate together to ensure {{the same level of}} security as the SET specification. At the same time, with the signcryptionthreshold scheme, the PA is more flexible and autonomous during trading...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} mechanism design without <b>payments</b> when <b>agents</b> {{have different}} types of preferences. Contrary to most settings in the literature where agents have the same preference, e. g. in the facility location games all agents would like {{to stay close to}} (or away from) the facility, we demonstrate the limitation of mechanism design without <b>payments</b> when <b>agents</b> have different preferences by introducing exchanging phases. We consider two types of exchanging phases. The first model is called central exchanges where the exchanges are performed by a central authority. The other model is called individual exchanges where agents exchange their outcomes by themselves. By using facility location games as an example, we provide a truthful mechanism that optimizes social welfare in central exchanges. We also provide a universally truthful randomized mechanism that achieves at least a half of the optimal social welfare in individual exchanges...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{architecture}} called InterPay for managing financial interactions with for-pay digital library services. The approach accommodates multiple payment mechanisms, interaction models, and charging policies. Key components of our model are <b>payment</b> <b>agents</b> and <b>payment</b> capabilities that encapsulate payment {{policy and the}} details of payment {{on behalf of the}} user. Collection agents and collection capabilities provide similar encapsulation for the service provider. The architecture supports interactions ranging from individual users directly interacting with the service provider to institutional users accessing information brokers via a corporate library. We also describe a prototype system that implements the InterPay architecture, allowing access to real services under varying payment policies. 1 Introduction In an ideal world, access to information and services would be free. However, collecting and providing access to information and services is expensive and these costs must b [...] ...|$|R
