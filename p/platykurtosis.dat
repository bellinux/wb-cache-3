40|$|Both {{the similar}} and {{different}} effects of freezing drizzle, sleet and snow on microphysical properties of supercooled fog were analyzed for fourteen events during a comprehensive wire icing, fog, and precipitation observation experiment conducted at Enshi radar station (30 ° 17 ′N, 109 ° 16 ′E; 1722 m a. s. l.) on a hilltop in Shibanling, Hubei, China. Liquid precipitation is {{in a relatively}} stable form in mountainous areas. Short-term precipitation (1 – 3 h) is dominant with temperature below 0 °C. The wet scavenging effect of freezing drizzle on small fog droplets with a size range less than 6 – 12 μm is weak but is stronger for fog droplets with a larger size, which is opposite {{to the effects of}} solid precipitation, broadening the fog droplet spectra significantly. As the fog droplet diameter increases, the distributions of droplet spectra change from leptokurtosis to <b>platykurtosis</b> and from positive skewness to negative skewness. Occurrence of freezing drizzle would improve the positive correlation of N-r in dissipation and oscillation periods, resulting in the N-r relationship having a weak negative correlation in the maturity period, and resulting in the transition of the N-L and N-r relationships into positive correlations in the development period. Meanwhile, the emergence of solid precipitation particles would result in negative values for the correlation coefficients of N-L and N-r. The change in relationships among the microphysical properties was caused by the occurrence of different phase precipitation, showing the influence on the main microphysical mechanisms of supercooled fog...|$|E
