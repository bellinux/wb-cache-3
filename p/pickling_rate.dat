40|$|L 1 W 2 x 9 In {{the metal}} {{finishing}} industries solutions of strong mineral acids (sulfuric, nitric, hydrochloric) {{are used to}} remove surface oxides that impair subsequent manufacturing operations. To a large degree these oxides are dissolved by the acids and as the concentration of dissolved metals increases there is a corresponding decrease in free acid concentrations. Although fresh acid {{can be added to}} the solution to make up for this, the oxide removal (<b>pickling)</b> <b>rate</b> generally decreasds when the metals concentrat ion increases.

40|$|In this report, the {{relation}} between the oxide formation and the pickling behaviour of duplex stainless steels is investigated. A duplex stainless steel 2205 (EN 1. 4462), and two single phases, ferritic and austenitic stainless steels with the same composition as the phases inside the 2205, have been annealed. The surface and composition of the oxide have been analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDS), focused ion beam (FIB) and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES). The thickness of the oxide scales increased when the annealing time and temperature were increased. The ferritic stainless steel has the thickest oxide, whereas the austenitic has the thinnest one. Nodules {{in the middle of the}} grains and thick oxides on the grain boundaries are observed on the austenitic stainless steel but also in a lower content on the austenitic phase of duplex stainless steel. The oxide scale on the 2205 is not homogenous, showing different types of oxide depending on the phase. The pickling behaviour of the same samples is also reviewed: oxide surface study and relative weight loss is discussed. The austenitic stainless steel has the highest <b>pickling</b> <b>rate,</b> followed by the 2205 and the ferritic stainless steel respectively. The oxide on the austenitic stainless steel is spalled from the surface mostly on the zones where nodules are placed, whereas the oxide on the ferritic stainless steel is dissolved during the process. The 2205 exhibit a mixture of both pickling behaviours: some grains are pickled fast, whereas in others the oxide still remains on the surface. The existence of thicker oxide on the top of grain boundaries, iron-enriched nodules with a porous structure, thick chromium depleted region and non protective silicon oxide could be attributed to the faster <b>pickling</b> <b>rate</b> on the austenitic stainless steel and the austenitic phase regions on the 2205.

50|$|Acid {{cleaning}} has {{limitations in}} {{that it is difficult to}} handle because of its corrosiveness, and it is not applicable to all steels. Hydrogen embrittlement becomes a problem for some alloys and high-carbon steels. The hydrogen from the acid reacts with the surface and makes it brittle and causes cracks. Because of its high reactance to treatable steels, acid concentrations and solution temperatures must be kept under control to assure desired <b>pickling</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steels (SS) are alloys {{widely used in}} many applications where high corrosion resistance materials are required, e. g., petrochemicals industries. The influence of iron (ferric) ions in the pickling of AISI 316 L SS was studied using an environmentally-friendly chemical treatment based on sulfuric-hydrofluoric peroxide mixtures. p-Toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA) had {{a positive influence on}} H 2 O 2 stabilization during the first 4 days of experimentation. Temperature and the stirring parameter in the pickling bath had a negative effect on H 2 O 2 stability. Ferric ions had a negative effect on H stability, and a threshold might be defined above which the H 2 O 2 loss increased. Pickling of AISI 316 L SS could be performed using the environmentally-friendly H 2 O 2 mixture. The AISI 316 L SS <b>pickling</b> <b>rate</b> decreased from 2. 6 mg/sq dm day (mdd) in the absence of ferric ions to 0. 2 mdd in the presence of 40 g/L ferric ions for 1 hr at 50 °C.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} utilization of ecological bath solutions for the pickling of stainless steel (SS), because conventional nitric (HNO 3) and hydrofluoric (HF) acid mixtures generate high NOx emissions. A mixture of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4), and HF has been tested in this study as an environmentally friendly pickling solution for AISI 316 L SS (UNS S 31603. The decomposition of H 2 O 2 and the H 2 SO 4 -HF-H 2 O 2 mixture was assessed at different temperatures from 25 °C to 60 °C, with ferric ion contents from 0 to 40 g/L, with and without stirring of the aqueous acid mixture. Me p-Toluene sulfonic, 3 -hydroxybenzoic, and 4 -dodecylbenzene sulfonic acids were tested as stabilizers for H 2 O 2. The AISI 316 L SS <b>pickling</b> <b>rate</b> found at 50 °C was 2. 35 × 103 mg/dm 2 -day (mdd) and 0. 12 × 103 mdd, respectively, in the absence and presence of 40 g/L ferric ion. © 2005, NACE International.

40|$|Stainless steels {{were first}} {{developed}} in the early 20 th century and have since then emerged as a very diverse class of engineering materials. Along with steels having new combinations of properties, there is a continuous development of new technologies allowing the material to be produced in a faster and more energy effcient manner. A prerequisite for new technologies to be adapted quicklyis a fundamental understanding of the microstructure evolution throughout theprocess chain. The {{first part of this}} thesis has been dedicated to the annealing and pickling processes from a process-microstructure perspective. In the second part the concept of utilising crystallographic texture as a way to attain microstructures with new combinations of properties has been evaluated. In the first part, annealing can be regarded as a high temperature oxidation process, resulting in chromium depletion that necessitate subsequent chemical pickling. Chemical pickling, on the other hand, is basically a wet-corrosion process and hence more difficult for highly corrosion-resistant grades. The chromium depleted layer was found to be enriched in austenite in case of duplex stainless steel UNS S 32205 (Paper I) and this may inuence the pickling process. Proper pretreatment like shot-blasting dramatically increases the <b>pickling</b> <b>rate</b> because it provides the pickling acid with access to the chromium depleted layer (Paper II). Oxidation kinetics for S 30400 in conditions relevant to strip annealing {{do not seem to be}} affected by the choice of air/oxygen as oxidiser even though the latter results in substantially higher water content (Paper III). This gives new possibilities regarding both cost savings and increased throughput. In the second part, the effect of crystallographic texture on resistance towards corrosion of S 31603 in a solution of FeCl 3 and AlCl 3 in ethanol/glycerol and in 30 vol% H 2 SO 4 is investigated. In the former, high density surfaces { 1111 } and { 100 } are less prone for pit nucleation, however the effect is relativelysmall. In H 2 SO 4 pronounced crystallographic anisotropy is observed inwhich the corrosion rate increase in the order { 111 } < { 110 } ≤ { 100 } (Paper IV). For corrosion at high temperatures, chromium diffusion is governed by randomhigh angle boundaries with ~ 20 — 55 ° misorientation. The possibilities to alter the texture in austenitic stainless steels by means of warm-rolling and annealing has been evaluated for S 30403 and S 31603. During warm-rolling, both steels develop the copper-type texture in contrast to the brass-type texture observedat room temperature. However only S 30403 is prone to recrytallise cube texture during subsequent annealing (Paper V). QC 20150121 </p...|$|E
