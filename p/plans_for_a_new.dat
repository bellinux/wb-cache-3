5|$|In 2005, after {{retiring}} from business {{to focus on}} his horse racing career, Borislow set forth <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> voice-over-IP business, with an initial name of Talk4free. He created YMAX Communications Corporation in April 2006 as a communications and equipment service. YMAX's profits come from {{the production of the}} magicJack, a small device which can be plugged into a computer's USB port and allows for unlimited calling from regular telephones.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> two-tier {{stand to}} the north and east were {{presented}} next. The plans had called for 24,500 sitting places in the new and south stands, and 5,500 standing places in the west stand. However, in 1989, the plans were modified, as the FIFA made new rules, requiring that only seating places could be used for international qualification matches from 1992. It was thereby decided that Ullevaal would become an all-seater.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{to connect}} Ottawa with Bancroft {{arose in the}} mid-1950s. When the {{province}} designated Highway132 in January 1956, they also announced <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> highway which would travel south from Renfrew to Calabogie, then turn west towards Denbigh and Bancroft. Ultimately this road was never constructed, but new road links were established in the following years regardless.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the first}} <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Interstate Highway freeway, {{bypassing}} I-405, surfaced in 1968. The first proposal {{was to create a}} new highway between I-405 and the west banks of Lake Sammamish. Residents however forced the highway to the east banks of the lake after voicing their concerns. Residents {{on the east side of}} the lake voiced similar concerns and the plan was later dropped.|$|E

In 2012, the city council approved <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> $10 million library, but ballot measures backed by the group Save Gladstone blocked the financing and construction pending specific voter approval. The city then placed a new measure on the November 2014 ballot for a $6.4 million option.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Start {{has played}} their home games at Kristiansand Stadion, a {{municipal}} multi-purpose stadium. In May 2005, the municipal council approved the <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> stadium for Start.

5|$|A {{grant of}} £650,000 funded the {{construction}} of a technology centre with a computer suite, which opened in January 1993. <b>Plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> sports hall were first discussed in 1990, but they only came to fruition in 1996, when Northgate Sports Hall opened. The Sports Council and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts donated £250,000 towards its construction; this was matched by North Kesteven District Council, while Carre's raised £50,000 towards the building work. An all-weather pitch at the school opened in 2007; it cost £649,000 to lay, half of which was met by the Football Foundation. A building programme costing £835,000 provided the school with food technology facilities and a two-storey Fitness Suite, which were opened in March 2011.|$|E

5|$|After the {{construction}} was complete {{there was no}} further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games. The club began to make <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> stadium. The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place {{under the auspices of}} Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1999, the St. Louis Cardinals began {{pushing for the}} {{construction}} of a new Busch Stadium as part of a broader trend in Major League Baseball toward stadium building. In early 2002, <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> park were settled among state and local leaders and Cardinals owners. According to an agreement in which the state and city would issue bonds for construction, the Cardinals agreed to build a multipurpose development known as St. Louis Ballpark Village on part of the site of Busch Memorial Stadium. The new stadium opened in 2006, and groundbreaking for Ballpark Village took place in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|Constantine the Great {{effectively}} {{became the}} emperor {{of the whole}} of the Roman Empire in September 324. Two months later, he laid out the <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> Christian city to replace Byzantium. As the eastern capital of the empire, the city was named Nova Roma; most called it Constantinople, a name that persisted into the 20th century. On 11 May 330, Constantinople was proclaimed the capital of the Roman Empire, which was later permanently divided between the two sons of Theodosius I upon his death on 17 January 395, when the city became the capital of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.|$|E

Soon {{after this}} dramatic event, and while the church was still in mourning, the Right Reverend William Grant Broughton was installed as Bishop of Australia during a service in St James' lasting five hours. Since Macquarie's <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> cathedral on George Street had not come to fruition, Broughton acted as if St James' were a pro-cathedral. Robert Cartwright and then Napoleon Woodd succeeded Richard Hill at St James'.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Thin Lizzy worked {{together}} again, with Sykes and Gorham bringing in ex-Angel bassist Randy Gregg, and drummer Michael Lee, {{who had played}} with Robert Plant and The Cult among others. They toured in North America in both the winter and then the summer as special guests of Deep Purple. This line-up proved temporary however, with Mendoza returning in 2005, and Aldridge returning in 2007. There were no <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> album though Thin Lizzy continued to tour. At the London Hammersmith Apollo concert of 13 December 2007, the line-up was Sykes, Gorham, Aldridge and Francesco DiCosmo on bass.|$|E
5|$|In {{his brief}} retirement, {{he focused on}} his horse racing career, sending Talk is Money to the 2001 Kentucky Derby {{although}} the thoroughbred did not complete the race. Borislow's most successful horse yet has been Toccet, who won four graded stakes, among which are the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002. After selling most of his horses in 2004, Borislow set forth <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> voice-over-IP business which became the magicJack. Invented in 2007, the magicJack is a small product which can be plugged into a computer's USB port and allows for unlimited calling from regular telephones.

5|$|Kenney Jones {{replaced}} Moon and {{the group}} resumed activity, releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1982. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25thanniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996–1997. They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing Endless Wire in 2006, and continued to play live regularly.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's Zelda team {{initiated}} <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> game {{early in}} the development of the GameCube system, before Majora's Mask was completed for the Nintendo 64 in 2000. Eiji Aonuma, director of Majora's Mask, returned to helm the project, while Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka served as producers. Early concepts generally followed Ocarina of Times designs, with graphics enhanced for the new system's capabilities. The team hastily created a brief clip of Link fighting Ganondorf for a demonstration at the 2000 Space World exposition, where Nintendo announced the GameCube. The clip resonated with fans and commentators who hoped it previewed the next Zelda title.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations.

Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and {{there would have been a}} leaning tower to the side of the building. The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E
