40|$|ABSTRACT 2 - and 3 -wheelers with 2 -S {{propulsion}} {{are still}} a very serious source of air pollution worldwide in many urban areas. Therefore every effort to reduce the emissions of those vehicles is {{an important contribution to}} improve the air quality. In the present work detailed investigations of limited emission compounds and of particle emissions of 2 -stroke scooters with direct injection and with carburator were performed. To demonstrate the emission reduction potentials some possibilities of emission improvements were combined in steps. These technical measures were: o	Higher tier lube oils o	Lower oil dosing o	Active oxidation catalyst o	Supplementary filtration & oxidation 	devise (WFC) **) o	Special fuel. The particle mass and nanoparticles, which are amply present in the 2 -stroke exhaust gas and which contribute strongly to the toxicity level are still unlimited by the international exhaust gas legislation. They were extensively investigated in the present project series. It was impressively demonstrated, that a strong reduction of particle emissions and toxicity is possible by means of a combination of these technical measures. There are also further possibilities of improvements, like total filtration, or use of alternative fuels. All those technical measures can be effective for the vehicles on the road only if the necessary market conditions will be created like: incentives for better products, <b>production</b> <b>conformity</b> control, in-use compliance control, public information and others.

40|$|The large (26 -fold {{over the}} past 25 years) {{increase}} in the on-road vehicle fleet in China has raised sustainability concerns regarding air pollution prevention, energy conservation, and climate change mitigation. China has established integrated emission control policies and measures since the 1990 s, including implementation of emission standards for new vehicles, inspection and maintenance programs for in-use vehicles, improvement in fuel quality, promotion of sustainable transportation and alternative fuel vehicles, and traffic management programs. As a result, emissions of major air pollutants from on-road vehicles in China have peaked and are now declining despite increasing vehicle population. As might be expected, progress in addressing vehicle emissions {{has not always been}} smooth and challenges such as the lack of low sulfur fuels, frauds over <b>production</b> <b>conformity</b> and in-use inspection tests, and unreliable retrofit programs have been encountered. Considering the high emission density from vehicles in East China, enhanced vehicle, fuel and transportation strategies will be required to address vehicle emissions in China. We project the total vehicle population in China to reach 400 - 500 million by 2030. Serious air pollution problems in many cities of China, in particular high ambient PM 2. 5 concentration, have led to pressure to accelerate the progress on vehicle emission reduction. A notable example is the draft China 6 emission standard released in May 2016, which contains more stringent emission limits than those in the Euro 6 regulations, and adds a real world emission testing protocol and a 48 -h evaporation testing procedure including diurnal and hot soak emissions. A scenario (PC[1]) considered in this study suggests that increasingly stringent standards for vehicle emissions could mitigate total vehicle emissions of HC, CO, NO X and PM 2. 5 in 2030 by approximately 39...|$|E
40|$|O presente estudo objetivou avaliar os impactos socioeconômicos e ambientais da implantação de uma tecnologia social conhecida como a Tecnologia de Produção Agroecológica Integrada e Sustentável (PAIS). O ensaio foi conduzido no Distrito Federal, onde se avaliaram 26 agricultores familiares que foram divididos em três grupos: o Grupo A, que incluiu os produtores que tiveram uma avaliação de conformidade de produção orgânica e vários canais de comercialização; o Grupo B que agrupou os produtores em processo de transição agroecológica, sem certificação; e o Grupo C que considerou os produtores de subsistência. Usaram-se duas técnicas para a coleta de dados: a primeira delas foram dois questionários, visando avaliar o grau de transição agroecológica das propriedades e mensurar os ganhos econômicos gerados pela adoção da tecnologia. A segunda técnica incluiu uma entrevista com os produtores utilizando o Sistema AMBITEC AGRO – Produção sustentável – desenvolvido pela Embrapa Meio Ambiente, o qual se compõe de planilhas (MSExcel®) organizadas em aspectos gerais, indicadores e variáveis das dimensões socioeconômica e {{ambiental}}, que atribuíram a cada variável um valor que representou a alteração proporcionada pela implantação da tecnologia. A análise estatística incluiu o cálculo da percentagem de impacto da tecnologia (PIT) para cada dimensão, e o teste de Wilconxon, identificando os indicadores mais significativos. O maior impacto encontrado pelo uso da tecnologia foi no aspecto Social apresentando um PIT para o Grupo A de 35, 9 %, Grupo B de 31, 3 %, e para o Grupo C, de 20, 5 %; em função dos indicadores melhora na saúde ambiental e pessoal, maior segurança alimentar, e contribuições no bem estar e saúde animal. O impacto ambiental também apresentou um progresso com a implantação da tecnologia com o PIT para o Grupo A de 24, 8 %, para o Grupo B de 21, 3 %, e para o Grupo C de 17, 3 %; sendo os indicadores mais influenciados, a redução no uso de insumos agrícolas e produtos veterinários, e o aumento na qualidade do solo. O impacto econômico foi o mais variável apresentando um PIT para o Grupo A de 26, 2 %, seguido do Grupo B (20, 4 %), e o Grupo C (10, 7 %). As diferenças que influenciaram positiva ou negativamente a geração de renda das unidades familiares avaliadas poderiam se relacionar com a participação no processo de avaliação da conformidade orgânica, a organização comunitária para facilitar o acesso aos mercados, e a diversificação da produção. Concluiu-se que houve um impacto positivo da implantação da tecnologia nos três grupos, em todas as dimensões avaliadas. _______________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis {{study had}} as objective {{to evaluate the}} socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the implantation of a social technology known as a Sustainable and Integrated Agro-ecological Production (PAIS) technology. Test was run in the Federal District, where 26 familiar farmers were evaluated, who were divided into three groups: Group A, which included the producers who had an evaluation of organic <b>production</b> <b>conformity</b> and several marketing channels; Group B incorporated by the producers in agro-ecological transition process, with no certification; and Group C, which considered the subsistence farmers. Two techniques were used for data collection: The first one was through two questionnaires, looking for to evaluate the agro-ecological transition grade of the properties and to measure the economical benefits generated by the adoption of technology; the second technique consisted of {{an interview with the}} producers, using AMBITEC-AGRO System – sustainable production –, which is composed of organized spreadsheets (MS Excel®) in general aspects, indicators, and variables of the socioeconomic and environmental dimensions, which attributed the each variable a value that represented the change provided by technology implementation. The statistical analysis included the calculus of Percentage of Impact of the Technology (PIT) for each dimension and the Willconxon test for the identification of the most significant indicators. The greatest impact found by the use of technology it was in the social aspect, presenting a PIT for group A of 35, 9 %, for group B of 31, 3 % and for group C of 20, 5 %; depending on the indicators it improves in environmental and personal health, bigger food security, and contributions on the welfare and animal health. Environmental impact also presented a progress with the implantation of technology, with a PIT for group A of 24, 8 %, for group B of 21, 3 % and for group C of 17, 3 %; being the most influenced indicators, the reduction in the use of agricultural inputs and veterinary products, and the increase of soil quality. The economic impact was the most variable, presenting a PIT for group A of 26, 2 %, followed by group B (20, 4 %), and group C (10, 7 %). The differences that influenced positive or negatively the income generation of the evaluated familiar unities, they could relate with the participation in an evaluation process of organic conformity, community organization to facilitate access to markets and diversification of production.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective of}} concrete production {{is to make}} concrete which complies with the specifications and {{to do this in}} an economical way. After an initial test period, a uniform level of performance is aimed for. In order to perform conformity control of concrete strength, the revised version of the European Standard EN 206 - 1 will allow CUSUM control charts to be used in order to detect significant changes in performance. This combined format of <b>production</b> and <b>conformity</b> control allows a continuous monitoring and thus enables producers to make fast adjustments towards the mixing proportions or the constituent materials, {{in order to meet the}} specifications or to reduce costs. A probabilistic framework was developed to assess the operating characteristics of this conformity control scheme based on Monte Carlo simulations. Due to the fact that certain concrete lots are rejected according to the applied conformity inspection scheme, a filter effect with respect to concrete compressive strength distributions occurs, which can be quantified using Bayesian updating techniques. Consequently, this conformity control inherently influences the safety level of concrete structures. The effect of the proposed conformity control scheme for the revision of EN 206 - 1 on the safety level of concrete structures is quantified and its performance is compared to that of the traditional conformity criteria which were used in the European Standard EN 206 - 1...|$|R

40|$|Conformity assessment, a {{relatively}} new activity in the printing industry, is an attestation that specified requirements relating to a product or process have been fulfilled. Printing certification bodies assess printing conformity according to sampling, aim points, tolerances, and decision-making rules that are stipulated by printing standards. However, do we know if: sampling is too large or too small; normative requirements are too many or too few; tolerances are set too tightly or too loosely; and the pass/fail criterion is too stringent or too relaxed? Moreover, how do these factors impact the passing probability of a sample, a job, and the database as a whole? To study inter-dependencies of these factors in <b>production</b> variation <b>conformity,</b> this research assumes {{that the number of}} jobs to be assessed for printing conformity is very large and that samples selected from a job are random. Statistical theory is used to study the relation between the passing probabilities of a printing job, a single sheet within each job, and each normative requirement. In our theoretical frame, given the tolerance levels of certain normative requirements, we can determine the passing probabilities of the criteria, the passing probability of a single sheet, and the overall passing probability of a printing job. Given the passing probability of a printing job, we can also determine the tolerance level of each normative requirement by reversing the procedure. This research uses a real-life printing dataset and simulation techniques to determine the passing probabilities of a job as a function of sampling, tolerances, and the pass/fail criterion of a job. This research offers two meaningful inferences: (1) the printing standards development community, i. e., ISO/TC 130, needs to be aware that sampling requirements, the number of normative requirements and their associated tolerances, and the pass/fail criteria impact the passing probability of a job; and (2) printers who are seeking printing certification need to know that, although sampling is random, the passing probability of a job ultimately depends on the process calibration and the effectiveness of local process control...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} performance based testing methodology for concrete durability and work currently underway jointly at Queens University Belfast and Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, to undertake this research under a EPSRC funded project (EP/G 02152 X/ 1). EN 206 - 1 superseded BS 5328 on 1 st December 2003 and allows designers and producers to use {{a wide range of}} cements and aggregate types for a variety of exposure conditions. In this new standard, the durability of concrete is specified in terms of the constituent materials of concrete, properties of fresh and hardened concrete, limitations for concrete composition, specification of concrete, delivery of fresh concrete, <b>production</b> control procedures, <b>conformity</b> criteria and evaluation of conformity and verification of these properties. Within this, six basic forms of exposure is also specified, namely XO (no risk of corrosion), XC (Corrosion induced by carbonation), XF (Freeze / thaw attack), XS (Corrosion induced by chlorides from seawater), XD (Corrosion induced by chlorides other than from seawater) and XA (Chemical attack). According to EN 206 - 1, the performance method adopted should be based on satisfactory experience with local practices in local environments from data obtained from an established performance test method for the relevant mechanism, or using appropriate proven predictive models. Therefore, the methods that may be used include those methods based on:- · long-term experience of local materials and practices and on detailed knowledge of the local environment. · approved and proven tests that are representative of actual conditions and have approved performance criteria. · analytical models that have been calibrated against test data representative of actual conditions in practice. The concrete composition and the constituent materials should be closely defined to enable the level of performance to be maintained. In order to determine the best methods for assessing concrete durability for performance, it is important to review those methods which have been developed and used in Queens University Belfast and Heriot Watt University to test for permeability, diffusion and absorption as well as electrical methods used to assess if the performance criteria have been achieved in structures using non-destructive testing methods. Prior to specifying durability performance testing methods, a review of previous projects where limits on permeability, diffusion, electrical resistivity etc, are presented along with the various durability tests used to assess these limits. The examples given are from a number of projects in the UK, Ireland and Europe of varying complexity and size. Due to the relatively small number of such examples in the UK and Ireland, the need for the research presented here is further justified. The proposed experimental work for the EPSRC project is presented which includes a breakdown of the concrete samples, tests and details of a new marine exposure site on the Northwest coast of Ireland. Based on the findings of this experimental work and the numerical calibration using the ClinConc model, development of a methodology for testing the concrete durability to assess the performance limits set will be determined.
