5|$|Tourism in Turkey has {{experienced}} {{rapid growth in}} the last twenty years, and constitutes {{an important part of}} the economy. The Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism currently promotes Turkish tourism under the Turkey Home name. At its height in 2014, Turkey attracted around 42 million foreign tourists, ranking as the 6th most popular tourist destination in the world. This number however declined to around 36 million in 2015, deteriorated to around 25 million in 2016 and still further in 2017, due to regional uncertanities, political tension with Russia, terrorist attacks and the unfavorable Erdogan regime image abroad. In 2012, 15 percent of the tourists were from Germany, 11 percent from Russia, 8 percent from the United Kingdom, 5 percent from Bulgaria, 4 <b>percent</b> <b>each</b> from Georgia, the Netherlands and Iran, 3 percent from France, 2 <b>percent</b> <b>each</b> from the United States and Syria, and 40 percent from other countries.|$|E

By May 2004, the company had 300,000 users and was growing 30 <b>percent</b> <b>each</b> month. That September, Cambrian Ventures invested $250,000.

40|$|Driver age, gender, medical conditions, and {{impairments}} in memory, vision, and physical functioning {{as predictors of}} self-limited driving were examined among a sample of 2, 650 drivers 65 and older from Kentucky (n= 1, 337), Connecticut (n= 828), and Rhode Island (n= 485). Drivers were recruited while renewing their driver’s licenses and were interviewed by telephone about their current driving patterns (e. g., whether they self-limit their driving and, if so, how), functional abilities related to driving (vision, memory, physical functioning, and diagnosed medical conditions), transportation options, and driver characteristics. The prevalence of driving-related impairments generally increased with driver age group, and memory impairment and medical conditions were more common than vision or physical functioning impairments among drivers in all three states. Adjusting for several factors including state, gender, and marital status, logistic regression analysis indicated that the likelihood of participants self-limiting their driving was increased by 19 <b>percent</b> with <b>each</b> additional memory impairment item on which they reported increased difficulty compared with 5 years ago, 19 <b>percent</b> with <b>each</b> additional visual impairment item, 32 <b>percent</b> with <b>each</b> additional physical functioning impairment item, and 13 <b>percent</b> with <b>each</b> additional diagnosed medical condition. Drivers 80 and older were {{more than twice as}} likely as drivers ages 65 – 69 to self-limit their driving...|$|R

Membership grew 79 <b>percent</b> <b>each</b> {{year in the}} 2000s due to {{an increasing number of}} practitioners in the field of internal communications. IABC hosted its first annual world conference in 2005 and grew to more than 16,000 members by 2008.

5|$|According to the Address-Based Population Recording System of Turkey, the country's {{population}} was 74.7 {{million people in}} 2011, nearly three-quarters of whom lived in towns and cities. According to the 2011 estimate, the population is increasing by 1.35 <b>percent</b> <b>each</b> year. Turkey has an average population density of 97 people per km². People within the 15–64 age group constitute 67.4 {{percent of the total}} population; the 0–14 age group corresponds to 25.3 percent; while senior citizens aged 65 years or older make up 7.3 percent. In 1927, when the first official census was recorded in the Republic of Turkey, the {{population was}} 13.6 million. The largest city in Turkey, Istanbul, is also the largest city in Europe in population, and the third-largest city in Europe in terms of size.|$|E
5|$|Hamar Sportsanlegg (HSA) was {{established}} in 2003 to execute the plan. It was owned 34 percent by the municipality, and 22 <b>percent</b> <b>each</b> by Ham-Kam, Hamar IL and Storhamar Dragons. In 2004, Storhamar's share was transferred to Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a municipal company which owns Vikingskipet Olympic Arena and Hamar Olympic Amphitheater. A report estimated the technical value of Briskeby to NOK6 million, while the sales price of the lot was estimated at NOK30 million. The municipal council voted on 18 February 2004 to transfer the ownership of the two stadiums to the new company. Ham-Kam rented the venues from HSA, with HSA's deficit {{for the first four}} years being covered by the municipality. Of the NOK20.8 million in value transferred to the company, NOK14.5 million was paid by HSA taking over the municipality's obligation to build a new athletics venue should Hamar stadion be closed, and NOK5 million was debt.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} fire on {{vegetation}} {{in the upper}} encinal woodlands, Santa Catalina Mountains, southeastern Arizona, were studied following a wildfire in July 1995. Similar unburned and burned sites were compared to determine differences (alpha =. 05) for frequency, density, and percent cover of herbs, shrubs, and trees through observations made during early June of 1997 and 1998 (two and three years postfire). For herbs, which showed their opportunistic characters, differences existed for frequency and <b>percent</b> cover <b>each</b> year and density in the third year. For shrubs, due {{to the ability of}} the dominant species, Arctostaphylos pungens (pointleaf manzanita), to rapidly reseed itself, no differences existed for frequency or density each year; but total mortality of mature A. pungens resulted in differences for <b>percent</b> cover <b>each</b> year.

5|$|In December 2006, HSA sold Briskeby {{to a new}} company, Briskeby Gressbane AS (BG), {{which was}} owned 50 <b>percent</b> <b>each</b> by Ham-Kam and HSA. Another company, Briskeby Eiendom 1 AS (BE1), was {{established}} and owned 66 percent by HSA and 34 percent by BG. The latter was also given 50 percent of the shares in Hamar stadion. BG was non-commercial and was to own the stadium itself, while BE1 was commercial and was to rent out the commercial property. The two shared board, managing director and accountant. In May 2007, NCC was awarded the contract to build the new venue by BG and BE1. Although NCC was NOK8 million {{more expensive than the}} cheapest bid, they offered four months shorter construction time. Briskeby's lot needed to be expanded, which was done by purchasing neighbor lots for NOK34 million. Hamar stadion and the neighbor lot Fuglsetmyra were sold for NOK295 million in June 2007, of which NOK9 million was paid to BG and another NOK175 million was a guarantee which would be paid after the lot was re-regulated.|$|E
5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three <b>percent</b> <b>each</b> year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter.
