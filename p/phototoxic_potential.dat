40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of synthetic asymmetric and glycosylated curcuminoids on planktonic model bacteria by counting the colony forming units. The Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli were exposed to aqueous solutions of the curcuminoids (≤ 2. 5 μM) in the presence or absence of selected pharmaceutical excipients (Pluronic® F 127, PEG 400 and HPγCD) in combination with a low irradiation dose (5 J/cm 2). All the asymmetric curcuminoids, but only one of the glycosylated curcuminoids demonstrated substantial phototoxic effect on Enterococcus faecalis (≥ 4. 7 log reduction). Only two of the asymmetric curcuminoids showed a moderate to low phototoxic effect on the more persistent Escherichia coli. This study emphasized that aromatic hydroxyl substituents in the para-position are important to maintain the <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of curcuminoids independent of molecular symmetry. Glycosylation of the aromatic substituents resulted in a substantial loss in phototoxicity towards planktonic bacteria, an apparent change in the non-radiative S 1 -decay process and a weaker interaction with Pluronic® F 127 compared to the non-glycosylated curcuminoids. The selected excipients Pluronic® F 127, PEG 400 and HPγCD strongly influenced the <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of the unsymmetrical, non-glycosylated compounds...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study, human {{keratinocyte}} cell line {{was used as}} in vitro cell culture model to elucidate {{the effects of the}} fatty acid chain length of acylglutamate (amino acid-based surfactant) namely, sodium cocoyl glutamate, sodium lauroyl glutamate, and sodium myristoyl glutamate on their cytotoxicity and the ultraviolet B induced phototoxicity. The endpoint used to assess toxicity was a tetrazolium-based assay whereas, the <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of acylglutamate surfactants was predicted using two models namely, the Photo-Irritation Factor and Mean Photo Effect. The results of this study showed that the fatty acid chain length of acylglutamate greatly influences toxic effects on human keratinocyte cells. In addition, all the acylglutamate surfactants tested on human keratinocyte cells demonstrated significantly less cytotoxicity (when irradiated and non-irradiated with ultraviolet B light; p < 0. 05) and no <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> was observed in any of the acylglutamate surfactants, when compared with the positive control chlorpromazine. In conclusion, the in vitro studies confirm the suitability of sodium lauroyl glutamate destined for the synthesis and stabilization of lipid nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|Until very {{recently}} time, we carried out some studies for {{the determination of}} the <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of chemicals, using to the animals, but there was no a guide for these purposes. With the development of the Alternative Toxicology there were established several procedures among which we can mention 3 T 3 Neutral Red (3 T 3 NRU). However other methods exist, very useful for the procedures of screening of the <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of the chemists or finished products by the skill of these to interact with the red blood cells and / or to oxidize to the hemoglobin under the effects of the Ultraviolet and visibly light. In studies realized with erythrocytes of other species one found the feasibility of the utilization of the blood of rate, for what we use the protocol 81 of the In Vitro Toxicity (INVITTOX), with this one modification. The Chlorpromazine and the Sodium Duodecyl Sulphate took like controls positively and negatively respectively. The obtained results indicated that neither none of the used perfumes was showing effects photohemolityc. These results allow us to raise that 10 perfumes of National are not potentially phototoxic for the human beings, as well as the utility of the mentioned protocol for these purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{aimed to develop}} an {{effective}} screening strategy to predict in vivo phototoxicity of multiple compounds by combined use of in vitro phototoxicity assessments and cassette dosing pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. Photochemical properties of six fluoroquinolones (FQs) were evaluated by UV spectral and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays, and <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potentials</b> of FQs were also assessed using 3 T 3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test (3 T 3 NRU PT) and intercalator-based photogenotoxicity (IBP) assay. Cassette dosing pharmacokinetics on FQs was conducted for calculating PK parameters and dermal distribution. All the FQs exhibited potent UV/VIS absorption and ROS generation under light exposure, suggesting potent photosensitivity of FQs. In vitro phototoxic risks of some FQs were also elucidated by 3 T 3 NRU PT and IBP assay. Decision matrix for phototoxicity prediction was built upon these in vitro data, taken together with outcomes from cassette dosing PK studies. According to the decision matrix, most FQs were deduced to be phototoxic, although gatifloxacin {{was found to be}} less phototoxic. These findings were in agreement with clinical observations. Combined use of in vitro photobiochemical and cassette dosing PK data will be useful for predicting in vivo <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potentials</b> of drug candidates with high productivity and reliability...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the phototoxicities {{of a series of}} 7 -(3 -aminopyrrolidinyl) quinolones containing various substituents at position 1 (in which the substituent at R 8 is a hydrogen or a halogen) by use of a mouse model. For the 7 -(3 -aminopyrrolidinyl) quinolones with a halogen atom at position 8, well-known substituent groups such as a cyclopropyl, an ethyl, or a difluorophenyl at position 1 were found to be responsible for severe phototoxicity. However, when an aminodifluorophenyl or an isoxazolyl group was placed at position 1, even 8 -halogeno quinolones were found to be mildly phototoxic. This is the first report of 8 -halogeno quinolones that are not severely phototoxic. Two structurally similar 8 -chloro quinolones (the 1 -aminodifluorophenyl 8 -chloro quinolone and the 1 -difluorophenyl 8 -chloro quinolone) were investigated further. The former was mildly phototoxic; the latter was severely phototoxic. We demonstrate that these two 8 -chloro quinolones have practically the same areas under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 4 h in auricular tissue, suggesting that the mild phototoxicity is not due to pharmacokinetic instability. The rates of UV photodegradation of these compounds were also measured. We found that these two quinolones photodegrade at similar rates, suggesting that the mild phototoxicity is not attained through increased photostability. In conclusion, the <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potentials</b> of fluoroquinolones are influenced not only by the substituent at position 8 but also by that at position 1 (a new finding from this study). We also discovered a mildly phototoxic 8 -chloro quinolone which did not have increased photostability...|$|R

Several clinically recognized photosensitizers were identified by this technique. The activating spectrum depended on the test drug. Sulfonamides and vinblastin were activated by sunburning erythemic radiation (UV-B), while tetracyclines, nalidixic acid and phenothiazines by near UV (UV-A), and chlorothiazide by both.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro skin phototoxicity of cosmetic formulations containing photounstable and photostable UV-filters and vitamin A palmitate, assessed by two in vitro techniques: 3 T 3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test and Human 3 -D Skin Model In Vitro Phototoxicity Test. For this, four different formulations containing vitamin A palmitate and different UV-filters combinations, two of them considered photostable and two of them considered photounstable, were prepared. Solutions of each UV-filter and vitamin under study and solutions of four different combinations under study were also prepared. The phototoxicity was assessed in vitro by the 3 T 3 NRU phototoxicity test (3 T 3 -NRU-PT) and subsequently in a phototoxicity test on reconstructed human skin model (H 3 D-PT). Avobenzone presented a pronounced phototoxicity and vitamin A presented a tendency to a weak <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential.</b> A synergistic effect of vitamin A palmitate on the phototoxicity of combinations containing avobenzone was observed. H 3 D-PT results did not confirm the positive 3 T 3 -NRU-PT results. However, despite the four formulations studied did not present any acute phototoxicity potential, the combination 2 containing octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), avobenzone (AVB) and 4 -methylbenzilidene camphor (MBC) presented an indication of phototoxicity that should be better investigated in terms of the frequency of photoallergic or chronic phototoxicity in humans, once these tests are scientifically validated only to detect <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> with the aim of preventing phototoxic reactions in the general population, and positive results cannot predict the exact incidence of phototoxic reactions in humans...|$|E
40|$|The skin {{exposure}} to solar irradiation and photoreactive xenobiotics may produce abnormal skin reaction, phototoxicity. Phototoxicity is an acute light-induced response, which occurs when photoreacive chemi-cals are activated by solar lights and transformed into products cytotoxic against the skin cells. Multifari-ous symptoms of phototoxicity are identified, skin irritation, erythema, pruritis, and edema {{that are similar}} to those of the exaggerated sunburn. Diverse organic chemicals, especially drugs, are known to induce phototoxicity, which is probably from the common possession of UV-absorbing benzene or heterocyclic rings in their molecular structures. Both UVB (290 ~ 320 nm) and UVA (320 ~ 400 nm) are responsible for the manifestation of phototoxicity. Absorption of photons and absorbed energy (hv) by photoactive chemi-cals results in molecular changes or generates reactive oxygen species and depending on the way how endogenous molecules are affected by phototoxicants, mechanisms of phototoxcity is categorized into two modes of action: Direct when unstable species from excited state directly react with the endogenous mole-cules, and indirect when endogeneous molecules react with secondary photoproducts. In order to identify <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of a chemical, various test methods have been introduced. Focus is given to animal alternative test methods, i. e., in vitro, and in chemico assays as well as in vivo. 3 T 3 neutral red uptake assay, erythrocyte photohemolysis test, and phototoxicity test using human 3 -dimensional (3 D) epidermis model are examples of in vitro assays.

40|$|Red {{blood cell}} lysis and {{histidine}} degradation, photosensitized by tiaprofenic acid (TIA), were investigated. Photohaemolysis was markedly enhanced in oxygenated solutions, {{but was also}} intense {{in the presence of}} nitrogen. Photohaemolysis was inhibited by butylated hydroxyanisole and reduced glutathione, but was unaffected by sodium azide, superoxide dismutase and mannitol. The TIA-induced photo-oxidation of histidine was greatly enhanced in the presence of oxygen and almost completely inhibited in solutions bubbled with nitrogen. Sodium azide, butylated hydroxyanisole and reduced glutathione inhibited the photodegradation of histidine. Phototoxicity to histidine was unaffected by mannitol and superoxide dismutase. The overall results suggest that molecular mechanisms involving free radicals and singlet oxygen are responsible for TIA-photosensitized reactions. These two in vitro models (photohaemolysis and histidine degradation) represent different mechanisms of phototoxicity, but complement one another in the investigation of <b>potential</b> <b>phototoxic</b> substances...|$|R
40|$|The {{sunscreen}} agent 2 -phenylbenzimidazole- 5 -sulfonic acid (PBSA) {{is water}} soluble and {{is widely used}} in the cosmetic industry because it absorbs strongly at UV-B wavelengths. Previous {{studies have shown that}} PBSA, photoexcited by UV-B, oxidizes guanine bases in vitro. Because of its <b>potential</b> <b>phototoxic</b> effect, it is important to determine whether PBSA photosensitizes in cellulo the formation of oxidatively generated DNA damage on UV exposure. For this purpose, we investigated, in vitro and in cellulo, the effect of PBSA on DNA bases after UV-A or UV-B irradiation. To monitor the formation of oxidized bases and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), DNA was digested either with FaPy-DNA glycosylase and endonuclease III or with T 4 endonuclease V and photolyase, then analyzed by means of neutral- and glyoxal-agarose gel electrophoresis and ligation-mediated PCR. In cellulo, we found that PBSA provided good protection against CPD formation after UV-B exposure. However, PBSA also photosensitized oxidized guanines on UV-A and UV-B irradiation. Our results indicate that PBSA has the potential to function as a double-edged sword toward DNA and question its suitability for sunscreen applications...|$|R

Method: The study included 296 volunteers in different stages: 256 healthy adult volunteers for the safety evaluation, and 40 volunteers between 2 and 12 years old who presented Molluscum contagiosum, {{for the evaluation of}} tolerability and efficacy. Each volunteer represented two experimental units (left and right) where it was applied randomly the tested products (cream or aerosol) 30 minutes before the dermatological curettage, immediately after and twice a day during 7 days. Dermatological evaluations of safety and efficacy were performed immediately after the procedure, 3 and 7 days after the curettage. Results: During safety evaluation, the tested products showed no irritant, sensitizing, <b>phototoxic</b> or photosensitizing <b>potential.</b> Both presentations, cream and aerosol, were considered safe with no statistically significant differences between them. With respect to analgesic efficacy, the results showed that the medication promoted the reduction of painful symptoms and there was no statistically significant difference (p < 0. 05) between the two presentations.

A negligible production of singlet oxygen was observed for both compounds whereas a significant production of superoxide anion was noted for amitriptyline in particular. Moderate red blood cell lysis under UVA light (365 nm) was induced {{in the presence of}} the two drugs at a concentration of 50 mu M. Cellular phototoxicity was investigated on a murine fibroblast cell line (3 T 3). The two drugs were phototoxic causing cell death at a concentration of 100 mu M and a WA dose in the range of 3. 3 - 6. 6 J/cm(2). Furthermore, the two drugs photosensitized the peroxidation of linoleic acid, as monitored by the formation of dienic hydroperoxides. The presence of BHA and GSH, two free radical scavengers, significantly reduced the lipid oxidation photoinduced by the drugs, suggesting a predominant involvement of radical species.

40|$|Photoactivation and binding of photoactive {{chemicals}} to proteins is a known prerequisite {{for the formation}} of immunogenic photoantigens and the induction of photoallergy. The intensive use of products and the availability of new chemicals, along with an increasing exposure to sun light contribute to the risk of photosensitizing adverse reactions. Dendritic cells (DC) play a pivotal role in the induction of allergic contact dermatitis. Human peripheral blood monocyte derived dendritic cells (PBMDC) were thus perceived as an obvious choice {{for the development of a}} novel in vitro photosensitization assay using the modulation of cell surface protein expression in response to photosensitizing agents. In this new protocol, known chemicals with photosensitizing, allergenic or non-allergenic potential were pre-incubated with PBMDCs prior to UVA irradiation (1 J/cm 2). Following a 48 h incubation, the expression of the cell surface molecules CD 86, HLA-DR and CD 83 was measured by flow cytometry. All tested photosensitizers induced a significant and dose-dependent increase of CD 86 expression after irradiation compared to non-irradiated controls. Moreover, the phototoxicity of the chemicals could also be determined. In contrast, (i) CD 86 expression was not affected by the chosen irradiation conditions, (ii) increased CD 86 expression induced by allergens was independent of irradiation and (iii) no PBMDC activation was observed with the non-allergenic control.

40|$|Glucocorticosteroids, natural hormones {{derived from}} -pregnane, are potent {{therapeutic}} agents {{for the treatment}} of a broad range of inflammatory diseases. Semisynthetic derivatives are widely used systemically mainly {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid diseases and allergic manifestations, {{and many of them are}} effective by topical use in dermatoses and other skin diseases. This class of drugs is sensitive to UV radiation. They are a typical example of bichromophoric moiety: all possess an aliphatic ketone in the side chain linked to position 17 of the D ring, which absorbs UVB light. Ring A bears a keto group that is conjugated with either one or two double bonds, depending on the specific drug. In the former case (i. e., hydrocortisone) the chromophore is mainly sensitive to UVB. In the latter (i. e., betamethasone, fluocinolone, triamcinolone, flumethasone) both UVA and UVB effectively induce photolysis. The photodegradation of these drugs was studied in vitro (in the solid state, in organic and aqueous solutions, in commercial formulations) and ex vivo (in the pig skin). Both primary photoprocesses, cyclohexadienone ‘lumi’ rearrangement (under UV-A) and C- 20 ketone homolysis (under UV-B) occur and the main photoproducts formed have been isolated and characterized. Any modification of the structure of corticosteroids, in particular the loss of the side-chain, has profound effect on their anti-inflammatory activity. The drugs are also able to photoreact with biological substrates mainly through radical intermediates and one of them (betamethasone) shows phototoxic effects both ex vivo and in vivo (mice) too. All these results suggest to protect these drugs from light not only during storage but also after in vivo administration to avoid loss of therapeutic activity and <b>potential</b> <b>phototoxic</b> reactions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} to {{evaluate}} the photochemical behavior of drugs and their associated photosensitizing potential by instrumental methods was successfully achieved. In this investigation, an HPLC method was developed, which {{makes it possible to}} determinate reactive oxygen species generated from photoirradiated drugs. This was achieved by using various surrogate parameters to detect and create kinetics for the reactive oxygen species. The formation of singlet oxygen under the influence of light was studied with the help of FFA and RNO to various drugs. In the process ketoprofen, furosemide and doxycycline showed the strongest 1 O 2 formation. Furthermore, it is possible to determine with this method whether the 1 O 2 is formed directly by the drug or by one of its photoproducts. The formation of superoxide was detected using NBT. The described method allows predicting the photosensitive/phototoxic potential of a drug through a type II reaction. In order to predict the photosensitizing potential of a drug through a type I reaction an electron paramagnetic resonance method was developed. In the developed method, the drug was irradiated during simultaneous spectrum recordings. The result of the drug investigations showed, {{that it is possible to}} detect light-induced free radical formation over the time, thus, giving insights into the reactivity and durability of the radicals formed. Moreover, it is possible to determine the position at which the free radical is formed. Accord-ingly, it is possible to distinguish whether a drug reacts phototoxic via a type I or type II reac-tion. In addition to these results, the behavior of irritated drugs in presence of biomolecules has been studied. Calcitonin has been used as a model molecule. It was found that especially the drugs which also showed a pronounced formation of reactive oxygen species, lead to a degra-dation of calcitonin. Not all tested photosensitizers, such as doxycycline, showed a degrada-tion of calcitonin. By combining the photoreactor with an LC-ESI-TOF system, resulting photoproducts were determined. These photoproducts could partially be assigned to the photodegradation products described in the literature. The results promise a further development of the method using an MS-MS detector to have a lot of potential, since both, the detection limit is reduced, and it is also possible to identify the newly formed photoproducts. Therefore, it should be possible to create photo-reaction pathways. The main purpose of the developed method is the screening of the photosensitive and photo-toxic potential of drugs and other substances. Through the use of this screening method, it will be possible to predict the <b>phototoxic</b> or photoallergic <b>potential</b> of pharmaceutical substances in early stage of development.

Tetracycline derivatives, quinolone derivatives, and chlorpromazine were used as model compounds for development of the assay. Human fibroblasts Were incubated with potential phototoxins, the cell cultures irradiated with UV, and the capacity for neutral red uptake determined. Demeclocycline and doxycycline, two known photosensitizers, showed a 94 % and 95 % decrease of neutral red uptake, respectively, indicating photo-induced cytotoxicity. Minocycline, a non-photosensitizing tetracycline derivative, showed no decrease in uptake. Tetracycline, a weak phototoxin, showed minor (10 %) decrease at equivalent concentrations (20 μg/ml). Microscopic observation of neutral red uptake and cell damage paralleled the spectrophotometric findings. Chlorpromazine, a non-tetracycline, phototoxin, showed 91 % decrease. An additional group of phototoxic drugs, quinolone antibacterials, were studied. Nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin all demonstrated phototoxicity, with nalidixic acid showing the greatest decrease in neutral red uptake.

The capacity to photosensitize biological substrates (lipids, proteins, DNA) has been analyzed, {{as well as their}} photocytotoxicity on red blood cells and 3 T 3 murine fibroblasts. The results obtained show that the quinolones studied are able to photosensitize red blood cell lysis in an oxygen-dependent way and induce a high decrease in cell viability after UVA irradiation. A major correlation with phototoxicity lies {{in the structure of the}} individual antibacterials and their hydrophobicity; in particular, 6 -amino derivatives are less phototoxic than corresponding unsubstituted and fluorinated compounds. Cellular phototoxicity was inhibited by the addition of free radical and hydroxyl radical scavengers (BHA, GSH and DMTU), suggesting the involvement of a radical mechanism in their cytotoxicity. A good correlation was observed between lipid peroxidation and phototoxicity, indicating that the test compounds exert their toxic effects mainly in the cellular membrane.

Perphenazine gave a single product due to dechlorination. From thioridazine, the two major products formed; the endocyclic sulfoxide and the endocyclic N-oxide in which the 2 -SCH 3 substituent was replaced by a hydroxy group were tested. From fluphenazine, two products have been examined as follows: an exocyclic N-piperazine oxide and a carboxylic acid arising from hydrolysis of the 2 -CF 3 group. The phototoxicity of the isolated photoproducts has been studied in order to determine their possible involvement in the photosensitizing effects exhibited by the parent drugs, using hemolysis and 3 T 3 fibroblasts viability as in vitro assays. As fluphenazine, perphenazine, and thioridazine did, some photoproducts proved phototoxic. In particular, the perphenazine dechlorinated photoproduct and the thioridazine N-oxide were found to exert phototoxic properties similar to the parent compounds. Therefore, our data suggest that some phenothiazine photoproducts {{may play a role in}} the mechanism of photosensitivity of these drugs. Because some of these photoproducts correspond to metabolic products of phenothiazines found in humans, it cannot be ruled out that metabolites of phenothiazines can be phototoxic in vivo...|$|E

It’s likely that other drugs that induce moderate phototoxicity are not recognized as 'photosensitizers' since the induced cutaneous reactions are taken for mild sunburn or solar eczemas. The selective inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase- 2 (CSIs), drugs entered recently the market, are here studied in terms of phototoxicity and photostability, since their chemical structure suggests their interactions with UV light. This reactivity could bring to changes of the molecule or to its activation, with induction of photosensitizing effects. Indeed, for the less recent Nimesulide, some phototoxic reactions have already been reported in humans. In fact, CSIs drugs are characterized by the presence of an aromatic structure with high degree of conjugation, of a sulphonamide moiety (similar to that of the Sulphonamides, the phototoxicity of which has been already demonstrated) and, in some of them, of a trifluoromethyl group highly unstable under irradiation (as in the case of Fluphenazine).

40|$|Bis-dehydroxycurcumin tert-butyl ester (K 2 T 23) is a {{derivative}} {{of the natural}} spice curcumin. Curcumin is widely studied for its multiple therapeutic properties, including photosensitized cytotoxicity. However, the full exploitation of curcumin <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> is hindered by the extreme instability of its excited state, caused by very efficient non radiative decay by means of transfer of the enolic proton to the nearby keto oxygen. K 2 T 23 is designed to exhibit a tautomeric equilibrium shifted toward the diketo conformers with respect to natural curcumin. This property should endow K 2 T 23 with superior excited-state stability when excited in the UVB band, i. e., in correspondence of the diketo conformers absorption peaks, making this compound an interesting candidate for topical photodynamic therapy of, e. g., skin tumors or oral infections. In this work, the tautomeric equilibrium of K 2 T 23 between the keto-enolic and diketo conformers is assessed in the ground state in several organic solvents by UV-visible absorption and by nuclear magnetic resonance. The same tautomeric equilibrium is also probed in the excited-state in the same environments by means of steady-state fluorescence and time-correlated single-photon counting measurements. These techniques are also exploited to elucidate the excited state dynamics and excited-state deactivation pathways of K 2 T 23, which are compared to those determined for several other curcuminoids characterized in previous works of ours. The ability of K 2 T 23 in photosensitizing the production of singlet oxygen is {{compared with that of}} curcumin...|$|E

Since all the UV filter chemicals on the positive list of EU Directive 76 / 768 /EEC have been shown not to be phototoxic in vivo in humans under use con-ditions, only negative effects would be expected in the 3 T 3 NRU PT test. To balance the number {{of positive and negative}} chemicals, ten phototoxic and ten non-phototoxic chemicals were tested under blind conditions in four laboratories. Moreover, to assess the optimum concentration range for testing, information was provided on appropriate solvents and on the solubility of the coded chemicals. In this study, the <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of test chemicals was evaluated in a prediction model in which either the Photoirritation Factor (PIF) or the Mean Photo Effect (MPE) were determined. The results obtained with both PIF and MPE were highly reproducible in the four laboratories, and the correlation between in vitro and in vivo data was almost perfect. All the pho-totoxic test chemicals provided a positive result at concentrations of 1 µg/ml, while nine of the ten non-phototoxic chemicals gave clear negative results, even at the highest test concentrations.

40|$|International audiencePhototoxicity {{inducing}} in vivo photoirritation, a reversible inflammatory {{reaction of}} the skin after chemical contact and UVA radiation exposure, is increasingly observed as a side effect {{associated with the use}} of both cosmetics and systemic drugs. In order to systematically screen for the <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of new compounds, we propose two three-dimensional models suitable for in vitro testing: a dermal equivalent (DE) and a skin equivalent (SE) model. The DE model includes a collagen-glycosaminoglycans-chitosan porous matrix populated by normal human fibroblasts. The SE model is made by seeding normal human keratinocytes onto the DE, leading to a fully differentiated epidermis. The objectives of this pilot study are: 1) to compare the deleterious effects of UVA radiation on the two models and 2) to evaluate to what extent the in vitro results can predict the in vivo phototoxicity caused by well-known photoirritant compounds, included in the COLIPA validation phototoxicity reference chemical list. Dilutions of thiourea, sulisobenzone, promethazine, chlorpromazine and tetracycline were applied (20 microliters) onto DEs and SEs (n = 6) and incubated for 1 h (or 15 h) at 37 degrees C. Irradiated samples received 3 J/cm 2 UVA. The 24 h post-irradiation residual cellular viability was measured using the MTT test on treated and untreated tissues and IL- 1 alpha release measurement in collected SE culture media. A concordance in terms of photoirritant/non-photoirritant was obtained between the in vivo data and the in vitro results, suggesting that the DE and the SE models could be integrated, after a complete validation study, into a protocol for in vitro testing of the photoirritant potential of new molecules.

40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} induces DNA damage, oxidative stress, and inflammatory {{processes in}} human keratinocytes, resulting in skin inflammation, photoaging, and photocarcinogenesis. Adequate protection of skin against {{the harmful effects}} of UV irradiation is essential. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the protective effects of afzelin, one of the flavonoids, against UV irradiation in human keratinocytes and epidermal equivalent models. Spectrophotometric measurements revealed that the afzelin extinction maxima were in the UVB and UVA range, and UV transmission below 376 nm was < 10 %, indicating UV-absorbing activity of afzelin. In the phototoxicity assay using the 3 T 3 NRU phototoxicity test (3 T 3 -NRU-PT), afzelin presented a tendency to no <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential.</b> In addition, in order to investigate cellular functions of afzelin itself, cells were treated with afzelin after UVB irradiation. In human keratinocyte, afzelin effectively inhibited the UVB-mediated increase in lipid peroxidation and the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Afzelin also inhibited UVB-induced cell death in human keratinocytes by inhibiting intrinsic apoptotic signaling. Furthermore, afzelin showed inhibitory effects on UVB-induced release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin- 6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and prostaglandin-E 2 in human keratinocytes by interfering with the p 38 kinase pathway. Using an epidermal equivalent model exposed to UVB radiation, anti-apoptotic activity of afzelin was also confirmed together with a photoprotective effect at the morphological level. Taken together, our results suggest that afzelin has several cellular activities such as DNA-protective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory as well as UV-absorbing activity and may protect human skin from UVB-induced damage by a combination of UV-absorbing and cellular activities...|$|E
40|$|Vemurafenib is a first-in-class, small {{molecule}} B-Raf {{kinase inhibitor}} {{for the treatment}} of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma carrying the BRAFV 600 E mutation, commercially available since 2011. A general <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> was identified early during development; however, based on results of an animal study in hairless rats, it was concluded that there would exist no relevant risk for humans. Surprisingly, signs of clinical photosensitivity were reported in many patients during clinical development. Therefore, it became a fundamental question to understand this discrepancy. An established mouse model (oral UV-Local Lymph Node Assay, UV-LLNA) for the assessment of in vivo photosafety was used to investigate the impact of formulations, dose levels, duration of treatment, and timing of irradiation. Moreover, a basic pharmacokinetic profile was established within the same mouse strain. We were able to demonstrate dose- and time-dependent phototoxicity of vemurafenib using commercially available tablets (stabilized amorphous material). The lowest phototoxic dose was 350 mg/kg administrated for 3 consecutive days followed by exposure to UV-visible irradiation at a UVA-normalized dose of 10 J/cm 2. In comparison, pure vemurafenib, which easily forms crystalline variants and is known to have poor bioavailability, was tested at 350 mg/kg, and no signs of phototoxicity could be seen. The most apparent difference between the early study in hairless rats and this study in mice was the spectral range of the irradiation light source (350 - 400 nm vs 320 - 700 nm). Because vemurafenib does not absorb sufficiently light above 350 nm, this difference can easily explain the negative earlier study result in hairless rat...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we have {{investigated}} the mechanism of phototoxicity of fluvastatin, an 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, in human keratinocytes cell line NCTC- 2544. Fluvastatin underwent rapid photodegradation upon Ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation in buffered aqueous solution {{as shown by the}} changes in absorption spectra. Interestingly, no isosbestic points were observed but only a fast appearance of a spectral change, indicative of the formation of a new chromophore. The isolation and characterization of the main photoproduct revealed the formation of a polycyclic compound with a benzocarbazole-like structure. This product was also evaluated for its <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential.</b> Cell phototoxicity was evaluated by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide test after 72 h from the irradiation in the presence of fluvastatin. The results showed a reduction of the cell viability in a concentration and UVA dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, the photoproduct showed a dramatic decrease of the cell viability that occurred at concentrations of an order of magnitude lower than the parent compound. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that fluvastatin and its main photoproduct induced principally necrosis as revealed by the large appearance of propidium iodide-positive cells and confirmed also by the rapid drop in cellular adenosine triphosphate levels. Interestingly, a rapid increase of intracellular calcium followed by an extensive cell lipid membrane peroxidation and a significant oxidation of model proteins were induced by fluvastatin and its photoproduct, suggesting that these compounds exerted their toxic effect mainly in the cellular membranes. On the basis of our results, the phototoxicity of fluvastatin may be mediated by the formation of benzocarbazole-like photoproduct that acts as strong photosensitizer...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in developing new sunscreens is increasing due to {{the harmful effects of}} UV radiation on the skin, such as erythema, accelerated skin ageing (photoageing) and the induction of skin cancer. However, many molecular sunscreens penetrate into the skin causing photoallergies, phototoxic reactions and skin irritation. Thus, the aim of this work was the preparation and characterization of polymeric and solid lipid nanoparticles to act carriers of benzophenone- 3 (BZ 3), aiming to improve the safety of sunscreen products by increasing the sun protection factor (SPF), decreasing BZ 3 skin penetration and decreasing BZ 3 concentration in sunscreen formulation. BZ 3 was encapsulated in poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles by the nanoprecipitation method and in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) by the hot high pressure homogenization method. the particles were stable for 40 days. the BZ 3 encapsulated in PCL nanoparticles was released faster than BZ 3 encapsulated in SLN. the sun protection factor increased when BZ 3 was encapsulated in both nanostructures. However, BZ 3 encapsulated in PCL nanoparticles decreased its skin permeation more than SLN-BZ 3. Furthermore, BZ 3 encapsulated in SLN did not exhibit cytotoxic or phototoxic effects in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and BABL/c 3 T 3 fibroblasts, whereas PCL nanoparticles with BZ 3 showed <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> in HaCaT cells. Nevertheless, BZ 3 free and encapsulated in PCL nanoparticles or in SLN did not show allergic reactions in mice. Our results suggest that these nanostructures are interesting carriers for sunscreen.

40|$|Decabromodiphenylether (deca-BDE) and {{triclosan}} (2, 4, 42 ̆ 7 -trichloro- 22 ̆ 7 -hydroxydiphenylether) {{are used}} in consumer products as flame retardant and bactericide, respectively. Dermal contact is a major human exposure pathway. Deca-BDE and triclosan {{are known to be}} photolytically degraded to compounds like lower-BDEs and dioxins. My hypothesis is that photolysis of deca-BDE and triclosan generates free radicals and degradation products which cause toxic effects including cytotoxicity, growth inhibition, oxidative stress and genotoxicity in skin. To test this hypothesis radical formation and photolytic products of deca-BDE and toxic effects of deca-BDE and triclosan alone/with UV-exposure were determined using immortal human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and primary human skin fibroblasts (HSF). My electron paramagnetic resonance and GC-MS studies indicate that deca-BDE is photoreactive and UV irradiation of deca-BDE in organic solvents generates free radicals and lower-BDEs. The free radical formation is wavelength-dependent and positively related to the irradiation time and deca-BDE concentration. In structure-activity relationship studies with deca-BDE, octa-BDE, PBB 209, PCB 209 and diphenyl ether, the presence of halogen atoms (Br 3 ̆e Cl), and/or an ether bond enhance free radical formation. Debromination and hydrogen abstraction from the solvents are the mechanism of radical formation with deca-BDE, which raises concerns about possible toxic effects in UV-exposed skin. In cell culture experiments high levels of triclosan plus UV irradiation and repetitive deca-BDE and UV exposures caused synergistic cytotoxicity in HaCaT. However, neither triclosan nor deca-BDE can be regarded as a phototoxicant following the OECD test and evaluation guidelines. In HSF, no synergistic cytotoxicity was observed, although HSF were more sensitive to deca-BDE and triclosan alone than HaCaT. Contrary to expectations, the photodegradation products of triclosan were less toxic than triclosan itself to HaCaT. However, UV irradiation of triclosan-exposed cells produced a dose dependent increase in intracellular oxidative stress (dichlorofluorescein formation). Comet experiments did not show consistent results of genotoxicity in HaCaT. Overall, deca-BDE and triclosan had no or weak <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> in cells with the experimental conditions employed. To my knowledge, my research is the first prove of free radical formation during UV irradiation of deca-BDE and the first investigation of phototoxicity of deca-BDE and triclosan in human skin cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work, the {{coupling}} of the photochemistry in the purely watery environment with the high performance liquid chromatography, was moved successfully. The HPLC on-line method was developed by using a hyphenated technique comprising a photoreactor and HPLC separation. The enrichment and chromatography occurs with two special aqua columns. The developed HPLC on-line method was used successfully for photostability testing with variable pH factors and with different sources of light. The described method allows {{the investigation of the}} most different drugs. Thus, polar as well as lipophilic drugs could be investigated with this method. Especially the application of this method the screening on phototoxic or photoallergic reaction by drugs is to be emphasised. For screening phototoxic reactions the DNA base guanosinemonophosphate was used as model substance. The drugs chlorpromazine and ofloxacine showed under exposure with UVA light interaction and reaction with the DNA base and the phototoxic effect of these drugs could be confirmed with this method. On the other side the diuretic drug hydrochlorothiazide showed no reaction with GMP, although the drug was described in the literature as phototoxic. A reaction of hydrochlorothiazide could be proved by the use of short DNA antisense single-strand instead of the base GMP under exposure with UVA light. However, in attempts with the DNA sense single-strand no interaction could be ascertained. For the screening on photoallergic reaction of drugs the dipeptide alanyltryptophan was used as model substance. The test results to the screening on photoallergy well correlated with the information from the literature. The photoallergic potential could be confirmed for the phenothiazines, hydrochlorothiazide, ofloxacine and mefloquine by the interaction or reaction with the dipeptide. The theory was confirmed that often halogenated drugs are involved in photochemical reactions with biomolecules. The halogenated drugs chlorpromazine, hydrochlorothiazide, ofloxacine and mefloquine turned out especially reactive in present of biomolecules. The not halogenated drugs etodolac and nifedipine showed to the comparison weak reaction with biomolecules. All together distinctive pH dependence has appeared in the carried out investigations. A damage dependent on sequence of the DNA single-strand can be booked with the investigation results. The chromatograms of the DNA antisense strand showed in presence of hydrochlorothiazide, eosine and protoporphyrine a damage or structure change of the DNA antisense strand, while the comparative investigation results showed higher stability to the DNA sense strand. The main application of the described HPLC on-line method is the screening on photoallergic and <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of drugs. Drugs in development could be tested with this method in early stage. This method is a low cost alternative to conventional methods. In comparison animal experiments are very time-consuming and are also cost-intensive with it. Outgoing from the introduced results numerous other application possibilities arise. With the developed method new knowledge could be won to understand mechanisms by photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the report}} from the “ECVAM–EFPIA {{workshop}} on 3 T 3 NRU Phototoxicity Test: Practical Experience and Implications for Phototoxicity Testing”, jointly organized by ECVAM and EFPIA and held on the 25 – 27 October 2010 in Somma Lombardo, Italy. The European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) was established in 1991 within the European Commission Joint Research, based on a Communication from the European Commission (1991). The main objective of ECVAM is to promote the scientific and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods which are of importance to the biosciences and which reduce, refine and replace the use of laboratory animals. The European Federation of Pharmaceuticals Industries and Association (EFPIA) represent the pharmaceutical industry operating in Europe. Through its direct membership of 31 national associations and 40 leading pharmaceutical companies, EFPIA is {{the voice on the}} EU scene of 2200 companies committed to researching, developing and bringing to patients new medicines that improve health and the quality of life around the world. The workshop, co-chaired by Joachim Kreysa (ECVAM) and Phil Wilcox (GSK, EFPIA) involved thirty-five experts from academia, regulatory authorities and industry, invited to contribute with their experiences in the field of phototoxicology. The main objectives of the workshop were: – to present ‘in use’ experience of the pharmaceutical industry with the 3 T 3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test (3 T 3 NRU-PT), – to discuss why it differs from the results in the original validation exercise, – to discuss technical issues and consider ways to improve the usability of the 3 T 3 NRU-PT for (non-topical) pharmaceuticals, e. g., by modifying the threshold of chemical light absorption to trigger photo-toxicological testing, and by modifying technical aspects of the assay, or adjusting the criteria used to classify a positive response. During the workshop, the assay methodology was reviewed by comparing the OECD Test Guideline (TG 432) with the protocols used in testing laboratories, data from EFPIA and JPMA ‘surveys’ were presented and possible reasons for the outcomes were discussed. Experts from cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries reported on their experience with the 3 T 3 NRU-PT and evidence was presented for phototoxic clinical symptoms that could be linked to certain relevant molecules. Brainstorming sessions discussed if the 3 T 3 NRU-PT needed to be improved and whether alternatives to the 3 T 3 NRU-PT exist. Finally, the viewpoint from EU and US regulators was presented. In the final session, the conclusions of the meeting were summarized, with action points. It was concluded that the 3 T 3 NRU-PT identifies phototoxicological hazards with a 100 % sensitivity, and thus is accepted as the tier one test that correctly identifies the absence of <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential.</b> Consequently, positive results in the 3 T 3 NRU-PT often do not translate into a clinical phototoxicity risk. Possible ways to improve the practical use of this assay include: (i) adaptation of changed UV/vis-absorption criteria as a means {{to reduce the number of}} materials tested, (ii) reduction of the highest concentration to be tested, and (iii) consideration of modifying the threshold criteria for the prediction of a positive call in the test...|$|E
40|$|Regulatory requirements: According to {{the current}} Notes for Guidance of the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products (SCCNFP), {{cosmetic}} ingredients and mixtures of ingredients absorbing UV light (in particular UV filter chemicals used, for example, to ensure the light stability of cosmetics or used in sun protection products) should be tested for acute phototoxic and photogenotoxic potential. Testing for photosensitisation (immunological photoallergy) potential is not specifically required, but it is nevertheless often performed. Acute phototoxicity: Due to a thorough multi-stage and multi-centre validation trial (1992 - 1998) the In Vitro 3 T 3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test (3 T 3 -NRU-PT) had already gained acceptance by the SCCNFP in 1998, and it is recommended by the EMEA/CPMP as a basic preclinical test for acute phototoxicity. It was accepted as Method No. 41 in Annex V to Directive 67 / 548 /EEC in the year 2000, and was accepted as the new Test Guideline 432 by the OECD in 2002. The 3 T 3 -NRU-PT {{is regarded as a}} basic screen for identifying acute <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential.</b> Two additional in vitro tests, formally evaluated in controlled blind trials, the RBC Phototoxicity Test (RBC-PT) and the Human 3 -D Skin Model Phototoxicity Test (H 3 D-PT), are regarded as useful and important adjunct tests to overcome some limitations of the 3 T 3 -NRU-PT, namely the fairly low UVB tolerance of the 3 T 3 fibroblasts and the inability to model the bioavailability of test materials topically applied to the skin. In addition, the RBC-PT permits an evaluation of the phototoxic mechanisms involved. In conclusion, the identification of acute phototoxic hazards is now regarded as being sufficiently covered by in vitro tests, so that animal testing for that endpoint can now be 100 % replaced. Photogenotoxicity: In the area of photogenotoxicity, almost the whole battery of in vitro genetic toxicity tests have been (or are currently being) converted into test protocols of photogenotoxicity tests. Tests exclusively predictive for gene mutation, for example, the Photo-Ames (P-Ames) Test and the Photo-Thymidine Kinase Test (P-TKT), have become less important than tests for clastogenic effects (for example, the Photo-Chromosome Aberration Test [P-CAT] and the Photo-Micronucleus Test [P-MNT]). In addition, a number of promising indicator tests, such as the Photo-Comet Assay (P-Comet) have been developed. Although routinely used, to date none of the new photogenotoxicity tests have been formally validated. Therefore, the P-MNT and the P-Comet are currently being evaluated in a formal interlaboratory validation study. It is expected that these in vitro photogenotoxicity test methods may become available as validated and accepted methods within the next five years. Photoallergy (Photosensitisation) : In the area of photoallergy (photosensitisation), as development of predictive in vitro tests for delayed contact sensitisation (allergenicity) potential without the involvement of light, {{due to a lack of}} ability to model the complex mechanisms underlying allergy, no promising in vitro methods to predict photo-sensitisation potential are currently in sight (see the section on skin sensitisation). One in vitro screening method, which models the covalent binding of a light activated chemical to human serum albumin, may become relevant. However, while the binding of an excited chemical to proteins is a prerequisite for photoallergy, this is not a sufficient predictor on its own. The only promising alternatives currently under development are in vivo refinements, like the Photo Local Lymph Node Assay (PLLNA). Once a reliable and predictive in vitro test battery and strategy for the assessment of "dark" sensitisation potential have been developed and accepted, their adaptation into similar photosensitisation testing will become possible...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from January 6, 2016 - January 6, 2017 Significant inputs of hydrocarbons are continually released into the environment from anthropogenic and natural sources. Some of the most toxic hydrocarbon compounds are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons {{are known for their}} ability to absorb ultraviolet light and enhance toxicity. Generally, PAHs exert their toxicity via narcosis but UV-absorbing PAHs can become photosensitized and significantly exacerbate toxic effects. During crude oil spills, PAHs are released in large amounts that have potential for narcotic and phototoxic effects on aquatic organisms. As a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, effort was placed on quantifying toxic effects of crude oils and oil constituents for aquatic organisms. The following studies attempted to characterize narcotic and phototoxic effects that may have occurred during the Deepwater Horizon incident; however, the results of this research are equally applicable to any PAH exposure scenario. The objectives of the following studies were to: 1) identify susceptible stages of Gulf of Mexico organisms to the photo-enhanced toxicity of PAHs, 2) determine the importance of UV intensity and exposure duration on phototoxicity, 3) determine the effect of alkylation on the phototoxic potency of PAHs, 4) validate the assumption of additivity for phototoxic PAHs mixtures, 5) evaluate the potential for narcotic toxicity and phototoxicity of fresh and weathered Macondo crude oils released from the Deepwater Horizon, and 6) assess the potential for ongoing oil phototoxicity at field sites in the Gulf of Mexico. Model organisms used in studies included the mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia), inland silverside (Menidia beryllina), sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), and Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis). Studies demonstrated that organism sensitivity to phototoxicity of PAHs decreased with organism age and increasing pigmentation. Photo-enhanced toxicity was, to some extent, dependent on the degree of organism pigmentation. Generally, high-intensity short-duration UV treatments resulted in greater toxicity than low-intensity long-duration UV treatments at similar UV doses. Fresh Macondo crude oil was more toxic than weathered crude oils, both in the presence and absence of UV light. Differences in toxicity between fresh and weathered crude oils were primarily attributed to the lighter mono and di-aromatic hydrocarbons in fresh crude oils. Phototoxic PAH concentrations were relatively similar among fresh and weathered crude oils, suggesting recalcitrance to oil weathering processes. The addition of Corexit 9500, an oil-dispersant used during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, to crude oil in laboratory experiments increased toxicity compared to tests conducted with crude oil alone. It is anticipated that this enhanced response resulted from the increased concentrations of phototoxic and narcotic PAHs in water-accommodated fractions and the inherent toxicity of Corexit 9500. Weathered crude oil present in previously heavily-oiled Barataria Bay, LA field sites was found to pose little or no phototoxic risk in ambient environmental conditions four years after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Water-accommodated fractions of field-collected oil suggest slight <b>phototoxic</b> <b>potential</b> to mysid shrimp in the laboratory in highly transparent artificial seawater. When examining mixtures of phototoxic PAHs in crude oil, laboratory studies suggested that toxicity adhered to an "additive interactions" model; therefore, predictive toxicity models should consider an additivity model for assessing the toxicity of hydrocarbon mixtures. Furthermore, PAH phototoxic potency seemed to increase with increasing methylation for all phototoxic PAHs examined. In fact, phenanthrene, a non-phototoxic PAH, demonstrated a slight degree of phototoxicity when methylated. Overall, predictive models based on HOMO-LUMO gap were relatively accurate in predicting phototoxicity compared with empirical data generated in the present study. Future models should consider effects of other substituents on photo-enhanced toxicity of PAHs due to toxicity differences between unsubstituted and alkylated PAHs observed in the present studies. Data presented in this dissertation, can be used in part, as the basis for an ecological risk assessment for the photo-enhanced toxicity of oil constituents in the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill...|$|E
