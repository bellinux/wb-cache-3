40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to prove that the {{classifying}} spaces of categories of algebras governed by a <b>prop</b> <b>can</b> be determined by using function spaces on the category of props. We first consider a function space of props to define the moduli space of algebra structures over this prop on an object of the base category. Then we mainly prove that this moduli space is the homotopy fiber of a forgetful map of classifying spaces, generalizing to the prop setting a theorem of Rezk. The crux of our proof lies in the construction of certain universal diagrams in categories of algebras over a prop. We introduce a general method to carry out such constructions in a functorial way.

40|$|Many {{complexities}} of laser propagation can be eased {{by the use}} of PROP to model a laser. PROP is a computational tool that was created at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories [I]. This code can be specified to create different types of lasers with different beam fluences and different pulse shapes. As it is implemented at the University of Rochester LLE, it will allow scientists to propagate any laser, any distance, with the use of hardware such as lenses, rod amplifiers, slab amplifiers, spatial filters, and active mirrors. Since <b>PROP</b> <b>can</b> model 2 -D effects on lasers, many effects such as diffraction, aberrations, small-scale self-focusing, 2 -D gain and saturation can be accounted for. PROP is also flexible as it takes user input data and analyzes it, creating a profile from that data. Using the features of PROP, a rod amplifier spatial filter chain was modeled to demonstrate many of its functions and capabilities. PROP will replace the current 1 -D code at LLE creating new possibilities of diagnosing laser-induced damage and accurately modeling the 60 -beam laser chain at OMEGA. 2...|$|E

Seventy eight rats weighing 100 - 150 g were divided into four groups.

The second group (24 rats); were received an i. p injection of 0. 9 % NaCl for 15 consecutive days, then received i. p injection of ET (1 mg/kg/day) at the 16 th day of experiment for 4 repeated days. The third group (24 rats); were received an i. p injection of prop (150 mg/kg/day) for 19 consecutive days.

The stability of the prop is studied using the buckling analysis. The results show that {{without regard to the}} dynamic load, the <b>prop</b> <b>can</b> bear 2. 0 times axial pressure and 1. 1 times off-center 0. 3 R pressure, and the stress distribution is even.

40|$|A PROP is a {{symmetric}} monoidal category whose {{objects are}} the nonnegative integers and whose tensor product on objects is addition. A morphism from m to n in a <b>PROP</b> <b>can</b> be visualized as a string diagram with m input wires and n output wires. For a field k, the PROP FinVect_k where morphisms are k-linear maps {{is used by}} Baez and Erbele to study signal-flow diagrams. We aim to generalize their result characterizing this PROP in terms of generators and relations {{by looking at the}} PROP Mat(R) of matrices of values in R, where R is a commutative rig (that is, a generalization of a ring where the condition that each element has an additive inverse is relaxed). To this end, we show that the category of symmetric monoidal functors out of Mat(R) is equivalent to the category of bicommutative bimonoids equipped with a certain map of rigs; such functors are called algebras. By choosing R correctly, we will see that the algebras of the PROP FinSpan of finite sets and spans between them are bicommutative bimonoids, while the algebras of the PROP FinRel of finite sets and relations between them are special bicommuative bimonoids and the algebras of Mat(Z) are bicommutative Hopf monoids.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The G protein-coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) TAS 2 R 38 is {{a bitter}} taste receptor that {{can respond to}} bitter compounds such as phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and 6 -n-propylthiouracil (PROP). This receptor was chosen because its four haplotypes (based on three residue site polymorphism) hTAS 2 R 38 PAV, hTAS 2 R 38 AVI, hTAS 2 R 38 AAI, and hTAS 2 R 38 PVV {{are known to have}} dramatically different responses to PTC and PROP. We aimed to identify the protein−ligand interaction features that determine whether the bitter taste signal from this receptor is sent to the cortex. To do this we predicted the 3 D structures of the TAS 2 R 38 bitter taste receptor using our new BiHelix and SuperBiHelix Monte Carlo methods (No experimental determinations of the 3 D structure have been reported for any taste receptors.). We find that residue 262 (2 nd position in the polymorphism) is involved in the interhelical hydrogen bond network stabilizing the GPCR structure in tasters (hTAS 2 R 38 PAV, hTAS 2 R 38 AAI, and hTAS 2 R 38 PVV), while it is not in the nontaster (hTAS 2 R 38 AVI). This suggests that the hydrogen bond interactions between TM 3 and TM 6 or between TM 5 and TM 6 {{may play a role in}} activating this GPCR. To further validate these structures, we used the DarwinDock method to predict the binding sites and 3 D structures for PTC and PROP bound to hTAS 2 R 38 PAV, hTAS 2 R 38 AVI, hTAS 2 R 38 AAI, and hTAS 2 R 38 PVV, respectively. Our results show that PTC and <b>PROP</b> <b>can</b> form H-bonds with the backbone of residue 262 in the tasters (hTAS 2 R 38 PAV, hTAS 2 R 38 AAI, and hTAS 2 R 38 PVV) but not in the nontaster (hTAS 2 R 38 AVI). Thus it appears that the hydrogen bond interaction between TM 3 and TM 6 may activate the receptor to pass the ligand binding signal to intracellular processes and that the H-bond between agonists and residue 262 in tasters is involved in the bitter tasting. This is in agreement with experimental observations, providing validation of the predicted ligand-protein complexes and also a potential activation mechanism for the TAS 2 R 38 receptor...|$|E

Therefore, players have to make efforts to guarantee the possessions of prop i and j all the time, after they obtain both props. Otherwise, they need to buy prop k directly to avoid repetitive game tasks. Obviously, the problem induced by long-distance intervention makes props related to each other, and existing methods may be inappropriate for this recommendation task.|$|R

40|$|Background Improving {{the patient}} {{experience}} is a key focus within the National Health Service. This has led us to consider how health services are experienced, from both staff and patient perspectives. Novel service improvement activities bring staff and patients together to use design-led methods to improve how health services are delivered. The Multiple Sclerosis Outpatient Future Group study aimed to explore how analogies and <b>props</b> <b>can</b> be used to facilitate rich interactions between staff and patients within these activities. This paper will consider how these interactions supported participants to share experiences, generate ideas and suggest service improvements. Method Qualitative explorative study using ‘future groups,’ a reinterpretation of the recognised focus groups method directed towards exploring future alternatives through employing analogies and physical props to engage participants to speculate about future service interactions and health experiences. Participants were people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and outpatient staff: staff nurses, nursing assistants, junior sisters and reception staff. Results Use of future groups, analogies and physical props enabled PwMS and outpatient staff to invest their own ideas and feelings in the service improvement activity and envisage alternative health care scenarios. The combination {{of participants in the}} groups with their diverse perspectives and knowledge of the service led to a collaborative approach in which staff highlighted potential practical problems and patients ensured ideas were holistic. Service improvements were prototyped and tested in the outpatient clinic. Conclusion Design-led methods such as future groups using analogies and physical <b>props</b> <b>can</b> be used to facilitate interactions between staff and patients in service improvement activities, leading to the generation of meaningful ideas. It is hoped that improving the quality of ideation tools within design-led methods can contribute to developing successful service interventions in service improvement activities. <br/...|$|R
