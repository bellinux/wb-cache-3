This evidence supports the notion that FTHRs are not true digesting cells. Quite interestingly, trouts and human MOs were positive for PAS, AS-D, Anae, and perox stainings, thus confirming that cellular cytochemistries are maintained across evolution as their phagocytic functions. Additionally, blood films from trouts, accidentally infected with Candida albicans in aquarium, were morphologically analyzed.

In sectioned intact cells only the plasma membrane and tonoplast stained with <b>periodic</b> acid-chromic acid-phosphotungstic <b>acid</b> as viewed by electron microscopy. All of the membranous material which partitioned into the upper phase of the two phase system stained with this procedure, whilst much of the material in the lower phase did not.

In order to differentiate between plasma membrane and tonoplast, vanadate-sensitive, nitrate-insensitive, azide-insensitive, molybdate-insensitive K+, Mg 2 +-ATPase was used as an additional marker for plasma membrane, and acid phosphatase and nitrate-sensitive ATPase were used as markers for tonoplast.

Strong secondary-bonds act as thermo-reversible physical crosslinks between chains which drive self-assembly.

Furthermore, understanding {{and improving the}} relevant factors that control transport properties would have vast implications on developing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for technologically important applications including water desalination, ion exchange membranes and microelectronics. This thesis explores the structure – processing – morphology - property relationships of acid and ionic functionalized polymers. ^ Improvements in synthetic techniques and advancements in characterization methods have enabled new studies of associating polymer systems. Synthesis of entangled, high molecular weight, linear polyethylene (PE) chains functionalized with interacting pendant groups (acidic or ionic) placed periodically along the polymer backbone represent {{a new class of}} associating polymers. These polymers with <b>periodic</b> distributions of <b>acid</b> groups are much more homogenous than the commercially available polymers. Previous studies of these polymers with greater structural homogeneity revealed great variety in morphologies of the nano-aggregated polar groups within the non-polar polymer matrix. ^ This thesis correlated the morphologies with bulk properties through real-time X-ray scattering and tensile deformation at a range of temperatures and sample compositions. New, transient morphologies and hierarchical morphologies were observed which coincided with unusual tensile strain hardening. These results indicate that improvements in synthetic control of polymers can enhance physical properties such as tensile strain-hardening, through cooperative bonding between chains. ^ The structural regularity of precise polyethylenes also enables robust comparisons between experiments and computer simulations. At pico- to nano-seconds time scales and length scales of polymer and aggregate dynamics, neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulations were combined to extend the knowledge of the molecular-level aggregated polymer dynamics. These experiments provide a baseline for future studies of ion-conduction in associating polymer melts. ...|$|R

The lake {{serves as a}} state fishing area, and AMD inputs may affect the aquatic ecosystem and human health. The purpose {{of this research is}} to determine to what extent the sediments in Green Valley Lake are acting as sinks for metals and if they may impact water quality. Water and bottom sediment samples were taken throughout the lake to evaluate spatial variability of contamination and to determine how the metal concentrations compared to Post Archean Average Shale (PAAS) background values and sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) values. Three cores were taken from the Northwest portion of the lake, where AMD enters via surface flow to evaluate temporal changes in contamination. Results indicate that water quality at Green Valley is acceptable, pH is slightly acidic (pH= 6. 4) near the locations of AMD input and increases to the east (pH= 8. 30). The northwest portion of Green Valley Lake is an eutrophic lake, based on its nutrient levels and Secchi disk measurements. Organic matter content, based on LOI, is higher in the older portion of the lake (7 - 33 wt %) due to the influence of vegetation surrounding the lake. Bottom sediment at Green Valley Lake are acting as a sink for metals and nutrients. Ni and Cd concentrations are above the sediment quality guidelines severe effect level, while Zn and Pb were above the probable effect level. Metals over the severe and probably effect levels should continue to be monitored in the sediments at Green Valley Lake to ensure that organisms are not being impacted.

40|$|Manter uma boa saúde depende, entre outros fatores, de um fluxo salivar adequado 1 - 3. Os danos causados por obstrução, traumas ou remoção cirúrgica das glândulas salivares poderão acarretar alteração na produção salivar. Qualquer diminuição no fluxo salivar trará conseqüências danosas ao organismo. Desenvolveu-se este trabalho com o objetivo de aprofundar o conhecimento nos mecanismos que envolvem a regeneração da Glândula Submandibular (GSM) de ratos submetida à excisão parcial de um de seus lobos. FORMA DE ESTUDO: Experimental. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Foram utilizadas lâminas referentes ao desenvolvimento glandular de ratos aos 15, 16, 17, 18 e 19 dias de vida fetal, e 20 ratos machos de 30 ou 60 dias. Após conveniente anestesia foi removido o terço {{inferior}} do lobo esquerdo da GSM de cada animal. Após a remoção, foram deixados a se recuperar por 2, 3, 7 e 15 dias. Nestes tempos determinados foram eutanaziados, as glândulas removidas, fixadas em Methacarn, incluídas em parafina, e cortes de 5 ¼m efetuados. Foi realizada coloração ou com hematoxilina/eosina ou com ácido Periódico Reativo de Schiff (PAS). RESULTADOS: Observou-se que o processo regenerativo se instalou precocemente e em todos os espécimes estudados. Foi semelhante ao aspecto verificado no desenvolvimento glandular normal e mais acentuado no rato de 30 dias. A citodiferenciação representada pela marcação das mucinas neutras pelo PAS foi discreta inicialmente, logo após atingindo sua produção máxima, então finalmente reduzindo a expressão, sendo mudada a sua localização inicial. CONCLUSÃO: Baseados nos resultados obtidos, concluiu-se que o processo regenerativo da GSM de ratos excisada é estável, permanente e gradual, seguindo etapas definidas.

This project was developed in order to enlighten the knowledge about the mechanisms that involve the regeneration of the rat submandibular gland (SMG) submitted to a partial lobe excision. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Archived sections of rat submandibular glands of 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 days of fetal life, and twenty male rats aging 30 or 60 days were utilized. Following anesthesia, the inferior third of the left lobe of the SMG of each animal was removed. Each animal was then left for recovery during 2, 3, 7 or 15 days, when were euthanazied and the glands removed, fixed in Methacarn solution, parafinated, and with sections of 5 ¼m under microtomy.
