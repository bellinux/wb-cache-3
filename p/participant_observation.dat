5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic <b>participant</b> <b>observation</b> or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E

50|$|Observational research, (a type of non-experimental, {{correlational}} research), {{involves the}} researcher observing the ongoing behaviour of their subjects. There are multiple methods of observational research such as <b>participant</b> <b>observations,</b> non-participant observations and naturalistic observations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Participant</b> <b>observations</b> are {{methods that}} involve a {{researcher}} joining the particular social group they are studying. For example, the social psychologist, Leon Festinger and his associates, joined {{a group called}} The Seekers in order to observe them. The Seekers believed they were in touch with aliens, and that the aliens had told them the world was about to end. When the foretasted event didn't happen, Festinger and his associates observed how {{the attitudes of the}} group members changed. They published their results in a 1956 book called When Prophecy Fails. David Rosenhan in 1973 published a journal that involved research by <b>participant</b> <b>observations.</b> see: on being sane in insane places.|$|R
25|$|I/O {{psychologists have}} also {{employed}} qualitative methods, which largely involve focus groups, interviews, and case studies. I/O research on organizational culture research has employed ethnographic techniques and <b>participant</b> <b>observation.</b> A qualitative technique associated with I/O psychology is Flanagan's Critical Incident Technique. I/O psychologists sometimes use {{quantitative and qualitative}} methods in concert. OHP researchers have also combined and coordinated quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study.|$|E
25|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} {{research methods}} include interviews, first-hand observation, and <b>participant</b> <b>observation.</b> Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, ethnography, case study, and grounded theory. Qualitative researchers sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or critiques of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can {{give rise to}} quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of Nazi voting or Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.|$|E
25|$|Though Paules {{highlights}} the positive consequences of emotional labor {{for a specific}} population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of <b>participant</b> <b>observation</b> research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that casino waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace. Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous tipping system, both casino owners and customers control waitresses' behavior and appearance for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management {{makes it difficult to}} change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.|$|E

25|$|In psychology, {{qualitative}} research {{has come to}} be defined as research whose findings are not arrived at by statistical or other quantitative procedures. Qualitative research is often said to be naturalistic. That is, its goal is to understand behaviour in a natural setting. Two other goals attributed to {{qualitative research}} are understanding a phenomenon {{from the perspective of the}} research participant and understanding the meanings people give to their experience. It attempts to do this by using so-called naturalistic methods—interviewing, observation, ethnography, <b>participant</b> <b>observation</b> and focus groups. Each of these methods seeks to understand the perspective of the research participant within the context of their everyday life. This means that the researcher is concerned with asking broad questions that allow the respondent to answer in their own words. These methods allow the researcher to try to qualify their understanding during the research process through further probing questions. In addition, a method such as observation allows the researcher to observe people within natural settings—particularly those in public places. This has resulted in greater understanding of people's behaviours in, for example, lifts, public transport, and queues.|$|E
500|$|Techniques {{to gather}} this data include surveys, {{in-depth}} interviews, diaries, and <b>participant</b> <b>observation.</b> Proponents of time use diaries {{believe that this}} method [...] "generate more detailed information and tend to capture greater variation than predetermined questions." [...] However, others argue that <b>participant</b> <b>observation,</b> [...] "where the researcher spends lengthy periods of time in households helping out and observing the labor process," [...] generates more accurate information because the researcher can ascertain whether or not those studied are accurately reporting what activities they perform.|$|E

What fails to be highlighted among inner city youth are practices of nonviolence, compassion and trust. Krump dancing provides a case where inner city youth use street based tools to improve their lives. This study relies on 16 months of <b>participant</b> <b>observations</b> and in-depth interviews among krump dancers living in South Los Angeles. To understand how krump dancing is transmitted and interpreted outside of the US, I conducted three months of <b>participant</b> <b>observations</b> and in-depth interviews among krump dancers, in Melbourne, Australia. Drawing from the structures of the violent street gang, inner city youth build families, manage conflict, and cope with emotional pain and rage. Through their street experiences and identities, inner city youth create an alternative practice to the violent street gang. In doing so, they retain their street character, while demonstrating how street and decent {{are not mutually exclusive}} practices...|$|R
500|$|Observation: Using {{data from}} the senses, the {{researcher}} records information about social phenomenon or behaviour. Observation techniques {{may or may not}} feature participation. In <b>participant</b> <b>observation,</b> the researcher goes into the field (such as a community or a place of work), and participates in the activities of the field for a prolonged period of time in order to acquire a deep understanding of it. Data acquired through these techniques may be analysed either quantitatively or qualitatively. [...] In the observation research, a sociologist might study global warming in some part of the that is less populated.|$|E
500|$|The {{first problem}} of {{measuring}} unpaid {{work is the}} issue of collecting accurate information. This is always a concern in research studies, but is particularly difficult when evaluating unpaid work. [...] "Time-use surveys may reveal relatively little time devoted to unpaid direct care activities [...] the demands of subsistence production in those countries are great," [...] and may not take into account multitasking [...] for example, a mother may collect wood fuel while a child is in the same location, so the child is in her care while she is performing other work. Usually such indirect care should be included, as it is in many time use studies. But it is not always, and as a result some studies may undervalue the amount of certain types of unpaid work. <b>Participant</b> <b>observation</b> has been criticized for being [...] "so time-consuming that it can only focus on small numbers of households," [...] and thus limited in the amount of information {{it can be used to}} gather.|$|E
500|$|All data {{gathering}} involves difficulties {{with the potential}} inaccuracy of research subjects' reports. For instance, when [...] "people doing domestic labor {{have no reason to}} pay close attention to the amount of time tasks take ... they [...] often underestimate time spent in familiar activities." [...] Measuring time can also be problematic because [...] "the slowest and most inefficient workers [...] the greatest workload." [...] Time use in assessing childcare is criticized as [...] "easily obscur gender differences in workload. Men and women may both put in {{the same amount of time}} being responsible for children but as <b>participant</b> <b>observation</b> studies have shown, many men are more likely to 'babysit' their children while doing something for themselves, such as watching TV. Men's standards of care may be limited to ensuring the children are not hurt. Dirty diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until the mother returns." [...] A paradoxical aspect of this problem is that those most burdened may not be able to participate in the studies: [...] "It is usually those women with the heaviest work loads who choose not to participate in these studies." [...] In general, measurement of time causes [...] "some of the most demanding aspects of unpaid work [...] and the premise that time is an appropriate tool for measuring women's unpaid work goes unchallenged." [...] Surveys have also been criticized for lacking [...] "depth and complexity" [...] as questions cannot be specifically tailored to particular circumstances.|$|E

2500|$|In {{qualitative}} research, {{the researcher}} {{is the primary}} data collection instrument. Qualitative research involves data collected from participant observations, interviews, questionnaires, phone calls, focus groups etc. Interviewing, focus groups, and <b>participant</b> <b>observation</b> are common modes of qualitative data gathering. Interviews are used in most types of qualitative research. <b>Participant</b> <b>observation</b> is a method particularly employed by ethnographers in the anthropological tradition. It is used {{to learn about the}} naturally occurring routines, interactions and practices of a particular group of people in their social environments, and so to understand their culture. When a researcher becomes a part {{of the participants in the}} situation under observation, it is called a participant observer.|$|E
2500|$|Observational {{methods are}} purely {{descriptive}} and include naturalistic observation, [...] "contrived" [...] observation, <b>participant</b> <b>observation,</b> and archival analysis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the chronic poverty {{problems}} in Metro Manila, based on the NSO data and the <b>participant</b> <b>observations</b> in a squatters area. Indeed, we can recognize the improvement in the poverty incidence in M. M. during the 1990 s, but the level of the alleviation may tend to be exaggerated. In fact, while it is often pointed out that most of the slum dwellers are migrants from Bicol, Western and Eastern Visayas, the pattern of the immigration of M. M. has not yet changed. Furthermore, we would like to explain the changes in the "customary economy" through the <b>participant</b> <b>observations</b> since 1985. Such an informal economic mechanism secures the poor social safety nets, which they cannot obtain in "market economy". We can point out that such a role of "customary economy" may be based on the town-mate socio-economic relationships, "kababayan". During the 1990 s, the dominant mechanism in the labor market has changed from the "bilateral vertical" to the "multilateral horizontal" relationships. It can be a symptom of mobilizing community resources in the Philippines. ...|$|R

2500|$|By using <b>participant</b> <b>observation</b> and interviews, Leidner (1993) {{examines}} how employers in fast food restaurants regulate workers' interactions with customers. According to Leidner (1993), employers attempt to regulate workers' interactions with customers only under certain conditions. Specifically, when employers attempt to regulate worker-customer interactions, employers believe that [...] "the {{quality of the}} interaction {{is important to the}} success of the enterprise", that workers are [...] "unable or unwilling to conduct the interactions appropriately on their own", and that the [...] "tasks themselves are not too complex or context-dependent." [...] According to Leidner (1993), regulating employee interactions with customers involves standardizing workers' personal interactions with customers. At the McDonald's fast food restaurants in Leidner's (1993) study, these interactions are strictly scripted, and workers' compliance with the scripts and regulations are closely monitored.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} how “birdwatching visions” are created through the {{relations}} between human and non-human actors in birdwatching, {{and what kind of}} representations of birds that are constituted within these visions. The aims have mainly been examined by <b>participant</b> <b>observations</b> of birdwatching in Sweden; <b>participant</b> <b>observations</b> of the work done by the NGO BirdLife Malta during the Spring hunting season of birds in Malta; and by interviewing birdwatchers in both contexts. The Actor-Network Theory serves as the theoretical perspective used to analyze how birdwatching visions are ordered and shaped in birdwatching, and how birds as “socio-material phenomenon” are constituted. The study shows how birdwatchers, through their relations to different devices, improve their abilities to determine species of birds, both by using equipment that extend their biological abilities, and equipment that offer a model of interpretation. The study also shows that the birdwatching visions are built upon a taxonomic and focused ways of thinking about birds, where the birds are given certain meanings depending on their occurrence in time and space and what kind of “species” they are identified as. ...|$|R
