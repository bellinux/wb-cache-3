5|$|There is {{a larger}} <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> in Brussels than Washington D.C.; in 2007 media outlets in every Union member-state had a Brussels correspondent. However, since the global {{downturn}} by 2010 the <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> in Brussels shrunk by a third. There is one journalist covering EU news for Latvia and none for Lithuania. Although {{there has been a}} worldwide cut in journalists, the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to believe they can cover the EU from these source and news agencies. In the face of high-level criticism, the Commission is also due to shut down Presseurop on 20 December 2013.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 2000, Giuliani and Clinton met {{face-to-face}} for {{the first}} time since the campaigning began, at the New York Inner Circle press dinner, an annual event in which New York politicians and the <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> stage skits, roast each other and make fun of themselves, with proceeds going to charity.|$|E

5|$|After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the first}} four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring {{replaced}} him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as a surprising move by the majority of the <b>press</b> <b>corps.</b> Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5|$|Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving {{his head}} like a Buddhist monk in protest. Mẫu had decided to leave the country for a {{religious}} pilgrimage to India and the diplomatic and <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> assembled at the airport to see him off. He never arrived, as the Ngô family had him arrested. General Đính softened the punishment at the behest of a fellow officer, and put the former diplomat under house arrest instead of placing him in jail.|$|E
5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The exact nature of this relationship has been widely discussed by historians; some have argued that the relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others have argued that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{opposition}} from ConnDOT, the Connecticut DEP, and affected towns, the FHWA issued a Record of Decision and the Army Corps of Engineers issued required permits for Alternative 133 18/25 (southern alignment) in 2001. State {{and local officials}} continued to <b>press</b> the <b>Corps</b> of Engineers to approve the northern alignment. Due to the impasse between state, local, and federal officials, federal funds for the bypass were withdrawn in 2003.

5|$|Clinton {{traveled}} to 79countries during this time, breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon. She {{did not hold}} a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but {{played a role in}} U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American <b>press</b> <b>corps.</b> The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2006, American comedian Stephen Colbert {{appeared}} as the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, {{which was held}} in Washington, D.C., at the Hilton Washington hotel. Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States on the cable television networks C-SPAN and MSNBC. Standing {{a few feet from}} U.S. President George W.

He spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhists in Saigon {{were aware}} that a raid on the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist {{relatives}} of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into {{the region in the}} lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of the raids. The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks and the doors were barricaded with furniture and reinforced by nailing wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> in Saigon that the raids were coming, allowing them to be more prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, as mass {{civil disobedience}} broke out due to discontent from the Buddhist {{majority}} over Diệm's pro-Catholic discrimination, {{sparked by the}} fatal shootings of nine people who were demonstrating against the ban on the Buddhist flag. The US began to lose confidence in Diệm's ability to run the country effectively and prevent {{the growth of the}} communist insurgency, and concluded that he was an obstacle to religious and thus national stability. During this time, the American <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> wrote unvarnished stories about the South Vietnamese government's policies and actions, in contrast to the supportive pieces of the 1950s, and Diệm's attempt to physically intimidate correspondents backfired. After Diệm tried to settle the Buddhist crisis by launching synchronized raids on Buddhist temples across the country to round up those monks who were leading protests against him, the Americans began to look for alternative leadership, sending Cable 243 to their embassy in Saigon to authorise the search for someone to replace Diệm. In November 1963, Diệm was overthrown in a US-backed coup and he and Nhu were captured and executed.|$|E
5|$|The large, mostly {{spontaneous}} gatherings at Truman's whistle-stop {{events were}} an important {{sign of a}} change in momentum in the campaign, but this shift went virtually unnoticed by the national <b>press</b> <b>corps.</b> It continued reporting Republican Thomas Dewey's apparent impending victory as a certainty. One reason for the press's inaccurate projection was that polls were conducted primarily by telephone, but many people, including much of Truman's populist base, did not yet own a telephone. This skewed the data to indicate a stronger support base for Dewey than existed. An unintended and undetected projection error {{may have contributed to the}} perception of Truman's bleak chances. The three major polling organizations stopped polling well before the November 2 election date—Roper in September, and Crossley and Gallup in October—thus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey.|$|E
25|$|The WHCD {{has been}} {{increasingly}} criticized {{as an example}} of the coziness between the White House <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> and the administration. The dinner typically includes a skit, either live or videotaped, by the sitting president in which he mocks himself, for the amusement of the <b>press</b> <b>corps.</b> The <b>press</b> <b>corps,</b> in turn, hobnobs with administration officials, even those who are unpopular and are not regularly cooperative with the press. Increasing scrutiny by bloggers has contributed to added public focus on this friendliness.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the outcome}} of the 11:40 A.M. attack seemed in doubt, Sheridan sent the VIII Corps under Brig. Gen. George Crook to locate the Confederate left flank and look out for and protect the right flank of the XIX Corps. Sheridan also ordered Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson's cavalry {{division}} to advance toward Early's right flank and cut off his line of retreat from Winchester. Wilson started late and did not succeed in his mission in spite of the weak nature of the Confederates in his front. Sheridan rode to his right flank where he found the hard <b>pressed</b> XIX <b>Corps</b> and vociferously assured General Emory that Crook was coming up and that the Union forces would whip the rebels. Crook reached the Union right flank, he found Sheridan waiting for him and advanced into the First Woods toward the Middle Field where Dwight's division was still hanging on after taking heavy losses in its fight with Gordon. Crook decided to relieve the XIX Corps with Col. Joseph Thoburn's division and then personally led Col. Isaac Duval's division on a flank march north of Red Bud Run and attack Gordon's left flank.|$|R
25|$|On January 1, the {{commander}} of the XI <b>Corps</b> <b>pressed</b> a frontal attack on Sarikamish that lasted for the next four days; after that the fighting began to lose momentum. Snow hindered advancing forces which were supposed to bring relief. The IX Corps melted away on the way to Sarikamish. One of the divisions lost 40% of its strength in a snowstorm. The X Corps never came to the rescue. 90% of X Corps was left on the slopes of the Allahüekber Mountains. The XI Corps was fighting in the Aras region. A regiment entered Çerkezköy, only to be taken prisoner. While the Stange regiment entered Ardahan on schedule, the troops were exhausted. The Russians were poised to encircle the remaining forces.|$|R
5000|$|As the war neared its end, the Canadian <b>Corps</b> <b>pressed</b> on towards Germany and {{the final}} phase of the war for the Canadians was known as the ''''''Pursuit to Mons''''''. It was during these final thirty-two days of the war that the Canadians engaged the {{retreating}} Germans over about seventy kilometres in a running series of battles at Denain and Valenciennes in France and finally Mons in Belgium where they pushed the Germans out of the town on November 10-11. [...] Mons was, coincidentally, where the British had engaged the German armies {{for the first time in}} battle in the Great War on August 23, 1914. As such, Mons is considered by some to be considered the place where the war both began and ended for the British Empire.|$|R

5000|$|At 13:30, the 4th Panzer Brigade {{ran into}} enemy {{positions}} between the rail {{line and the}} highway from Wavre to Gembloux. The Dyle position was defended.

That morning, 3rd Panzer Brigade crossed the Belgian anti-tank obstacle behind the 4th Panzer Division, with 5th Panzer Regiment {{on the right and}} 6th Panzer Regiment on the left. Colonel Kuhn—the brigade commander—was with 6th Panzer Regiment which became involved in the fighting in Ernage and on the Wavre-Gembloux road, the tanks being taken under [...] "lively" [...] artillery and anti-tank fire.

2500|$|Falkenhayn now {{ordered a}} new attack south of Ypres, between Gheluveld and Ploegsteert Wood, by [...] "Army Group Fabeck". IV Corps was broken up (27 October) and Rawlinson {{and his staff}} sent home to {{supervise}} the arrival of 8th Division. [...] French still expected to attack, turning the German western flank, on 29 October, and even after the Germans had <b>pressed</b> I <b>Corps</b> hard SE of Ypres that day (he later claimed in 1914 to have realised that the BEF could now {{do no more than}} hold its ground, but he in fact issued orders for the flanking attack to go ahead on 30 October). Sir John supervised the arrangement of reinforcements from Smith-Dorrien and Dubois' French corps to Haig's and Allenby's hard pressed forces at Ypres (30 October). Once again, the British planned to counterattack, but French was roused from his sleep (12.30am on 31 October) by Foch, who warned him that his staff had spotted a gap in the British lines at Hollebeke Chateau; Foch advised him to [...] "hammer away, keep on hammering" [...] and promised to send a further 8 French battalions and 3 batteries. [...] Sir John spent the crisis day of 31 October visiting Allenby and Gough, and was with Haig when they learned that a single battalion of the Worcesters had retaken Gheluveld ("The Worcesters saved the Empire" [...] French later wrote). [...] He then met Foch at the town hall at Ypres to warn him that he had no more reserves apart from [...] "the sentries at his gate"—the next day (1 November) Haig's I Corps held its ground, with cooks, grooms and drivers pressed into the line, and aided by French counterattacks which drew off German reserves. [...] The line stabilised, although there was a final day of crisis on 11 November.|$|R
50|$|After a {{pause for}} breath at Dong Song to {{resupply}} {{with food and}} ammunition and to establish a shorter supply line back to Chu across the mountain of Deo Quan, the Tonkin expeditionary <b>corps</b> <b>pressed</b> on towards Lang Son. On 11 February the 2nd Brigade, {{at the head of}} the French column, contacted advance elements of the Guangxi Army at Pho Vy. The Chinese were ejected from the village of Pho Vy by Herbinger's three French battalions with little difficulty, but they brought up their reserves and mounted a counterattack against Herbinger's regiment which forced de Negrier to commit Diguet's Legion battalion to drive them off. Towards the end of the battle the 111th Battalion stormed a Chinese hill position under the eyes of the rest of the brigade. 2nd Lieutenant Rene Normand, who fell a month later in the Battle of Bang Bo and whose letters from Tonkin were published after his death, distinguished himself in this action. Towards evening the Chinese fell back on their main body at Bac Vie. French casualties at Pho Vy were slight: a total of 1 dead and 23 wounded.|$|R

50|$|It {{took the}} French {{a month to}} {{complete}} their preparations for the Lạng Sơn Campaign. Finally, on 3 February 1885, Brière de l'Isle began his advance from Chu with a column of just under 7,200 troops, accompanied by 4,500 coolies. In ten days the column advanced {{to the outskirts of}} Lang Son. The troops were burdened with the weight of their provisions and equipment, and had to march through extremely difficult country. They also had to fight fierce actions to overrun stoutly defended Chinese positions, at Tây Hòa (4 February), Hạ Hòa (5 February) and Dong Song (6 February). After a brief pause for breath at Dong Song, the expeditionary <b>corps</b> <b>pressed</b> on towards Lạng Sơn, fighting further actions at Deo Quao (9 February), and Pho Vy (11 February). On 12 February, in a costly but successful battle, the Turcos and marine infantry of Colonel Laurent Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade stormed the main Chinese defences at Bac Vie, several kilometres to the south of Lang Son. On 13 February, the French column entered Lang Son which the Chinese abandoned after fighting a token rearguard action at the nearby village of Ky Lua.|$|R
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the 6th, it was found that General Lee was moving west of Jetersville, towards Danville. General Sheridan moved with his cavalry (the 5th corps having been {{returned}} to General Meade on his reaching Jetersville) to strike his flank, followed by the 6th corps, while the 2d and 5th <b>corps</b> <b>pressed</b> hard after, forcing him to abandon several hundred wagons and several pieces of artillery. General Ord advanced from Burkesville towards Farmville, sending two regiments of infantry and a squadron of cavalry, under Brevet Brigadier-General Theodore Read, to reach and destroy the bridges. This advance met the head of Lee's column near Farmville, which it heroically attacked and detained until General Read was killed and his small force overpowered. This caused a delay in the enemy's movements, and enabled General Ord to get well up with the remainder of his force, on meeting which, the enemy immediately intrenched himself. In the afternoon, General Sheridan struck the enemy south of Sailors' Creek, captured sixteen pieces of artillery and about four hundred wagons, and detained him until the 6th corps got up, when a general attack of infantry and cavalry was made, which resulted in the capture of six or seven thousand prisoners, among whom were many general officers. The movements of the 2d corps and General Ord's command contributed greatly to the day's success.|$|R
50|$|The central thrust by the U.S. 36th Division, under Major General Fred L. Walker, {{commenced}} {{three hours}} after sunset on 20 January. The lack of time to prepare meant that the approach to the river was still hazardous due to uncleared mines and booby traps and the highly technical business of an opposed river crossing lacked the necessary planning and rehearsal. Although a battalion of the 143rd Infantry Regiment {{was able to get}} across the Gari {{on the south side of}} San Angelo and two companies of the 141st Infantry Regiment on the north side, they were isolated for most of the time and at no time was Allied armour able to get across the river, leaving them highly vulnerable to counter-attacking tanks and self-propelled guns of Generalleutnant Eberhard Rodt's 15th Panzergrenadier Division. The southern group was forced back across the river by mid-morning of 21 January. Major General Keyes, commanding the U.S. II <b>Corps,</b> <b>pressed</b> Major General Walker to renew the attack immediately. Once again the two regiments attacked)| but with no more success against the well dug-in 15th Panzergrenadier Division: the 143rd Infantry Regiment got the equivalent of two battalions across, but, once again, there was no armoured support and they were devastated when daylight came the next day. The 141st Infantry Regiment also crossed in two battalion strength and, despite the lack of armoured support, managed to advance 1 km. However, with the coming of daylight, they too were cut down and by the evening of 22 January the 141st Infantry Regiment had virtually ceased to exist; only 40 men made it back to the Allied lines.|$|R
