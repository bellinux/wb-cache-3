40|$|The DLR project ALLFlight (Assisted Low-Level Flight and Landing on Unprepared Landing Sites) {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a helicopter pilot assistance system, to provide pilot assistance during all phases of flight. The research is particularly focused on the landing on unprepared sites in the presence of obstacles and in a degraded visual environment. The goal is to compute a safe flight path in real time that is displayed to the pilot. Several technical components such as a sensor suite to scan the environment, path planning algorithms, head-downand helmet-mounted displays, active inceptors, and the model-based flight control system are set up to form the overall assistance system. Throughout the development, <b>pilot</b> <b>surveys</b> generate requirements to design individual components such as path planning algorithms, or the synthetic view of the helmet-mounted display. Prior surveys accelerate the design and adjustment of the respective components, meaning that the flight tests benefit from well-designed components, minimizing the requirement for further “re-designs”. During ALLFlight, the successfully flight-tested manual landing with path planning and obstacle avoidance in real time for an unknown terrain has been demonstrated. This paper describes each assistance component, the <b>pilot</b> <b>surveys,</b> and the results obtained in almost six years of research...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to editing {{in the production}} of official statistics is to aim at detecting and correcting all errors in the data. This approach leads to an editing procedure that is highly resource-demanding. In some surveys conducted at Statistics Finland, over 50 % of the working time is used for editing. Moreover, the {{traditional approach}} to editing often lacks a clear strategy. Typically, a large number of errors that have little impact on results are corrected. Selective editing helps target editing to errors that {{have a significant impact on}} results. Both the likelihood of errors and their impact on results are estimated in order to calculate score values for survey units. These score values help prioritize units subjected to manual editing. This presentation will describe the implementation of selective editing at four statistical surveys conducted at Statistics Finland. International trade in services, Finance of housing companies, Quarterly statistics on the finances of municipalities and Register-based statistics on buildings and dwellings were chosen as <b>pilot</b> <b>surveys</b> in a project that aims to harmonize and improve editing practices in the framework of an editing model developed at Statistics Finland. Selective editing is one of the new tools to be implemented in the project. The usefulness of selective editing in the <b>pilot</b> <b>surveys</b> is evaluated by the decrease in the number of units requiring manual editing...|$|R

40|$|Improved {{access to}} {{effective}} contraceptive methods {{is needed in}} Canada, particularly in rural areas, where unintended pregnancy rates are high and specific sexual health services may be further away. A rural pharmacist {{may be the most}} accessible health care professional. Pharmacy practice increasingly incorporates cognitive services. In Canada many provinces allow pharmacists to independently prescribe for some indications, but not for hormonal contraception. To assess the acceptability for the implementation of this innovative practice in Canada, we developed and <b>piloted</b> a <b>survey</b> instrument. We chose questions to address the components for adoption and change described in Rogers’ “diffusion of innovations” theory. The proposed instrument was iteratively reviewed by 12 experts, then focus group tested among eight pharmacists or students to improve the instrument for face validity, readability, consistency and relevancy to community pharmacists in the Canadian context. We then <b>pilot</b> tested the <b>survey</b> among urban and rural pharmacies. 4 % of urban and 35 % of rural pharmacies returned <b>pilot</b> <b>surveys.</b> Internal consistency on repeated re-phrased questions was high (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0. 901). We present our process {{for the development of a}} survey instrument to assess the acceptability and feasibility among Canadian community pharmacists for the innovative practice of the independent prescribing of hormonal contraception...|$|R

50|$|Information, {{industry}} experts, {{and secondary}} data {{may not be}} sufficient to define the research problem. Sometimes qualitative research must be undertaken to gain a qualitative understanding of the problem and its underlying factors. Qualitative research is unstructured, exploratory in nature, based on small samples, and may utilize popular qualitative techniques such as focus groups (group interviews), word association (asking respondents to indicate their first responses to stimulus words), and depth interviews (one-on-one interviews which probe the respondents' thoughts in detail). Other exploratory research techniques, such as <b>pilot</b> <b>surveys</b> with small samples of respondents, may also be undertaken.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pilot study}} of the merger was done, which yielded {{perception}} and production data from a few New Zealand speakers.

The finding has been interesting to some linguists because it concurs with the recent understanding that losing a distinction between two sounds involves losing the ability to produce it as well as to perceive it (Gordon 2002). However, due to the very small number of people participating in the study the results cannot be considered convincing.|$|E
