5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the board}} is triangular, the two armies are set up asymmetrically. One player sets their pieces near a base of the {{triangle}} on light-colored cells in three rows: 7 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the front row, 6 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the middle row, 5 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the third row; the back row is left empty. The other player sets their pieces {{at the opposite end}} of the triangle on dark-colored cells in four rows: 6 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the front row, 5 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the second row, 4 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the third row, 3 <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the fourth row; the two back rows are left empty. Each player's two captains are placed in their front row, one cell inward from the left and right sides. An empty row separates the armies.|$|R

50|$|Most of Bosch's guitar {{works were}} not {{published}} {{at the time}} they were written but in collections of Dix <b>Pièces</b> (ten <b>pieces)</b> <b>in</b> 1887 and 1894, 12 Pièces faciles (12 easy <b>pieces)</b> <b>in</b> 1892 and a further six easy <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> 1894. A later edition of ten easy pieces (1923) reprints some previously published pieces together with seven pieces that had apparently not previously been published.|$|R

5|$|The king, which {{required}} safeguarding from checkmate in the middlegame, {{emerges as a}} strong <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> the endgame. It is often brought {{to the center of}} the board where it can protect its own pawns, attack enemy pawns, and hinder moves of the opponent's king.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (about {{the size of}} a half dollar) being issued by the Mint was {{becoming}} both unpopular in commerce and expensive to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> February 1857.|$|E

5|$|Fauré did {{not intend}} the eighth nocturne to appear under that designation. His {{publisher}} collected eight short piano pieces together and published them as 8 pièces brèves, allocating each of them a title unauthorised by the composer. The nocturne, the last <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> the set of eight, is shorter and less complex than its immediate predecessor, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's opera {{based on}} the legend of Ulysses and Penelope was first {{performed}} in 1913, after which the composer published {{a version of the}} prelude transcribed for piano. The <b>piece,</b> <b>in</b> G minor, contrasts a gravely noble andante moderato theme representing Penelope with a forthright theme for Ulysses. The polyphonic writing transfers effectively from the orchestral original to the piano.|$|E
5|$|Given to the City of London by Moore and the Contemporary Art Society in 1967, Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65 is {{displayed}} in Abingdon Street Gardens, opposite the Houses of Parliament, where its regular {{appearance in the}} background of televised news reports from Westminster makes it Moore's most prominent <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> Britain. The ownership of Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65 was disputed until its 2011 acquisition by the Parliamentary Art Collection.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} {{that may}} change the strategy is that the cannon can not use a face down piece for a screen but can capture multiple <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> a single turn. The cannon can not capture face down <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> this variant.|$|R
50|$|Unlike chess or its variants, {{there is}} no {{predetermined}} layout for the pieces, allowing each player to place the <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> different squares to his advantage or according to his strategy. The allocation of spaces (6 vacant squares) {{is important for the}} tactical movement of the individual <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> the first three ranks, because a piece that has friendly <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> front, behind, and on each side is effectively immobilized until a space opens up on these adjacent squares.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1967, new coins were {{introduced}} {{due to a}} considerable fall {{in the value of}} the króna. 10 krónur coins {{were introduced}} in that year, followed by 50 aurar and 5 krónur <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> 1969 and 50 krónur <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> 1970.|$|R
5|$|In 1900, Dunne {{moved to}} New York. Dooley's musings, since the war, had been entirely on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed {{to satisfy the}} demands of a {{national}} audience. In January 1900, just before he left the Journal, he wrote a Bridgeport <b>piece,</b> <b>in</b> which many of the earlier ones were recalled. This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the Journal.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the works}} {{that make up the}} Better Out Than In series were defaced, some just hours after the piece was unveiled. At least one {{defacement}} was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.|$|E

She stated that she loved France, her street, her café, and not having to use a car. Rather than go on to work on a big budget American film after Inglourious Basterds, her next role was in a small theater <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> France.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} TransGeneration came in 2004. Lawyer and {{journalist}} Fred Bernstein had written {{an article about}} transgender students at US colleges and universities. The New York Times published the <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> March; some Sundance Channel staffers (including Adam Pincus, {{senior vice president of}} original programming) read it, and saw potential for a documentary series. The idea got executive approval, and Sundance commissioned World of Wonder Productions to make the series.|$|E
5|$|Brooks & Dunn is an American {{country music}} duo {{consisting}} of Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn, both vocalists and songwriters. The duo {{was founded in}} 1990 through the suggestion of Tim DuBois. Before the foundation, both members were solo recording artists. Brooks wrote number one singles for John Conlee, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Highway 101; both he and Dunn also charted two solo singles a <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s, with Brooks also releasing an album for Capitol Records in 1989.

5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that <b>piece.</b> <b>In</b> three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E
5|$|Early Baroque organ {{music in}} Germany was highly contrapuntal. Sacred organ music {{was based on}} chorales: composers such as Samuel Scheidt and Heinrich Scheidemann wrote chorale preludes, chorale fantasias, and chorale motets. Towards {{the end of the}} Baroque era, the chorale prelude and the partita became mixed, forming the chorale partita. This genre was {{developed}} by Georg Böhm, Johann Pachelbel, and Dieterich Buxtehude. The primary type of free-form <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> this period was the praeludium, as exemplified in the works of Matthias Weckmann, Nicolaus Bruhns, Böhm, and Buxtehude. The organ music of Johann Sebastian Bach fused characteristics of every national tradition and historical style in his large-scale preludes and fugues and chorale-based works. Towards the end of the Baroque era, George Frideric Handel composed the first organ concertos.|$|E
5|$|In March 2017, to {{coincide}} with International Women's Day and Women's History Month, the Tory Burch Foundation launched Embrace Ambition, a global campaign to address the double standard that exists around ambition, which is often seen as a positive trait in men and a negative one in women. The campaign includes a video PSA featuring a variety of celebrities, both women and men. In September 2017, Burch wrote an opinion <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> TIME on pay equity for women, noting how equal pay benefits society and business across the board.|$|E
