25|$|The manubrium joins {{with the}} body of the sternum, the clavicles and the cartilages of the first <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs.</b> The {{inferior}} border, oval and rough, is covered with a thin layer of cartilage for articulation {{with the body}}. The lateral borders are each marked above by a depression for the first costal cartilage, and below by a small facet, which, with a similar facet on the upper angle of the body, forms a notch for the reception of the costal cartilage of the second rib. Between the depression for the first costal cartilage and the demi-facet for the second is a narrow, curved edge, which slopes from above downward towards the middle. Also, the superior sternopericardial ligament attaches the pericardium to the posterior side of the manubrium.|$|E
25|$|Hyenas have {{relatively}} short torsos and are fairly massive and wolf-like in build, but have lower hind quarters, high withers and their backs slope noticeably downward toward their rumps. The forelegs are high, while the hind legs are very short and their necks are thick and short. Their skulls superficially {{resemble those of}} large canids, but are much larger and heavier, with shorter facial portions. Hyenas are digitigrade, with the fore and hind paws having four digits each and sporting bulging pawpads. Like canids, hyenas have short, blunt, non-retractable claws. Their pelage is sparse and coarse with poorly developed or absent underfur. Most species have a rich mane of long hair running from the withers or from the head. With {{the exception of the}} spotted hyena, hyaenids have striped coats, which they likely inherited from their viverrid ancestors. Their ears are large and have simple basal ridges and no marginal bursa. Their vertebral column, including the cervical region are of limited mobility. Hyenas have no baculum. Hyenas have an additional <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs</b> than canids, and their tongues are rough like those of felids and viverrids. Males in most hyena species are larger than females, though the spotted hyena is exceptional, as it is the female of the species that outweighs and dominates the male. Also, unlike other hyenas, the female spotted hyena's external genitalia closely resembles that of the male.|$|E
2500|$|In horses, the Arabian (breed) {{can have}} one less {{vertebrae}} and <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs.</b> [...] This anomaly disappears in foals {{that are the}} product of an Arabian and another breed of horse.|$|E

50|$|The terms true {{and false}} rib {{describe}} rib pairs that are {{directly or indirectly}} attached to the sternum. The phrase true rib (costae verae), or fixed rib, refers to the first seven, or vertebrosternal, rib pairs. The phrase false rib (costae spuriae), or vertebrochondral ribs refers to the eighth-to-twelfth <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs.</b> The eighth-to-tenth <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs</b> connect to the sternum indirectly via the costal cartilages <b>of</b> the <b>ribs</b> above them. Their elasticity allows ribcage movement for respiratory activity.|$|R
50|$|Skowronek died in February 1930 {{at the age}} of 22. Lady Wentworth {{donated the}} stallion's {{skeleton}} (showing 17 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs</b> and five lumbar vertebrae) to the British Museum in London.|$|R
2500|$|Upper {{pitchers}} are variably funnel-shaped, {{ranging from}} wholly [...] to infundibular {{only in the}} basal quarter and cylindrical, or more rarely tubular, above. They may be considerably larger than their terrestrial counterparts, reaching 24cm in height by 6cm in width, though they rarely approach these maximum dimensions. The wings are commonly reduced to a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs</b> in aerial traps. Upper pitchers resemble lower ones in other respects.|$|E
2500|$|Rosette {{and lower}} {{pitchers}} are bulbous in the basal third, becoming cylindrical above {{and having a}} slight constriction in the middle. They are up to 16.5cm high by 4cm wide. The pitcher opening is up to 3cm wide. The peristome is cylindrical and up to 5–7mm wide. The fringed wings are restricted to {{the upper half of}} the pitcher cup, the lower parts being reduced to a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs.</b> The fringe elements are spaced several millimetres apart and the longest (≤1.3cm) are found in the upper third of the pitcher, near the peristome. The lid is round to slightly [...] (heart-shaped). It is distinctly domed and has a diameter of up to 3.5cm. On the underside of the lid, the basal keel is 7–8mm long and 3mm high. A branched spur 2–3mm long is inserted near the base of the lid.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is claimed}} that in January 1881, that Krao {{and her parents}} were {{captured}} during an expedition conducted by the explorer Carl Bock {{to what is now}} northern Thailand and Laos. An anthropologist named Dr. George Shelly was part of the expedition and took charge of Krao. Krao was described as being part of a primitive tribe of humans called [...] "Kraos-monink" [...] all of whom were covered in hair and lived in trees. Her parents were also captured. The Siamese had to be bribed by Bock and Shelley into capturing them because of the belief that it was bad luck to kill or capture Kraos-monink. Krao's mother was detained in Bangkok and her father died from cholera. They were said to lack the knowledge of fire and survived upon fruits, fish, and nuts. Her name was said to mean [...] "ape" [...] in Siamese. She was also described as having a number of anatomically unusual features in addition to her body hair including an extra Thoracic vertebrae, an extra <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs,</b> cheek pouches, hypermobility of her joints, and lacking cartilage in her ears and nose.|$|E
50|$|Sumatran {{elephants}} reach {{a shoulder}} height of between 2 and 3.2 m, weigh between 2000 and 4000 kg, and have 20 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs.</b> Their skin color is lighter than of maximus and indicus with least depigmentation.|$|R
5000|$|The axial {{skeleton}} contains the skull, vertebral column, sternum, and ribs. The sternum consists of multiple sternebrae, which fuse to form one bone, {{attached to the}} 8 [...] "true" [...] <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs,</b> out <b>of</b> a total of 18.|$|R
40|$|Ribs from sheep, goat and pig {{are rarely}} assessed  to species {{due to the}} fact that they are very similar in their {{morphology}} and size. The ribs are instead considered unidentifiable although it is possible to see what kind of bone it is. If these ribs would be identified to species not only would species assessment degree of archaeological source material   increase, the relationship between meat-rich and meat poor regions would change. To find out whether there are morphologically measurable differences between sheep, goat and pig ribs, three measurement points on each rib has been defined and measured. At each measurement point two measurements were measured, one medial-lateral measurement and one cranial-caudal measurement. The ratio between the medial- lateral measurement and the cranial-caudal measurement was calculated for each point. In this way, it is not the size variation between species that are studied, but its morphology. There are statistically differences between the species. Sheep and pig   have significant differences in 11 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs.</b> Goat and pig also have significant differences in 11 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs.</b> Sheep and goat are significantly different in five <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs.</b> The results <b>of</b> this study could be used to develop a method for the assessment of sheep, goat and pig based on ribs...|$|R

50|$|In general, the Asian {{elephant}} {{is smaller}} than the African elephant and has the highest body point on the head. The back is convex or level. The ears are small with dorsal borders folded laterally. It has up to 20 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs</b> and 34 caudal vertebrae. The feet have more nail-like structures than those of African elephants—five on each forefoot, and four on each hind foot.|$|R

50|$|The {{thoracic}} inlet is bounded by: {{the first}} thoracic vertebra (T1) posteriorly; the first <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs</b> laterally, forming lateral C-shaped curves posterior to anterior; and the costal cartilage {{of the first}} rib and the superior border of the manubrium anteriorly.|$|E
50|$|Thoracic {{vertebrae}} in all mammalian {{species are}} those vertebrae that also carry a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs,</b> and lie caudal to the cervical vertebrae.

50|$|The {{rib cage}} is {{composed}} <b>of</b> 12 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs</b> plus the sternum {{for a total}} of 25 separate bones. The rib cage functions as protection for the vital organs such as the heart and lungs. The ribs are shaped like crescents, with one end flattened and the other end rounded. The rounded ends are attached at joints to the thoracic vertebrae at the back and the flattened ends come together at the sternum, in the front.|$|R
5000|$|Upper {{pitchers}} {{are similar}} to their terrestrial counterparts in most respects, even retaining the same colouration.

50|$|Tetrapods, however, {{only ever}} have a single set of ribs which are {{probably}} homologous with the dorsal ribs of fishes. In the early tetrapods, every vertebra bore a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs,</b> although those on the thoracic vertebrae are typically the longest. The sacral ribs were stout and short, since they formed part of the pelvis, connecting the backbone to the hip bones.|$|E
5000|$|Upper {{pitchers}} {{are frequently}} produced. They are variably funnel-shaped, ranging from wholly [...] to infundibular {{only in the}} basal two-thirds and cylindrical above. They may be somewhat larger than their terrestrial counterparts, reaching 25 cm in height by 7 cm in width, though they rarely reach these maximum dimensions. The wings are commonly reduced to a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>ribs.</b> Aerial traps resemble terrestrial ones in other respects.|$|E
