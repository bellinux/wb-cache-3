5|$|Again coincidentally {{about this}} same time, the Saratoga strike force arrived and {{attacked}} Ryūjō, hitting and heavily damaging her with {{three to five}} bombs and <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> torpedo, and killing 120 of her crew. Also during this time, several U.S. B-17 heavy bombers attacked the crippled Ryūjō but caused no additional damage. The crew abandoned the heavily damaged Japanese carrier at nightfall and she sank soon after. Amatsukaze and Tokitsukaze rescued Ryūjōs survivors and the aircrews from her returning strike force, who ditched their aircraft in the ocean nearby. After the rescue operations were complete, both Japanese destroyers and Tone rejoined Nagumo's main force.|$|E
5|$|Al-Biruni (973–1048) {{measured}} the {{radius of the}} earth using a new method. It involved observing {{the height of a}} mountain at Nandana (now in Pakistan). Al-Idrisi (1100–1166) created a map of the world for Roger, the Norman King of Sicily. He also wrote the Book of Roger, a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time. The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis (c. 1470–1553) made a map of the New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use of maps from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> made by Christopher Columbus. He was part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, despite setbacks, financially tight {{times and}} the American Civil War, the College {{continued}} to expand. Seton Hall opened a military science department (forerunner to the ROTC program) {{during the summer of}} 1893, but this program was ultimately disbanded during the Spanish–American War. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> of the most pivotal events in the history of Seton Hall came in 1897 when Seton Hall's preparatory (high school) and college (undergraduate) divisions were permanently separated. By 1937, Seton Hall established a University College. This marked the first matriculation of women at Seton Hall. Seton Hall became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1948, Seton Hall was given a license by the FCC for WSOU-FM.|$|E
5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, {{and the only}} remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as {{there was not a}} single person who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (<b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>one</b> of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E

It was <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> of the largest exoduses from a single district in the country ever. Chhagan Bhujbal, Nashik's guardian minister, reported that 15,000migrant workers had left the city {{in the aftermath of the}} violence against North Indians.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} types of shallow-water coral reef, {{including}} fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls; most occur in tropical and subtropical seas. They are very slow-growing, adding <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> centimetre (0.4in) in height each year. The Great Barrier Reef {{is thought to have}} been laid down about two million years ago. Over time, corals fragment and die, sand and rubble accumulates between the corals, and the shells of clams and other molluscs decay to form a gradually evolving calcium carbonate structure. Coral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems hosting over 4,000 species of fish, massive numbers of cnidarians, molluscs, crustaceans, and many other animals.|$|E
5|$|Sedna has an {{exceptionally}} long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 11,400 {{years to complete}} and a distant point of closest approach to the Sun at 76AU. These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor Planet Center currently places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to informally {{refer to it as}} the first known member of the inner Oort cloud. Others speculate that it might have been tugged into its current orbit by a passing star, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> within the Sun's birth cluster (an open cluster), or even that it was captured from another star system. Another hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large planet beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} parish of Olney, Buckinghamshire in 1714 several dozen {{small towns and}} {{individual}} parishes established their own institutions without any specific legal authorization. These were concentrated in the South Midlands and in the county of Essex. From the late 1710s the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge began to promote the idea of parochial workhouses. The Society published several pamphlets on the subject, and supported Sir Edward Knatchbull in his successful efforts to steer the Workhouse Test Act through parliament in 1723. The act gave legislative authority {{for the establishment of}} parochial workhouses, by both single parishes and as joint ventures between two or more parishes. More importantly, the Act helped to publicise the idea of establishing workhouses to a national audience. By 1776 some 1,912 parish and corporation workhouses had been established in England and Wales, housing almost 100,000 paupers. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> million people were receiving some kind of parish poor relief {{by the end of the}} century. Although many parishes and pamphlet writers expected to earn money from the labour of the poor in workhouses, the vast majority of people obliged to take up residence in workhouses were ill, elderly, or children whose labour proved largely unprofitable. The demands, needs and expectations of the poor also ensured that workhouses came to take on the character of general social policy institutions, combining the functions of creche, and night shelter, geriatric ward and orphanage. In 1782, Thomas Gilbert finally succeeded in passing an Act that established poor houses solely for the aged and infirm and introduced a system of outdoor relief for the able-bodied. This was the basis for the development of the Speenhamland system, which made financial provision for low-paid workers. Settlement Laws were altered by the Removal Act 1795 which prevented non-settled persons from being moved on unless they had applied for relief.|$|E
