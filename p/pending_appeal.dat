25|$|Following {{affirmation}} by {{the state}} courts, two same-sex couples {{filed a lawsuit against}} the initiative in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in the case Perry v.

In August 2010, Chief Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional under both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, since it purported to re-remove rights from a disfavored class only, with no rational basis. The official proponents' justifications for the measure were analyzed in over fifty pages covering eighty findings of fact. The state government supported the ruling and refused to defend the law. The ruling was stayed <b>pending</b> <b>appeal</b> by the proponents of the initiative.
