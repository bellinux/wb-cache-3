2500|$|The rate of {{areal density}} {{advancement}} {{was similar to}} Moore's law (doubling every two years) through 2010: 60% per year during 1988–1996, 100% during 1996–2003 and 30% during 2003–2010. Gordon Moore (1997) called the increase [...] "flabbergasting," [...] while observing later that growth cannot continue forever. Price improvement decelerated to −12% per year during 2010–2017, as the growth of areal density slowed. The rate of advancement for areal density slowed to 10% per year during 2010–2016, and there was difficulty in migrating from <b>perpendicular</b> <b>recording</b> to newer technologies.|$|E
2500|$|In modern drives, {{the small}} size of the {{magnetic}} regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of thermal effects, thermally induced magnetic instability which is commonly known as the [...] "superparamagnetic limit". To counter this, the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, separated by a 3-atom layer of the non-magnetic element ruthenium, and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation, thus reinforcing each other. Another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is <b>perpendicular</b> <b>recording,</b> first shipped in 2005, and as of 2007 the technology was used in many HDDs.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Perpendicular</b> <b>recording</b> {{can deliver}} {{more than three}} times the storage density of {{traditional}} longitudinal recording. <b>Perpendicular</b> <b>recording</b> was first used by Toshiba in 3.5" [...] floppy disks in 1989 to permit 2.88 MB of capacity (ED or extra-high density), but they failed to succeed in the marketplace. Since about 2005 the technology has come into use for hard disk drives. Hard disk technology with longitudinal recording has an estimated limit of 100 to 200 gigabit per square inch due to the superparamagnetic effect, though this estimate is constantly changing. <b>Perpendicular</b> <b>recording</b> is predicted to allow information densities of up to around 1 Tbit/sq. inch (1000 Gbit/sq. inch).

We study the effect of coil current waveforms with different rise times and overshoots. For fast coil current rise times, the head field shows very little response, until the coil current changes its polarity and it {{is limited by the}} intrinsic magnetization dynamics. Even the effect of overshoot is limited by the same mechanism. Shorter yoke length and coil turns close to the air-bearing surface improve the head-field dynamics.

40|$|Write spacing {{losses in}} <b>perpendicular</b> {{magnetic}} <b>recording</b> {{have been investigated}} experimentally for a ring head and a single pole head. In ring head recording, an increase of write spacing causes the change of magnetization mode in the Co-Cr layer from perpendicular to longitudinal. In single pole head recording, the magnetization mode remains perpendicular, even for large write spacing. Furthermore, the reproduced voltage in saturation recording decreases with increased write spacing, since the magnetization transition length is broadened by the decreasing write head field gradient resulting from disappearance of head-to-medium magnetic coupling. Therefore, in <b>perpendicular</b> magnetic <b>recording,</b> a slight reduction of the head-to-medium spacing leads to a remarkable improvement in high density recording characteristics...|$|R

This feature is achieved by optical coherent configuration of the IFE in the central and peripheral regions of the focal spot with opposite signs. By increasing {{the intensity of the}} peripheral regions to produce destructive interference, the lateral size of the reversed Mz smaller than 30 nm in one dimension in the central region can be achieved.

The Ni-Zn spinel ferrite thin-films with a preferential orientation of (100) and a relatively low coercivity of 15 Oe were obtained at a high deposition rate of 14 nm/min and at a temperature below 200 degrees C. Although post-annealing treatment in air at 200 degrees C was effective to decrease the coercivity of the Ni-Zn ferrite thin-films, the saturation magnetization and initial permeability decreased and the surface smoothness was deteriorated simultaneously.
