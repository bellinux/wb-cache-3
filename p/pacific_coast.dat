5|$|Football on the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast.</b> Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds were {{established}} as an expansion {{team of the}} Double-A Southern League (SL) in 1978. They moved to the Triple-A American Association (AA) in 1985 and to the Triple-A <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> League (PCL) in 1998. The team won the Southern League Championship in 1979 as the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds and again in 1982 as the Double-A club of the New York Yankees. The Sounds won the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> League Championship in 2005 as the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pacific</b> <b>coasts</b> are {{constantly}} changing {{as a result}} of natural processes such as tides, strong currents, rain, storm surges, strong wind, cyclones and sea level rise. With increasing human activities within the coastal areas in terms of human settlement, land use changes, flow of solid and liquid waste and coastal developments such as beach ramps, jetties, causeways, coastal protection structures, reef mining and extractions of sand and beach aggregates, there is ever increasing change along <b>Pacific</b> <b>coasts.</b> In addition, climate change and climate variability and extreme weather events have exacerbated the rate of change of <b>Pacific</b> <b>coasts.</b> The coast has been defined as the zone where the land and sea meet. The main features of <b>Pacific</b> <b>coasts</b> are dominated by coral reefs, reef ridges, inter-tidal ridges, beaches, cliffs, wave actions and mangroves. <b>Pacific</b> <b>coasts</b> are designated important areas for providing vital Pacific livelihood. The coastal ecosystems, human sett lement and other major supporting services and basic infrastructure are centred on the coastal zone. Coasts are being used for many reasons. The underlying problem is that <b>Pacific</b> <b>coasts</b> {{are in a state of}} crisis. A number of human engineering interventions over the past decade have contributed and accelerated the coastal erosion problem in the Pacific Region. The Pacific coastline is over 50, 532 km long. Both natural processes and human engineering work are blamed for causing coastal erosion. This guide has been produced to inform and assist coastal experts, managers, and Pacific communities understand the various measures they can take to reduce coastal erosion...|$|R

5|$|Around 0300UTC on October4, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Carlos on the <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> of Baja California and for areas between Santa Rosalía to Loreto on the Gulf coast of the Peninsula. Roughly twelve hours later, the warning was superseded by another tropical storm warning. The new warning was issued for areas between Punta Abreojos and El Rosario on the <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> and for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Final on the Gulf coast. In mainland Mexico, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for coastal areas of Sonora between Cabo Lobos and Puerto Penasco. By 1830UTC, all of the watches and warnings were revised; on the <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> of Baja California, the warning was in effect for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Juanico; on the Gulf coast, the warning was in effect for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Conception; the watch for coastal areas of Sonora was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for areas between Guaymas and Cabo Lobos. Following Raymond's landfall in mainland Mexico, all warnings were discontinued by 1200UTC on October5.|$|E

5|$|Nashville {{reached the}} postseason during six of their seven {{seasons in the}} Southern League. They won three Western Division titles and two Southern League Championships. The Sounds' 13years with the American Association at the Triple-A level was a vast contrast.

Though they did not perform well during their first few years with the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> League, the team {{went on to win}} four division titles, two American Conference titles, and one <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> League Championship between 2003 and 2007.

5|$|Sculptures of the Potbelly style {{are found}} {{all along the}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> from {{southern}} Mexico to El Salvador, as well as further afield at sites in the Maya lowlands. Although some investigators have suggested that this style is pre-Olmec, archaeological excavations on the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast,</b> including those at Takalik Abaj, have shown that this style began to be used {{at the end of}} the Middle Preclassic and reached its height during the Late Preclassic. The potbelly sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Late Preclassic and are very similar to those at Monte Alto in Escuintla and Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Odile's existence, the National Weather Service of Mexico {{declared}} several {{tropical storm}} watches and warnings for the <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> of Mexico spanning from Jalisco to Oaxaca. They were extended and discontinued as Odile progressed westward. On October 11 at around 2 AM PDT, a hurricane watch was declared for the <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> of Mexico from Tecpán de Galeana to Punta San Telmo. Six hours later, the hurricane watch was adjusted and {{in effect for}} the coast from Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo.
