Some sources {{have a new}} total of 373 Centuries, but Cicero still writes of 193 centuries in his era, and most scholars still use that number It known that the first <b>property</b> <b>class</b> was reduced form 80 to 70 centuries, and the order of voting was changed so that the first class would go first, and be followed by the equites.|$|E
25|$|The clamp load, {{also called}} preload of a fastener, is created when a torque is applied, and so {{develops}} a tensile preload that is generally a substantial {{percentage of the}} fastener's proof strength. Fasteners are manufactured to various standards that define, among other things, their strength. Torque charts are available to specify the required torque for a given fastener based on its <b>property</b> <b>class</b> (fineness of manufacture and fit) and grade (tensile strength).|$|E
500|$|The Centuriate Assembly was {{supposedly}} {{founded by the}} legendary Roman King Servius Tullius, less than a century before {{the founding of the}} Roman Republic in 509 BC. As such, the original design of the Centuriate Assembly was known as the [...] "Servian organization". Under this organization, the assembly {{was supposedly}} designed to mirror the Roman army {{during the time of the}} Roman Kingdom. Soldiers in the Roman army were classified on the basis of the amount of property that they owned, and as such, soldiers with more property had more influence than soldiers with less property. The 193 Centuries in the assembly under the Servian Organization were each divided into one of three different grades: the officer class, the enlisted class, and a class of unarmed adjuncts. The officer class was grouped into eighteen Centuries. The enlisted class was grouped into five separate property classes, for a total of 170 Centuries. The unarmed soldiers were divided into the final five Centuries. Of five enlisted classes, the wealthiest controlled 80 of the votes. During a vote, all of the Centuries of one class had to vote before the Centuries of the next lower class could vote. The first candidate to reach a majority of 97 votes was victorious. [...] When a measure or candidate received 97 votes, a majority of the centuries, the voting ended, and as such, many lower ranking Centuries rarely if ever had a chance to actually vote. Combined the 18 equites and the 80 centuries of the first <b>property</b> <b>class</b> had one more century than needed, and a unanimous vote from the elite would thus elect a candidate.|$|E

2500|$|The table {{shows that}} the richest two {{property}} classes combined, the equites (knights, including the six centuriae probably reserved for patricians), together with the 1st <b>property</b> <b>class,</b> were allocated an absolute majority of the votes (98 of 193 centuriae), despite being {{a small minority of}} the population. Their precise proportion is unknown, but was most likely under 5% of the citizen-body. These classes supplied a legion's cavalry, just 6.6% of the unit's total effectives (300 of 4,500), which is probably greater than their proportionate share, as the lowest class was excluded from legionary service. Overall, votes were allocated in inverse proportion to population. Thus the lowest social echelon (the proletarii, under 400 drachmae), was allocated just 1 of the 193 centuriae, despite being probably the largest. As Livy himself puts it: [...] "Thus every citizen was given the illusion of wielding power through the right to vote, but in reality the aristocracy remained in full control. For the centuriae of knights were summoned first to vote, and then the centuriae of the First <b>Property</b> <b>Class.</b> In the rare event of a majority not being attained, the Second Class was called, but it was hardly ever necessary to consult the lowest classes." [...] Also in its legislative capacity, the popular assembly offered little scope for democratic action. For this purpose, the comitia could only meet when summoned by a Magistrate. Participants could only vote (by centuria) for or against propositions (rogationes) put before them by the convening Magistrate. No amendments or motions from the floor were admissible. In modern terms, the legislative activity of the comitia amounted to no more than a series of referenda, and in no sense resembled the role of a parliament.|$|E

At first he joined in only to correct Sid's version, but afterwards he took control. His manner changed. He sat up and rested his elbow on his knees, and his cheek flushed a little. He expanded his case against Property and the <b>property</b> <b>class</b> with such vigour that Kipps was completely carried away, and never thought of asking for a clear vision of the thing that would fill the void this abolition might create. For a time he quite forgot his own private opulence. And it was as if something had been lit in Masterman. His languor passed. He enforced his words by gestures of his long, thin hands. And as he passed swiftly from point to point of his argument it was evident he grew angry.|$|E

However, the amount of zeugite's income as transmitted by the tradition makes them owners of properties so vast that some scholars expressed doubts about the accuracy of these figures. A new analysis of the famous passage of Pollux (VIII, 129. 6 - 131. 1) taking advantage of a recent study on Greek metrology actually enables us to restore more plausible figures.

50|$|The numbers {{stamped on}} the head of the bolt are {{referred}} to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called <b>property</b> <b>class)</b> stamped {{on the head}}. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a <b>property</b> <b>class</b> 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.|$|E
