The observed K, value for indomethacin was 5 presence or absence of the lipophilic substituent on the central nng. As expected, anti-inflammatory pyrrazole derivatives, aspi-nM. Structural specificity of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug site was studied with arylacetic acids, anthranilic acids, and compounds from other chemical families. Arylacetic acid drugs rin, bucloxic acid, cortisol, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and the chemotactic peptide formyl-Met-Leu-Phe were not recognized by the indomethacin binding site.
