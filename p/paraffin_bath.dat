50|$|Occasionally, lotion is rubbed on {{the hand}} before {{submersion}} into the <b>paraffin</b> <b>bath.</b> The hand is usually dipped more than once to allow a thicker wax coat to form, making the coating stay warm longer {{and less likely to}} break or tear prematurely. After the hands have been dipped in the wax, they are wrapped in either plastic or aluminum foil, or a special type of plastic bag or glove, then covered with a towel or special mitten to retain warmth. The hands are left for a few minutes before the paraffin is cooled and dried.|$|E

40|$|SiO_ 2 {{nanoparticles}} of {{a quantum}} size (15 nm or less) were prepared via sol–gel method using tetraethylorthosilicate as a precursor. SiO_ 2 nanoparticles {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analyses. Polyethersulfone/silica (PES/SiO_ 2) crystal structure nanocomposite was prepared by in situ polymerization using silica nanoparticles as reinforcement filler. The polymerization reaction was done at 160 °C in <b>paraffin</b> <b>bath</b> {{in the presence of}} diphenolic monomers. XRD and FESEM analyses were used to study the morphology of the synthesized nanocomposite. The purity and thermal property of the PES/SiO_ 2 nanocomposite were studied by energy dispersion of X-ray analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. The effect of silica particles on the hydrophilicity of PES/SiO_ 2 nanocomposite was also investigated. It was showed that the PES/SiO_ 2 nanocomposite had a higher swelling degree when compared with the pure PES. The synthesized PES/SiO_ 2 powder was used to remove Cu(II) ions from its aqueous solution. The effect of experimental conditions such as pH, shaking time, and sorbent mass on adsorption capacity of PES/SiO_ 2 nanocomposite were investigated. It was found that incorporation of a low amount of silica (2 wt%) into the polymer matrix caused the increase of the Cu(II) ions adsorption capacity of PES. POLYM. COMPOS., 2012...|$|E

An experimental {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of range of motion (ROM) and muscle strengthening exercises for 6 weeks on grip strength and hand function in RA patients. Seventeen patients with chronic RA were randomly assigned to a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group (n= 8) was given muscle strengthening exercises and heat therapy using <b>paraffin</b> <b>baths</b> 3 times a week at the hospital and ROM exercises once a day at home for 6 weeks.

40|$|Caramel {{colors are}} brown powders or viscous liquids {{that are used}} to impart yellow to dark brown and have been used in carbonated beverages, {{distilled}} liquors, wines, pharmaceutical, extracts, bakery products, candy, soups, and baked beans for decades. This color additive can be prepared from various sources of carbohydrates such as glucose, corn, molasses, wheat, and tapioca hydrolysates by controlled heat treatment in the presence of certain reactants. The {{purpose of this study is}} to produce caramel color from different sources of carbohydrates as well as investigate the effect of pH on the development of the browning reactions. In this study, two set of experiments were conducted. The first is production of caramel color from glucose solution. Glucose sample of different pH are pre-heated in water bath at 100 °C and further heated at caramelization temperature of 121 °C in <b>paraffin</b> <b>bath.</b> The color development was monitored using U- 1800 Hitachi UV-Visible Spectrophotometer. The second experiment is production of caramel color using starch hydrolysates produced from acid hydrolysis of corn starch by microwave heating. In this particular experiment, the starch concentration was varied to study the effect of starch concentration. Different length of heating time for microwave assisted hydrolysis of starch was used. As a result, the color intensity was observed highest at pH 8, in lower concentration of starch, 0. 7 g/ml and 10 minutes of microwave heating. Hence, it is concluded that alkaline condition is a suitable reaction medium to produce caramel color while the required time for caramelization completion is 1. 5 hours...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{backbone}} of daily pathological diagnostic {{work is the}} paraffin section. Paraffin sections are still prepared by methods largely unchanged for over 150 years. A xylene-free method has been developed that excludes xylene, not only as the intermediate step before the <b>paraffin</b> <b>baths,</b> but also for deparaffinizing of the cut sections, which also {{eliminates the need for}} rehydration and dehydration for the staining and mounting steps. Elimination of xylene from tissue processing cuts costs, saves time, and improves the laboratory environment. Experience with xylene-free sections since 1995 at the Vrinnevi Hospital is favorable. Our opinion is that the xylene-free sections are equivalent to conventionally processed sections. To test this hypothesis, nine pathologists from three hospitals participated in an evaluation trial. Paired tissue blocks from 10 consecutively submitted samples each of breast, intestine, and skin were processed by either the xylene-free or the conventional method. Sections from each block were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and with van Gieson’s method. A randomized mix of 180 sections (10 samples 3 tissues 3 stains 2) gave 90 matched pairs. Each section was blindly examined and scored by nine pathologists to give 810 paired observations for statistical evaluation. The xylene-free sections were ranked as good as or better than their conventional counterparts in 74 % of the comparisons, and poorer in 26 %. The major discriminating factor was the staining method. H&E and PAS sections were equivalent. The xylene-free van Gieson sections, cut from the same blocks and randomly assigned to this stain, tended to be downgraded. This could be traced to a faulty stain solution used for this batch. The overall results have demonstrated professional acceptance for th...|$|R

40|$|A {{horizontal}} finger arthrograph {{has been}} developed to measure stiffness in the human metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger. Data from the arthrograph {{has been shown to}} have reasonable reproducibility. Stiffness is quantified in terms of dissipated energy, equilibrium position and absolute resistive torque measured from the equilibrium position. Three groups of experiments are reported. The first investigates the circadian variation of stiffness in normal subjects. The second investigates stiffness in normal subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis and the third looks at the effects of various techniques of physiotherapy in altering stiffness. The results show a circadian variation of stiffness with increased stiffness {{in the early hours of}} the morning. Male subjects exhibit higher dissipated energy than female subjects though no statistically significant differences could be found in other stiffness parameters. Within the range of values tested no statistically significant differences could be found between controls and patients in dissipated energy, resistive torque or equilibrium position. Correlation of these characteristics with other parameters, for example, grip strength and limb circumference has identified differences between controls and patients, and it is concluded that, in rheumatoid arthritis, stiffness mainly results from the involvement of immediate soft tissue periarticular structures. The effects of physiotherapeutic techniques, usually administered to alleviate stiffness, are shown to be variable. Short wave diathermy and ultrasound effected a reduction in dissipated energy in the patient group and it is concluded that a reduction in the viscous and frictional properties of periarticular structures produces this effect. A shift in the equilibrium position is also shown to occur in this group following the application of short wave diathermy. <b>Paraffin</b> wax <b>baths,</b> ice and exercises had no effect on stiffness in the patient group and no treatment technique produced significant effects in the control group...|$|R

CuO (50 nm) nanoparticle was dispersed at 0. 2, 0. 25, 2 and 3 % in liquid <b>paraffin</b> using ultrasonic <b>bath</b> during 1 hour and 10 minutes for particle modification with Oleic Acid. Wear characteristics were evaluated using four-ball machine for {{the testing conditions}} of load 40 kg at 1200 rpm rotation and 15 min test duration at temperature of 60 - 70 °C. The wear scar diameter (WSD) was measured by means of optical microscope. The morphologies of the worn surface have revealed that concentrations of nanoparticle were improved the friction and wear properties of liquid paraffin. The lowest friction coefficient (COF) was 0. 185 obtained for a nanoparticle content of 0. 2 % CuO and the highest was for a 3 % CuO concentration at 0. 247 for liquid Paraffin + CuO without modification suspensions. In contrast after modification, the lowest friction coefficient was obtained at 3 % CuO modified at 0. 123 and the highest at 0. 2 % of CuO modified at 0. 158 for liquid paraffin + modified CuO suspensions. Both type of nanoparticle suspensions at various concentration have exhibited clearly different friction coefficients. The {{results indicated that the}} higher concentrate of CuO, the better the tribological properties.
