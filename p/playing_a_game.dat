5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They {{can be played}} alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E

5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E
5|$|From 1976 to 1980, {{he was one}} of {{the premier}} {{pitchers}} in the majors, leading the National League twice in strikeouts, once in earned run average, and three times in hits allowed per nine innings, winning at least 18games between 1976 and 1979. On July 30, 1980, Richard suffered a stroke and collapsed while <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of catch before an Astros game, and was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery to remove a life-threatening blood clot in his neck. His condition brought a sudden end to his major league career at the age of 30. His 313strikeouts in 1979 remains an Astros franchise record, and he held the team's record for career strikeouts (1,493) until 1987. Two-time National League MVPs Johnny Bench and Dale Murphy both named Richard as the toughest pitcher they ever faced.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{originally}} planned to bring Taylor {{up through the}} minor leagues rapidly, like the Mets did with Dwight Gooden. However, they found he needed a better move to first base to hold base runners, and chose not to expedite his major league debut. Before even <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> <b>game,</b> he was named the game's top prospect by Baseball America before the 1992 season. He began his professional career with the Fort Lauderdale Yankees, the Yankees' Class-A Advanced minor league affiliate. His performances with Fort Lauderdale included throwing nine strikeouts against the Osceola Astros in an 85 victory, {{as well as a}} 12-strikeout, two-hit performance in September against the West Palm Beach Expos. For the season, Taylor had a 68 win-loss record, a 2.57 ERA, and 187 strikeouts in 161.1 innings pitched.|$|E
