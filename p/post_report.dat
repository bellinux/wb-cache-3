The report was “sharply critical” of BART, finding that the ATC system was unreliable, the ATC program was mismanaged, and “no solution was in sight.” The report accused BART of paying excessive fees for engineering services. BART’s general manager called the indictment of safety in the <b>Post</b> <b>Report</b> “not only disappointing, but deplorable as well.” At the same time, management deemed that the ATC “could not now be trusted to detect one train stalled on the tracks in the path of another going at full speed,” so automatic controls were dropped. Telephone calls were placed manually between stations, instead.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Wenzlau's {{presidency}} (1968–1984) {{began with}} the challenge of campus unrest: Ohio Wesleyan students took over the ROTC building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970.

Bob Dylan, 22 at that time, was one of the celebrities at the march and on the journey home to New York City he read about the conviction of Zantzinger and decided to write a protest song about the case. According to a 1991 Washington <b>Post</b> <b>report,</b> Dylan wrote the song in Manhattan, sitting in an all-night cafe. A recent radio documentary on the song said rather that he wrote it both in New York and at the home of his then-lover, Joan Baez, in Carmel. According to Nancy Carlin, a friend of Baez who visited, [...] "He would stand in this cubbyhole, beautiful view across the hills, and peck type on an old typewriter... there was an old piano up at Joan's... and peck piano playing... up until noon he would drink black coffee then switch over to red wine, quit about five or six." [...] He recorded it on October 23, 1963, when the trial was still relatively fresh news, and incorporated it into his live repertoire immediately, before releasing the studio version on January 13, 1964.|$|E
