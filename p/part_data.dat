40|$|Several media {{access control}} (MAC) {{protocols}} proposed for wireless sensor networks assume nodes to be stationary. This can lead to poor network performance, as well as fast depletion of energy in systems where nodes are mobile. This paper presents several results for TDMA-based MAC protocol for mobile sensor networks, and also introduces a novel mobility-aware TDMA-based MAC protocol for mobile sensor networks. The protocol works by first splitting a given round into a control <b>part,</b> and a <b>data</b> <b>part.</b> The control part is used to manage mobility, whereas nodes transmit messages in the <b>data</b> <b>part.</b> In the <b>data</b> <b>part,</b> some slots are reserved for mobile nodes.

This information {{is found in}} supplier specific documentation (i.e. maximum allowed diameter of a fine boring tool). Before the new acquisition can be used, the data must be integrated in the company-specific task format. (i.e. The exact setup values for a required fine boring tool). Furthermore, this information must {{be made available to}} all participating work areas. (i.e. the exact adjusted diameter must be made known to the NC programming and tool store departments). Processed company information is then made available as <b>part</b> <b>data</b> instructions (i.e. appropriate cutting values for a particular tools usage with a specified material) and must be managed and integrated within workflows to prevent production capacity loss or shortening tool life.|$|E

5000|$|The FAA Order {{covering}} the application for PMA is Order 8110.42 revision D. This document is worded as {{instructions to the}} FAA reviewing personnel. An accompanying Advisory Circular (AC) 21.303-4 is intended to address the applicant. 8110.42C addressed both the applicant and the reviewer. Per the order, application for a PMA can be made per the following ways: Identicality in which the applicant attempts to convince the FAA that the PMA part {{is identical to the}} OAH (Original Approval Holder) part. Identicality by Licensure is accomplished by providing evidence to the FAA that the applicant has licensed the <b>part</b> <b>data</b> from the OAH. This evidence is usually {{in the form of an}} Assist Letter provided to the applicant by the OAH. PMA may also be granted based upon prior approval of an STC [...] As an example: If an STC were granted to alter an existing aircraft design then that approval would also apply to the parts needed to make that modification. A PMA would be required, however, to manufacture the parts. The last method to obtain a PMA is Test & Computation. This approach consist of one or a combination of both of the following methods: General Analysis and Comparative Analysis. General analysis compares the proposed part to the functional requirements of that part when installed. Comparative Analysis compares the function of the proposed part to the OAH part. As an example: If a PMA application for flight control cables were to show that the PMA part exceeds the pull strength requirements of the aircraft system it is meant for, that is general analysis. To show that it exceeds that of the OAH part is comparative analysis. The modern trend is to use a variety of techniques in combination in order to obtain approval of complicated parts - relying on the techniques that are most accurate and best able to provide the proof of airworthiness desired. [...] The cognizant regional FAA Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) determines if the applicant has shown compliance with all relevant airworthiness regulations and is thus entitled to design approval.|$|E
