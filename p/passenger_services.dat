5|$|Coal is now {{delivered}} to the station mainly using rail transport and is unloaded at the station using a merry-go-round system. Trains supplying the station use the Newbiggin and Lynemouth branch line of the Blyth and Tyne Railway, which also serves the smelter. This line was originally used to export coal from the local coalfield, and also had <b>passenger</b> <b>services.</b> These <b>passenger</b> <b>services</b> ceased in 1964, and now the line is only used to serve the power station and smelter. Coal from the local opencast mines is brought to the station by road using heavy goods vehicles. Coal is graded and washed at the station prior to being burned.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{numbers at}} Holland Arms station had fallen {{since the end}} of <b>passenger</b> <b>services</b> on the Red Wharf Bay branch. The branch was closed to all traffic in 1950, and Holland Arms closed on 4 August 1952.|$|E
5|$|<b>Passenger</b> <b>services</b> at {{the station}} {{declined}} following the Second World War, and the Beeching Report recommended the complete closure of the Portishead line. <b>Passenger</b> <b>services</b> at Clifton Bridge ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services following on 5 July 1965, although the line saw occasional traffic until 1981. Most of the station was demolished, leaving some remains of the platforms, a retaining wall and the footbridge. Regular freight trains through the station began to run again in 2002 when Royal Portbury Dock {{was connected to the}} rail network. The line is due to be reopened to passenger traffic in 2019 as part of MetroWest, but there are no plans to reopen the station.|$|E

5|$|After {{a public}} meeting in Amlwch to gauge local support, Isle of Anglesey Railways Ltd (IoAR) was {{established}} in 1991 {{with the aim of}} restoring <b>passenger</b> <b>services</b> to the line. Special trains ran from Bangor to a temporary station at Amlwch on the Spring and August bank holidays of 1992, and the 125th anniversary of the line's opening (a total of eight return trips). Pathfinder Tours subsequently ran an excursion from York to Llandudno and Amlwch in October 1993. The project's viability was discussed with the Welsh Development Agency and Anglesey District Council, followed by negotiations in July 1993 with Railfreight Distribution to purchase the line. Octel offered a portion of its private railway for the building of a new station at Amlwch. IoAR initially hoped to start <b>passenger</b> <b>services</b> between Amlwch and Llangefni as early as 1994.|$|E
5|$|Although the old Cleveland Railway had not {{provided}} any <b>passenger</b> <b>services,</b> during the 1870s the NER built {{a number of}} stations at {{the eastern end of}} the line. <b>Passenger</b> <b>services</b> began from Brotton, Skinningrove and Loftus in 1875, plus Boosbeck in 1878. The tortuous history of the Cleveland Railway had a lasting effect on the provision of rail services to Guisborough. It did not at any time offer a passenger service to the town, leaving that instead to the M, which provided only a single-platform station {{at the end of its}} line into the town. This line was bypassed by the Cleveland Railway en route to Skinningrove. After the westbound Cleveland Railway was closed, the eastbound line was joined with the M line, leaving Guisborough railway station at the end of a spur. Trains thus had to reverse out of the station before continuing along the line to Loftus. It remained this way until the line was closed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Cathay dragon (Formerly Dragonair) {{operated}} {{its first}} commercial flight from Hong Kong to Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia in July 1985 with a Boeing 737-200 aircraft, after receiving its air operator's certificate. In 1986, the airline introduced regular <b>passenger</b> <b>services</b> to Guilin, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Xiamen in the People's Republic of China, and to Phuket, Thailand. In the following years, the airline's operations expanded to more {{cities in the}} People's Republic of China and to other countries across Asia, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Japan, Nepal, Philippines, the Republic of China (Taiwan), South Korea and Vietnam. Initially, Dragonair operated its <b>passenger</b> <b>services</b> only as regular charter flights; these were passenger flights that were operated by the airline on a programme basis similar to scheduled flights, but {{were not part of}} the air services agreement between their respective countries. The airline was granted scheduled services rights in 1990.|$|E

A railfan website notes Class 24, Class 40, and Class 47 as having been used for the freight services, as well as the 1983 special <b>passenger</b> <b>services.</b> The 1992 specials used Class 101 DMU units, and the 1993 special used Class 20 and Class 37 engines.|$|E
5|$|Fare evasion in 2006 was {{estimated}} at 2–6% of all users, and in 2012 at 2.5% of all users.

5|$|Goods-only trains were a rarity, and {{the usual}} {{practice}} was to attach goods wagons to any scheduled <b>passenger</b> <b>services.</b> Whilst the shunting of wagons at intermediate stations no doubt added to {{the interest of the}} tourist and occasional traveller, it also added marginally to the journey time.|$|E

5|$|Historically, <b>passenger</b> <b>services</b> were {{provided}} to the Sydney Central by steam locomotives. The first services to Hurstville were run by steam locomotives of the Q.158 and R.285 classes. When the City Underground opened to St James in 1926, a new electric service was provided to run there. From {{the time when the}} line to the Royal National Park was electrified, passengers received a steam train service at first, then when this became expensive, it was replaced by a rail motor service. This arrangement continued until the line was electrified to Waterfall, and the Eastern Suburbs Line was opened. In 1979 the Eastern Suburbs Line being the first line to only use S set double-decker rolling stock. The current running operations for <b>passenger</b> <b>services</b> have remained generally unchanged since 1981 with the integration of the Illawarra line and the Eastern Suburbs Railway. Suburban services utilise Erskineville Junction and proceed to Central and Bondi Junction.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, about 5,500 {{people worked}} at Fornebu. Of these, 3,600 {{worked for the}} airlines, {{including}} ground services. The airport administration had 350 employees, including administration, air control, fire fighters, meteorology and maintenance. The remaining 500 people worked for other public offices, including the police and customs, as well as service employees working for private companies involved with <b>passenger</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
5|$|Motor buses {{appeared}} in the district from 1924, and passenger numbers dropped. Cheap fares and a steam railcar did not halt the decline, although {{in the last days}} of operation, five trains were run on Saturdays, three on Wednesdays and two on other weekdays. The last trains ran on 15 July 1933, with all <b>passenger</b> <b>services</b> suspended from Monday 17 July. In addition to timetabled services, excursions were run, with Epworth, the birthplace of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism being popular. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway published a booklet entitled Epworth: What to see and how to get there to entice people to travel there from Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Excursions from the Isle of Axholme to Blackpool were popular, with over 600 passengers on such a trip in 1913, and 750 visiting the Great Yorkshire Show at Hull in 1922. Excursions to Blackpool continued to be run even after timetabled <b>passenger</b> <b>services</b> were withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{the only}} {{passenger}} station was Lyngbyvej (now Ryparken), Nørrebro (500 m NW of its old position) and Godthåbsvej (now Grøndal). Here the modest <b>passenger</b> <b>service</b> between Frederiksberg and Hellerup called; the trains went directly from Frederiksberg to Godthåbsvej through the connecting curve at Flintholm. Flintholm itself had no <b>passenger</b> <b>service</b> until much later, {{and there was}} no <b>passenger</b> <b>service</b> south of Flintholm.|$|R
