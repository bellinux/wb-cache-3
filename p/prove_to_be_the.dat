5|$|In October 2012, Achebe's publishers, Penguin Books, {{released}} There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra. Publication immediately {{caused a}} stir and re-opened the discussion about the Nigerian Civil War. It would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last publication during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon I {{embarked}} on an invasion of Russia in 1812. This war would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> turning point in his fortunes, as the expedition failed miserably and Napoleon was forced to retreat with an army in tatters.|$|E

5|$|As the Union army retreated towards Washington, it {{paused to}} re-group at Centreville, Virginia. On August 31, 1862, Gen. Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Jackson to flank the Union right and {{to cut the}} Union army off from Washington. This {{flanking}} effort resulted in the Battle of Chantilly which would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most disastrous engagement of the entire war for the 21st Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|King Ottokar's Sceptre {{was first}} serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from 4 August 1938 to 10 August 1939 {{under the title}} Tintin En Syldavie ("Tintin in Syldavia"). It would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last Tintin {{adventure}} {{to be published in}} its entirety in Le Petit Vingtième. From 14 May 1939, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, Cœurs Vaillants.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Hamilton's lead in the Drivers' Championship was cut down to 41 points, with Rosberg still in second place. Sebastian Vettel moved closer as well, now being 49 points behind Hamilton. Felipe Massa's {{retirement}} saw him drop from fourth to sixth in the standings, being overtaken by both Räikkönen and Bottas. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari closed the gap to leaders Mercedes, now trailing 310 to 463 points. This race would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only one that Lewis Hamilton did not finish in the season.|$|E

5|$|By November 1998, UBS's {{losses from}} its {{exposure}} to LTCM were estimated {{at the level}} of approximately CHF 790million. UBS would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF 950million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to the bailout effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E
5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, the issuing of NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) did not <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} as envisioned by Hawker, as NBMR-3 sought performance characteristics {{of which the}} P.1127 was not only unable to meet, but unlikely to be developed to meet {{in its current form}} either. As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, Hawker believed that the continuing development of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, acting to dissuade potential customers from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.|$|E
5|$|Former All Black Jamie Joseph {{was hired}} as coach for the 2011 Super Rugby season, while Jamie Mackintosh {{replaced}} Cowan as team captain. The campaign would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> franchise's most successful in several years, as they raced out to a 3–0 start including a monumental away win over the Bulls in Pretoria. They remained in playoff contention for almost the entire season, sitting 8–4 at one juncture, before slumping under an injury cloud {{at the end of}} the year to finish 8th on the table.|$|E

5|$|He began 2001–02 on the left-side {{of central}} defence despite Smith {{reverting}} to a 4–4–2 formation. Smith was sacked after a poor start, but his replacement Colin Todd failed {{to improve the}} club's form, and Todd was sacked and replaced with John Gregory, with similarly poor results. Higginbotham scored his first goal in English football on 16 March 2002, converting a penalty to secure a 3–1 victory over Bolton Wanderers after striker Fabrizio Ravanelli backed out of taking the penalty. This would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last win of a relegation campaign, with the only remaining positive to the season for Higginbotham coming when he was voted as the fans' Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1961, {{the stadium}} {{was used for}} Motorcycle {{speedway}} when it {{was chosen as the}} host for the Speedway World Championship Final. The event, {{the first of its kind}} not to be staged at Wembley Stadium in England, was won by Swedish rider and defending champion Ove Fundin who won the third of his five Individual World Championships. It would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only World Final staged at Malmö Stadion. From 1964, World Final's held in Sweden were run at the Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg.|$|E
5|$|Several local meteorologists, however, did {{depart from}} the {{official}} predictions of a Tampa Bay landfall {{as early as the}} morning of August 13. Jim Farrell of WINK, Robert Van Winkle WBBH, Steve Jerve of WFLA in Tampa, Jim Reif of WZVN in Fort Myers, and Tom Terry of WFTV in Orlando, all broke with their national news forecasts and stated at around 1500 UTC that Charley was going to turn early, striking around Charlotte Harbor and traveling over Orlando, as would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|E

5|$|The Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, was {{instructed}} to prepare designs for pattern coins. Initially, Longacre worked with Liberty head designs such as were common at the time, but Snowden asked that a flying eagle design be prepared. This occurred as Booth's experiments continued; the first cent patterns with the flying eagle design were {{about the size of}} a quarter. To promote the new alloy, the Mint had 50 half cents struck in it, and had them sent to Washington for Treasury officials to show to officials and congressmen. In early November 1856, Longacre prepared dies in what would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> final design, depicting a flying eagle on the obverse and a wreathed denomination on the reverse, in the size sought by Booth.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{compared}} with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine, whose Rights of Man (1791) would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most popular {{of the responses}} to Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in Rights of Men in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her most famous and influential work. Wollstonecraft's fame extended across the English channel, for when the French statesmen Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be given the same right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{was the son}} of al-Muwaffaq, who was the regent {{and virtual}} ruler of the Abbasid state during the reign of his brother, Caliph al-Mu'tamid. As a prince, the future al-Mu'tadid served under his father in various {{military}} campaigns, most notably in the suppression of the Zanj Rebellion, in which he played a major role. When al-Muwaffaq died in June 891 al-Mu'tadid succeeded him as regent. He quickly sidelined his cousin and heir-apparent al-Mufawwad, and when al-Mu'tamid died in October 892, he succeeded to the throne. Like his father, al-Mu'tadid's power depended on his close relations with the army, first forged in the campaigns against the Zanj and reinforced in later expeditions which the Caliph led in person: al-Mu'tadid would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most militarily active of all Abbasid caliphs. Through his energy and ability, he succeeded in restoring to the Abbasid state some of the power and provinces it had lost during the turmoils of the previous decades.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{purchasing}} specimens, many geologists {{visited her}} to collect fossils or discuss anatomy and classification. Henry De la Beche and Anning became friends as teenagers following his move to Lyme, and he, Mary, and sometimes Mary's brother Joseph, went fossil-hunting together. De la Beche and Anning {{kept in touch}} as {{he became one of}} Britain's leading geologists. William Buckland, who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford, often visited Lyme on his Christmas vacations and was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning. It was to him she made what would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> scientifically important suggestion that the strange conical objects known as bezoar stones, were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs. Buckland would name the objects coprolites. In 1839 Buckland, Conybeare, and Richard Owen visited Lyme together so that Anning could lead them all on a fossil-collecting excursion.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Grant {{began the}} second Typhonian Trilogy with Nightside of Eden, {{in which he}} {{discussed}} {{some of his own}} personal magical ideas, outlining magical formulae with which to explore a dark, dense realm that he variously called 'Universe B' and 'the Tunnels of Set', conceived as a 'dark side' of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Grant made connections between this realm and the extramundane deities of H.P. Lovecraft's horror fiction. The book proved controversial among occultists and Thelemites, and starkly divided opinion. The sequel appeared in 1980 as Outside the Circles of Time, and introduced Grant's thoughts on the relevance of Ufology and insectoid symbolism for occultism. This would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> final Grant volume published by Muller, who would merge with Blond and Briggs in 1984, while the publishing rights to his works reverted to him the following year. His next book would not appear for another eleven years after Outside the Circles of Time.|$|E

In 2001, Pescarolo Sport began using a 3.2-litre twin-turbocharged Sodemo-Peugeot A32 V6 engined version of the car, and the Peugeot-engined versions would <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most successful. In 2004, Pescarolo redeveloped the C60 on their own, and replaced the Peugeot engines with 5-litre Judd GV5 V10s. In 2005, Courage ran two updated versions of the C60 (known as the C60 Hybrid, and using the Judd GV4 engines) as a factory effort, and one of these took third place at that year's 24 Hours of Le Mans; Pescarolo also updated their C60s into a similar Hybrid format, and took second at the 2005 and 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans, whilst also winning the Le Mans Series in both years.|$|E
