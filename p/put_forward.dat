Davis, Gallagher, Norris and Scallon (all running as Independents), secured their nominations via local authorities. Higgins was <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> by Labour, McGuinness was <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> by Sinn Féin and Mitchell was <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> by Fine Gael. The previously dominant Fianna Fáil party declined to <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> an official candidate following their disastrous general election campaign earlier that year. Norris, {{a civil rights}} campaigner credited with helping overthrow Ireland's laws criminalising homosexuality, was the leading candidate {{for much of the}} race, and had more than double the support of the other declared candidates in January 2011. He withdrew in August 2011 but returned to the race the following month due to his continuing widespread popular appeal.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{have also been}} <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> to explain the derivation of Bunbury, and Bunburying, which {{are used in the}} play to imply a secretive double life. It may have derived from Henry Shirley Bunbury, a hypochondriacal acquaintance of Wilde's youth.

5|$|Between 1822 and 1848 Bute {{played a}} central role in the {{creation}} of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> to Bute by one of his staff in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could be transformed into a major port for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, was small and inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and pushed forward with his own scheme shortly afterward.|$|E
