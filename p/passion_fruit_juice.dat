This study was quasi non randomized experimental design with pre-test post-test with control group. Sampel was selected using purposive sampling counted 40 people who were divided into 2 groups. The treatment group was given 250 ml / day yellow <b>passion</b> <b>fruit</b> peel <b>juice</b> and education for 15 days while the control group was given education. Levels of HDL and LDL were measured before and after the intervention.

40|$|The Flash Profile is a {{descriptive}} analysis method derived from Free-Choice Profile, {{in which each}} taster chooses and uses his/her own words to evaluate the product while comparing several attributes. Four <b>passion</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> were analyzed, two juices were produced with concentrated juice, one with pulp and one with reconstituted juice; all juices had different levels of sugar, some had gum and dyes. This study aimed to evaluate the physicochemical properties (color, titratable acidity and solid content) as well as sensory analysis like Flash profile and affective test. In physicochemical characterization and in Flash Profile, the juice A (pulp) had higher solid content and consistence, the juice B (concentrated juice) was the least acidic and presented the lowest value of soluble solids and presented strong aroma and flavor of passion-fruit, the juice C (reconstituted juice) was pale yellow and showed artificial flavor and the juice D (concentrated juice) was the most acidic, consistent with the natural flavor.

40|$|Summary Polygalacturonases are enzymes {{with the}} biotechnological {{potential}} {{for use in}} <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> clarification and for the enhancement of filtration efficiency. The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} production of polygalacturonase by the fungus Neosartorya glabra by means of solid-state and submerged fermentation using fruit peel residues as the carbon source, and also apply the enzyme in the clarification and decrease in viscosity of <b>passion</b> <b>fruit</b> and apple <b>juices.</b> The highest polygalacturonase (4. 52 U/g/h) production was obtained by means of submerged fermentation in Vogel´s medium (1964) containing orange peel – Bahia variety (Citrus sinensis), at a concentration of 1. 5 % (w/v, dried mass) at 30 - 35 °C for 72 h. The polygalacturonase of the crude extract presented optimal activity at 60 °C and pH 5. 5. The enzyme retained around 90 % of the initial activity after 180 minutes at 40 °C, and 50 % of the initial activity after 150 minutes at 50 °C. The enzyme was shown to be stable at acid pH values (3. 0 - 6. 5) after 120 minutes at 25 oC. All these favourable enzymatic properties make the polygalacturonase attractive for potential uses in the industry of pectin-rich <b>fruit</b> <b>juices,</b> since the application of the crude extract to <b>passion</b> <b>fruit</b> (Passiflora edulis) <b>juice</b> caused an 80 % reduction in viscosity and 75 % decrease in light absorbance.

The results indicated that temperature and humidity significantly affect dissolution rate of the <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> effervescent tablet. The reason for the decrease in dissolution rate was because at high storage temperature (35 oC), sodium bicarbonate was not stable.
