The first cage mill was shipped April 22, 1886; and the first cage mill to be shipped overseas was in December, 1890, to Kennedy Brick Machinery Manufacturing in Liverpool, England. Patents were granted to Nathan P. Stedman son of Nathan R. Stedman on April 10, 1894, for the disintegrator, as the patent named the machines. We know these machines today as Cage Mills. The machines soon became known for their performance under the most severe crushing conditions. Stedman’s first <b>pan</b> <b>mixer</b> was shipped to a customer in Chillicothe, Ohio, in 1897; and the Stedman family continued to {{search for new markets}} for their products. Another monument to the company was furnishing of the castings for the Vine and Sycamore Street cable lines in Denver and New York City.|$|E

Before the addition of water and the admixture solution, the admixture in the mixing water was thoroughly dispersed. Coarse aggregate and fine aggregate were then added, giving the mixture a few turns. Cement was subsequently added and the mixer was started for about 90  s. Finally water was added while the mixer was running and the concrete was mixed for another 120  s.|$|E

30|$|All the {{materials}} were mixed using a <b>pan</b> <b>mixer</b> {{with a maximum}} capacity of 80  l. The materials were fed into the mixer {{in the order of}} coarse aggregate, cement, MK and sand. The materials were mixed dry for 1.5  min. Subsequently three-quarters of the water was added, followed by the SP and the remaining water while mixing continued for a further 5  min in order to obtain a homogenous mixture. Upon discharging from the mixer, the slump test was conducted on the fresh properties for each mixture. The fresh concrete was placed into the steel cube moulds and compacted on a vibrating table. Finally, surface finishing was done carefully to obtain a uniform smooth surface.|$|E
30|$|The {{different}} {{parameters of}} the concrete composites, the length and volume fraction of the jute yarn content were used. The different lengths of yarn 10, 15, 20 and 25  mm and the contents 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75  % were used. Three different specimens; cubes (150  mm × 150  mm × 150  mm), prisms (450  mm × 150  mm × 150  mm) and cylinders (150  mm × 300  mm) were cast to determine the compressive, flexural and tensile strength of the composites, respectively. The yarns were cut to the mentioned length manually by a hand scissor. The mixing of the ingredients were done by a <b>pan</b> <b>mixer</b> accordingly jute yarns were added slowly and evenly to the concrete mix, so that, a uniform distribution of yarns throughout of the concrete could be confirmed. Cement was added into the mixer and mixing was conducted followed {{by the addition of}} water, until uniformity was achieved. This way of concrete mixing was continued for about 3  min. Then the freshly mixed concrete was poured in the moulds of cube, prism and cylinder. After that the specimens were left 24  h for de-moulding. They were then cured in water for at least 28  days. At the end of curing period the specimens were allowed to be dried in air for 24  h before testing.|$|E
40|$|Poor and {{inconsistent}} flow of cohesive powders {{is a major}} issue in powder processing. A common solution is to coat the surfaces of the cohesive particles with finer particles, referred to as flow-aids. Such particles adhere to sticky surfaces and act as spacers preventing them from contacting each other and thus reducing the inter-particle forces and bulk powder cohesion. A question which naturally arises is how much flow-aid is needed to enhance the flowability to an optimum level. This work aims to establish a relationship between the degree of Surface Area Coverage (SAC) of flow-aids and the flowability, the latter as determined by a quasi-static shear cell method, as well as the angle of repose test and the FT 4 powder rheometer. Glass beads of 90 - 150 μm sieve cut are made cohesive by silanising their surfaces with a commercial chemical reagent, Sigmacote® and are used as host particles. Two types of zeolite particles are used as flow aids. The mass fraction of the flow aids required to achieve a theoretical SAC of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 % is first estimated and then the host particles are coated in a <b>pan</b> <b>mixer.</b> The SAC is measured by Scanning Electron Microscopy, coupled with image analysis, and found to correlate well with the estimated value. The optimum surface coverage is found to be when SAC is 10 - 20 %, as this provides the greatest flowability. An increase in SAC beyond this range leads to a gradual reduction in flowability...|$|E

5000|$|Neill, Auerbach, and Carney {{arrived at}} Muscle Shoals Sound on August 16, 2009—coincidentally 40 {{years to the}} day singer-songwriter R. B. Greaves cut [...] "Take a Letter Maria" [...] at the studio, the first hit record to {{originate}} from the building. The group hauled a truckload of Auerbach's equipment from Easy Eye Sound System in Akron, as well as Neill's personal gear from California. Neill's equipment included portions of a Universal Audio 610 console (the same desk featured during the early days of Muscle Shoals) and a late 1950s Pultec <b>panning</b> <b>mixer,</b> as well as a 10:2 Studer monitoring mixer originally designed for classical music recording. The studio was very much a museum when they arrived—they found vintage recording gear that no longer operated, along with photos on the walls of legendary performers, such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, who had once recorded there. Auerbach immediately took down the photos, feeling they were distracting decorations. The band put a piece of Plexiglas on top of the studio's non-functional console to hold their own digital recording equipment. The group experienced technical difficulties while recording. However, they were not caused by the studio, but rather by utility work on nearby telephone poles. Some of Neill's equipment was wrecked, including burned-out microphones. Compositions were kept very simple due to technical limitations. Neill said, [...] "Thanks to the Studer mixer, we seldom went beyond 10 tracks." [...] He occasionally had to resort to digital sources; as the studio's downstairs echo chambers were long gone, Neill attached a mono digital reverberator to the Studer console. He also provided additional guitar and percussion parts during the sessions.|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 28 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 6 - 9 July 2009 "Sustainable Transport", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Ultra Thin Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement (UTCRCP) is a new rehabilitation technique for roads which was originally imported from overseas and redesigned for South Africa conditions. Initial development involved accelerated pavement testing (APT) with the Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) on experimental sections at the Heidelberg Traffic Control Centre. The success of these short experimental sections shifted the emphasis to constructability issues and associated design issues on a larger scale. A test section of 50 mm thick UTCRCP was constructed in 2008 at the Heidelberg Traffic Control Centre (screener lanes for heavy vehicles). The main challenges of construction of the UTCRCP were examined, {{with the objective of}} achieving a methodology for the roll out on full scale projects. The construction aspects examined included the mixing technique of the concrete components, the position of the reinforcing mesh within the overall 50 mm thickness of concrete layer, the compaction and vibration techniques of the fresh concrete, and the use of a <b>pan</b> <b>mixer.</b> Indicators such as slump values during construction and the normal mix design criteria such as water cement ratio were recorded, as well as flexural strength and compressive strength of this ultra strong concrete, were monitored. Additional test results such as the new composite centrally loaded round panel deflection test were also recorded. Initial conclusions and recommendations regarding constructability are made to help further technology development of the UTCRCP.

5000|$|The {{heart of}} the {{concrete}} batching plant is the mixer, {{and there are many}} types of mixers such as Tilt Drum, Pan, Planetary, Single Shaft and Twin shaft mixer. The twin shaft mixer can ensure an even mixture of concrete through the use of high horsepower motors, while the tilt mixer offers a consistent mix with much less maintenance labor and cost. [...] In North America, the predominant central mixer type is a tilt drum style, while in Europe a Twin Shaft is more prevalent. A <b>Pan</b> or Planetary <b>mixer</b> is more common at a precast plant. Aggregate bins have 2 to 6 compartments for storage of various sand and aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.) sizes, while cement silos are typically one or two compartments, but at times up to 4 compartments in a single silo. Conveyors are typically between 24-48 inches wide and carry aggregate from the ground hopper to the aggregate bin, {{as well as from the}} aggregate batcher to the charge chute.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals {{with the development of}} self-consolidating high performance concrete (SCHPC) incorporating rice husk ash (RHA) as a supplementary cementing material. Various SCHPCs were produced using the water-binder (W/B) ratios of 0. 30, 0. 35, 0. 40 and 0. 50, and RHA content in the range of 0 to 30 % of cement by weight. In addition, a number of pastes and mortars formulated from the concretes were prepared and tested for the filling ability. The paste and mortar filling abilities were tested with respect to flow time and flow spread, respectively, at various dosages of high-range water reducer (HRWR). Also, the mortars were tested for the air content at various dosages of air-entraining admixture (AEA). It was observed that the flow time of the pastes increased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content, whereas the flow spread of the mortars decreased with higher W/B ratio and greater RHA content. Both paste and mortar filling abilities increased with higher HRWR dosages. In addition, the air content of the mortars decreased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content for given AEA dosages. The fresh SCHPCs were tested for filling ability, passing ability, air-void stability, segregation resistance, unit weight and air content. The filling ability was determined with respect to slump and slump flow, inverted slump cone flow time and spread, and orimet flow time and spread. The passing ability was measured with regard to slump and slump flow with J-ring, inverted slump cone flow spread with J-ring, and orimet flow spread with J-ring. The air-void stability in several fresh SCHPC mixtures was investigated with respect to re-mixing of concrete and subsequent measurement of air content at different test stages. The test results obtained for the fresh properties showed that the inverted slump cone and orimet flow times increased with lower W/B ratio and greater RHA content. In addition, the slump flow, inverted slump cone flow spread, and orimet flow spread with and without J-ring increased considerably with lower W/B ratio and greater RHA content. However, the increases in slump with and without J-ring at lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content were not significant. The unit weight of concrete slightly decreased with higher W/B ratio and greater RHA content, and with higher air content. Achieving the target air content required greater AEA dosages for lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content. However, the presence of RHA had no adverse effect on the air-void stability of concrete. The segregation resistance of various SCHPCs was investigated by visual inspection of concrete in <b>mixer</b> <b>pan,</b> and during and after different flow tests. Slight bleeding and a thick layer of paste were noticed in <b>mixer</b> <b>pan</b> for several concretes. The dynamic segregation in the form of discontinuity or blockage of flow did not occur during the orimet and inverted slump cone flow tests for any concrete. No aggregate pile appeared in the slump flow, and orimet and inverted slump cone flow spreads of any concrete. But minor to severe mortar halos were noticed in the periphery of the flow spread of several concretes, particularly in the presence of high RHA content. The results of visual inspection suggest that both lower W/B ratio and greater RHA content improved the dynamic segregation resistance of concrete. In contrast, the higher RHA content resulted in a lower static segregation resistance, which was overcome in the presence of viscosity-enhancing admixture (VEA). The static segregation resistance of several SCHPCs was quantitatively determined by sieve and column apparatus. The segregation index given by the sieve increased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content, thus indicating a reduced static segregation resistance. In contrast, the segregation factor given by the column apparatus decreased with lower W/B ratio suggesting an increased static segregation resistance. However, the segregation factor increased with higher RHA content, and thus revealed a reduction in static segregation resistance. In the presence of VEA, both segregation index and segregation factor decreased significantly, indicating an improvement in the static segregation resistance of concrete. The hardened SCHPCs were tested for compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water absorption, total porosity and electrical resistivity. Test results revealed that the compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity and true electrical resistivity increased, whereas the water absorption and total porosity decreased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content. The entrained air-voids decreased the compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water absorption and total porosity, but slightly increased the electrical resistivity of concrete. In general, the hardened properties indicated good durability of the concretes. The empirical models for the filling ability (slump flow) and compressive strength of SCHPC were derived and verified with test data from this study and other data taken from the literature. The slump flow and compressive strength computed from the models were coherent with the measured values. Both filling ability and strength models were useful to develop a mixture design method for SCHPC with and without RHA...|$|R
