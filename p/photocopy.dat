5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a <b>photocopy</b> on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought {{it had something to}} do with naval guns.|$|E

40|$|Outside of {{contemporary}} art practice, the act of <b>photocopying</b> is by-and-large not given much consideration by general users and is only granted limited treatment within discussions of electronic media. This paper seeks to redress this, by speculating on the practice of <b>photocopying</b> {{and some of the}} less remarked on behaviours and 'drives' which motivate and structure this practice. It begins by sketching briefly the development of commercial <b>photocopying</b> technologies and some of their artistic uses. Then, drawing on various written accounts and observational research in a large public research library, it explores a number of 'pathologies' or curiosities of behaviour and motivation which attend and characterise the act of <b>photocopying.</b> The paper concludes by suggesting that gaining insight into these patterns and processes can contribute to a richer understanding of the practice of everyday <b>photocopying,</b> as well as human-machine interaction more generally...|$|R

25|$|On March 3, 2007, an American Greetings Christmas card {{sent to the}} Chronicle, postmarked 1990 in Eureka had {{recently}} been discovered in their photo files by editorial assistant Daniel King. Inside the envelope, with the card, was a <b>photocopy</b> of two U.S. Postal keys on a magnet keychain. The handwriting on the envelope resembles Zodiac's print, but was declared inauthentic by forensic document examiner Lloyd Cunningham. However, not all Zodiac experts agree with Cunningham's analysis. There is no return address on the envelope nor is his crossed-circle signature to be found. The card itself is unmarked. The Chronicle turned over all the material to the Vallejo Police Department for further analysis.|$|E
25|$|By 2004, the {{investigation}} of the BTK Killer was cold. Then, Rader began a series of 11 communications to the local media that led directly to his arrest in February 2005. In March 2004, The Wichita Eagle received a letter from someone using the return address Bill Thomas Killman. The author of the letter claimed that he had murdered Vicki Wegerle on September 16, 1986, and enclosed photographs of the crime scene and a <b>photocopy</b> of her driver's license, which had been stolen {{at the time of the}} crime. Before this, it was not definitively established that Wegerle was killed by BTK. DNA collected from under Wegerle's fingernails provided police with previously unknown evidence. They then began DNA testing hundreds of men in an effort to find the serial killer. Altogether, over 1300 DNA samples were taken and later destroyed by court order.|$|E
25|$|On 17 September 2003, Sobhraj {{was seen}} in a street of Kathmandu by a {{journalist}}. The journalist quickly reported this to the Nepalese authorities who arrested him two days later in the casino of the Yak and Yeti hotel. Sobhraj's motives for returning to Nepal remain unknown. He {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment by the Kathmandu district court on 20 August 2004 for the murders of Bronzich and Carrière in 1975. Most of the <b>photocopy</b> evidence used against him in this case was from that gathered by Knippenberg, the Dutch embassy investigator, and Interpol. He appealed against the conviction, claiming that he was sentenced without trial. His lawyer also announced that Chantal, Sobhraj's wife in France, was filing a case before the European Court of Human Rights against the French government, for refusing to provide him with any assistance. Sobhraj's conviction was confirmed by the Patan Court of Appeals in 2005.|$|E
