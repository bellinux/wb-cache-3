50|$|Ironically, {{it was not}} a {{purchasing}} agent but a salesman working for the Thomas Publishing Company by the name of Elwood B. Hendricks who realized the full potential of the buying function and was the driving force behind forming a national <b>purchasing</b> <b>association.</b> In 1913, Hendricks's plan began to bear fruit when he helped form the Purchasing Agents Association of New York that was to become the nucleus of the national organization. The New York group applied for and received a charter for N.A.P.A. in 1915. The first local groups to affiliate with the new national association were New York City and Pittsburgh in 1915 and Columbus in 1916. South Bend, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Detroit and Los Angeles followed them in 1917. Buffalo later affiliated with N.A.P.A. in 1918 and by 1920 there were over 30 affiliates and that number continued to skyrocket. Hendricks efforts were so instrumental in the organization's success that it gave him an honorary lifetime membership.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the Manufacturing ISM Report On Business® {{can be traced back}} to 1923 when ISM, then known then as the National Association of Purchasing Agents (N.A.P.A.), adopted a polling {{technique}} to survey its members on commodities across the country. The results of these surveys were published in the association's membership publication. For three years, there was no solid structure or guidelines on the implementation of the surveys. Then, in 1926, N.A.P.A. selected Edward T. Gushee, a purchaser from Detroit, Michigan, as the chairman to supervise the activities of this survey group and decided to expand the scope of information gathered from its membership for the survey. In 1930, the United States was still experiencing the drastic economic impact of the stock market collapse and the Great Depression. In office for a little over one year, U.S. President Herbert Hoover, faced with the traumatic difficulties brought on by these events, was looking for answers. The President and other leading businessmen were concerned over the lack of information to assist them in resolving the economic conditions in the United States. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce had organized, with President Hoover's approval, a committee to gather pertinent business data from companies who were members of the Chamber. However, after numerous efforts to gather information, the committee was disbanded in June 1931. John R. Whitehead, who was the recently elected president of N.A.P.A. and represented the association on this committee, wanted to continue the efforts of the committee. He believed that this was a project the <b>purchasing</b> <b>association</b> could carry on, not only for the benefit of the country's economy but also to assist purchasing professionals with performing a more effective job for their organizations during these difficult times. George A. Renard, the executive secretary of N.A.P.A. at the time, agreed with Whitehead on conducting the program. Under the leadership of Whitehead and Renard, the newly founded Business Survey Committee surveyed the association membership on current business conditions. Renard tabulated the results and then sent them directly to President Hoover.In view of the positive feedback from N.A.P.A. members and the government on the surveys, N.A.P.A. was inspired to survey its members and release the information on a regular basis. Except for a four-year interruption during World War II, because of the difficulty of businesses operating under full-scale war conditions, ISM (and it predecessors) have published the report since 1931 for its membership and other interested organizations and individuals.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerned}} the wear of farm sprayer nozzles in practical operation and {{was conducted in}} order to answer following questions. * when do the nozzles become worn out? * which type of nozzle wears out the fastest? * do certain herbicides cause more wear than others? The Swedish Farmers Selling & <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Association</b> had requested its local branches to collect nozzles from farmers who had kept records of how they had been used. These records gave information {{on the type of}} herbicide, the number of seasons used and the spray rate. Altogether 42 sets of nozzles were used in the survey. Of these, 9 were made of brass (fan nozzles) and 33 of plastic (5 cone nozzles, 28 fan nozzles). The experimental equipment consisted of a patternator. The test was divided into two parts, the first dealing with determinations of the flow and the second dealing with the spraying uniformity. In the present study the total flow per nozzle was chosen as a measure of the nozzles range of use. As the original flows of the nozzles are not known, it is impossible to calculate the relative change in flow. This survey demonstrates that the change in flow is negligible within the sector in which the nozzles have been used. Neither do coefficients of variation for the flow change with the total flow. The coefficient of variation for the distribution increases with the total flow in the nozzle. A plastic fan nozzle is, on average, worn out after approximately 4000 l. In order to obtain a corresponding value for brass we have made an extrapolation (but its justification is doubtful). According to the extrapolation, the brass nozzles would wear out after approximately 14000 l (3. 5 times more than plastic). The material was divided with regard to herbicides used into one group consisting of herbicides which form true solutions when mixed with water and another consisting of slurry herbicides and micro-suspensions. It is clear that the latter group is the most aggressive...|$|E

40|$|Introduction A Consortium {{could be}} {{described}} as a group of organizations who come together to fulfill a combined objective that usefully requires co-operation and sharing of resources. And need to have a clear mutual goal in order to ensure their success. A library Consortium formation can be local, regional, state, national and inter institutional level. According to Webster 2 ̆ 7 s 3 rd new International Dictionary, Library consortia is 2 ̆ 2 an agreement, combination, or group formed to undertake and enterprise beyond the resources of anyone member 2 ̆ 2 (Merriam Webster online dictionary. 2008) Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science (ODLIS) defines Library Consortia as 2 ̆ 2 an association of independent Libraries and/or Library systems established by formal agreement, usually for the purpose of sharing 2 ̆ 2. Membership may be restricted to a specific geographical region, type of Library (Public, Academic, and Special) or subject specialization 2 ̆ 2. (ODLIS-Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science) Consortium is the term, which has many meaning. In the beginning libraries work in the field of collection development and resource sharing in the widest sense of word. Later on cooperative cataloguing system were as consortia. As <b>purchasing</b> <b>association</b> in the network environment the term 2 ̆ 2 Consortia 2 ̆ 2 is now widely used. Review of Literature The study of related research implies locating, reading and evaluating research reports. The survey of the literature is a crucial aspect for planning of the body of research. The investigators reviewed only those studies which are related to the present study. It was revealed that majority of the users are aware about the availability of online journals. And majority of respondent indicated that they make use of online journals for their research work. It was also found that users faced problems while using online journals. A need was also felt by some research scholars regarding inclusion of some more e- journals in UGC-Infonet Consortium (Zaidi and Bharati, 2008). The users faced problem while accessing e-consortium and lack of awareness of e-resources available. It was suggested that a training programme should be conducted regularly to improve the usage of e-journal consortium. (Gupta and Rawtani, 2008) There is a need of conducting regular orientation/training programme for the UGC Infonet programme; more number of e-journals {{to be included in the}} UGC Infonet consortium (Veenapani, Singh and Devi, 2008). A high proportion of teaching and research staff are aware of the collection of electronic journals and there is an increasing preference for the electronic information sources to the detriment of the printed format. The collection of electronic journals is highly valued and most users expect to increase their use during the next few years. The results also confirm the importance of discipline and age as explanatory factors of the use of electronic journals (Borrego et. al., 2007). In a study under the title 2 ̆ 2 Preserving perpetual access to electronic journals: A Korean consortial approach 2 ̆ 2 This study describes the key findings of the Korean Electronic Site License Initiative (KESLI), established by the National Digital Science Library to develop a digital archive of electronic journals in Korea. Research and relevant activities included developing system architecture, suggesting journal selection criteria and publisher selection criteria, choosing a set of metadata elements, and addressing stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 concerns. Recommendations for further tasks have been made in order to have the system fully operating by December 2007 (Choia and Parkb, 2007). A study observes that electronic journals continue to usually be the format of choice for institutional serials subscriptions. However, in developing countries this is not always the case, due to access and connectivity issues. He found that insufficient administrative infrastructure and resources were the major contributing factors and reasons why harnessing of e-journals is not more ubiquitous and common in Nigeria. The paper offers some useful suggestions on how to tackle these problems through constant training of users on the use of internet, networking all libraries 2 ̆ 7 computer terminals, provides stand-by generator, and put in place a technical-oriented manpower. Finally, there is a need to overhaul the telecommunication industry so as to get a better result in term of Information Technology development in the developing countries (Ajegbomogun, 2007). Authors discuss the concern over the archival of electronic journals such as unprecedented pace of technological developments, hardware and software updates. Copyright issues and mergers cessation and stoppages of publishing industries. The successful operation of library consortium clearly depends upon a number of things such as good working relationship among the members and consortium headquarter clear policies and priorities, attempts to address the issue and concern etc. However, the consortia initiatives in India are not popular and the trends are slowly catching up among the professional community. Now libraries recognized that they can accomplish more by working together than they can individually (Bavakutty and Azeez, 2006). The libraries and information centers with their static financial allocations have to consider new ways to consolidate global resources amongst them in order to maximize their limited financial resources. Fortunately, availability of powerful computers at affordable cost, speed of telecommunication networks to remote areas, advent of internet, increasing interest in creating digital contents etc, are now helping the library and information professionals to give answer to the challenges occurring due to the explosion of information and knowledge, increasing cost of library materials, changing format of reading materials, shrinking library budget and increasing demand of the users for information and knowledge. Keeping in view of these factors, he discusses the concept of resource sharing and the role of library consortia as an effective collaborative approach to face challenges of modern librarianship (Bhatt, 2006) ...|$|E
