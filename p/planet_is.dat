5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope on the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> inclined at 53° to {{the plane of the}} sky; but innermost b and e are inclined at 85°. Planet c's inclination is unknown.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-pressure}} area, high or anticyclone is {{a region}} where the atmospheric pressure at {{the surface of the}} <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> greater than its surrounding environment.|$|E
5|$|A major {{detrimental}} {{factors which}} may prevent life from forming and it being an inhabitable <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> the fact Gliese 581 is a variable star.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, two <b>planets</b> <b>were</b> found transiting the star. These <b>planets</b> <b>were</b> {{confirmed}} through transit-timing variation method. A third <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> discovered through follow-up {{radial velocity}} measurements which was confirmed in January 2014.|$|R
25|$|Pulsar <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> <b>planets</b> that <b>are</b> found {{orbiting}} pulsars, or rapidly rotating neutron stars. The {{first such}} <b>planet</b> to <b>be</b> discovered was around a millisecond pulsar {{and was the}} first extrasolar <b>planet</b> to <b>be</b> confirmed as discovered.|$|R
50|$|Oreo <b>is</b> an {{extinguished}} <b>planet,</b> <b>were</b> Deck {{was born}} and brought up. As Oreo was extremely advanced on technology, many Oreans managed to escape before the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> destroyed.|$|R
5|$|Beyond {{the main}} rings at a {{distance}} of 12 million km from the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> the sparse Phoebe ring, which is tilted at an angle of 27° to the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.|$|E
5|$|Due to its extreme {{distance}} from the Sun, Planet Nine would reflect little sunlight, potentially evading telescope sightings. It {{is expected to have}} an apparent magnitude fainter than 22, making it at least 600 times fainter than Pluto. If Planet Nine exists and is close to its perihelion, astronomers could identify it based on existing images. For its aphelion, the largest telescopes would be required. However, if the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> currently located in between, many observatories could spot Planet Nine. Statistically, the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> more likely to be closer to its aphelion at a distance greater than 500 AU. This is because objects move more slowly when near their aphelion, in accordance with Kepler's second law.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the planet}}'s high mass, the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> a gas giant with no solid surface. Since the planet {{has only been}} {{detected}} indirectly, parameters such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of astrology, {{generation}}al <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> <b>planets</b> that affect {{an entire generation of}} people. The generational <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> the outer <b>planets</b> Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Sedna, and Quaoar.|$|R
5|$|In 2014, {{secondary}} transit of the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> reported. Full {{observation of}} {{phases of the}} <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> reported in September 2014.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in 2001 from the Lick and Keck observatories using precision {{measurements of the}} star's radial velocity variations. The periodicity in this variation allowed astronomers to extract information about the planet's orbit and minimum mass. A second <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> discovered by the same team two years later. Both <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> greater in mass than Jupiter.|$|R
5|$|HAT-P-33b has an orbital {{inclination}} of 86.7º {{as seen from}} Earth. The <b>planet</b> <b>is,</b> thus, almost edge-on when seen from Earth. The planet has been observed to transit its host star.|$|E
5|$|In the 5-planet {{solution}} for the 55 Cancri system, the orbit of 55 Cancri c is mildly eccentric: at apoastron the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> about 19% further from the star than it is at periastron. It is located closer to 55 Cancri A than Mercury is to our sun, though it has a longer orbital period than the hot Jupiters. The <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> located close to a 3:1 resonance with the inner planet 55 Cancri b; however, simulations indicate that the two planets are not actually in this resonance.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is {{the only}} known {{exoplanet}} in the orbit of host star MOA-2009-BLG-387L. The <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be 2.6 times the mass of Jupiter. However, because knowledge of the exact parameters of the planet {{are tied to the}} host star's parameters, and the host star's parameters are not well-constrained, uncertainty places MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass between 1.0 and 6.7 times that of Jupiter. The <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> estimated to orbit its host star every 1970 days at a distance of 1.8 AU, some 1.8 times the mean distance between Earth and the Sun. Uncertainty broadens the mean distance to between 1.1 and 2.7 AU.|$|E
50|$|This <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in 2007 on September 20 and published on March 1. This <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> typical {{as it was}} discovered spectroscopically using the radial velocity method.|$|R
50|$|The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} by observing {{the amount of}} stellar flux reaching the Earth. The existence of the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> confirmed by also observing the reflected starlight from the planet, {{the shape of the}} star due to gravitational tug from the planet and radial velocity method. Finally, part of the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> found transiting the parent star with secondary occultation also being detected.|$|R
40|$|Ultra-short-period (USP) <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> a newly {{recognized}} {{class of}} planets with periods shorter than {{one day and}} radii smaller than about 2 Earth radii. It has been proposed that USP <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> the solid cores of hot Jupiters that lost their gaseous envelopes due to photo-evaporation or Roche lobe overflow. We test this hypothesis by asking whether USP <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> associated with metal-rich stars, as has long been observed for hot Jupiters. We find the metallicity distributions of USP-planet and hot-Jupiter hosts to be significantly different (p = 3 × 10 ^- 4), based on Keck spectroscopy of Kepler stars. Evidently, the sample of USP <b>planets</b> <b>is</b> not dominated by the evaporated cores of hot Jupiters. The metallicity distribution of stars with USP <b>planets</b> <b>is</b> indistinguishable from that of stars with short-period planets with sizes between 2 [...] 4 R_⊕. Thus it remains possible that the USP <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> the solid cores of formerly gaseous planets smaller than Neptune. Comment: AJ, in pres...|$|R
5|$|Since 47 Ursae Majoris c was {{detected}} indirectly, properties {{such as its}} radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Based on its high mass, the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{likely to be a}} gas giant with no solid surface.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{content of}} the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{calculated}} at a few percent of its total mass, but the envelope accounts for 70-80% of the planet's total volume.|$|E
5|$|The <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{unlikely}} to have large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales relative {{to the age of}} the system.|$|E
50|$|PSR B1257+12: The first {{confirmed}} {{discovery of}} extrasolar <b>planets</b> <b>was</b> made in 1992 when {{a system of}} terrestrial-mass <b>planets</b> <b>was</b> announced to be present around the millisecond pulsar PSR B1257+12.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 a <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} orbiting 14 Herculis. The planet's eccentric {{orbital period}} is 4.8 years. In 2005, a possible second <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> proposed, designated 14 Herculis c. The parameters of this <b>planet</b> <b>are</b> uncertain, {{but a recent}} analysis suggests it {{may lie in the}} 4:1 resonance with the inner planet, with an orbital period of almost 19 years at an orbital distance of 6.9 AU.|$|R
50|$|Kepler-90 {{is notable}} for the {{configuration}} of its planetary system, which has similarities to the Solar System in which the rocky <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> nearer and gas giants further away. The five inner <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> either super-Earths or mini-Neptunes due to their size. The two outer <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> gas giants. The outermost known planet orbits its host star {{at about the same}} distance as Earth from the Sun.|$|R
5|$|A dwarf <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> a planetary-mass {{object that}} {{is neither a}} planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to crush it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the {{neighborhood}} of other material around its orbit.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing {{mystery of}} Venus {{observations}} {{is the so-called}} ashen light—an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but {{the existence of the}} illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.|$|E
5|$|A team {{of astronomers}} led by Stéphane Udry of the Geneva Observatory used the HARPS {{instrument}} on the European Southern Observatory 3.6 meter telescope in La Silla, Chile, {{to discover the}} planet in 2007. Udry's team employed the radial velocity technique, in which the mass of a <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> determined based on the small perturbations it induces in its parent star’s orbit via gravity.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 1998, an extrasolar <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} {{in orbit around}} Gliese876 by two independent teams led by Geoffrey Marcy and Xavier Delfosse. The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> designated Gliese876b and was detected by Doppler spectroscopy.|$|R

50|$|In 2012, a circumbinary Neptune-sized <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> found transiting the {{brighter}} star. Follow-up radial velocity measurements {{did not give}} sufficient information to constrain {{the mass of the}} <b>planet.</b> The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> confirmed via transit duration variation method.|$|R
5|$|As the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{not known}} to transit from Earth and {{atmospheric}} conditions are not observable with current technology, no atmosphere for the planet has been confirmed to date. As such, all climate predictions for the planet are based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric conditions.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{its high}} mass, Gliese 876 c {{is likely to}} be a gas giant with no solid surface. Since it was {{detected}} indirectly through its gravitational effects on the star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> predicted to have a cloudless upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Freedom <b>Planet</b> <b>is</b> a {{two-dimensional}} platform video game developed {{and published by}} independent developer GalaxyTrail. The player controls one of three anthropomorphic animal protagonists: the dragon Lilac, the wildcat Carol, or the basset hound Milla. Aided by the duck-like Torque, the player attempts to defeat Lord Brevon, who plans to conquer the galaxy. While the game focuses on fast-paced platforming, its levels are interspersed with slower action scenes.|$|E
50|$|The two <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> in a 2:1 resonance, {{meaning that}} the outer planet orbits the star once every time when the inner planet orbits the star twice. These two jovian <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> dancing around each other gravitationally.|$|R
25|$|As of June 2016, {{all but one}} of the {{confirmed}} Kepler circumbinary <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> {{smaller than}} Jupiter. This cannot be a selection effect because larger <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> easier to detect. Simulations had predicted this would be the case.|$|R
