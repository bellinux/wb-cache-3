5|$|The first World Cup was {{the only}} one without qualification. Every country {{affiliated}} with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, <b>Paraguay,</b> <b>Peru</b> and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players, very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances, and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to The Football Association, even though the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929. Two months {{before the start of the}} tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.|$|E

25|$|The {{increased}} {{incidence of}} military coups d'état since World War II, {{particularly in the}} 1960s and 1970s, brought about a growing interest in academic and journalistic circles in studying the nature of such coups.

Political unrest in South America, which involved military coups in Bolivia (189 military coups in its first 169 years of existence), Chile, Argentina, Brazil, <b>Paraguay,</b> <b>Peru,</b> and Uruguay, was largely a result of forces attempting to stem the increasing influence of left-wing and communist led uprisings. The 2006 military coup in Thailand engendered continued interest in this area.|$|E
