25|$|Batteries {{are used}} either as sole or as backup power for {{residential}} smoke detectors. Mains-operated detectors have disposable or rechargeable batteries; others run only on 9-volt disposable batteries. When the battery is exhausted a battery-only smoke detector becomes inactive; most smoke detectors chirp repeatedly if the battery is low. It {{has been found}} that battery-powered smoke detectors in many houses have dead batteries. It has been estimated that in the UK over 30% of smoke alarms may have dead or removed batteries. In response public information campaigns have been created to remind people to change smoke detector batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public information campaign suggests that smoke alarm batteries should be replaced on April Fools' Day every year. In regions using daylight saving time, campaigns may suggest that <b>people</b> <b>change</b> their batteries when they change their clocks or on a birthday.|$|E

Moreover, the extreme weather in Viet Nam makes citizens uncomfortable when wearing the ao dai. Besides, it is wardrobe malfunction that causes to the fear of wearing the ao dai in daily activities.

500|$|In Whitehead's view, then, {{concepts}} such as [...] "quality", [...] "matter", and [...] "form" [...] are problematic. These [...] "classical" [...] concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature {{of the most basic}} elements of the world. They are useful abstractions, but are not the world's basic building blocks. [...] What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events. [...] After all, <b>people</b> <b>change</b> all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience. [...] These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a [...] "society" [...] of events. [...] By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the [...] "fallacy of misplaced concreteness").|$|E
500|$|Some <b>People</b> <b>Change</b> was Montgomery Gentry's lowest-selling album at the time.

[...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times gave a mixed review, saying that it was more [...] "touchy-feely" [...] than You Do Your Thing, and that [...] "no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "C", criticizing the duo for the {{contradictory}} viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the [...] "defense of the American right to piss off your neighbors" [...] in [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". Jurek comparatively called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that it was [...] "a new pinnacle for the duo", calling the title track [...] "one of those tunes that defines something that {{lies at the heart of}} what is good about Americans." ...|$|E
500|$|A Link to the Past is {{the first}} {{appearance}} of what would subsequently become a major Zelda trademark: the existence of two parallel worlds between which the player travels. [...] The first, called the Light World, is the ordinary Hyrule where Link grew up with his uncle. The second is {{what was once the}} Sacred Realm, but became the Dark World when Ganon acquired the Triforce. The Dark World is a corrupted version of Hyrule; the water is a dark, unpleasant blue-green color, the grass is dead, skulls replace rocks and pots, and trees have faces. <b>People</b> <b>change</b> forms in the Dark World based on their nature; without an item to prevent it (in this case, the Moon Pearl), Link turns into a pink rabbit. Each location in the Light World corresponds to a similar location in the Dark World, usually with a similar physical structure but an opposite nature (e.g. a desert in the Light World corresponds to a swamp in the Dark World, a peaceful village in the Light World corresponds to a dilapidated town of thieves in the Dark World).|$|E
