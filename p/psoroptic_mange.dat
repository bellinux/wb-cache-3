50|$|Psoroptes mites are {{responsible}} for causing <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> in various animals, leading to economic losses among farmers of cattle, sheep and goats. It {{is also known as}} sheep scab and cattle scab. The disease is highly infectious, and is transmitted via fenceposts and other structures that livestock use when scratching themselves. The mites have mouthparts which do not pierce the skin, but are adapted to feeding on the surface, where the mites abrade the stratum corneum.

After a one year survey among West African Dwarf {{sheep and goats}} in four villages and five flocks in the North-West province of Cameroon, the sanitary state of these traditional flocks was studied. The main diseases encountered were respiratory problems, present all the year and, especially severe during the rainy season, cutaneous and gastro-intestinal parasitic diseases. Keratoconjunctivitis and foot lesions were also frequently noticed. Among cutaneous parasites, <b>mange</b> (<b>psoroptic</b> and sarcoptic) and ticks (Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus) were the most prevalent. Nematodes and coccidia were the main intestinal parasites. Faecal cultures results indicated that Strongyloides, Trichostrongylus, Chabertia and Cooperia were the prevalent parasites. The mean total faecal egg counts were higher in goats than in sheep. An anthelmintic treatment (Eustidil, Wellcome) given to ail animals {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season was ineffective in protecting these animals from field infestations...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 13th {{century the}} abbey had {{incurred}} debts on its building projects and lost revenue due to an epidemic of sheep scab (<b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange).</b> The ill fortune was compounded by raiders from Scotland in the early 14th century.The great reduction in population caused by the Black Death in the mid-14th century made it difficult to recruit new lay brothers for manual labour. As a result, the abbey was forced to lease much of its land. By 1381 there were only fourteen choir monks, three lay brothers and the abbot left at Rievaulx, and some buildings were reduced in size.|$|E
40|$|The Belgian Blue {{cattle breed}} is {{extremely}} sensitive to <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange,</b> a severe dermatitis {{caused by the}} mite Psoroptes ovis. This marked breed predisposition indicates that the susceptibility to <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> is partly heritable. Determination of the genetic factors underlying this high sensitivity of the Belgian Blue breed requires {{the definition of a}} clear phenotype. The mange phenotype was defined based on lesion extent, lesion appearance and mite counts. “Lesion extent” reflects the percentage of clinically affected body surface, calculated from a sketch of the lesions. The second parameter differentiates active, inactive (healing) and chronic lesions and is called “lesion appearance”. Mites were counted in skinscrapings of each animal to establish the third parameter. Disease evolution (time span≈ 14 days) and reaction to acaricide treatment (1 month after treatment) were evaluated at 3 consecutive farm visits. Finally, the 3 quantitative phenotypic parameters of all 3 visits were mean centered, weighed and combined to a final score for each animal. In this approach, <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> in cattle {{is considered to be a}} quantitative trait rather than a class variable, so phenotyping cattle is sorting them based on their sensitivity score rather than dividing the population in a sensitive and resistant class. This finding is of great importance for the future genome wide association study of the susceptibility to <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> in cattle. status: publishe...|$|E

This mange phenotype was defined based on lesion extent, lesion appearance and mite counts, measured at three consecutive farm visits. In this study, a GWAS was performed using the Illumina Bovine SNP 50 v 2 BeadChip to identify locations linked to mange sensitivity in 496 Belgian Blue animals sampled at 18 different farms. The Glascow program was used to allow the implementation of a linear mixed model on haplotypes inferred from the genomic data. Considering mange sensitivity as a quantitative phenotype, 110 extreme cases (sensitive/resistant) were selected. A GWAS on these extreme phenotypes showed a promising signal at the telomere of chromosome 11. This genome scan is the first attempt to unravel the genetics of <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> sensitivity, promising economic as well as welfare advantages. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|In an {{investigation}} into alternative methods for the treatment and control of sheep scab, the efficacy of moxidectin, a second generation milbemycin, was evaluated {{in a series of}} laboratory and field studies in Ireland. Initial laboratory trials demon-strated that moxidectin, given as a subcutaneous injection at 200 gg/kg bodyweight was effective in the treatment of clinical <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange.</b> Subsequent work showed that a single injec-tion of clean sheep with moxidectin at the same dose rate pro-vided protection against natural and experimental sheep scab infection for up to 35 days. This residual protective efficacy was tested in a large scale field trial in County Offaly, Ireland, in which more than 6500 sheep on 50 farms received a single prophylactic injection with moxidectin in the autumn and remained free from scab throughout the winter.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> is a chronic, refractory, {{contagious}} {{and infectious}} disease {{mainly caused by}} the mange mite Psoroptes ovis, which can infect horses, sheep, buffaloes, rabbits, other domestic animals, deer, wild camels, foxes, minks, lemurs, alpacas, elks and other wild animals. Features of the disease include intense pruritus and dermatitis, depilation and hyperkeratosis, which ultimately result in emaciation or death caused by secondary bacterial infections. The infestation is usually transmitted by close contact between animals. <b>Psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> is widespread in the world. In this paper, the transcriptome of P. ovis is described following sequencing and analysis of transcripts from samples of larvae (i. e. the Pso_L group) and nymphs and adults (i. e. the Pso_N_A group). The study describes differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and genes encoding allergens, which help understanding the biology of P. ovis and lay foundations {{for the development of}} vaccine antigens and drug target screening. Methods The transcriptome of P. ovis was assembled and analyzed using bioinformatic tools. The unigenes of P. ovis from each developmental stage and the unigenes differentially between developmental stages were compared with allergen protein sequences contained in the allergen database website to predict potential allergens. Results We identified 38, 836 unigenes, whose mean length was 825  bp. On the basis of sequence similarity with seven databases, a total of 17, 366 unigenes were annotated. A total of 1, 316 DEGs were identified, including 496 upregulated and 820 downregulated in the Pso_L group compared with the Pso_N_A group. We predicted 205 allergens genes in the two developmental stages similar to genes from other mites and ticks, of these, 14 were among the upregulated DEGs and 26 among the downregulated DEGs. Conclusion This study provides a reference transcriptome of P. ovis in absence of a reference genome. The analysis of DEGs and putative allergen genes may lay the foundation for studies of functional genomics, immunity and gene expression profiles of this parasitic mite species...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of the d-phenothrin/pyriproxyfen association against Psoroptes ovis, Cheyletiella parasitivorax, and Leporacarus gibbus infestations in naturally co-infested rabbits. Twenty crossbreed (New Zealand White x California) rabbits concurrently infested by the three mite species were randomly divided in two groups. All rabbits presented with hyperemia, erythema and formation of crusts in the ear canals caused by P. ovis. Infestations by both C. parasitivorax and L. gibbus were considered asymptomatic in all animals. Ten animals were treated with a 4. 4 % d-phenothrin and 0. 148 % pyriproxyfen spray formulation until have their body surface uniformly sprayed, including external ear canals. The other ten rabbits remained untreated, serving as control group. Observations were done on days + 7, + 14, + 21, + 28, and + 35 post-treatment. The d-phenothrin/pyriproxyfen association showed 100 % efficacy against the three mite species and was responsible for the remission of <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> lesions on treated animals. No signs of intoxication were observed. The results indicate that d-phenothrin/pyriproxyfen spray formulation in a single application is an effective and clinically safe option for the control of different mite infestations in rabbits...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of mite species infest animals. Most inhabit the skin, {{feathers}} or mucous membranes, although a few are endoparasites. Many mites are tolerated without consequences unless their populations become very large; other species regularly cause pruritus, mild to severe dermatitis, and hair or feather loss (mites found on the integument), or respiratory signs (air sac mites). Mites such as Sarcoptes scabiei (sarcoptic mange) and Psoroptes ovis (<b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange)</b> can cause significant economic losses in livestock from debilitation and damage to the hides and wool. Secondary bacterial infections and mortality can occur in severe mite infestations, notably during infestation with S. scabiei {{and other members of}} the Sarcoptidae. Sarcoptic mange is also a concern in threatened or fragmented wildlife populations; some populations have experienced severe declines in their numbers after these mites were introduced. Avian mites such as Ornithonyssus sylviarum, Orn, bursa, Dermanyssus gallinae, Knemidokoptes spp. and Sternostoma tracheacolum can cause disease in poultry or pet birds. Mites also affect laboratory and pet rodents, rabbits, exotic animals and reptiles. Humans occasionally become infested with zoonotic mites, which can cause discomfort and dermatitis. A few species can transmit diseases, such as human vesicular rickettsiosis. Mites from animals do not usually survive for very long on humans, and most zoonotic infestations are self-limiting...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{cellular}} and humoral immune {{responses of}} beef (Belgian White and Blue [BWB]) and dairy (Friesian-Holstein [FH]) cattle to Psoroptes ovis infestation {{and to determine}} whether P ovis infestation impaired immune responses to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBR) vaccine or an immunogenic protein (keyhole-limpet hemocyanin [KLH]). ANIMALS: 19 BWB and 6 FH 1 -year-old calves. PROCEDURE: 2 trials were performed. In each trial, 7 (trial 1) or 6 (trial 2) BWB calves and 3 FH calves were experimentally infested with P ovis and 3 BWB calves were maintained as uninfested controls. Animals were inoculated with KLH and IBR virus vaccine twice; 3 BWB calves in each trial were treated with ivermectin. Serum antibody responses to KLH, IBR virus, and P ovis were measured by use of ELISA. A lymphocyte transformation assay {{was used to determine}} nonspecific responses to 3 mitogens and specific lymphocyte reactivity to P ovis antigen. RESULTS: In each trial, 3 BWB and 3 FH calves developed clinical signs of <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> and mites could be recovered. Infested and control animals developed similar antibody titers to KLH and IBR virus. Antibodies to P ovis were detected early in some infested calves, and this was correlated with a marked cell-mediated immune response. Lymphocyte responsiveness to the 3 mitogens was not significantly different among groups. CONCLUSIONS: In these calves, infestation with P ovis induced a marked humoral and cell-mediated immune response. Immunosuppression was not evident...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractThe {{sheep scab}} mite, Psoroptes ovis, {{is a major}} problem in the beef cattle industry, {{especially}} in Belgian Blue (BB) cattle. This breed is naturally more predisposed to <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> but reasons for this high susceptibility remain unknown. Different immune responses could be a potential cause; thus in this study, the cutaneous immune response and in vitro cellular immune response after antigen re-stimulation were examined in naturally infested BB. Cytokine production in the skin and in circulating re-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) demonstrated a mixed pro-inflammatory Th 2 /Th 17 profile, with transcription of IL- 4, IL- 13, IL- 6 and IL- 17. Strong IL- 17 up-regulation in the skin of BB was associated with an influx of eosinophils and other immune cells, potentially leading towards more severe symptoms. Virtually no changes in cutaneous IFN-γ transcription were detected, while there was substantial IFN-γ up-regulation in re-stimulated PBMC from infested and uninfested animals, potentially indicating a role of this pro-inflammatory cytokine in the innate immune response. In Holstein–Friesian (HF) cattle, generally more resistant to P. ovis infection, a largely similar immunologic response was observed. Differences between HF and BB were the lack of cutaneous IL- 17 response in infested HF and low transcription levels of IFN-γ and high IL- 10 transcription in re-stimulated PBMC from both infested and uninfested animals. Further research is needed to identify potential cell sources and biological functions for these cytokines and to fully unravel the basis of this different breed susceptibility to P. ovis...|$|E
40|$|Cows were {{infected}} twice with 600 and 500 nymphs and adults of a bovine strain of Psoroptes ovis with a nine-week interval. The haematological response and the non-specific mitogen- and antigen-induced responsiveness of the peripheral blood lymphocytes {{of the animals}} was followed. Dermal reactivity to P ovis antigen injection was studied five weeks after reinfection. After the first infection with 600 mites none of the infected animals developed clinical <b>psoroptic</b> <b>mange</b> but a leucocytosis developed, contributed to primarily by an eosinophilia and by a slight lymphocytosis. Antigen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis {{was used to measure}} the antigen-sensitive cell population in peripheral blood and this population showed a maximum increase 10 days after infection; however, antigen-sensitive cells remained above normal levels until reinfection. Upon challenge infection with 500 mites the infected animals showed an immediate hypersensitivity type reaction with a marked pruritus, scratching and exudation. Thereafter the lesions healed rapidly and none of the animals developed clinical mange. This clinical reaction was accompanied by a secondary eosinophilia but no change was apparent in the other blood elements. A marked increase in the blastogenic response of the peripheral blood lymphocytes was also apparent and this peaked three weeks after challenge. Following the intradermal injection of P ovis antigen there was an immediate swelling of the injection site in all infected and control animals and skin thickness was maximal one hour after injection. Thereafter there was a clear distinction in dermal reactions between P ovis infected and control animals; after 48 hours reactions were not seen in the control animals while marked dermal reactions were still present in the P ovis infected group.

40|$|<b>Psoroptic</b> <b>mange,</b> {{caused by}} the Astigmatid mite Psoroptes ovis, is an ectoparasitic disease of {{significant}} economic importance to agriculture {{on a global scale}} and poses a serious welfare concern. With the current chemotherapeutic controls considered unsustainable, there is pressing need for novel control strategies. RNA interference has been proposed as a potential high throughput approach for the identification of novel therapeutic targets with high specificity, speed and at a relatively low cost compared to the existing methods. The presence of the components of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in P. ovis was first confirmed through in silico analyses of the P. ovis transcriptome and, following development of a non-invasive immersion method of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) delivery, gene silencing by RNAi was demonstrated in P. ovis. Statistically-significant reduction of transcript level was measured for the three genes targeted: P. ovis mite group 2 allergen (Pso o 2), P. ovis mu class glutathione S-transferase (PoGST-mu 1) and P. ovis beta tubulin (Poβtub). This is the first demonstration of gene silencing by RNAi in P. ovis and provides a key mechanism for mining transcriptomic and genomic datasets in the future for novel targets of intervention against P. ovis. The first assessment of gene silencing was also performed in two related Astigmatid mites of high medical importance; the European house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and the scabies mite Sarcoptes scabiei. A statistically-significant reduction in expression of a D. pteronyssinus mu class glutathione S-transferase (DpGST-mu 1) transcript was observed. No significant reduction in expression of a S. scabiei mu class glutathione S-transferase (SsGST-mu 1) transcript was observed. Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) from the related miRNA pathway were identified in a P. ovis small RNA sample and were sequenced and annotated...|$|E
