5|$|In April 2006 Gillan {{released}} a CD/multimedia project to document his 44-year career called Gillan's Inn. Tony Iommi, Jeff Healey, Joe Satriani, Dean Howard, {{as well as}} current and former members of Deep Purple such as Jon Lord, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, Don Airey and Steve Morse are featured on this 2006 CD and DVD. The project, produced by Nick Blagona, includes a re-recorded selection of his Deep <b>Purple,</b> <b>Black</b> Sabbath and solo tracks. At {{the same time as}} Gillan's Inn, Gillan announced that his solo albums with the Ian Gillan Band and Gillan from the 1970s and 1980s would be re-issued late in 2006 and early 2007 through Demon Records.|$|E
5|$|The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though <b>purple,</b> <b>black,</b> red, white, {{and yellow}} cultivars exist. Carrots are a domesticated {{form of the}} wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant {{probably}} originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} club colours {{are green}} and white, {{which have been}} used since {{the formation of the}} club in 1875. The strip typically has a green body, white sleeves and a white collar. The shorts are normally white, although green has been used in recent seasons. The socks are green, usually with some white detail. Hibs have used yellow, <b>purple,</b> <b>black,</b> white and a dark green in recent seasons for their alternate kits. In 1977, Hibs became the first club in Scotland to bear sponsorship on their shirts. This arrangement prompted television companies to threaten a boycott of Hibs games if they used the sponsored kit, which resulted in the club using an alternate kit for the first time.|$|E

They influenced some early punk and post-punk bands, among them the Ramones, Joy Division and the Cult. They were also an important influence {{on the development of}} alternative rock, as bands adapted elements from the [...] "Zeppelin sound" [...] of the mid-1970s, including the Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden.

500|$|As {{with each}} series since Big Brother 2002, the {{programme}} was filmed at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. A total of 27 editing suites, manned by over 300 members of staff, were {{situated in the}} [...] "George Lucas Stage" [...] to produce the programme. In the 18 May issue of Star magazine, aerial photographs of the House were published, showing the garden under construction. Official pictures of the House interior were released by Channel 4 on 1 June, showing the entrance stairway, living room and garden. The entrance stairway had images of insects on its walls whilst the garden and living room had a science fiction theme; the former included a bus stop as the designated smoking area. On 3 June, Metro published {{an image of the}} Diary Room, which has a multicoloured chair and wall pattern. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, a sitting room with red sofas, a wood panelled kitched with <b>purple,</b> <b>black</b> and white fittings and a bedroom with splats of paint covering the walls. The house contained 44 cameras, 75 two-way mirrors and 57 fixed microphones, as well as individual microphones for each housemate.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{sentiment}} was {{in favour}} of reviving the Huskies nickname, but team management realized it would be nearly impossible to design a logo that did not substantially resemble that of the Minnesota Timberwolves. As a result, a nationwide contest was held to help name the team and develop their colours and logo. Over 2,000 entries were narrowed down to eleven prospects: Beavers, Bobcats, Dragons, Grizzlies, Hogs, Raptors, Scorpions, T-Rex, Tarantulas, Terriers and Towers (the eventual runner-up). The final selection—Toronto Raptors—was unveiled on Canadian national television on May 15, 1994: the choice {{was influenced by the}} popularity of the 1993 film adaption of the 1990 science fiction novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton. The name [...] "Raptor" [...] is a common informal name for the velociraptor, a swift medium-sized dromaeosaurid theropod non-avian dinosaur. On May 24, 1994, the team's logo and first General Manager, Isiah Thomas were revealed at a press conference. As part of the deal, Thomas received an option to purchase part of the team, reportedly for under market value. [...] He would purchase 4.5% in May 1995 and a further 4.5% in December 1995, half each from Bitove and Slaight, decreasing their share to 39.5%. [...] The team's colours of bright red, <b>purple,</b> <b>black,</b> and silver were also revealed; [...] "Naismith" [...] silver was chosen as an ode to Canadian James Naismith, the inventor of basketball. [...] The team originally competed in the Central Division, and before the inaugural season began, sales of Raptors merchandise ranked seventh in the league, marking a successful return of professional basketball to Canada.|$|E
2500|$|The Diamondbacks' {{original}} {{colors were}} <b>purple,</b> <b>black,</b> teal and copper.

Prior to their inaugural season, they released their baseball caps. The home cap had a cream color crown with a purple visor and button. The road cap was black and had a turquoise visor and button. Their alternate cap had a turquoise crown with a purple visor and button. Depending on the cap, the [...] "A" [...] logo {{on the front of}} the cap had different color variations.|$|E

2500|$|From around 1800, [...] painted {{decoration}} {{began to}} flourish, including {{a palette of}} [...] "delicate iron-red, a glossy blue, a bluish green, a soft <b>purple</b> <b>black,</b> and a yellow very sparingly used". A slightly later innovation added [...] The multi-coloured enamel overglaze and gold were painted on delicate, ivory-bodied pieces with a finely crackled transparent glaze. The designs—often light, simple floral patterns—were highly influenced by both Kyoto pottery and the Kanō school of painting, resulting in an emphasis on negative space. Many believe this came from Satsuma potters visiting Kyoto in the late seventeenth century to learn overglaze painting techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Ceramics first {{appeared}} in the Antilles as part of the Saladoid culture (named for the Saladero site in the Orinoco basin in Venezuela. Saladoid people appeared in Trinidad around 500 BC or a little later, and had reached Puerto Rico by about 250 BC. The Cedrosan variety of Saladoid ceramics appeared in Trinidad early on, although ceramics in the Antilles continued to closely resemble forms on the Venezuela coast into the Current Era. Cedrosan Saladoid vessels have a distinctive bell shape with [...] "zone-incised cross-hatching". Many also have complex designs of white on red paint. Later examples were decorated with <b>purple,</b> <b>black,</b> yellow and orange paint. These ceramics are described as [...] "technologically fine, delicate, and graceful." ...|$|E
2500|$|The school's {{historic}} {{coat of arms}} is used {{on official}} documentation including degree certificates and transcripts and includes the motto – rerum cognoscere causas, a line taken from Virgil’s Georgics meaning [...] "to know the causes of things", together with the school's mascot – a beaver. Both these symbols, adopted in February 1922, continue {{to be held in}} high regard to this day with the beaver chosen because of its representation as [...] "a hard working and industrious yet sociable animal", attributes that the founders hoped LSE students to both possess and aspire to. The school's weekly newspaper is still entitled The Beaver, Rosebery residence hall's bar is called the Tipsy Beaver and LSE sports teams are known as the Beavers. The institution has two sets of colours – brand and academic – red being the brand colour used on signage, publications and in buildings across campus and <b>purple,</b> <b>black</b> and gold for academic purposes including presentation ceremonies and graduation dress.|$|E

60|$|It {{filled him}} with a {{momentary}} pleasure to see a wry stick of <b>purple</b> <b>black</b> flash out into {{the form of a}} snake, and vanish amidst the brown. After all, the infernal valley WAS alive. And then, to rejoice him still more, came a little breath across his face, a whisper that came and went, the faintest inclination of a stiff black-antlered bush upon a little crest, the first intimations of a possible breeze. Idly he wetted his finger, and held it up.|$|E
60|$|In {{the forest}} itself the only common and {{conspicuous}} coleoptera were two tiger beetles. One, Therates labiata, was {{much larger than}} our green tiger beetle, of a <b>purple</b> <b>black</b> colour, with green metallic glosses, and the broad upper lip of a bright yellow. It was always found upon foliage, generally of broad-leaned herbaceous plants, and in damp and gloomy situations, taking frequent short flights from leaf to leaf, and preserving an alert attitude, as if always looking out for its prey. Its vicinity could be immediately ascertained, often before it was seen, by a very pleasant odour, like otto of roses, which it seems to emit continually, and which may probably be attractive to the small insects on which it feeds. The other, Tricondyla aptera, {{is one of the}} most curious forms in the family of the Cicindelidae, and is almost exclusively confined to the Malay islands. In shape it resembles a very large ant, more than an inch long, and of a <b>purple</b> <b>black</b> colour. Like an ant also it is wingless, and is generally found ascending trees, passing around the trunks in a spiral direction when approached, to avoid capture, so that it requires a sudden run and active fingers to secure a specimen. This species emits the usual fetid odour of the ground beetles. My collections during our four days' stay at Ke were as follow:--Birds, 13 species; insects, 194 species; and 3 kinds of land-shells.|$|E

60|$|Here {{he seemed}} to have caught sight of a woman's dress in the distance, which in the shade looked a <b>purple</b> <b>black.</b> He took off his hat, placed his hand upon his heart, and hurried towards her muttering and gesticulating feverishly. But William caught him by the sleeve and touched a flower with the tip of his {{walking-stick}} in order to divert the old man's attention. After looking at it for a moment in some confusion the old man bent his ear to it and seemed to answer a voice speaking from it, for he began talking about the forests of Uruguay which he had visited hundreds of years ago in company with the most beautiful young woman in Europe. He could be heard murmuring about forests of Uruguay blanketed with the wax petals of tropical roses, nightingales, sea beaches, mermaids, and women drowned at sea, as he suffered himself to be moved on by William, upon whose face the look of stoical patience grew slowly deeper and deeper.|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been after dinner, for he was sitting, duskily indistinct, against the light, with a voice coming out to him. The candles had not been brought in, and the view one saw through the big plate glass window behind him was very clear and splendid. Those little Wealden hills in Surrey and Sussex assume at times, for all that by Swiss {{standards}} they are the merest ridges of earth, the dignity and mystery of great mountains. Now, the crests of Hindhead and Blackdown, <b>purple</b> <b>black</b> against the level gold of the evening sky, might have been some high-flung boundary chain. Nearer there gathered banks and pools of luminous lavender-tinted mist out of which hills of pinewood rose like islands out of the sea. The intervening spaces were magnified to continental dimensions. And the closer lowlier things over which we looked, the cottages below us, were grey and black and dim, pierced by a few luminous orange windows and with a solitary street lamp shining like a star; the village might have been nestling a mountain's height below instead {{of a couple of}} hundred feet.|$|E
60|$|It is, however, {{when we come}} to true fruits (in {{a popular}} sense) that we find varied colours evidently {{intended}} to attract animals, in order that the fruits may be eaten, while the seeds pass through the body undigested and are then in the fittest state for germination. This end has been gained in a great variety of ways, and with so many corresponding adaptations as to leave no doubt as to the value of the result. Fruits are pulpy or juicy, and usually sweet, and form the favourite food of innumerable birds and some mammals. They are always coloured so as to contrast with the foliage or surroundings, red being the most common as it is certainly the most conspicuous colour, but yellow, <b>purple,</b> <b>black,</b> or white being not uncommon. The edible portion of fruits is developed from different parts of the floral envelopes, or of the ovary, in the various orders and genera. Sometimes the calyx becomes enlarged and fleshy, as in the apple and pear tribe; more often the integuments of the ovary itself are enlarged, as in the plum, peach, grape, etc.; the receptacle is enlarged and forms the fruit of the strawberry; while the mulberry, pineapple, and fig are examples of compound fruits formed in various ways from a dense mass of flowers.|$|E
