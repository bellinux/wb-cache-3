Two Zn fertilizer treatments were imposed across <b>previous</b> <b>cropping</b> treatments. A batch method for determining resin extractable soil Zn was established. Both plant Zn concentration and Zn uptake by beans in 1989 were signifi-cantly higher in Zn fertilized than unfertilized treatments regardless of previous crop; and higher in plots previously cropped with corn than beans or fallow, regardless of Zn treatment. DTPA and resin extractable soil Zn were significantly higher in Zn fertilized plots compared to unfertilized plots but did not differ between <b>previous</b> <b>cropping</b> treatments. Resin and DTPA extractable soil Zn con-centrations were positively correlated. Resin extracted soil Zn correlated better with plant Zn concentration and Zn uptake throughout the growing season than DTPA extracted soil Zn, particularly in plots that had been fallowed or previously cropped with corn.

Yield of double crop soybean production behind canola vs. wheat was also studied. 	The experiment was designed as a complete factorial with a split-split-split plot arrangement using 4 replications. Corn/soybean served as the main effect. Tillage was the sub-plot, and winter canola/wheat served as the sub-sub-plot. Two varieties each of canola and wheat were tested as sub-sub-sub plot. Fall stand, seed yield, and double crop soybean yield were measured for all plots. 	Interactions between either pair of canola or wheat varieties with <b>previous</b> <b>crop</b> or tillage system were not detected either season. Canola produced a higher yield after a <b>previous</b> <b>crop</b> of corn than after a <b>previous</b> <b>crop</b> of soybean in 2005 - 2006. In 2007 - 2008, the yield of canola after soybean was higher however this difference was not significant. No influence of <b>previous</b> <b>crop</b> on wheat yield was detected either season. 	 The influence of tillage on canola and wheat yield was inconsistent across seasons. Canola produced a higher yield under reduced till in 2007 - 2008, but not in 2005 - 2006. In 2005 - 2006, wheat produced a higher yield under no-till and a higher yield under reduced till in 2007 - 2008. In 2007 - 2008, a significant interaction between <b>previous</b> <b>crop</b> and tillage system was detected for both canola and wheat. Canola yield was significantly reduced by no-till after corn but not so by no-till after soybean. Wheat yield was significantly lower following corn no-till than following soybean no-till, however, {{there was no difference in}} wheat yield following corn or soybean under reduced till. 	The yield of double crop soybean did not differ following winter canola or winter wheat either season, however in 2005 - 2006, yield was higher following corn after either canola or wheat. The double crop soybean yield was 1, 421 hg/ha in 2005 - 2006 and was 3, 161 kg/ha in 2007 - 2008. 	The results herein indicate that canola and wheat can be profitably grown behind either corn or soybean and under either a reduced till or a no-till system. However, these results are inconclusive as to which combination of <b>previous</b> <b>crop</b> or tillage system should be recommended for either winter crop. It does appear that there is a greater concern establishing a canola stand under a no-till system. 	Canola provided greater gross revenue over that of wheat both seasons, even after considering the additional canola seed and nitrogen costs. When combined across seasons, canola had a mean yield of 3, 838 kg/ha and a mean revenue of $ 1, 236 /ha. Wheat had a mean yield of 5, 511 kg/ha and a mean revenue of $ 939 /ha.

The experiment was disposed in split-plot randomized complete block design with six replications. The main plot was three <b>previous</b> <b>crops</b> – black oat, hairy vetch and oilseed radish. The split plot had six nitrogen rates – zero, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 kg ha- 1. Based on the results, corn grown after black oat responds positively to nitrogen fertilization, with maximum grain yield with N rates of 205 kg ha- 1. After oilseed radish there is also a good response to nitrogen fertilization, however a lower rate could be used in order to get the maximum grain yield (175 kg ha- 1). Corn grown after hairy vetch under no-tillage has no response to nitrogen fertilization, though yield is higher than black oat/corn and oilseed radish/corn crop sequences, when nitrogen fertilization is not used...|$|R
40|$|Data on {{earthworm}} surface cast {{deposition in}} undisturbed, cropped and recovering sites from West and Central Africa were compiled {{to assess the}} effects of land use system (LUS) change and if casting {{can be used to}} indicate soil quality. Annual cast deposition in undisturbed systems was significantly higher on Alfisols (49, 000 kg ha 1) than on Ultisols (25, 000 kg ha 1). Vegetation clearance had significant detrimental effects on earthworm activity. With an increasing length of continuous cropping, cast deposition declined. In young fallows, cast production exceeded levels attained in previously un-cropped controls on Alfisols, yet, on Ultisols, it depended on the previous LUS and length of the <b>previous</b> <b>cropping</b> phase. Recovery was highest after agrisilviculture and after clearing bush fallow. After forest clearance, burning and one year cropping, cast deposition did not recover within three years. On Alfisols, cast production was higher under planted tree fallow and natural fallow than under herbaceous fallow. On Ultisols, fallow type had no effect. Earthworm surface cast production contributes to soil quality. However, its suitability as an indicator of soil quality is limited to rough assessments as it is dependent upon earthworm species composition, vegetation management and soil type, with more drastic changes on the poorer Ultisols than the morefertile Alfisols.

40|$|The {{quantity}} {{and patterns of}} net mineralization of soil nitrogen (N) were studied in Vertisols under different cropping systems in the semi-arid tropical areas. Eight cropping systems were selected; three contained pigeonpea (PP), one contained PP and cowpea (COP), and two contained chickpea (CP) as legume component crops, one included sequence cropping with nonlegumes during the rainy and postrainy seasons, and one system was kept fallow (F) {{during the rainy season}} and sown to sorghum (S) during the postrainy season. Cropping systems with PP as a component crop increased mineralizable N(N o) content two-fold in the soil compared with fallow + sorghum (F+S) –F+S system. The N mineralization rate constant (k) was not significantly affected by <b>previous</b> <b>cropping</b> history of the soil; however, a numerically higher rate constant was observed in the COP/PP intercrop, followed by sequential S+safflower (SF) system as compared to the other soils. Mineral N accumulation curves for six soils were more accurately described by the exponential model than the linear model. The active N fraction (N o /Ntot %) varied between 8 and 16 % for different systems and a direct relationship was observed between N o /Ntot and total N for the soils under diverse cropping systems...|$|E
40|$|Mycorrhizal {{associations}} {{contribute to}} the sustainability of crop production systems through their roles in nutrient cycling and other benefits in the soil-plant ecosystems. A two-year study {{was conducted on the}} Alfisols of Lilongwe and Dowa districts, Central Malawi, to assess the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungal colonisation levels in pigeon pea, cowpea, and maize grown in sole cropping, legume-cereal, and legume-legume intercropping systems and in the maize grown in short rotation (year 2) as influenced by the <b>previous</b> <b>cropping</b> systems and N fertilizer application. The gridline intersect method was used to assess the VAM fungal colonisation levels. Results showed that all treatments that included legumes whether grown as sole crop, in legume-cereal or in legume-legume cropping systems in the previous year, had significantly higher (P < 0. 05) VAM fungal colonisation of the rotational maize crop roots by a range 39 % to 50 % and 19 % to 47 % than those in maize supplied and not supplied with N fertilizer, respectively, in a maize-maize short rotation, at the Lilongwe site. A similar trend was reported for the Dowa site. Furthermore, there were positive correlations between VAM fungal colonisation and the plant P content, dry matter yield, and nodule numbers. Further studies may help to assess the diversity of VAM fungal species in Malawi soils and identify more adaptive ones for inoculation studies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{experiment}} was conducted during 1996 - 1998 on a Dothan sandy loam (fine, loamy siliceous, thermic Plinthic Kandiudults) at the North Florida Research and Education Center, Quincy, FL. The objectives {{of this study}} were to determine optimum N rates for cotton, the impact of fallow, small grain and legume as winter covers on N requirements of cotton, and to compare N requirements in strip tilled cotton with conventional plantings. The lint cotton yields were significantly different between years and were influenced by <b>previous</b> <b>crop,</b> N rates, and the interaction of tillage and <b>previous</b> <b>crops.</b> Significantly lower yields were obtained in 1998 due to hard-locks. Higher yields of cotton were obtained after crimson clover than wheat or fallow. There was a significant positive response to N between 0 and 60 lb N/acre and between 60 and 120 lb N/acre but no respons...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we use the maximum overlap {{discrete}} packet transform (MODWPT) to investigate residual effects on wheat biomass of fertigation treatments applied to a <b>previous</b> <b>crop.</b> The wheat crop covered nine subplots from a previous experiment on melon response to fertigation. Each subplot had previously received a different level of applied nitrogen. Many factors affect wheat biomass, causing it to vary at different spatial frequencies. We hypothesize that these will include residual effects from fertilizer application (at relatively low spatial frequencies) and the local influence of individual plants from the <b>previous</b> melon <b>crop</b> (at high frequency). To test this hypothesis we use the MODWPT to identify the dominant spatial frequencies of wheat biomass variation, and analyse the relationship to both the previous fertilizer application {{and the location of}} individual melon plants in the <b>previous</b> <b>crop.</b> The MODWPT is particularly appropriate for this because it allows us first to identify the key spatial frequencies in the wheat biomass objectively and to analyse them, and their relationship to hypothesized driving factors without any assumptions of uniformity (stationarity) of wheat-biomass variation. The results showed that the applied nitrogen dominated the wheat biomass response, and that there was a noticeable component of wheat-biomass variation at the spatial frequency that corresponds to the melon cropping. We expected wheat biomass to be negatively correlated with the position of melons in the <b>previous</b> <b>crop,</b> due to uptake of the applied nitrogen. The MODWPT, which allows us to detect changes in correlation between variables at different frequencies, showed that such a relationship was found across part of the experiment but not uniformly...|$|R
