5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{is found}} in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing Nyjer thistle seed, or by planting grasses and <b>perennial</b> <b>plants,</b> such as zinnias, cosmos, bee balm, or globe thistle, which produce seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding (see bird feeder for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species.|$|E
5|$|His most {{significant}} influence was {{the introduction of}} the idea of wild gardening, which first appeared in The Wild Garden and was further developed in The English Flower Garden. The idea of introducing large drifts of native hardy <b>perennial</b> <b>plants</b> into meadow, woodand, and waterside is taken for granted today, but was revolutionary in Robinson's time. In the first edition, he happily used any plant that could be naturalised, including half-hardy perennials and natives {{from other parts of the}} world—thus Robinson's wild garden was not limited to locally native species. Robinson's own garden at Gravetye was planted on a large scale, but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards, where the 'garden' is designed to appear to merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow. Robinson's ideas continue to influence gardeners and landscape architects today—from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells are {{a species}} of {{deciduous}} woodland over much of their range, flowering and leafing early before the canopy closes in late spring. They may also be found growing under bracken or Japanese knotweed, <b>perennial</b> <b>plants</b> which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as Mercurialis perennis. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through {{a thick layer of}} leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a host species for the parasitic fungus Uromyces muscari, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of H.non-scripta to take up phosphorus from the soil is greatly enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.|$|E

5000|$|One of the plant's {{cultivar}}s {{is named}} Husker Red {{because of its}} red foliage that has white or bluish-pink flowers. The <b>Perennial</b> <b>Plant</b> Association chose the Husker Red cultivar of Penstemon digitalis as the 1996 <b>Perennial</b> <b>Plant</b> of the Year. The {{author of the book}} Perennial All-Stars described Husker Red as [...] "a stunning flowering perennial" [...] and that [...] "you can easily see why the <b>Perennial</b> <b>Plant</b> Association chose this perennial above all others". Husker Red was named after the Nebraska Cornhuskers. The other cultivar, Mystica, is green at first and then later changes to red in the fall.|$|R

25|$|Irises are <b>perennial</b> <b>plants,</b> {{growing from}} {{creeping}} rhizomes (rhizomatous irises) or, in drier climates, from bulbs (bulbous irises). They have long, erect flowering stems {{which may be}} simple or branched, solid or hollow, and flattened or have a circular cross-section. The rhizomatous species usually have 3–10 basal sword-shaped leaves growing in dense clumps. The bulbous species have cylindrical, basal leaves.|$|E
25|$|Ageing or aging (see {{spelling}} differences) is {{the process}} of becoming older. The term refers especially to human beings, many animals, and fungi, whereas for example bacteria, <b>perennial</b> <b>plants</b> and some simple animals are potentially immortal. In the broader sense, ageing can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing (cellular senescence) or to the population of a species (population ageing).|$|E
25|$|Reduced {{nutrient}} {{delivery to}} downstream farms. Wide replacement of annual with <b>perennial</b> <b>plants</b> on agricultural landscapes could stabilize soils and reduce nitrate leaching {{to the point}} that the delivery of sediment and dissolved nitrogen to downstream landscapes could be reduced. Farmers in these areas may currently rely on these nutrient inputs. On the other hand, other water usage sectors might benefit from improved water quality.|$|E

25|$|Sarracenia are {{herbaceous}} <b>perennial</b> <b>plants</b> {{that grow}} from a subterranean rhizome, with many tubular pitcher-shaped leaves radiating {{out from the}} growing point, and then turning upwards with their trap openings facing {{the center of the}} crown. The trap is a vertical tube with a 'hood' (the operculum) extending over its entrance; and below it the top of the tube usually has a rolled lip (the peristome) which secretes nectar and scents. The hood itself frequently produces nectar too, but in lesser quantities.|$|E
25|$|O. longistaminataas donor of perenniality traits. This African {{species is}} genetically diverse, {{strongly}} perennial and rhizomatous. Rhizomes {{may be able}} to survive and spread in drier conditions than stolons. The downside of this donor is that it is more distantly related to cultivated rice and the crosses and backcrosses are much more difficult to make. Descendents of the few successful crosses are mostly infertile, and few were perennial. Interestingly, many of the <b>perennial</b> <b>plants</b> lacked rhizomes. Rhizomes may not be essential for survival, but they may help plants survive stress and they certainly help them spread.|$|E
25|$|Biannual and <b>perennial</b> <b>plants</b> {{produce a}} stout taproot {{of up to}} 8cm in {{diameter}} and 60cm long. Young plants consist of a rosette of leaves, which may be variegated, once-pinnately spiny-lobed, to 30cm long, and having short, fleshy stalks. The stems can be simple or carry many branches, and carry spiny wings along their lengths. The wavy leaves with prominent veins are pinnately divided and are alternately set along the stems. The leaf margin has prominent pale green or yellow veins and large teeth which are topped by fierce spines. The leaf surface may initially be covered in soft, felty hairs, which quickly clear away, most slowly on the veins.|$|E

50|$|Meconopsis bella is a deciduous, <b>perennial</b> <b>plant</b> {{that grows}} in rock crevices and grass cliff edges. As a <b>perennial</b> <b>plant,</b> it lives {{for over two}} years. It dies in autumn and winter to a resting bud and then emerges again {{in the spring and}} summer. As a <b>perennial</b> {{flowering}} <b>plant,</b> it grows from the root-stalk as opposed to from a seed. This pretty blue poppy thrives in poor, drained soil, and on a cool, half shaded raised bed.|$|R
25|$|In agriculture, {{many farmers}} could use less fertilizer, and the {{reductions}} in crop yields would be small or nonexistent. Runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corn’s roots penetrate {{only the top}} few inches of soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year. In addition, nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant winter cover crops, such as rye or wheat, which can help the soil hold nitrogen. These crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils, mitigating climate change. Better yet is to grow <b>perennial</b> <b>plants</b> such as grasses rather than corn; nitrogen losses are many times lower. Nitrogen pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is a huge problem.|$|E
25|$|Tropaeolum is a genus of {{dicotyledonous}} annual or <b>perennial</b> <b>plants,</b> {{often with}} somewhat succulent stems and sometimes tuberous roots. The alternate leaves are hairless, peltate and entire or palmately lobed. The petioles or leaf stalks {{are long and}} in many species are able to twine round other stems to provide support. The flowers are bisexual and showy, set singly on long stalks in the axils of the leaves. They have five sepals, the uppermost of which is elongated into a nectar spur. The five petals are clawed, with the lower three unlike the upper two. The eight stamens are in two whorls of unequal length and the superior ovary has three segments and three stigmas on a single style. The fruit is naked and nut-like, with three single seed segments.|$|E
25|$|Facilitation may act by {{reducing}} the negative impacts of a stressful environment. As described above, nurse plants facilitate seed germination and survival by alleviating stressful environmental conditions. A similar interaction occurs between the red alga Chondrus crispus and the canopy-forming seaweed Fucus in intertidal sites of southern New England, USA. The alga survives higher in the intertidal zone—where temperature and desiccation stresses are greater—only when the seaweed is present because the canopy of the seaweed offers protection from those stresses. The previous examples describe facilitation of individuals or of single species, {{but there are also}} instances of a single facilitator species mediating some community-wide stress, such as disturbance. An example of such “whole-community” facilitation is substrate stabilization of cobble beach plant communities in Rhode Island, USA, by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Large beds of cordgrass buffer wave action, thus allowing the establishment and persistence of a community of less disturbance-tolerant annual and <b>perennial</b> <b>plants</b> below the high-water mark.|$|E
