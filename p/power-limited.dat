50|$|A {{multi-frequency}} time-division {{multiple access}} (MF-TDMA) {{system has been}} developed for a thin route satellite communication network, which has most of the desirable features of both FDMA and time-division multiple access (TDMA) systems. It is shown that when the network downlink is <b>power-limited</b> (with negligible uplink noise) and consists of mixed Earth station sizes with different rain margin requirements, the MF-TDMA and FDMA systems can have greater throughput capacity compared to TDMA. This improvement depends {{on the amount of}} satellite transponder backoff required to keep the intermodulation effects small, and {{is the result of the}} TDMA downlink having been sized for the smallest station and largest rain margin. In the case where the Earth station must provide circuits to more than one station simultaneously, MF-TDMA is advantageous over FDMA because fewer modems are required. Use of MFTDMA can lead to lower Earth station costs by requiring lower transmitter power compared to TDMA and fewer modems compared to FDMA. Even though the control algorithm for a MFTDMA network is somewhat more complicated, a high degree of flexibility in channel assignment is retained.|$|E

30|$|Now {{consider}} an oligopolistic buyer. Our model structure—one farmer and one buyer who holds all bargaining <b>power—limits</b> the strategic considerations {{that can come}} into play. First, in contrast to Von Schlippenbach and Teichmann (2012), the farmer {{does not have the}} opportunity to increase his reservation utility by contracting with a different buyer. Second, unlike in Helper and Levine (1992), there is no scope for the farmer to negotiate a share of the buyer’s rents from the output market. Third, in contrast to Krattenmaker and Salop (1986), our buyer does not have the opportunity to increase her input purchases and output sales by contracting with additional farmers. This eliminates another motivation—raising competitors’ costs —for contracting in an oligopoly. Once again, quantity is the only strategic variable available to the buyer in the context of our model structure, and the presence of market power will affect contract menu design only through its effect on this variable. Thus, the insights of the analysis can be applied to questions regarding agricultural contracts even in markets where buyers have market power.|$|R

In a transmission experiment we have observed strong power limiting at wavelengths longer than the absorption edge at 7. 5 mum associated with induced free carrier absorption produced by direct interband two-photon transitions in InSb. We have estimated the two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient (b) of InSb at 8. 9 mum to be 2 cm/MW, by fitting the <b>power-limiting</b> effect with a simple theoretical model.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the mode of {{decision}} making within federal sub-units affects the organizational patterns of intergovernmental relations (IGR) through which regional actors engage in cross-jurisdictional co-operation. In a nutshell, majoritarian executive-legislative relations tend to weaken the institutionalization of intergovernmental arrangements (IGAs), while power-sharing executive-legislative relations tend to facilitate it. This is, first, because one-party majority cabinets tend to increase ideological differences between the sub-units. Secondly, complete government alternations—which are less likely given coalition or oversized governments—strongly alter actors' interest constellations over time, thereby increasing the costs of maintaining stable intergovernmental structures. Thirdly, the heavy impact of a potential electoral loss induces politicians to shift the blame to the other governments, thereby undermining the potential for cross-boundary co-operation. Finally, autonomy losses caused by intergovernmental co-operation are higher for parties which govern alone when compared to coalition governments. Based on a typology of <b>power-limiting</b> democracies, which distinguishes federal systems along their respective executive-legislative relations, Spain and Switzerland are selected as cases. The analysis indicates that the much more power-concentrating executive-legislative relations within the Spanish regions and the power-sharing executive-legislative relations within the Swiss cantons help to explain why Spanish regional actors resort to ad hoc co-ordination within a weakly institutionalized environment instead of establishing strong IGAs as the Swiss regional actor...|$|R

In the first method, the average solution provides estimates of the initial adjoint variables; in the second, it provides approximations of the optimal controls in feedback form. Both trajectory variables and orbit elements are used in developing these methods. Canonical transformations are derived to convert between these sets of coordinates. The accuracy of the methods for computing coplanar, minimum-fuel, <b>power-limited</b> transfers is assessed {{for a variety of}} initial and final orbits.

5000|$|Transmortals are a {{group of}} beings {{appearing}} in N.D. Wilson's Ashtown Burials series. A transmortal is simply an ordinary mortal who somehow becomes immortal. Thus they have transformed from mortal, to immortal. There is no common way to become a transmortal. Some have eaten of the Fruit of Life, or drank of the Fountain of Youth. Others become immortal by possessing a powerful object, such as the Odyssian Cloak, or Dragon's Tooth. It is also a result of some blessing or curse. Wilson commonly chooses semi-famous people from history and mythology to give this transmortality to. In the first book of the Ashtown Burials, The Dragon's Tooth, Maximilian Robespierre, {{the leader of the}} French Revolution, is revealed to be a transmortal. In later books, legendary people like Gilgamesh of Uruk, Arachne, and Captain John Smith are introduced, all being known in the real world, and given transmortality by Wilson.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of deterministically engineered, three-dimensional architectures {{to be used as}} high-performance electrodes in energy storage applications. These high-surface-area architectures are created by the robotically-assisted sequential electrodeposition of structural and sacrificial layers in an alternating fashion, followed by the removal of the sacrificial layers. The primary goal of this study is the incorporation of these highly laminated architectures into the battery electrodes to improve their power density without compromising their energy density. MEMS technologies, as well as electrochemical techniques, are utilized for the realization of these high-power electrodes with precisely controlled characteristic dimensions. Diffusion-limited models are adopted for the determination of the optimum characteristic dimensions of the electrodes, including the surface area, the thickness of the active material film, and the distance between the adjacent layers of the multilayer structure. The contribution of the resultant structures to the power performance is first demonstrated by a proof-of-concept Zn-air microbattery which is based on a multilayer Ni backbone coated with a conformal Zn film serving as the anode. This primary battery system demonstrates superior performance to its thin-film counterpart in terms of the energy density at high discharge rates. Another demonstration involves secondary battery chemistries, including Ni(OH) 2 and Li-ion systems, both of which exhibit significant cycling stability and remarkable power capability by delivering more than 50 % of their capacities after ultra-fast charge rates of 60 C. Areal capacities as high as 5. 1 mAh cm- 2 are reported. This multilayer fabrication approach is also proven successful for realizing high-performance electrochemical capacitors. Ni(OH) 2 -based electrochemical capacitors feature a relatively high areal capacitance of 1319 mF cm- 2 and an outstanding cycling stability with a 94 % capacity retention after more than 1000 cycles. The improved power performance of the electrodes is realized by the simultaneous minimization of the internal resistances encountered during the transport of the ionic and electronic species at high charge and discharge rates. The high surface area provided by the highly laminated backbone structures enables an increased number of active sites for the redox reactions. The formation of a thin and conformal active material film on this high surface area structure renders a reduced ionic diffusion and electronic conduction path length, mitigating the <b>power-limiting</b> effect of the active materials with low conductivities. Also, the highly conductive backbone serving as a mechanically stable and electrochemically inert current collector features minimized transport resistance for the electrons. Finally, the highly scalable nature of the multilayer structures enables the realization of high-performance electrodes {{for a wide range of}} applications from autonomous microsystems to macroscale portable electronic devices.

40|$|The opening {{phrase of}} the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution provides, 2 ̆ 2 Congress shall make no law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, or prohibiting {{the free exercise}} thereof. 2 ̆ 2 The free exercise clause functions as an individual right with its purpose being to forestall personal religious harm. Its underlying principle is that in religious matters a person ought {{to be free of}} coercion caused by the government and thereby not made to suffer for cause of conscience. The function of the establishment clause is altogether different, for its purpose is to restrain government from using its powers to act on matters properly in the realm of religion. The resulting division between church and state impliedly acknowledges that the state is limited in its powers and that the churches retain sufficient breathing space to perform their work in society. The principle underlying this autonomy of the churches is voluntarism, with it consequence that inherently religious matters are {{under the auspices of the}} churches and not the state. This proper ordering of the respective competencies of state and church is best for the body politic because it avoids increasing factionalism along religious lines while reinforcing the idea of limited government, and it is best for the churches because it avoids corrupting religion. In addition to differentiating the two religion clauses, this shift to a structuralist establishment clause explains several longstanding puzzles about the clause: (1) Why the Supreme Court has carved out a special standing exception for federal taxpayers applicable only when asserting claims under the establishment clause; (2) Why the remedy (class-wide injunctive relief) in establishment clause cases is aimed more to negate the power of government rather than affording just victim-specific relief for the actual complainants; (3) Why establishment clause cases touching on religious doctrinal disputes lead to dismissals for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction when there is nothing in Article III of the Constitution that limits the power of the federal judiciary over such cases or controversies; (4) Why viewing the establishment clause as structuralist makes sense of the 2 ̆ 2 two-definitions-of-religion 2 ̆ 2 enigma, notwithstanding that 2 ̆ 2 religion 2 ̆ 2 appears only once grammatically governing both clauses; (5) Why the Court has struck down aid to religious schools reciting as one of its reasons that government aid would be harmful to the schools, while the religious schools themselves actively seek the aid and insist that they have waived any supposed constitutional safeguards to their religious integrity; and (6) Why the supposed 2 ̆ 2 tensions 2 ̆ 2 between the free exercise and establishment clauses ? as if the founders drafted an amendment that is internally contradictory ? go away when no-establishment is viewed as a <b>power-limiting</b> clause and free exercise as a rights-based clause...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} the power {{transmission}} with normal-conducting low-temperature cables, especially the economic aspects, are {{worked out in}} detail. As useful cost-comparisons can only be done on optimised systems, studies on system-optimisation are most important. Calculations on the optimal temperature of the cryocable give the result, {{that there is a}} minimum of the costs of power loss (incl. investment-costs of the pefrigerators) around 25 K, but the complication of the conductors caused by the necessity of reducing skinand proximity-effect resul t in a displacement and nearly total elimination of the optimum. The costs of current-transportcannot be effectively lowered by deep cooling. The optimistic cost data of cryocables reported in the literature may be explained by the following arguments: - insulation of high-voltage can be done easier at low temperatures and allows a simpler design of the cable. - the <b>power-limit</b> of cryocables is much higher comparedwith conventional cables, thus the degression of specific cost typical for all types of cables can be utilizied. Some further criterions may be added which are not analysed concerning the costs in detail, for example low with of the cable trench related to the power rating, good overload capability, adaption to the growing load with low costs by extension of the cooling-stations (this argument applies especially to the liquid nitrogen ($LN_{ 2 }$) -cable). As cooling with liquid hydrogen gives no substantial cost advantages, only the $LN_{ 2 }$-cable is treated further on because this will be an easier and more reliable system. Two typical and especially promising concepts are investigated in detail - a single conductor tube-cable, which is electrically and thermally insulated by vacuurn - a three-conductor cable with litz-type conductors which is insulated electrically by wrapped paper impregnated with $LN_{ 2 }$ and thermally by superinsulation under vacuum. The investment-costs and capitalized running costs related to the length and the transmitted power of the optimized systems are calculated at a nominal voltage of 110 kV and shown in dependence of power and length. Cable and cooling station can be devided in parallel independent units to increase the reliability of the system. The oncost of this provision is determined. By the following investigations on further details the results are refined and especially some unsafe points are examined more closely. As conclusion an economic comparison is done between the investigated types of a cryocable and an advanced normal-temperature-cable, that is an artificially cooled $SF_{ 6 }$-cable. As this is done on a uniform basis, the result will surely have a high reliability. The comparison shows, that the $LN_{ 2 }$-vacuum-tubecable is not competitive with the advanced $SF_{ 6 }$-tube-cable within the whole region of power investigated. The $LN_{ 2 }$-litz-conductor-cable on the other hand is able to cornpete when power and length are high. This is especially true, if it can be shown that the estimation of the frabrication costs of the conductor has been too pessimistic. Therefore experimental research on losses and fabrication problems of litz-conductors with high cross-sections are very important. The results of such investigations will be decisive on the good chances of a cryocable development...|$|R
