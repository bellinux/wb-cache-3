The fabrication method involves depositing {{first and second}} <b>pluralities</b> <b>of</b> electrodes comprising nanowires using processes such as lithography, deposition of metals, lift-off processes, and chemical etching that can be performed using conventional processing tools applicable to electronic materials processing.

40|$|Abstract of the volume: The aim of {{this volume}} is to explore novel ways <b>of</b> {{thinking}} about <b>plurality</b> while casting {{new light on the}} interconnections between its logical, philosophical and linguistic ramifications. This volume brings together new work on the logic and ontology <b>of</b> <b>plurality</b> and a range of recent articles exploring novel applications to natural language semantics. The contributions in this volume in particular investigate and extend new perspectives presented by plural logic and non-standard mereology and explore their applications to a range of natural language phenomena. Pluralities in logic We talk about individuals and <b>pluralities</b> <b>of</b> individuals. In an interpreted formal language of first-order logic, first-order variables range over a given domain of individuals, the domain of discourse This is what the formal language is about, and hence, first order logic is about individuals. The question then is, what should the logic be for <b>pluralities</b> <b>of</b> individuals? One answer is that a formal language may also contain second-order variables...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{presents}} and analyzes an exhibition on Laws Pluralities.  The exhibition {{was an integral}} part of the academic conference Laws Pluralities: Cultures/Narratives/Images/Genders that was held at the University of Giessen in 2015. It explains relevant curatorial decisions and discusses contemporary artistic positions involved in dealing with the <b>pluralities</b> <b>of</b> law and legal cultures. Further, the essay examines strategies for visualizing, interrogating, and subverting the law and legal practices. Some of the artworks documented in the exhibition challenge the increasing use of surveillance practices in public spaces and question the legal framework of these practices. These works make use of privacy legislation to open up surveillance systems otherwise closed circuits to the public. Alternatively, they question their authority by reclaiming spaces under surveillance as stages for performative interventions. Still other works focus on the concrete, written nature of law, and propose alternative visualizations and readings of legal texts and symbols. The essay argues that artistic works represent powerful means for uncovering the <b>pluralities</b> <b>of</b> law as cultural constructions...|$|R

The ontological credentials of an arithmos are exactly those of its constituent units. It is not however the task of the mathematician to investigate or speculate whether things falling into a species - such as clouds in the sky, shades of red, human emotional states, men of the 22nd century - are sufficiently clearly individuated to constitute units of possible arithmoi or whether the boundaries <b>of</b> <b>pluralities</b> <b>of</b> things - e.g. should we count centaurs and mermaids as falling into the species “human kind”? is it exactly determined when shades of red end and shades of purple begin ? - are sufficiently clearly delineated as to constitute an arithmos.

5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda).

Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more.|$|E
