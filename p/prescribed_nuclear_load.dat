40|$|The 3 D Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) {{steady state}} {{analysis}} of the regular sector # 5 of the ITER vacuum vessel (VV) is presented in these two companion papers using the commercial software ANSYS-FLUENT®. The pure hydraulic analysis, concentrating on flow field and pressure drop, is presented in Part I. This Part II focuses on the thermal-hydraulic {{analysis of the}} effects of the <b>nuclear</b> heat <b>load.</b> Being the VV classified as safety important component, an accurate thermal-hydraulic analysis is mandatory to assess the capability of the water coolant to adequately remove the <b>nuclear</b> heat <b>load</b> on the VV. Based on the recent re-evaluation of the <b>nuclear</b> heat <b>load,</b> the steady state conjugate heat transfer problem is solved in both the solid and fluid domains. Hot spots turn out to be located on the surface of the inter-modular keys and blanket support housings, with the computed peak temperature in the sector reaching ∼ 290 C. The computed temperature of the wetted surfaces is well below the coolant saturation temperature and the temperature increase of the water coolant at the outlet of the sector is of only a few C. In the high <b>nuclear</b> heat <b>load</b> regions the computed heat transfer coefficient typically stays above the 500 W/m 2 K targe...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this computational engineering design study is to assess whether the ITER confined plasma will be adversely affected if the first wall {{at the top of}} the plasma chamber is armoured with tungsten instead of beryllium. The OSM–EIRENE code package is employed to calculate 2 D steady-state hydrogenic background plasma solutions, after benchmarking against reference SOLPS simulations. The DIVIMP code is used to determine the impurity distributions. In order to sample a large area of the foreseen ITER parameter space, a range of boundary plasmas are assigned based on the ITER Heat and <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Load</b> Specifications.

40|$|The {{complementary}} {{features of}} low-carbon power sources are {{a central issue}} in designing energy transition policies. The French current electricity mix is characterised by a high share of nuclear power which equalled 73 % of the total electric production in 2013. With the increase of non-dispatchable renewable resources, nuclear flexibility is examined {{as part of the}} solution to balance electricity supply and demand. Our proposed methodology involves designing scenarios of nuclear and non-dispatchable renewable penetration levels, and developing residual load duration curves in each case. The load modulation impact on the nuclear production cost is estimated. This article shows to which extent the nuclear annual energy production will decrease with high shares of non-dispatchable renewables (down to load factors of 40 % for proactive assumptions). However, the production cost increase could be compensated by implementing a progressive replacement of the plants. Besides, incentives proves required for nuclear to compete with combined cycle gas turbines as its alternative backup option. In order to make the social planner and plant operator goals coincide, the solution could be to find new outlets rather than reducing <b>nuclear</b> <b>load</b> factors. To conclude, nuclear flexibility could then be considered through the power use by producing heat or hydrogen...|$|R

Nuclear {{energy generation}} in Turkey has sparked debates on its relevance and necessity for energy security policy. As a developing country, Turkey chose nuclear energy to address both to sustainability and development needs. The decision is challenged {{on the basis}} of “threats” to life, environment and security. The arguments and prescriptions of the contending sides render two meanings for nuclear energy: “asset” and “threat. ” This dissertation looks into the construction of these two meanings that <b>prescribe</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy either as the appropriate policy choice or an imminent threat to human life and environment. The respective arguments are shaped by the international norms on nuclear nonproliferation, environmentalism and antinuclearism. This study analyzes the contending discourses in order to find how the opposing meanings of nuclear energy are produced and sustained. It finds that the former meaning and policy prescription is formed with reference to the Realist conception of state power and security. It is Critical Theory, Marxism and Green Political Theory which account for the second meaning of nuclear energy. The “conflict” is not only at the practical but also at the theoretical level. The dissertation argues that this conflict can be addressed through a critical engagement of the parties concerned. It seeks to find common grounds on which the parties can talk. The analysis of the discourses reveals these common grounds where the two sides can find points of reconciliation and formulate a sound energy security policyUdum, ŞebnemPh. D...|$|R

40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) cell loading/unloading curves {{were used}} to provide comprehensive insights into biomechanical behavior of cardiomyocytes carrying the lamin A/C (LMNA) D 192 G mutation known to cause defective nuclear wall, myopathy and severe cardiomyopathy. Our results suggested that the LMNA D 192 G mutation increased maximum <b>nuclear</b> deformation <b>load,</b> <b>nuclear</b> stiffness and fragility as compared to controls. Furthermore, {{there seems to be}} a connection between this lamin nuclear mutation and cell adhesion behavior since LMNA D 192 G cardiomyocytes displayed loss of AFM probe-to-cell membrane adhesion. We believe that this loss of adhesion involves the cytoskeletal architecture since our microscopic analyses highlighted that mutant LMNA may also lead to a morphological alteration in the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, chemical disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D in control cardiomyocytes mirrored the alterations in the mechanical properties seen in mutant cells, suggesting a defect in the connection between the nucleoskeleton, cytoskeleton and cell adhesion molecules in cells expressing the mutant protein. These data add to our understanding of potential mechanisms responsible for this fatal cardiomyopathy, and show that the biomechanical effects of mutant lamin extend beyond nuclear mechanics to include interference of whole-cell biomechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|Demonstrating the {{production}} of net electricity and operating with a closed fuel-cycle remain unarguably the crucial steps towards the exploitation of fusion power. These are the aims of a demonstration fusion reactor (DEMO) proposed to be built after ITER. This paper briefly describes the DEMO design options that are being considered in Europe for the current conceptual design studies {{as part of the}} Roadmap to Fusion Electricity Horizon 2020. These are not intended to represent fixed and exclusive design choices but rather 'proxies' of possible plant design options to be used to identify generic design/material issues that need to be resolved in future fusion reactor systems. The materials nuclear design requirements and the effects of radiation damage are briefly analysed with emphasis on a pulsed 'low extrapolation' system, which is being used for the initial design integration studies, based as far as possible on mature technologies and reliable regimes of operation (to be extrapolated from the ITER experience), and on the use of materials suitable for the expected level of neutron fluence. The main technical issues arising from the plasma and <b>nuclear</b> <b>loads</b> and the effects of radiation damage particularly on the structural and heat sink materials of the vessel and in-vessel components are critically discussed. The need to establish realistic target performance and a development schedule for near-term electricity production tends to favour more conservative technology choices. The readiness of the technical (physics and technology) assumptions that are being made is expected to be an important factor for the selection of the technical features of the device...|$|R

Others run on highly enriched uranium, varying from 20% 235U, to the over 96% 235U found in U.S. submarines, in which the resulting smaller core is quieter in operation (a big advantage to a submarine).

Thermal conductivity in <b>loaded</b> <b>nuclear</b> waste form is an important property specific to scientific researchers, in waste form Integrated performance and safety code (IPSC). The effective thermal conductivity obtained from microstructure information and local thermal conductivity of different components is critical in predicting the life and performance of waste form during storage.

Several methods, including the Taylor model, Sachs model, self-consistent model, and statistical upscaling models were developed and implemented. Due to the absence of experimental data, prediction results from finite element method (FEM) were used as reference to determine the accuracy of different upscaling models. Micrographs from different <b>loading</b> of <b>nuclear</b> waste were used in the prediction of thermal conductivity. Prediction results demonstrated that in term of efficiency, boundary models (Taylor and Sachs model) are better than self consistent model, statistical upscaling method and FEM.
