Next to this primary task of packaging, consumers demand more and better information about products that they buy and today packaging is responsible for marketing tasks, too. In addition to better technical solutions, a trend can be seen toward the increased importance of environmental protection in manufacturing of packaging and distributing products. As adhesives {{play a major role in}} the production of nearly all goods and especially in the production of packaging, the question of how adhesive applications influence the idea of a closed-loop economy is becoming more and more important.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a review of}} the attitude of the scientific community towards reliability in electronic packages, with emphasis on the prevailing mechanisms for package failure under highly stressed environmental conditioning. Once this failure mechanism is fully developed, approaches to the resolution can be more rigorously applied. Overall, the predominant evidence points to moisture, both diffusivity and equilibrium weight gain, as the key factor in reduced reliability performance. Other fundamental polymer properties are important, but generally, methods are well established for adjusting these parameters. Moisture uptake is somewhat inherent to a particular chemistry type and this can direct the use of resin systems that are more suited to particularly moist environments. Epoxy resin systems, while pervasive in the electronics industry, do have limitations under humid environmental test conditions. Cyanate ester resin chemistry is claimed to have low moisture uptake by virtue of a non-hydrophilic cure mechanism. However, certain aspects of the cure chemistry and side reactions with water can result in misleading predictions on humid environment performance. Siloxane-based materials present an attractive solution to many moisture related issues. Traditional condensation and addition cure silicone systems have, thus, found widespread use as <b>packaging</b> <b>adhesives</b> and encapsulants. Siloxane-functional polyimides have also been successfully utilized in a number of application areas.

This project aims to develop a pH biosensor based on pH responsive hydrogels a piezoresistive pressure sensor capable of monitoring ambient pH as a signature of the physiological health status of a cell culture (in vitro), tissue or organ (in vivo). The hydrogel 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate-o-acrylic acid (HEMA-co-AA) was chosen to be incorporated into a cavity of a piezoresistive pressure sensor. The hydrogel was synthesized and investigated separately within the fabricated SU 8 photoresist cavity where hydrogel can only expand or shrink in one direction. When immersing the hydrogel into the pH buﬀers, the percentage of volume change of the hydrogel was determined indirectly by a proﬁlometer. The hydrogel samples with thickness from 77 - 110 µm performed the expansion degree of 55 - 77 % at low pH 2 - 4 and of 130 - 195 % at higher pH 5 - 11. Both the equilibrium time and the maximum expansion of hydrogel samples were inﬂuenced by their thickness. Practical experiments also showed {{that there is a}} hysteresis of the hydrogel response which can be accounted for a delay of the protonation to deprotonation mechanism. Results indicated that the hydrogel sample after hydration should be stored in suitable pH buﬀer. The design of the front-end hydrogel sensor electronics and packaging procedure was made.

New water-borne adhesives make it possible to convert laminates immediately after laminate production and enable food packaging within a very short time period.

40|$|Interactions between {{drugs and}} primary {{packaging}} especially {{play an important}} role, where a health risk of patients by toxicologically unsafe substances is possible. With increasing use of plastic materials as primary packaging for liquid pharmaceuticals the legal requirements have risen sharply. Increasing regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical packaging materials also lead to higher requirements for <b>packaging</b> <b>adhesives.</b> The use of permeable plastic packaging {{increases the risk of}} label adhesives migrating into the liquid medicine. The aim of this work was to conduct an extensive study on permeation of polyacrylate based label adhesives through various plastic materials. Main focus was on the detection of permeated toxicologically questionable (meth) acrylates and their hydrolytic compounds. Many parameters that influence the permeation process should be investigated. To assess the levels of migration the compound specific values as well as global migration limits according to the Bedarfsgegenständeverordnung (BedGgstV) have been taken into account. Some preliminary investigations have been done before starting the study: A Pyrolysis-GC/MS method helped to verify the adhesives according to the specification of the manufacturer. Furthermore, the formation of the characteristic thermal degradation products of poly(meth) acrylates could be observed. During the study their risk of permeation could also be evaluated. Thermogravimetry/MS method have been used in the hardened adhesive to detect so-called residual monomers, which remain due to incomplete polymerization. For the trace analysis of migrated (meth) acrylates and their hydrolytic compounds in aqueous solution, two chromatographic methods have been developed. While for the majority of compounds a headspace-GC/FID method was proven successful for polar monomers such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid a HPLC method has been established. Both methods proved to be valid and robust enough {{to be used in the}} routine analysis of the comprehensive study. In preparation for the migration study an extraction profile of every used adhesive has been created by aqueous extraction and subsequent chromatographic analysis. The migration study revealed the following findings: •	Migration levels in all commercial labels of all adhesive plastic material combinations have been below the global migration threshold of 60 mg/kg stated in the consumer products regulation Bedarfsgegenständeverordnung (BedGgstV). •	Barrier properties of the plastic materials with respect to the global migration of the evaluated plastic materials are in the following order: Polycarbonate > Cycloolefinpolymer > High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) > Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) > Polyvinylchloride (PVC) •	The monomers acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate, 2 -hydroxypropyl acrylate and their hydrolysis and oxidation products n-butanol, n-butanal, 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol, 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanal and 2 -ethylhexyl acetate permeated depending on their polarity and the polarity of the plastic material into the aqueous solution. Furthermore, the influence of the molecular size of the monomers on the permeation process could be observed. Long chain non-polar compounds have been the most aggressive. •	As expected, an increase in permeation in sensitive of higher temperature and humidity conditions together with longer storage duration was evaluated. •	Furthermore, the influence of the thickness of the adhesive layer as well as the choice of face material (paper or plastic) on the permeability could be determined. Based on the migration results there are adhesive/plastic combinations with varying distinct migration risks. The findings of this work provide support for a preferred combination of label adhesives and plastics used in pharmaceutical containers...|$|R
