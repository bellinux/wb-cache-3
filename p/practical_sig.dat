40|$|A unique {{mechanistic}} {{theory is}} described {{to predict the}} properties of nanocomposites. The theory is based on composite micromechanics with progressive substructuring down to a nanoscale slice of a nanofiber where all the governing equations are formulated. These equations hav e been programmed in a computer code. That computer code is used to predict 25 properties of a mononanofiber laminate. The results are pr esented graphically and discussed {{with respect to their}} <b>practical</b> <b>sig</b> nificance. Most of the results show smooth distributions. Results for matrix-dependent properties show bimodal through-the-thickness distr ibution with discontinuous changes from mode to mode...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} the activities {{developed during the}} <b>Practical</b> Project of <b>SIG</b> Applied to the Geography teaching (2008, Geographic Institut, UERJ). For this purpose it was used the Vista/SAGA(Geoencironmental Analysis system) / UFRJ (Federal university of Rio De Janeiro) and the ALFAGIS/SIG methodology (University of the State of Rio De Janeiro). According to the National Curricular Parameters for High School - PCNEM was selected, Degradation of the native vegetation {{of the city of}} Cabo Frio (RIO DE JANEIRO) and its relation with urbanization process as a work subject, of didactic book contents. The methodology was based on anlyses of didatic book free gis softwares testing and the use of Vista SAGA/UFRJ (Visualization module, signature module and Environmental Monitoring Modules). Cabo Frio land use data were from 1978 and 1993. Definition of subjects versus curricular areas versus Databases, as it is boarded inside of disciplines that it contains the selected subject and the exitencia of other item related inside of disciplines also is part of the methodology. The results showed that geographical and environmental concepts were better assimitated by the geography students. The work showed good efficience, therefore it allowed the graduation students in geography, a better understanding of geoprocessing science its application to geography education, its interdisciplinary use and its future application in teaching.

40|$|Prediction o f coastal hazards due {{to climate}} change is fraught with {{uncertainty}} that stems from complexity o f coastal systems, estimation o f sea level rise, and limitation o f available data. In-depth research on coastal modeling is hampered by lack o f techniques fo r handling uncertainty, and the available commercial geographical information sys tems (GIS) packages have only limited capability o f handling uncertain information. Therefore, integrating uncertainty theory with GIS is o f <b>practical</b> and theoretical <b>sig</b> nificance. This article presents a GIS-based model that integrates an existing predictive model using a differential approach, random simulation, and fuzzy set theory for pre dicting geomorphic hazards subject to uncertainty. Coastal hazard is modeled as the combined effects o f sea-level induced recession and storm erosion, using grid model ing techniques. The method is described with a case study o f Fingal Bay Beach, SE Australia, fo r which predicted responses to an IPCC standard sea-level rise o f 0. 86 m and superimposed storm erosion averaged 12 m and 90 m, respectively, with analysis of uncertainty yielding maximum o f 52 m and 120 m, respectively. Paradoxically, out put uncertainty reduces slightly with simulated increase in random error in the digital elevation model (DEM). This trend implies that the magnitude o f modeled uncertainty is not necessarily increased with the uncertainties in the input parameters. Built as a generic tool, the model can be used not only to predict different scenarios o f coastal hazard under uncertainties for coastal management, but is also applicable to otherfields that involve predictive modeling under uncertainty...|$|R
