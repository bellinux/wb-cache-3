2500|$|... often {{abbreviated}} SD, is a {{brand of}} ball-jointed doll, or BJD, made by the Japanese company Volks. They are made {{to be easy to}} customize and are primarily marketed to adult doll collectors and customizers. They are cast in <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin,</b> a porcelain-like, hard, dense plastic. The most common standard models are about 60cm, or 24inches, tall, taller and heavier than most comparable Western dolls. They are designed in a style which is both realistic and influenced by anime, and most models are anatomically correct. The various body parts have ball joints for articulation, and are strung together with a thick elastic cord.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chitin {{added to}} {{three types of}} <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> {{including}} hydrophilic, water in oil (w/o) emulsified, and wet-coagulated <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> for cast films and coated fabrics was investigated in this study The results showed that adding chitin to the hydrophilic and wet-coagulated <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> can effectively increase the water vapor permeability of the cast films or nylon coated fabrics. For the w/o emulsified polyurethane coated fabrics, however, this increase was not detected. These observations can be readily explained by the microstructural variations which create homogeneous or irregular pores, {{as evidenced by the}} scan-ning electron microscope pictures KEY WORDS: chitin, water vapor permeability, w/o emulsified polyurethane, coagulation, hydrophilic polyurethane...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> have {{frequently}} {{been used to}} reinforce the soil and to recover building foundation structures after subsidence. Such resins are characterized by a swelling capacity during the chemical reaction that determines their formation. As a consequence, {{in the presence of}} a confinement, such as that which occurs after injection of the subsoil, the expansive capacity of the resin produces the compaction of the surrounding soil or triggers a fracture. In order to supply design tools for this type of intervention, the physico-chemical, mechanical and hydraulic properties of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> are here described and the injection modalities, for different types of soil, are illustrated, through basic experimental tests. Simple theoretical models are then presented in order to evaluate the effects induced by the injection of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> on the stress and stain state of the soils. Some examples are given in order to illustrate the results that can be obtained from the application of the theoretical models. Finally, the possibility of using <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> for the treatment of expansive soils is describe...|$|R

50|$|Most {{commonly}} a {{thermosetting resin}} is used that polymerizes by mixing with a curing agent (polymerization catalyst) {{at room temperature}} and normal pressure. The resins are named by analogy with plant resins, but are synthetic monomers for making polymer plastics. The so-called synthetic resins used include polystyrene resin, <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin,</b> epoxy resin, unsaturated polyester resin, acrylic resin and silicone resin.|$|E

40|$|Contribution {{gives an}} {{overview}} {{of knowledge about the}} method of centrifugal casting with orientate on Tekcast system. Company Tekcast Industries has developed a device for centrifugal casting, extending the area of production of castings or prototyping of metal or plastic. Materials suitable for the centrifugal casting with flexible operating parameters may include non-ferrous metal alloy based on zinc or aluminum or non-metallic materials such as polyester <b>resins,</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins,</b> epoxy resins, waxes and the like. The casting process is particularly suitable {{for a wide range of}} commercial castings and decorative objects...|$|R
50|$|The {{individual}} {{components of}} a multi-component adhesive are not adhesive by nature. The individual components react with each other after being mixed and show full adhesion only on curing. The multi-component resins can be either solvent-based or solvent-less. The solvents present in the adhesives are a medium for the polyester or the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin.</b> The solvent is dried during the curing process.|$|E
50|$|The HDI <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> {{should be}} sourced from a {{manufacturer}} who can {{demonstrate that they}} have BS EN 9001 quality management standards. All companies conforming to this {{will be able to}} provide documentation on request. The resin-bound aggregate mix will generally be a mix of natural aggregates that must be kiln dried to prevent moisture coming in contact with polyurethanes and causing discolouration and poor performance.|$|E
5000|$|Epoxy resin {{has a lower}} {{viscosity}} than <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> {{polyester resin}} also shrinks markedly while curing. Acrylic resin, in particular the methyl methacrylate type of synthetic resin, produces acrylic glass (also called PMMA, Lucite, Plexiglass), {{which is not a}} glass but a plastic polymer that is transparent, and very hard. It is suitable for embedding objects (such as, for example, acrylic trophies), for display purposes. Styrene is a similar liquid monomer at room temperature, which will also polymerize into clear glass-like polystyrene plastic, with addition of a suitable catalyst.|$|E
50|$|The classic {{variety is}} epoxy resin, {{manufactured}} through polymerization-polyaddition or polycondensation reactions, {{used as a}} thermoset polymer for adhesives and composites. Epoxy resin is two times stronger than concrete, seamless and waterproof. Accordingly, it has been mainly in use for industrial flooring purposes since the 1960s. Since 2000, however, epoxy and <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> are used in interiors as well, mainly in Western Europe.|$|R
50|$|John (Jean) Stutz (born January 14, 1933) is {{a virtual}} artist who {{produces}} artworks (castings) made of reactive two component <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins,</b> sculptures and installations. He became well known 2011 by his first big life performance on the Parade Square in Zurich, in front and {{in the favor of}} the major Swiss Banks. He lives and works in Rorschach and Pawling, New York.|$|R
5000|$|The main use of polytetrahydrofuran {{is to make}} elastic fibers such as spandex (elastan) for {{stretchable}} {{fabrics and}} for <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins.</b> The latter are polyurethane prepolymers dissolved in solvent. They {{are used in the}} manufacture of artificial leather. These elastomers are either polyurethanes made by reacting PTMEG with diisocyanates, or polyesters made by reacting PTMEG with diacids or their derivatives.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} Chinese produced BJDs were knockoffs. Some were direct recasts, {{while others}} were slight modifications of Super Dollfie or Korean BJDs. These knockoffs were made of plaster, low quality resin or polystone — a mix of resin and a filler material like sand. They were low in price, but not very durable. The first Chinese company to release their own original BJD sculpts in high quality <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> was Dollzone. Their dolls hit the market in 2006. Since then, several other Chinese companies followed suit, putting their own BJD creations on the international market.|$|E
5000|$|Japanese garage kits {{are often}} female anime figures, {{sometimes}} in lurid or even pornographic poses. Another major subject is [...] "Kaiju" [...] monsters such as Godzilla, {{and they also}} include subjects like mecha and science fiction space ships. Garage kits {{can be as simple}} as a one piece figure, or as complex as kits with well over one hundred parts. Most commonly they are cast in <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin,</b> but may also be fabricated of such diverse substances as soft vinyl, white metal - a type of lead alloy - and fabric.|$|E
5000|$|More {{recent and}} less {{traditional}} Japanese dolls are ball-jointed dolls (BJDs), whose growth in popularity {{has spread to}} the US and other countries {{since the advent of}} the Super Dollfie, first made by Volks in 1999. BJDs can be very realistic-looking or based more on the anime aesthetic. They are made of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> which makes them very durable. These dolls are highly customizable in that owners can sand them, change out their wig and eye colors, and even change their face paint. Because of this hands-on aspect of customization, they are not only popular with collectors, but also with hobbyists.|$|E

50|$|Like in the 1920s the {{development}} of new raw materials by large chemical companies allowed paints and coatings makers to develop a whole new generation of innovative products. Thanks to novel <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> Lechler was fast to launch some products: Isofan, a name in vehicle painting, Dermophan, in leather painting, Acriplast and its derivatives for painting plastic items used in the automotive and interior design fields.|$|R
50|$|The {{usage of}} higher-quality HDI <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> ensures greater {{flexural}} performance for external applications and the resin will not yellow in appearance {{when exposed to}} UV light, the HDI presence also provides greater protection from UV degradation. Non light-stable aromatic polyurethanes, although strong in performance, are more suited to internal applications where {{they are not in}} direct sunlight. Internal resin-bound applications are generally known as stone carpet.|$|R
50|$|Ball-jointed dolls are {{initially}} modeled in clay, commonly polymer clay. The hardened {{clay body}} parts {{are used to}} form molds for multiple parts to be cast in synthetic <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin.</b> Cured resin has a hard, smooth, porcelain-like feel, but is less brittle. Unlike porcelain however, polyurethane tends to turn yellow and decay over time depending on exposure to UV light and heat. The resin casting process allows for molds to be produced with a relatively low initial investment, compared to the injection molding commonly used for mass produced vinyl dolls. However, the materials are more expensive, and the process requires more manual labor, resulting in a higher cost per unit.|$|E

5000|$|Modern Asian BJDs are {{intended}} for adult collectors and customizers and {{range in price from}} US$100 to over US$1000. Their body elements are cast in <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resin</b> and held together by thick elastic cords, making them fully articulated and highly poseable. BJDs tend to follow a distinctly Asian view in their aesthetics, but the designs are diverse and range from highly anime-inspired to hyper-realistic. LA Weekly said Asian BJDs are [...] "often strangely human looking" [...] while NPR described them as [...] "eerily lifelike." [...] Most are anatomically correct and have proportionally large heads, big eyes and comparatively large feet, contrasted with fashion dolls like Barbie, and are capable of standing on their own, without a stand or other support.|$|E
40|$|New polyurethanes {{containing}} {{a high degree}} of fluorine atoms are reported. The presence of the fluorine atoms in the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>resins</b> provides material having good thermal stability and chemical resistance. These polyurethanes are derived from a new hydroxy-terminated perfluoro polyether. The hydroxy terminated material is reacted with a diisocyanate to produce the polyurethanes.
