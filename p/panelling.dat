5|$|The hall has a hammerbeam roof; {{the louvre}} in the centre is now glazed, but was {{originally}} {{the only means}} of escape for smoke rising from a fireplace in the centre of the floor. The wooden <b>panelling</b> was designed by Ninian Comper and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous 19th-century Gothic type, though even earlier <b>panelling,</b> dating from 1710, is evident in the Buttery.|$|E
5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The <b>panelling</b> is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak <b>panelling</b> of the room {{may have been used}} {{in the construction of the}} canopy of the bed.|$|E
5|$|In 1854 William Gibbs {{commissioned}} John Gregory Crace, {{an architect}} {{he was already}} using elsewhere, to redesign and decorate the principal rooms at Tyntesfield. These new designs included gilded <b>panelling,</b> woodwork, moulding and chimneypieces all in the Gothic style.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{the south}} range {{includes}} three 16th- or early-17th-century stone fireplaces that {{have probably been}} reused from the earlier house. The north room of the attic floor and principal room {{on the first floor}} include 16th- or early-17th-century timber <b>panelling.</b> The room over the entrance hall features late-17th-century <b>panelling.</b> Two period staircases feature; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries. The windows in the entrance hall and north room of the east range include armorial stained glass windows dated 1567, 1567 and 1575. The stairwell includes windows with 17th-century German stained glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other, undated stained glass.|$|E
5|$|La Pausa {{contains}} three wings {{that face}} onto a shaded courtyard, with the rooms containing large fireplaces. The rooms were filled by Chanel with 16th-century English oak furniture, {{given to her}} by the Duke of Westminster; English oak was also used for floors and <b>panelling.</b> The large reception rooms were lit by wrought-iron chandeliers from Spain.|$|E
5|$|The final large {{reception}} {{room on the}} first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean <b>panelling.</b> The <b>panelling</b> was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from {{the upper part of the}} earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{impression}} of space within the cockpit {{area and the}} great degree of visual sighting afforded by the Plexiglas <b>panelling</b> were regarded as positive factors, with one important provision in relation to weather conditions. Should either bright sunshine or rainstorms be encountered, the pilot's visibility could be dangerously compromised either by glare throwback or lack of good sighting.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{is used in}} the {{construction}} of buildings, bridges, trackways, piles, poles for power lines, masts for boats, pit props, railway sleepers, fencing, hurdles, shuttering for concrete, pipes, scaffolding and pallets. In housebuilding it is used in joinery, for making joists, roof trusses, roofing shingles, thatching, staircases, doors, window frames, floor boards, parquet flooring, <b>panelling</b> and cladding.|$|E
5|$|Wood <b>panelling</b> from {{a room in}} the Crown & Treaty {{public house}} was sold in 1924 to an American businessman, who {{installed}} it in his office in the Empire State Building in New York. It was returned in 1953 as a gift to the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II and returned to the house, although the monarch retained ownership.|$|E
5|$|All five {{floors are}} {{connected}} by a central scale-and-platt staircase, added in the early 17th century to replace a turnpike stair in the south-west. The rooms of the upper floors have impressive <b>panelling</b> and decorated ceilings. The main hall, in the south part of the block, has been divided, but retains a large fireplace with the carved initials WS and JE, for William Sinclair and his wife Jean Edmonstone, and the date 1597.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations {{including}} the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded <b>panelling</b> and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze. The stairwell is lit from above with a roof light and features a cantilevered stair with iron balusters from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass handrail.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes House, No. 33, {{dates to}} the mid-18th century. A three-storey brick {{building}} with five bays and a classical stone door-case, with Doric columns and an entabulature. To the north is a two-storey mid-19th century extension, also in brick, and an adjoining former garden wall. The rear has seven bays and two projecting wings, dating to the 18th century. Internally, one room has 17th century <b>panelling</b> of a Tudor design.|$|E
5|$|Some of Belton's many {{rooms have}} been altered {{over the last}} 300 years both in use and design. One of the {{principal}} rooms, the Marble Hall (1), {{the first of the}} large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a chequer board patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton's conception, the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from William the Conqueror to William III, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the <b>panelling</b> contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by Jeffry Wyatville, who in addition to graining and painting the <b>panelling</b> to imitate oak installed new doors.|$|E
5|$|The Usumacinta style {{developed}} in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage. Cities {{took advantage of the}} hillsides to support their major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan. Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples. As in Petén, roof combs adorned principal structures. Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than corbel vaulting. Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted <b>panelling</b> to decorate its buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{has been changed}} and expanded over the centuries. It now consists of a main 3 storey block with two wings. The interior includes fine wooden <b>panelling</b> and plaster ceilings. Some of the original fireplaces survive {{and many of the}} rooms include decorative stained glass. It is surrounded by landscaped grounds including a sunken garden and a knot garden. There is a 17th century barn adjacent to the house.|$|E
5|$|The library, {{the last}} of the palace's rooms to be completed, is based on Sir Walter Scott's own library, {{revealing}} the personal friendship that Blore had with Scott. Inside, the library features about 6,000 literary and musical works of the 18th and 19th centuries. The interior's woodwork, including the doors, <b>panelling,</b> and ceilings, is made out of oak. The walls are adorned in cloth, with designs made by Dutch, Flemish, French, and Italian painters. The palace's Gothic fireplaces are made out of polished diabase.|$|E
5|$|The pulpit {{has some}} 19th-century oak <b>panelling</b> and reuses some ornate 17th-century panel {{work that is}} {{decorated}} with pictures of cherubs, dragons, dogs and lions' heads. The pews are made of pine; the choir stalls also have some carved oak panels that may date from the 17th century. A reading desk from the 19th century reuses material from the 14th and 17th centuries, depicting a lion, a griffin and angels. The church also has an eight-sided sandstone font decorated with a carved cross.|$|E
5|$|The solar block has two storeys and a cellar, {{and would}} have {{probably}} acted as the living space for Laurence of Ludlow when he first moved into the castle. The solar room itself is on the first floor, and is reached by external steps. The wood <b>panelling</b> and carved wooden fireplace are of 17th-century origin, probably from around 1640. This woodwork would have originally been brightly painted, and included spy-holes so that the hall could be observed from the solar.|$|E
5|$|The wood of B.integrifolia is pink to red, with {{inconspicuous}} {{rings and}} conspicuous rays. It is spongy and porous, with a density of around 530 kilograms per cubic metre (33lb/ft3). It is considered highly decorative, but it warps badly on drying, has poor load-bearing qualities, and {{is susceptible to}} termite attack; it is therefore unsuitable for most construction purposes. It is sometimes used for cabinet <b>panelling</b> and in ornamental turnery, and natural bends were once sought after for making boat knees. It is a useful firewood.|$|E
5|$|To {{complement}} the garden, a bath house and summer house were constructed {{at the corners}} of the garden furthest from the castle. The bath house is ruined, but the two-storey summer house survives intact. It comprises a groin-vaulted lower room, with an upper chamber, containing the only surviving example of the castle’s carved-oak wall <b>panelling.</b> Charles McKean attributes the design and construction of the garden buildings to Thomas Leiper, an Aberdeenshire stonemason, based on the elaborately decorated gun holes in the summer house.|$|E
5|$|A small chapel lies to {{the north}} of the central hall. Originally rather austere, it was lavishly {{decorated}} by Barry in the High Victorian style. There is much elaborate wood carving, with the altar rail featuring angels and the benches poppyheads. The marble apse has alabaster carved heads of the prophets and evangelists by J. Birnie Philip, and the wall <b>panelling</b> features bronze medallions depicting biblical characters by the same artist. The ornate choir gallery, reached from the central hall's mezzanine gallery, contains the family pew. The stained glass and wall murals are by Clayton and Bell, and the painting and stencilling are by J. G. Crace.|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood <b>panelling</b> and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E
5|$|Council House is {{constructed}} from concrete-encased steel frame, with lifts and service rooms located at its eastern end and a fire escape stairwell at its western end. Level 9 houses the distinctive circular Council Chamber, which features wood <b>panelling</b> {{and has been}} restored to largely its original state in the 1990s refurbishment (by contrast {{to most of the}} other levels of the building). The building is almost completely clad with glass, which led to criticism about its excessive air conditioning costs. The glass exterior of the building has T-shaped white sunbreakers superimposed in an alternating pattern across the building, coated with fine mosaic tiles. With the newly enclosed top floor, the building now has 13 levels above ground.|$|E
5|$|Internally, Salvin knocked through {{existing}} {{rooms to}} create the Outer Hall, a new gallery on the first floor, a billiard room, a new library and a drawing room. Much of the wooden 17th-century <b>panelling</b> in the parlour and the hall had to be stripped out {{as part of the}} renovations. As part of his work, Salvin appears to have used a number of rolled wrought-iron beams to span the resulting structural gaps in the building, an advanced use of that technology for the time. The house was refurnished with newly bought 16th and 17th-century artwork, two brass Italian cannons and a stuffed polar bear.|$|E
5|$|Lord Herbert {{left the}} castle {{to join the}} {{campaign}} against Parliament, returning at intervals to acquire more funds for the war. Charles I himself visited the castle twice, first in June 1645 after the battle of Naseby and again in 1646, when he enjoyed playing bowls on the castle's green. The Royalist cause was now close to military collapse, and the Marquess started to send some valuables, including the oak <b>panelling</b> from the parlour, some plaster ceiling and many pictures, to his brother at nearby Troy House for safe-keeping. Lord Herbert was captured in Ireland, and an attack on Raglan itself appeared imminent.|$|E
5|$|The bronze lectern {{was given}} to the College in 1654. The black and white marble paving dates from 1677–78. Except for the pews on the west, dating from 1884, the <b>panelling,</b> stalls and screens are all 17th-century, as are the altar and carved communion rails. Behind the altar is Bernard van Orley's The Carrying of the Cross — a companion-piece to this {{painting}} is in the National Gallery of Scotland. The organ case dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{deteriorated}} {{through the}} 18th century, and by 1800 Doune was a roofless ruin. It remained so until the 1880s, when George Stuart, 14th Earl of Moray (1816–1895) began repair works. The timber roofs were replaced, and the interiors, including the <b>panelling</b> in the Lord's Hall, were installed. The castle is now maintained by Historic Scotland, having been donated to a predecessor organisation by Douglas Stuart, 20th Earl of Moray, in 1984, and {{is open to}} the public. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and is a Category A listed building, the highest levels of protection for nationally important built heritage in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room and kitchen. The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the <b>panelling</b> in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E
5|$|The manor of Southcote {{remained}} in the Blagrave family until the early 20th century, when it was owned by Henry Barry Blagrave. Henry died in 1927, though the manor house was demolished in 1921 after lying empty {{following the death of}} Wastel Brisco and his wife Sarah in 1891 and 1901 respectively. In 1920 the house had been purchased by a contractor with intentions to demolish the site, though the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a committee to attempt to raise money to save the house. The Sphere reported that the bricks and oak <b>panelling</b> were in demand and were likely removed for re-use before the building's demolition.|$|E
5|$|The north {{transept}} fittings {{are from}} 1936 and are by Caroe & Passmore. They include a finely carved reredos with <b>panelling</b> each side, the altar, rails (in {{the form of}} a long kneeler), a lectern, pews and kneelers, all in pale oak. The reredos has a carved Crucifixion, with St Mary and St John. There is a small Orthodox icon, a Theotokos, or Virgin and Child, {{to the right of the}} reredos. It is a reproduction of an early icon, printed on paper mounted on wood, from Stylite Icons, Welshpool, and probably dates from the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the main}} family sitting room on the ground floor, with the south-facing grand window giving views to the gardens, and was remodelled by John Lyte in 1533. In the early 17th century Thomas Lyte added the wood {{paneling}} (including Ionic pilasters) and the internal porch: these decorative features also had the practical benefit of keeping out the drafts. In the 20th century the room was {{being used as a}} store for farm equipment. Sir Walter Jenner had the paint stripped from the <b>panelling</b> to reveal the original warm-coloured oak.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many castles in England {{which were}} {{deliberately}} seriously damaged, or slighted, {{to put them}} beyond military use, Stokesay escaped substantial harm after the war. Parliament sequestrated the property from William and ordered the slighting of the castle in 1647, but only pulled down the castle's curtain wall, leaving {{the rest of the}} complex intact. Samuel returned in 1649 to continue to rent the castle during the years of the Commonwealth, and put in wood <b>panelling</b> and new windows into parts of the property. With the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, William's lands were returned to him, and the Baldwyns continued to lease Stokesay Castle from him.|$|E
5|$|Charles Edward Evans {{purchased}} Nailsea Court in 1906. He {{then started}} a restoration programme which took seven years. He employed Arthur James Stratton, {{an expert on}} Tudor architecture to reconstruct the west wing. The restoration included the use of materials from Over Langford Manor. The <b>panelling</b> was installed in his new withdrawing room. Consequently this room was called the Langford Parlour but {{is now known as}} the Langford Room. The Latch porch from Langford was at Nailsea Court for nearly twenty years, before being returned by Charles Evans to Upper Langford in 1923. The rebuilding included the erection of a tower. The first version looked similar to a lighthouse and was changed to one of Tudor appearance which was incorporated into the south wing. During World War I, in an effort to conserve coal, brick insets were built into the fireplaces to reduce their size.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood <b>panelling</b> and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} period many {{thousands}} of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as {{in addition to the}} family's problems, the house deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired but much of the <b>panelling</b> taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot. By the time of the death of the 6th Baron in 1978, the resultant death duties, coupled with the rising costs of the upkeep, made Belton too much for the Brownlow family.|$|E
5|$|Nothing survives of the {{original}} buildings, La Oriole and the smaller St Martin's Hall in the south-east; both were demolished before the quadrangle {{was built in the}} artisan mannerist style during the 17th century. The south and west ranges and the gate tower were built around 1620 to 1622; the north and east ranges and the chapel buildings date from 1637 to 1642. The façade of the east range forms a classical E shape comprising the college chapel, hall and undercroft. The exterior and interior of the ranges are topped by an alternating pattern of decorative gables. The gate house has a Perpendicular portal and canted Gothic oriel windows, with fan vaulting in the entrance. The room above has a particularly fine plaster ceiling and chimney piece of stucco caryatids and <b>panelling</b> interlaced with studded bands sprouting into large flowers.|$|E
