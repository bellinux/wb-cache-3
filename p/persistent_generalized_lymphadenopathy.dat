40|$|Background: This {{study was}} done {{to know about the}} {{clinical}} biochemical as well as radiological profile of patients presented as <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> in a tertiary care centre and to know the different causes of <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> Methods: 116 patients of <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> were included this study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Detailed history, physical examination and relevant systemic examination including detailed examination of lympho-reticular system were done as per a structured proforma and necessary lab investigations were done for confirming diagnosis. Results: Among 116 patients of <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> 59. 5 % were non-malignant causes where 40. 5 % diagnosed as malignant causes. Among them tuberculosis consist of 39 (33. 6 %), NHL 18 (15. 5 %), reactive lymphadenopathy 16 (13. 8 %), CLL and HD 8 (6. 9 %) each, ALL 7 (6 %), SLE 5 (4. 3 %), Kikuchi's disease 4 (3. 4 %), AML and RA 3 (2. 6 %) each and castleman's disease, phenytoin lymphadenopathy, metastatic lung and breast carcinoma 1 (0. 9 %) each. Cervical groups of lymph nodes were most commonly involved 86 patients (74. 1 %) followed by axillary groups 73 patients (62. 9 %). Lymph nodes size 1. 5 cm were due to malignant and non-malignant granulomatous cases. FNAC give definite diagnosis 80. 9 % malignant cases where 76. 8 % in non-malignant cases.

40|$|The Vancouver Lymphadenopathy-AIDS (acquired immune {{deficiency}} syndrome) Study is {{an ongoing}} prospective study of over 700 homosexual men attending six primary care practices in central Vancouver. A case-control study of risk factors for <b>persistent</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> in homosexual men was conducted {{in five of the}} practices. The participants completed a questionnaire and underwent a complete physical examination at the time of enrolment and at a subsequent visit not less than 3 months later, and laboratory tests were performed after both visits. <b>Persistent</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> was defined as the presence of lymph nodes greater than 1 cm in diameter at two or more extrainguinal sites for more than 3 months.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between infection with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) and various immunological parameters was studied in: (a) healthy controls; (b) homosexual individuals from the AIDS risk group without anti-HIV antibodies; (c) idem, but with anti-HIV antibodies; (d) patients with <b>persistent</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> (PGL); (e) patients with AIDS-related syndrome; (f) patients with AIDS and opportunistic infections. In each group, consisting of 15 - 20 individuals, the following parameters were studied: absolute numbers of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells; ratio CD 4 +/CD 8 +; cellular immune responses as measured in vivo by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and in vitro; and antibody response in vivo after immunization with a low dose of keyhole limpet haemocyanin. Healthy HIV antibody-positive individuals and patients with <b>persistent</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> already showed a decreased CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio, mainly due {{to an increase in}} the number of CD 8 + cells. The ratio in the AIDS-related syndrome and AIDS groups was even lower, but this was now due to low numbers of CD 4 + cells while the number of CD 8 + cells was normal. The lymphocyte proliferative response was low in the HIV antibody-positive group, normal in the group with <b>persistent</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> and profoundly decreased in the AIDS-related syndrome and AIDS groups. DTH was enhanced in the PGL group and diminished in both ARC and AIDS. Compared to healthy controls, the antibody response upon immunization with a low dose of keyhole limpet haemocyanin was depressed (although not absent) in all groups studied, even in HIV antibody-negative homosexuals. In the HIV antibody-positive group, the severity of the impairment of the various parameters of immunocompetence was not related to the presence of HIV antigenaemi...|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study of 128 individuals infected with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) was conducted to determine the correlation of reverse transcriptase-inhibiting (RTI) antibody to clinical disease. Thirty-two individuals were studied in each of four clinical groups: asymptomatic individuals, those with <b>persistent</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) -related complex, and those with AIDS. Our study showed that 78 % of asymptomatic individuals, 53 % of those with <b>persistent</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> 50 % of those with AIDS-related complex, and only 25 % of those with AIDS have RTI antibody. Concurrent measurement of measles antibody level {{was used as an}} indicator of the immune status of these individuals. Measles antibody did not decline in persons with clinical disease, but asymptomatic individuals had lower antibody titers, possibly due to hypergammaglobulinemia associated with advanced HIV infection. These results indicate that more HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals than symptomatic individuals have RTI antibody. This suggests either that the RTI antibody level decreases with the progression of disease in HIV infection or that symptomatic individuals do not produce RTI antibody. The presence or absence of RTI antibody can thus be used as a marker of advanced disease...|$|E
