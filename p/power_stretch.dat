30|$|Besides connectivity, {{the most}} {{important}} design metric of wireless networks is perhaps power efficiency, because it directly affects both nodes and network lifetime. Figure 6 e,f show all proposed structures have small <b>power</b> <b>stretch</b> factors even when the network is very dense. Notice that Yao structures based on PYG 8 and RNG {{have a little bit}} higher stretch factor than GG and other Yao-based structures, however, their maximum <b>power</b> <b>stretch</b> factors are still smaller than 5. The reason again is that the nodes are distributed randomly in the area and the number of nodes is not too large. As we expected, GG has a <b>power</b> <b>stretch</b> factor of one and all <b>power</b> <b>stretch</b> factors of 3 D Yao structures are smaller than their theoretical bounds if they have ones. Among all 3 D Yao structures, FlYGπ/ 6 and FlYYGπ/ 6 have the smallest stretch factor, since they are the densest 3 D Yao structures.|$|E

30|$|Topology {{control for}} 3 D {{wireless}} sensor networks has been well studied recently and different 3 D geometric topologies were proposed to achieve the sparseness and power efficiency. However, most of them cannot bound the node degree. Even though some of 3 D structures based on Yao graph can bound the node out-degree, they may still lead to large in-degree at some nodes. Therefore, in this article, we propose two general frameworks to build degree-bounded 3 D topologies for {{wireless sensor networks}}. These frameworks can use all existing Yao-based 3 D structures as the underlying methods, and only use local information with linear number of messages. We show some of them can also guarantee the constant <b>power</b> <b>stretch</b> factor in 3 D. Our simulation results confirm the good performance of our new 3 D topologies.|$|E

We {{present a}} distributed, {{localized}} and integrated approach for establishing both low-level (i. e. exploration of 1 -hop neighbors, interference avoidance) and high-level (a subgraph of the unit-disk graph) infrastructure in wireless sensor networks. More concretely, our proposed scheme constructs a subgraph of the unit-disk graph which is connected, planar and has <b>power</b> <b>stretch</b> factor of 1 (the well-known Gabriel graph intersected with the unit disk-graph) and – most importantly – deals explicitly {{with the problem}} of interference between nearby stations. Due to our interleaved approach of constructing low- and high-level infrastructure simultaneously, this results in considerable improvements in running time when applied in dense wireless networks. To substantiate the advantages of our approach, we introduce a novel distribution model inspired by actual sensing applications and analyze our new approach in that framework. ...|$|E
