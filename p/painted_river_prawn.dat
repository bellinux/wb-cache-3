Thus, {{it is important for}} new production systems to use practices that reduce environmental impacts, such as choosing to farm native species from a region's biological diversity and adopting better effluent management. This study aimed to estimate and compare environmental impacts of tropical freshwater prawn farming systems based either on the introduced species Macrobrachium rosenbergii (giant <b>river</b> <b>prawn)</b> or the native species Macrobrachium amazonicum (Amazon <b>river</b> <b>prawn).</b> The two hypothetical systems were compared using life cycle assessment (LCA) with the impact categories climate change, eutrophication, acidification, energy use, net primary production use, surface use and water dependence. Yields, species, feed conversation ratio (FCR) and feed processing were the factors with the most influence. The higher yield and lower FCR of giant <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> induced lower impacts than native Amazon <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> in all categories analyzed. Regardless of species, better effluent management in freshwater prawn farming, such as treating effluents with aquatic macrophytes or applying pond sediments to crops, significantly reduced eutrophication potential, making it extremely important to recommend using it in freshwater prawn farming.

50|$|Macrobrachium rosenbergii, {{also known}} as the giant <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> or giant {{freshwater}} prawn, is a commercially important species of palaemonid freshwater prawn. It is found throughout the tropical and subtropical areas of the Indo-Pacific region, from India to Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. The giant <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> has also been introduced to parts of Africa, Thailand, China, Japan, New Zealand, the Americas and the Caribbean. It {{is one of the biggest}} freshwater prawns in the world and is widely cultivated in several countries for food. While M. rosenbergii is considered a freshwater species, the larval stage of the animal depends on brackish water. Once the individual shrimp has grown beyond the planktonic stage and becomes a juvenile, it will live entirely in freshwater.|$|R
40|$|The gustavus gene is {{required}} for localizing pole plasm and specifying germ cells. Research on gustavus gene expression will advance {{our understanding of the}} biological function of gustavus in animals. A cDNA encoding gustavus protein was identified and termed MnGus in the oriental <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> Macrobrachium nipponense. Bioinformatic analyses showed that this gene encoded a protein of 262 amino acids and the protein belongs to the Spsb 1 family. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed that the expression level of MnGus in prawn embryos was slightly higher at the cleavage stage than at the blastula stage, and reached the maximum level during the zoea stage of embryos. The minimum level of MnGus expression occurred during the perinucleolus stage in the ovary, while the maximum was at the oil globule stage, and then the level of MnGus expression gradually decreased with the advancement of ovarian development. The expression level of MnGus in muscle was much higher than that in other tissues in mature prawn. The gustavus cDNA sequence was firstly cloned from the oriental <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> and the pattern of gene expression was described during oocyte maturation, embryonic development, and in other tissues. The differential expression patterns of MnGus in the embryo, ovary and other somatic tissues suggest that the gustavus gene performs multiple physiological functions in the oriental <b>river</b> <b>prawn...</b>|$|R
