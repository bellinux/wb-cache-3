The limitations of current analytical detection strategies for this class of compounds, in combination with their efficacy in growth-promoting effects, make <b>peptide</b> and <b>protein</b> drugs highly susceptible to abuse by either athletes or farmers who seek for products to illicitly enhance muscle growth. Mass spectrometry (MS) for qualitative analysis of <b>peptides</b> and <b>proteins</b> is well-established, particularly due to tremendous efforts in the proteomics community. Similarly, due to advancements in targeted proteomic strategies and {{the rapid growth of}} protein-based biopharmaceuticals, MS for quantitative analysis of <b>peptides</b> and <b>proteins</b> is becoming more widely accepted. These continuous advances in MS instrumentation and MS-based methodologies offer enormous opportunities for detection and confirmation of <b>peptides</b> and <b>proteins.</b> Therefore, MS seems to be the method of choice to improve the qualitative and quantitative analysis of <b>peptide</b> and <b>proteins</b> with growth-promoting properties. This review aims to address the opportunities of MS for <b>peptide</b> and <b>protein</b> analysis in veterinary control and sports-doping control with a particular focus on detection of illicit growth promotion.

50|$|A {{relatively}} {{new way of}} administration of therapeutic <b>peptides</b> and <b>proteins</b> (such as cytokines, domain antibodies, Fab fragments or single chain antibodies) is sublingual administration. <b>Peptides</b> and <b>proteins</b> are not stable in the gastro-intestinal tract, mainly due to degradation by enzymes and pH differences. As a consequence, most peptides (such as insulin, exenatide, vasopressin, etc...) or proteins (such as interferon, EPO and interleukins) have to be administered by injection. Recently, new technologies have allowed sublingual administration of such molecules. Increased efforts are underway to deliver macromolecules (<b>peptides,</b> <b>proteins</b> and immunotherapies) by sublingual route, by companies such as Novo Nordisk, Sanofi and BioLingus.|$|R

50|$|Camurus' FluidCrystal are {{available}} as injectable depots and topical bioadhesive delivery technologies. By encapsulating the drug compound in the nanostructures, injectable depots {{are able to}} deliver therapeutic levels of drug substance over extended periods from a single injection. This leads to a decrease in traditional side effects associated with high initial drug release on injection (drug burst), poor drug stability, and complex processing requirements, making the system highly suitable for sustained parental delivery of peptides, proteins, and small molecule drug compounds. The topical delivery system creates a bio-adhesive film that provides local and continual release of drug compounds. The delivery system is suited for delivery of <b>peptide,</b> <b>protein,</b> and small molecule drug compounds and {{can be applied to}} dermal, buccal, ophthalmic, nasal, vaginal, and other topical surfaces.|$|E

They are also known to possess potent antibiotic activity against bacteria, fungi, and even certain viruses. Recently, the rapid emergence of microbial pathogens that are resistant to currently available antibiotics has triggered considerable interest in the isolation and investigation of the mode of action of antimicrobial <b>proteins</b> (<b>peptides).</b> Plants produce a variety of <b>proteins</b> (<b>peptides)</b> {{that are involved in}} the defense against pathogens and invading organisms, including ribosome-inactivating proteins, lectins, protease inhibitors and antifungal <b>peptides</b> (<b>proteins).</b> Specially, the protease inhibitors can inhibit aspartic, serine and cysteine proteinases.
