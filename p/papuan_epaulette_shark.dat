5|$|The <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> is an {{opportunistic}} predator of benthic crustaceans, worms, {{and small}} bony fish. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark's</b> diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs, with juveniles taking mostly {{the former and}} adults mostly the latter. It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk, though feeding can occur {{at any time during}} the day. This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey. It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular buccal cavity. While searching for food, the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits. Unlike most <b>sharks,</b> the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> may chew its food for up to 510 minutes. Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard-shelled prey.|$|R

40|$|The key to {{surviving}} hypoxia is {{to protect}} the brain from energy depletion. The <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is an elasmobranch able to resist energy depletion and to survive hypoxia. Using epi-illumination microscopy in vivo to observe cerebral blood flow velocity on the brain surface, we show that cerebral blood flow in the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> is unaffected by 2 h of severe hypoxia (0. 35 mg O 2 l- 1 in the respiratory water, 24 C). Thus, the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> differs from other hypoxia- and anoxia-tolerant species studied: there is no adenosine-mediated increase in cerebral blood flow such as that occurring in freshwater turtles and cyprinid fish. However, blood pressure showed a 50 % decrease in the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> during hypoxia, indicating that a compensatory cerebral vasodilatation occurs to maintain cerebral blood flow. We observed an increase in cerebral blood flow velocity when superfusing the normoxic brain with adenosine (making sharks the oldest vertebrate group in which this mechanism has been found). The adenosine-induced increase in cerebral blood flow velocity was reduced by the adenosine receptor antagonist aminophylline. Aminophylline had no effect upon the maintenance of cerebral blood flow during hypoxia, however, indicating that adenosine is not involved in maintaining cerebral blood flow in the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> during hypoxic hypotension...|$|R

500|$|<b>Epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> have nocturnal {{habits and}} {{frequent}} shallow water on coral reefs or in tidal pools. This shark has evolved {{to cope with}} the severe night time oxygen depletion (hypoxia) in isolated tidal pools by increasing the blood supply to its brain and selectively shutting down non-essential neural functions. It is capable of surviving complete anoxia for an hour without ill effects, and at a much higher temperature than most other hypoxia-tolerant animals. Rather than swim, <b>epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> often [...] "walk" [...] by wriggling their bodies and pushing with their paired fins. This species feeds {{on a wide range of}} small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. <b>Epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> are oviparous, with females depositing pairs of egg capsules around every 14 days from August to December. Due to their hardiness and small size, <b>epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> are popular with both public and home aquaria. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as of Least Concern, as outside of the small aquarium trade it is of little interest to fisheries.|$|R
50|$|Hemiscyllium michaeli, (leopard <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark),</b> is {{a species}} of bamboo shark in the genus Hemiscyllium.

40|$|Reduced {{oxidative}} demand or neuronal hypometabolism is a neuroprotective strategy used {{by several}} anoxia and hypoxia-tolerant species. The <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark,</b> Hemiscyllium ocellatum inhabits shallow reef platforms that can become hypoxic. Hypoxic pre-conditioning (eight cycles of 0. 34 mg O 2 /l for 120 min, 12 h apart) {{was used to}} determine whether a reduction in oxidative metabolism could be elicited in the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> brain. Hypoxic pre-conditioning resulted in a significant overall reduction in oxidative activity in coronal sections of the brainstem, but key nuclei displayed heterogeneous levels of oxidative metabolism. Motor nuclei had significantly lower levels of oxidative activity while sensory nuclei did not. The <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark's</b> ability to enter this state of hypometabolism in response to hypoxic pre-conditioning revealed a neuroprotective mechanism, which would not only reduce neuronal damage during hypoxic exposure but also minimise re-oxygenation injury.

40|$|Hypoxia {{and warm}} {{ischemia}} are primary concerns in {{ischemic heart disease}} and transplant and trauma. Hypoxia impacts tissue ATP supply and can induce mitochondrial dysfunction that elevates reactive species release. The <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark,</b> Hemiscyllum ocellatum, is remarkably tolerant of severe hypoxia at temperatures up to 34 C, and therefore provides a valuable model to study warm hypoxia tolerance. Mitochondrial function was tested in saponin permeabilised ventricle fibres using high-resolution respirometry coupled with purpose-built fluorospectrometers. Ventricular mitochondrial function, stability and reactive species production of the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> was {{compared with that of}} the hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray, Aptychotrema rostrata. Fibres were prepared from each species acclimated to normoxic water conditions, or following a 2 h, acute hypoxic exposure at levels representing 40 % of each species' critical oxygen tension. Although mitochondrial respiratory fluxes for normoxia-acclimated animals were similar for both species, reactive species production in the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> was approximately half that of the shovelnose ray under normoxic conditions, even when normalised to tissue oxidative phosphorylation flux. The hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray halved oxidative phosphorylation flux and cytochrome c oxidase flux was depressed by 34 % following hypoxic stress. In contrast, oxidative phosphorylation flux of the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> ventricular fibres isolated from acute hypoxia exposed the animals remained similar to those from normoxia-acclimated animals. However, uncoupling of respiration revealed depressed electron transport systems in both species following hypoxia exposure. Overall, the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> ventricular mitochondria showed greater oxidative phosphorylation stability and lower reactive species outputs with hypoxic exposure, and this may protect cardiac bioenergetic function in hypoxic tropical waters.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{function}} and metabolic {{responses of the}} heart and other tissues during hypoxia exposure were compared between the hypoxia-tolerant <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) and the hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray (Aptychotrema rostrata). In both species, progressive hypoxia exposure caused increases in stroke volume and decreases in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac power output (CPO, an assessment of cardiac energy demand) and dorsal aortic blood pressure, all of which occurred at or below each species' critical PO 2 for whole-animal O 2 consumption rate, Embedded Image (Pcrit). In <b>epaulette</b> <b>sharks,</b> which have a lower Pcrit than shovelnose rays, routine levels of cardiovascular function were maintained to lower water PO 2 levels and the changes from routine levels during hypoxia exposure were smaller compared with those for the shovelnose ray. The maintenance rather than depression of cardiovascular function during hypoxia exposure may contribute to the superior hypoxia tolerance of the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark,</b> presumably by improving O 2 delivery and waste removal. Compared with shovelnose rays, <b>epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> were also better able to maintain a stable cardiac high-energy phosphate pool and to minimize metabolic acidosis and lactate accumulation in the heart (despite higher CPO) and other tissues during a 4 h exposure to 40 % of their respective Pcrit (referred to as a relative hypoxia exposure), which results in similar hypoxaemia in the two species (∼ 16 % Hb–O 2 saturation). These different metabolic responses to relative hypoxia exposure suggest that variation in hypoxia tolerance among species is not solely dictated by differences in O 2 uptake and transport but also by tissue-specific metabolic responses. In particular, lower tissue [lactate] accumulation in <b>epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> than in shovelnose rays during relative hypoxia exposure suggests that enhanced extra-cardiac metabolic depression occurs in the former species. This could facilitate strategic utilization of available O 2 for vital organs such as the heart, potentially explaining the greater hypoxic cardiovascular function of <b>epaulette</b> <b>sharks.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|The <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) and {{the grey}} carpet shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) are {{commonly}} found in periodically hypoxic environments. The ecophysiological time available for these animals to safely exploit these niches during different seasonal temperatures was examined. The time to loss of righting reflex (T (LRR)) was examined {{in response to an}} open ended anoxic challenge at three seasonal temperatures (23, 25 and 27 A degrees C). Ventilation rates were measured in an open ended anoxic challenge at 23 A degrees C and during 1. 5 h of anoxia followed by 2 h of re-oxygenation at 23 and 25 A degrees C. The mean T (LRR) of epaulette and grey carpet sharks was inversely proportional to temperature. The T (LRR) was similar between species at 23 A degrees C; however, grey carpet sharks had significantly reduced T (LRR) at higher temperatures. During the standardised anoxic challenge, <b>epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> entered into ventilatory depression significantly earlier at 25 A degrees C. During re-oxygenation, <b>epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> exposed to anoxia at 23 A degrees C had no significant increase in ventilation rates. However, after anoxic challenge and re-oxygenation at 25 A degrees C, <b>epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> showed a significant increase in ventilation rates during re-oxygenation. Grey carpet sharks displayed no evidence of ventilatory depression during anoxia. However, during re-oxygenation, grey carpet sharks had significantly elevated ventilation rates above pre-experimental levels and control animals. These data demonstrate that the anoxia tolerance times of both species were temperature dependent, with a significant reduction in the T (LRR) occurring at higher temperatures. <b>Epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> had a significantly greater T (LRR) at higher temperatures than grey carpet sharks, which did not enter into a ventilatory depression...|$|R
5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark's</b> paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. <b>Epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of vertebrates are not tolerant to hypoxia but <b>epaulette</b> <b>sharks</b> (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) living on shallow reef platforms appear to tolerate hypoxic periods during tidal fluctuations. The effects of progressive hypoxia on the metabolic and ventilatory responses of these elasmobranchs {{were examined in}} a closed respirometer. In order to determine whether repeated exposure to hypoxia primes these sharks to alter their metabolism, one group of sharks was exposed to repeated sub-lethal hypoxia, at 5 % of air saturation, prior to respirometry. In response to falling oxygen concentration [O 2], the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> increased its ventilatory rate and maintained its O 2 consumption rate (VO 2) down to 2. 2 mg O/l at 25 degrees C. This is the lowest critical O 2 ever measured for any elasmobranch. After reaching the O 2 crit of 2 22, the shark remained in the respirometer for a further 4. 5 h of progressive hypoxia. Only after the O 2 crit fell to 1. 0 mg/l was there {{a decrease in the}} ventilatory rate followed by a rise in blood lactate levels, indicating that the <b>epaulette</b> <b>shark</b> responds to severe hypoxia by entering a phase of metabolic and ventilatory depression.
