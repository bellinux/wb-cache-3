5|$|Jack Black as Carl Denham, a film {{director}} who obtained the map to Skull Island. Due to his debts, Carl starts {{to lose his}} moral compass and obsesses over his film to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> disregards safety.|$|E
5|$|Olcott, {{who managed}} Oswald West's {{successful}} 1910 campaign to become Governor of Oregon, recommended that West hire Hobbs as his private stenographer. She was hired, and impressed West to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hired her as his private secretary two years later. At that time, at age 27, {{she was the}} highest-paid woman in public service in the United States, earning $3,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprises {{chief medical}} officer and {{a close friend of}} Kirk and Spock. Kelley was {{dissatisfied}} with an earlier version of the script to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> considered not taking part. Kelley noted his character spoke many of the film's lighter lines, and felt that this role was essential in bringing a lighter side to the onscreen drama.|$|E

50|$|Katsuie {{appears in}} Sengoku Basara 4 as a {{low-rank}} vanguard under the Oda force. In the past {{he tried to}} rebel but failed. He is despaired in everything to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> even losing emotions.|$|R
5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|Australia played Pakistan at Karachi in {{the first}} Test between the two {{countries}} on a matting pitch, rather than the more familiar grass pitch. Miller top-scored {{in the first}} innings with 21, as Australia fell for 80. He took 2/40 and then scored 11 in the second innings as Australia fell to defeat. It was the last Test of his career, as his knee injury deteriorated to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not play in the three Tests against India, and retired upon his return to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops to a <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> judged that {{he could no longer}} hold back the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E
50|$|Letters to a Young Scientist is a 2013 book by E. O. Wilson. Some of the <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> makes {{includes}} {{the observation that}} one doesn't need to be brilliant at math to become a great scientist.|$|R
60|$|Shefford {{launched}} {{himself so}} swiftly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> scarcely talked coherently. But he made clear the <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must save Fay, get {{her away from}} the village, let her lead him to Surprise Valley, rescue Lassiter and Jane Withersteen, and take them all out of the country.|$|R

5|$|Despite their success, {{founding}} member Anthony Field almost left {{the group in}} 2004, shortly after his marriage {{and the birth of}} his first child, due to his serious medical issues, which were worsened by The Wiggles' demanding tour schedule. After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago, Field improved his health to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was able to continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and castmembers in every city they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was 28th {{nationally in}} scoring offense (number of points scored) and 55th in total offense. Most of the Hokies' success {{came on the}} ground: Tech was 16th nationally in rushing offense but 98th in passing offense. A large reason for Virginia Tech's {{offensive}} success was running back Ryan Williams, who broke Virginia Tech's single-season rushing record that year. Entering the Chick-fil-A Bowl, he had 1,538 yards, only 110 short of the record. Tech running back Darren Evans, who tore his left anterior cruciate ligament before the season began, was held out of the Chick-fil-A Bowl, even though his recovery had progressed to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could have participated.|$|E
5|$|Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{watch the}} film's {{shooting}} and Natalie's prediction is right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is unable to}} complete the sequence because he is hassled by the setting's disorder. He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons to do his job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The pawnshop is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients are drawn on the wall. On the crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence.|$|E
50|$|Wilsonianism or Wilsonian {{are words}} used to {{describe}} {{a certain type of}} ideological perspective on foreign policy. The term comes from the ideology of United States President Woodrow Wilson and his famous Fourteen <b>Points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed would help create world peace if implemented.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{critique}} of the mystery genre, The Simple Art of Murder, Raymond Chandler ridiculed some plot <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> considered preposterous: [...] "I have known relatively few international financiers, but I rather think {{the author of this}} novel has (if possible) known fewer." ...|$|R
60|$|There were a dozen such <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would have}} liked to have settled before starting. It was silly to start out on a venture of this sort without special knowledge. He had half a mind to plead a {{forgotten}} engagement and go straight back.|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in New York over 23 days in March 2014. Most of the film was shot in a townhouse on West 162nd Street in Manhattan. Some scenes were filmed in an apartment building in Yonkers and a senior's home in Hastings-on-Hudson. The film was shot by French cinematographer Denis Lenoir, whom Glatzer and Westmoreland had met at a film screening in 1999; they had {{wanted to work with}} him ever since. During filming, Glatzer and Westmoreland attempted to divide the directing duties equally between themselves, even though Glatzer's physical condition had deteriorated to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could only communicate by typing on an iPad with a single finger.|$|E
5|$|Transfer {{speculation}} linked Kisnorbo to Wigan Athletic {{at the end}} of the 2005–06 season, but {{he decided}} to extend his stay with Leicester by signing a new three-year contract, less than 12 months after joining the club. Kisnorbo began the 2006–07 season well, scoring two goals and putting in fine rear-guard displays against Coventry City and Southend United, helping the club survive relegation yet again. He was linked with a move to Fulham during the January transfer window. His performance in the 2006–07 season earned him the players' player of the season award from his teammates. It was also at this <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became a fan favourite.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5000|$|The final {{argument}} is that Luke does not use the material within the same Marcan paragraphs as Matthew. Farrer <b>points</b> out <b>that</b> <b>he</b> takes them out of a Marcan context and reproduces them elsewhere. In chapters 10-18, Luke reassembles the teaching material {{in a way which}} makes the <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wants to make, often by pairing sayings that have not been paired together before. This may have been to produce a Christian Deuteronomy, just as it was argued that Matthew's gospel was {{in the form of a}} Christian Pentateuch.|$|R
50|$|One player plays {{against the}} other two, paying to each or {{receiving}} from each {{the difference between the}} number of <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and they hold. Each player receives twelve cards, dealt four at a time. The remainder form the stock, which is left face downwards.|$|R
50|$|In Klitschko's post fight interview, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{sought after}} this {{fight against the}} {{supposedly}} feared KO puncher, just to show <b>that</b> <b>he</b> actually had a good chin, {{and should not be}} judged on the Corrie Sanders and Brewster fights which were controversial for several reasons. <b>He</b> also <b>pointed</b> out <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn't even complain once, about the many rabbit punches and other fouls.|$|R
5|$|Clark {{eventually}} {{applied for}} a Rhodes Scholarship and learned in December of his senior year at West <b>Point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been accepted. He spent his summer at the United States Army Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He worked in the Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) program during his Rhodes Scholarship, completing his degree at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in August 1968. While he was at Oxford, a Jewish cousin of Clark's who lived in England telephoned him and informed him of his Jewish heritage, having received permission from Veneta Clark. Clark spent three months after graduation at Fort Knox, Kentucky, going through Armor Officer Basic Course, {{then went on to}} Ranger School at Fort Benning. He was promoted to captain and was assigned as commander of the A Company of the 4th Battalion, 68th Armor, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Far more to Mao's liking {{were the}} {{accounts}} of war and banditry found in the Four Great Classical Novels, including Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, and Water Margin; while also steeped in Confucian morality, they emphasised the need to fight for justice in society, {{and it is possible}} that these texts inspired his interest in history. According to his later account, it was at this <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> attained a strong belief in justice; he began to divide his lunch in two to share with a poorer boy who could not afford food. On another occasion, he got into a physical fight with an older classmate; this greatly upset his mother, who held pacifist beliefs. According to his later account, at one point he rebelled when the teacher tried to punish him for disobedience; rather than permitting himself to be beaten with a rod, he marched out of the school and into the wooded mountains. He remained there for three days, until being discovered by a family member and brought home.|$|E
5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E
5000|$|Goldberg {{was also}} active on Twitter, Reddit, Discus.com and others under the {{username}} MoonMetropolis, a [...] "free speech absolutist" [...] {{who was involved}} with the Gamergate controversy. He would frequently use this persona to criticize the works of his other personas such as Tanya Cohen, arguing against <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> himself had made.|$|R

5|$|Seeking to help Dean find a {{cure for}} the Mark of Cain, Castiel breaks Metatron out of Heaven and removes his Grace so that the Winchesters can {{interrogate}} him. Although he fails to provide any new information, Metatron is able to lead Castiel to the library where he hid the remaining fragments of Castiel's Grace. With his powers restored, Castiel helps Claire find her long-lost mother, but although Amelia sacrifices herself to save Claire, Claire accepts that the Winchesters and Castiel meant well, even speculating that she will become a Hunter herself. When Rowena – Crowley's long-lost mother – casts a spell to remove the Mark, she also casts a spell that causes Castiel to attack Crowley while she escapes, leaving Castiel driven by a greater rage to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> kills two angels until Rowena is forced to cure him.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Bede was sent, as a puer oblatus, to {{the monastery}} of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith. Bede does not say whether it was already {{intended}} at that <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be a monk. It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out as an oblate; the practice was also {{likely to have been}} common among the Germanic peoples in England. Monkwearmouth's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year. The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church. In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The Life of Ceolfrith, written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14.|$|E
