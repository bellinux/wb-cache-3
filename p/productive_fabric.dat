40|$|The {{renewal of}} the <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> {{is central to the}} debate on the {{capacity}} of France and continental Europe to meet the challenge of innovation. Simultaneous observation of the group aspect and company aspect from 1985 to 2000 qualifies the usual observation of highly active {{renewal of the}} <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> in small enterprises in contrast with a relatively closed club of large groups. Groups took over the most buoyant companies whose growth was stimulated by their joining the group. This was particularly true of SMEs, especially when taken over by large groups. The growth of large groups was due to two contrasting movements: strong external growth generated by recent acquisitions (other groups, independent firms and firms sold by other groups) partially offset by internal job cuts. European groups rely much more on restructuring than new members for their reorganisation. This lack of openness in Europe contrasts with the USA. Growth of Firms, Business Groups, Job Creation...|$|E
30|$|Cobalt-based {{nanoparticles}} are {{the most}} <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> for mechanical applications such as data capacity, attractive liquid and as a photocatalyst. Co is well-familiar ferromagnetic fabric which is commonly utilized as alloying component in lasting magnets. It comprises two shapes: hexagonal closed pressed (HCP) and confront centered cubic (FCC) [14, 15]. Co nanoparticles appear tall chemical reactivity, which makes them appropriate for catalysis. In case we need advance applications of cobalt in numerous businesses such as partition innovation, data capacity frameworks, catalysis and biomedicine, the nanoparticle is required to be depicted indistinguishable in measure, shape, uniform in composition and gem structure [16, 17].|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} economic {{approach to}} the Single European Market remains centred {{too much on the}} advantages of competitiveness and access to markets. Without under-estimating the importance of these factors, it is necessary to place them in the wider context of changes in the globalization of the economy and the techno-industrial system. The results of analysis indicate that indirect impacts such as technological change, non-technical economies of scale and industrial co-operation will have a disruptive effect on the <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> of all the less favoured regions. The traditional industrial regions will have to implement an adjustment strategy based on an intra-industrial scenario, and the lagging regions need a strategy oriented to an inter-industrial scenario...|$|E

40|$|Although {{most of the}} {{immigrants}} integrate into the job market predominantly in unskilled labor, there are xamples of effective integration into the local <b>productive</b> social <b>fabric.</b> The aim of this report is to analyze two typologies of paths in which immigrants are actors in the Neapolitan production industry. In the first case, we {{take into account the}} craftsmen who integrate themselves into local manufacturing. As these immigrants develop traditional craftsmanship (such as the production of nativity figurines) and in gastronomy (such as pizza making), they learn techniques and expertise that are peculiar to Neapolitan culture; in turn, they add their own cultural identity. In the second case, we investigate some entrepreneurs who started their own ethnic business in the restaurant industry or in the retail and wholesale trade. In each case, transformations of roles and positions of {{the immigrants}} within metropolitan economy will be examined. On one hand, we will consider their sense of belonging to transnational communities, on the other hand, we will analyze the effects of their activities on changing the image of the migrants themselves {{from the perspective of the}} local residents...|$|R

And so, in which fields to invest resources, and to develop policies and new projects of intervention? The book deals with the crises in Milan, deepening the related issues through a large set of data.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the current developments {{of small and}} medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Algeria and investigates the contribution of those enterprises to economic development and employment creation. To this end the study uses the available data from the Algerian National Office of Statistics (ONS) and the Algerian Ministry of Industry, Small and Medium Enterprise and Investment Promotion; to analyze the effectiveness of those enterprises in terms of employment and wealth creation. The results of our research reveal that SMEs in Algeria are too fragile and do not contribute effectively to creating employment opportunities in which unemployment remains high, particularly among youth. Although Algeria has managed to diversify its economy, this diversification is still weak and the <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> remains largely concentrated in the hydrocarbon sector. In addition labor-intensive SME sector remains underdeveloped...|$|E

40|$|During the 1960 s large trenched expressways were {{introduced}} into our urban centres {{to accommodate the}} booming vehicular traffic. These expressways were built on an enormous scale, often traversing entire cities. Unfortunately, some neighbourhoods have been divided and now share a noxious physical boundary. The Vine Street Expressway in Philadelphia, the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York and the Décarie Expressway in Montreal are examples of such thoroughfares. They are noisy, polluted and uninspiring spaces. The auto-centric mindset with which these expressways were designed with is being challenged. A desire to make cities more sustainable, healthy and accessible for their citizens is emerging. Given the decreased mobility issues that would arise if these structures were to be completely eliminated, {{it is necessary to}} explore architectural solutions to remedy the destructive effects these massive artefacts have on the urban fabric. Through surgical interventions along the Décarie Expressway in Montreal, I will investigate realistic if slightly optimistic solutions in which we can foster a symbiotic relationship between these massive trenched urban vehicular infrastructures and the surrounding urban space. The large scale of interventions allows for the exploration of the inherent possibilities for expressive structural bridging solutions over the expressway, new configurations of urban public space by utilizing the captured space over the infrastructural thoroughfare and a <b>productive</b> urban <b>fabric</b> which begins to address the potential of a hybrid urbanism of the twenty first century...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1979 Economic Reform, the Chinese government's authoritarian {{interference}} with land use development to serve developers {{and its own}} interests has led to incongruent development between industrialization and urbanization. This process of land commodification {{has resulted in the}} demolition of existing <b>productive</b> urban <b>fabric</b> such as urban villages. And yet paradoxically suffering from both high vacancy rates and exorbitant property prices, developed cities such as Guangzhou exemplify the impending crisis wrought by this flawed mode of urbanization. Furthermore, the urbanization {{does not take into account}} the massive urban migration that fulfills the low-wage labor force necessary to sustain a metropolis. The native villagers, who collectively own rural residential land, have elected to house the urban migrants within their own buildings. With high density, occupancy, and adaptability, the urban villages represent a resilient form of urbanism. The Xiancun village in Guangzhou is encircled by the Tianhe CBD area and epitomizes the utmost contradiction of an agricultural land enclave encircled development. The CBD is the nexus of real estate development and also houses over 20, 000 urban migrants who are excluded from public amenity access. The villages have exhausted the capacity to grow as their expansion cannot encroach upon the boundary between urban and agricultural land. The rural-urban land ownership system also prevents the urban village from receiving governmental support to develop formal amenities. At the same time, the government cannot regulate the village with its current urbanization tools or its urban policy framework. The distribution of governance remains unresolved between the city government, the village committee, and individual villagers. This thesis argues for the further densification of Xiancun and proposes an architectural framework to create a new social contract between the city government, the villagers, and the urban migrants. A series of anchoring structures with centralized infrastructure and amenities re-territorialize the distribution of resources and a strategy of architectural infill achieves higher densification. by Jinhui Huang.

40|$|Environmental Education Centers {{have emerged}} more that thirty years ago. Preoccupation {{with the local}} {{environment}} {{can lead to a}} better understanding of universal problems, since local problems are always part of the universal. The trainees fully understand that their everyday choices and their general lifestyle influence the environment, even in very distant areas. The Ministry of Education in Greece included Environmental Education in the educational system, through various measures such as the establishment of Environmental Centers. The state allocated financial resources to the Environmental Centers and managed to form a small but very creative team of people to teach Environmental Education. Students' participation in programs and activities of the Environmental Centers is assessed to be rather positive. Retrospection in the bibliography of Environmental Centers in Greece shows that they are still in the sideline of the everyday school life, that only few programs are realized in every prefecture and that when realized there is no consistency or continuity. There is also no essential evaluation of Environmental Education and it is unknown how it contributes to the promotion of sustainability in a personal and in a community level. In 2011, at the place Meliti in the prefecture of Florina, a field study was organized in order to explore the role of an Environmental Center in distant areas. The Environmental Educational Center in Meliti was established in 2003. The study was carried out by questionnaires that were filled in by personal interview. The questionnaires were addressed to three target groups: High School students, local residents and teachers who work at the Environmental Center. Through the analysis of the study's findings many conclusions arise. Those conclusions concern the relation between the center and the local <b>productive</b> and economic <b>fabric</b> and also the relation between students and environment...|$|R

Most buildings in municipality and province have been damaged or fell down so it's difficult to collect information from this structures. In this paper we discuss about the social and organizational needs of the L'Aquila citizens after {{the earthquake}}. We describe how an information system can help population to have an active part in reconstruction process supporting the development of a innovative social network. Furthermore this system acting at a social level can help the population to recover the shock caused by the loss of civil infrastructures and <b>productive</b> <b>fabric,</b> and to retie the broken social and productive links according with the sensemaking approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{more the}} {{information}} technologies {{begin to be}} incorporated into the industrial <b>productive</b> <b>fabric,</b> the more complex it becomes to organise them. It is vital to implant proactive, self-managed systems that ensure continuous operation and, therefore, business continuity. This article proposes a regeneration system for industrial production elements that transfers the concept of high availability to the manufacturing levels of the organisation, acting automatically under open protocols when there is degradation or failure of any of the components, ensuring that normal operation is resumed within a delimited time. In addition to this proposal, we present a development scenario that allows the validity of the approach to be confirmed, while verifying the drastic reduction in recovery times, the support for the significant heterogeneity existing in these scenarios and their high level of automation, while practically dispensing with the intervention of system administrators...|$|E

40|$|While the European Union (EU) {{is facing}} a further {{aggravation}} of the recession, accompanied by {{the consequences of the}} 2008 global financial crisis, the support for economic activities is proving to be more than necessary. Primary concerns of member states must be based on increased efforts in competitiveness, employment, innovation, and assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), to boost economic growth on a short-term basis or on a longer-term horizon. In this regard, this article firstly suggests that the temporary support for economic activities is absolutely necessary and the possible arrangements are examined in detail. In addition, more emphasis must be put on innovation, as it plays a crucial role for economic growth. Particular attention is also drawn to SMEs, their potential impact on the <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> and their financial constraints. The concluding remarks are focused on the European market size, and the antagonism between competition policy and industrial policy is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{articulated}} around the following chapters. After this introduction, {{the first chapter}} will underscore Africa’s development stakes. This analysis {{will enable us to}} tackle the problem of modernizing and diversifying the <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> of African economies. The second chapter will be devoted to the recent renewal of the diversification problem. It will enable us to underscore the new concerns and the development of the debate on this issue since the failure of the experiences of the 1970 ’s. The third chapter will be devoted to the presentation and the discussion of diversification gauging tools. The fourth chapter will present facts connected to the diversification of African economies. In this chapter, we took a comparative approach that would allow us to put into perspective the different sub-regional experiences as well as link Africa’s economic history in comparison to that of Asia and Latin America. In the fifth chapter, we will abandon the descriptive approach in favour of analytical elements and attempt to determine factors justifying diversification. This approach will be reflected upon in detail in the sixth chapter where we will focus our attention on the relation between diversification and economic growth. Finally, in the last chapter we will look into formulating economic policy recommendations for African countries in the area of diversification. ...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{widespread}} opinion that the Italian productive system has a presumed low capacity for innovation. Firms {{are too small to}} invest in research, there is little investment in R&D functions in relation to the GDP, and the presence of Italy in cutting edge sectors is low. Actually, perhaps all of this is a cliché. Innovation of development (and not only incremental) is actually the daily commitment for thousands of small and medium enterprises. This has to be the starting point if we want to foster the encounter between the <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> and centres for innovation, but research policies very often pursue models of success that are not easily applicable to the Italian situation. The major universities in the English-speaking world, with close links to the world of business and supported by private funding, are certainly more sensitive to orienting research towards results for application. The effective encounter between universities and the centres for industrial production in Italy is not as linear. For Italian firms, the stimulus for innovation mostly takes place locally, thanks to particularly efficient structures such as the hubs of networks and of the exchange of knowledge, but which are too marginally with respect to research poles...|$|E
40|$|This chapter has {{analysed}} {{the impact}} of EU development policies in inducing greater economic cohesion in the EU, with special focus on Objective 1 regions. The evidence that convergence has happened at country level, but that lagging regions have generally failed to catch up has been investigated with particular attention paid {{to the effects of}} Structural Fund expenditure. The results have highlighted that the Objective 1 commitments have been unbalanced towards infrastructure and business support, and that the economic returns of these development axes have been limited. New economic geography models – despite their diversity – provide some potential explanations for this. Investment in transport infrastructure, in particular, is contributing to greater economic agglomeration, making any change to the present equilibrium situation difficult. Moreover, the improvement of transport infrastructure can itself be a reason for increasing agglomeration and disparities. NEG models point out that infrastructure linking different regions usually tends to favour those regions endowed with a stronger <b>productive</b> <b>fabric,</b> and thus further reinforce agglomeration. This also contributes to explain why the expenditure in human capital, which goes in the direction of providing local economies with better skills to overcome some of the endowment shortcomings of the periphery, has been the only axis to provide significant and durable growth effects in Objective 1 regions...|$|E
3000|$|The break {{identified}} can {{be largely}} {{thought of as}} a turning point in Spanish economic policy relative to Franco’s dictatorial regime, leading to a period of a high reformist vigor brought about by the new democratic period that encompassed almost every economic area, both within the country itself and further afield, spurred by the firm intention of Spain to access to the European core. As regards Spanish internal policy, which has been progressively constrained by the European integration process, after the Pactos de la Moncloa (1977)—a battery of urgent policy measures in response to the peak in inflation—, one of the first measures taken was the adoption of the medium-term economic program 1983 – 1986 (updated twice afterwards). In this program, on the one hand, some adjustment policies were put into place with the aim of correcting the main macroeconomic imbalances, and, on the other hand, several structural reforms were fostered in order to better articulate the <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> of the country and enhance the efficient functioning of the markets. 26 It is also indisputable that the initiatives in favor of the European integration, and the legislative alignment that ensued from that, were crucial during those years which ended with Spain entering the European Economic Community (EEC) on January the 1 st 1986. Within this process, the Maastricht Treaty called for central banks’ independence of those countries aiming to join the Single Currency, which in the case of Spain led to the approval of the Law of Autonomy of the Bank of Spain (Law 13 / 1994). In the context of EMU, an inter-annual inflation target around 2  % was established. 27 [...]...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyDuring the 1990 s, {{the economies}} of Latin America and the Caribbean {{implemented}} a series of far-reaching structural reforms and took a new direction {{in terms of economic}} policy. At first, these liberalization measures were primarily focused on national financial markets and the initial opening-up of trade, but they were soon extended to include the swift liberalization of external capital flows, and some countries embarked upon intensive privatization programmes. This set of reforms generated increases in foreign trade (particularly exports) and higher foreign direct investment. However, the growth path of the region's countries {{is a far cry from}} one of intensive, steady expansion -and this document analyses possible reasons for this. This paper posits that there is no unequivocally positive link between trade openness and economic growth, given the importance of the context and how the process of liberalization is carried out. The way in which changes are processed within economies is crucial if the <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> is to be strengthened rather than destroyed. The link between increased exports and growth is not necessarily positive either, as it depends on the types of exports and their potential to generate linkages that boost the rest of the productive structure. Similarly, in the case of foreign direct investment, there is no unequivocally positive relationship between FDI and growth, as the link between the two depends on the type of FDI, its objectives and target sectors. This therefore leaves considerable scope for productive policies to promote these linkages and ensure that the region's export position and the foreign investment it receives contribute to the buoyancy of national economies. The present document closes with an analysis of precisely those characteristics that productive policies need to include if they are to achieve that objective...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{the rate}} of {{creation}} of new enterprises -or start-ups- is considered {{as one of the}} maximum exponents of competitiveness within the different economies. The interest regarding the appearance of new enterprises has made numerous governments in the continent implement a series of support measures in that direction. It is expected that the European <b>productive</b> <b>fabric</b> can be revitalized in this way, and therefore to be able to compete with the present superiority of the United States, specially in the field of the so-called 'new economy'. However, very little is still known with respect to the specific characteristics of the individuals who create those enterprises. The knowledge about the figure of the entrepreneur could allow a greater effectiveness of the measures already in operation, as well as of others that may be implemented. In this work we seek to contribute to a better knowledge of the European entrepreneur through an analysis of the characteristics of nascent entrepreneurs in Germany, a major Central European country. Given that Germany is the most important economy in the continent, and taking into account the narrow cultural interrelations with the neighbouring countries, we understand that this study can be representative of that area in Europe. For this study we will be using data from the Panel Comparability (PACO) Project, which includes a longitudinal panel of German households. The Panel data provide information on economic variables and both personal and family characteristics that may influence the decision of creating a new enterprise. It allows us to analyze the features presented by the prospective entrepreneurs before the creation of their enterprises. Thus, we can approach to the ideal situation of studying which are the factors that cause the decision of settling down as an entrepreneur. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{participation}} {{of women in}} entrepreneurial activity forty years ago was virtually an exception. However, nowadays {{this is an important}} economic and social phenomenon, with an outstanding impact on the dynamics of both advanced and emerging economies. This is significant not only from a quantitative viewpoint. The fact that female personal features, motives and managerial methods differ from those of men gives a new and interesting perspective –which is still subject to debate- to the analysis regarding training and consolidation of enterprises. Gender-related differences can be the vehicle to introduce innovative aspects that could be influential in the uncertain and changing economic environment after the current crises, particularly in those fields where business output is related to the quality of life. Adopting a previous regional model as a basis of study, we analyse in this work the characteristics that differentiate entrepreneurial women in Spain on the grounds of data collected from an own drafted survey regarding the entrepreneurial activity (607 complete questionnaires) carried out in 2009. The results obtained indicate the coexistence of two different types of entrepreneurial women. The first group gathers those women whose enterprises show, generally speaking, a similar sectoral distribution to that of the whole <b>productive</b> <b>fabric,</b> although with a slight tendency to be more present in services activities. Their characteristics and attitudes are, in general, quite similar to those registered among entrepreneurial men and many of these women come from entrepreneurial families. The second group is mainly made up of entrepreneurial women –frequently with family burdens and low qualified- devoted to services, particularly personal services and retail trade. Technological and managerial characteristics of companies managed by the entrepreneurial women belonging to this group differ substantially from the average of the economy, with a much more traditional and less innovative profile. ...|$|E
