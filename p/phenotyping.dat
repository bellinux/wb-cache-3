25|$|One of {{the issues}} that many {{researchers}} and wolfdog communities are faced with is identifying wolfdogs from pure dogs and any of the wolf species mixed into the hybrid. The most common method used by various wolfdog communities is <b>phenotyping,</b> a method that involves observing the animal's physical features. This method is often favoured for many in determining the degree of wolf and northern spitz-type dog that is in a hybrid. However, a lot of criticisms have been made by opponents within some communities who tend to point out that <b>phenotyping</b> cannot always determine the wolf-contents accurately. Another challenge involves determining exactly the domestic breeds and wolf subspecies involved in the admixture {{due to the fact that}} dogs are known to come in various breeds while gray wolves in turn come in various subspecies with many different regional ecotypes hence have different physical features depending on the subspecies used in the breeding. Although wolves are often mixed with spitz types such as Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and German Shepherds, hybrids between wolves to non-Spitz type dogs such as Poodles, Pit bulls, and Great Pyrenees also exist, the latter hybrids often having less lupine features.|$|E

Over the last years, a plethora of <b>phenotype</b> ontologies has been proposed [5 - 11]. These ontologies are developed by a variety of biomedical communities and aim to support the annotation of phenotypic observations derived either from the literature or from experimental studies, including large scale <b>phenotype</b> studies [12, 13].

Metabolic profiling of different high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) <b>phenotypes</b> of COPD patients before and after treatment may identify discriminatory metabolites that can serve as biomarkers and therapeutic agents. Patients and methods: 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR) -based metabolomics was performed on a discovery set of plasma samples from 50 patients with stable COPD. Patients were assigned into two groups {{on the basis of}} HRCT findings including <b>phenotype</b> E (n= 22) and <b>phenotype</b> M (n= 28). After budesonide–formoterol treatment (160 / 4. 5  µg × 2 inhalations twice daily for 3  months), clinical characteristics and metabolites were then compared between <b>phenotype</b> E pretreatment and posttreatment, <b>phenotype</b> M pretreatment and posttreatment, <b>phenotype</b> E pretreatment and <b>phenotype</b> M pretreatment, and <b>phenotype</b> E posttreatment and <b>phenotype</b> M posttreatment. Results: Inhaled budesonide–formoterol therapy for both <b>phenotype</b> E (emphysema without bronchial wall thickening) and <b>phenotype</b> M (emphysema with bronchial wall thickening) was effective. However, <b>phenotype</b> E and <b>phenotype</b> M were different in response to therapy. Patients with <b>phenotype</b> M in response to therapeutic effects were significantly greater compared with <b>phenotype</b> E. Certain metabolites were identified, which were closely related to the treatment and <b>phenotype.</b> Metabolic changes in <b>phenotype</b> E or <b>phenotype</b> M after treatment may be involved with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), guanosine, choline, malonate, tyrosine, glycine, proline, l-alanine, l-valine, l-threonine leucine, uridine, pyruvic acid, acetone and metabolism disturbance.

MethodsFor two <b>phenotypes</b> of the spiny cushion shrub Onobrychis cornuta, a facilitative <b>phenotype</b> that occurs in concave topographies (mesic soil) and a competitive <b>phenotype</b> that occurs in convex topographies (xeric soil), we quantified cushion traits, environmental conditions and subordinate plant species abundances (within and outside the cushions) for the two <b>phenotypes</b> in northern (low stress) and southern (high stress) exposures, and with and without grazing. Relative interaction index (RII) for subordinate species richness and abundance was calculated in the eight treatment combinations and a correspondence analysis (CA) was conducted on species composition. ResultsDrought stress exacerbated phenotypic effects in southern exposure, with loose <b>phenotypes</b> being more facilitative and tight <b>phenotypes</b> more competitive than in northern exposure. This was related to both changes in cushion traits of the two <b>phenotypes</b> and {{to an increase in}} the pool of subordinate species sensitive to cushion effects. In contrast, grazing increased cushion positive effects of both <b>phenotypes</b> through the occurrence of indirect facilitation, with loose <b>phenotypes</b> becoming more facilitative and tight <b>phenotypes</b> less competitive.
