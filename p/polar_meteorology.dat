40|$|The Esrange VHF radar (ESRAD), {{located in}} {{northern}} Sweden (67. 88 ° N, 21. 10 ° E), {{has been used}} to investigate polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE). During July and August of 1998, coherent radar imaging (CRI) was used to study the dynamic evolution of PMSE with high temporal and spatial resolution. A CRI analysis provides an estimate of the angular brightness distribution within the radar’s probing volume. The brightness distribution {{is directly related to the}} radar reflectivity. Consequently, these data are used to investigate the aspect sensitivity of PMSE. In addition to the CRI analysis, the full correlation analysis (FCA) is used to derive estimates of the prevailing three-dimensional wind associated with the observed PMSE. It is shown that regions within the PMSE with enhanced aspect sensitivity have a correspondingly high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Although this relationship has been investigated in the past, the present study allows for an estimation of the aspect sensitivity independent of the assumed scattering models and avoids the complications of comparing echo strengths from vertical and off-vertical beams over large horizontal separations, as in the Doppler Beam Swinging (DBS) method.

Global warming has increased interest in <b>polar</b> <b>meteorology.</b> This is because most of Earth's snow and ice are in polar regions, and these areas are expected to be the most affected by the snow/ice-surface albedo feedback effect.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the summer}} of 1997 {{investigations}} {{into the nature of}} polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE) were conducted using the European incoherent scatter (EISCAT) VHF radar in Norway. The radar was operated in a frequency domain interferometry (FDI) mode over a period of two weeks to study the frequency coherence of the returned radar signals. The operating frequencies of the radar were 224. 0 and 224. 6 MHz. We present the first results from the experiment by discussing two 4 -h intervals of data collected over two consecutive nights. During the first of the two days an enhancement of the FDI coherence, which indicates the presence of distinct scattering layers, was found to follow the lower boundary of the PMSE. Indeed, it is not unusual to observe that the coherence values are peaked around the heights corresponding to both the lower- and upper-most boundaries of the PMSE layer and sublayers. A Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism is offered as one possible explanation for the layering structure. Additionally, our analysis using range-time-pseudocolor plots of signal-to-noise ratios, spectrograms of Doppler velocity, and estimates of the positions of individual scattering layers is shown to be consistent with the proposition that upwardly propagating gravity waves can become steepened near the mesopause.

40|$|Two Doppler imaging systems (DIS) or wide-field imaging Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI), have {{recently}} been commissioned, one at the Auroral Station, Adventdalen, Longyearbyen, Svalbard, and the second at the IRF, Kiruna, Sweden. These instruments can provide wide-field (600 * 800 km) images of neutral wind flows in the upper thermosphere, by measuring the Doppler shift of the atomic oxygen forbidden near 630 nm, which is emitted from an altitude of approximately 240 km. From the instrument in Svalbard, at mid-winter, {{it is possible to}} observe the dayside polar cusp and the polar cap throughout the entire day, whereas from Kiruna, the night-time auroral oval is observable during the hours of darkness. Measurements of thermospheric dynamics from the DIS can be used in conjunction with observations of ionospheric plasma flows and thermal plasma densities by the EISCAT-Svalbard radar (ESR) and by EISCAT, along with other complementary observations by co-located instruments such as the auroral large-scale imaging system (ALIS). Such combined data sets will allow a wide range of scientific studies to be performed concerning the dynamical response of the thermosphere and ionosphere, and the important energetic and momentum exchange processes resulting from their complex interactions. These processes are particularly important in the immediate vicinity of the polar cusp and within the auroral oval. Early results from Svalbard in late 1995 will be discussed. The DIS in Kiruna observed two interesting geomagnetic disturbances in early 1997, the minor geomagnetic storm of 10, 11 January, and the disturbed period from 7 – 10 February. During these events, the thermospheric wind response showed some interesting departures from the average behaviour, which we attribute to the result of strong and variable Lorenz forcing (ion drag) and Joule and particle heating during these geomagnetic disturbances.

50|$|In early 2013, David Bromwich, a {{professor}} of <b>polar</b> <b>meteorology</b> at Ohio State University, and a team including Antarctic weather station experts from the University of Wisconsin, published a paper in Nature Geoscience showing that the warming in central West Antarctica was unambiguous—and likely about twice the magnitude estimated by Steig et al. The key to Bromwich et al.'s work was the correction for errors in the temperature sensors used in various incarnations of the Byrd Station record (the only long record {{in this part of}} Antarctica); miscalibration had previously caused the magnitude of the 1990s warmth to be underestimated, and the magnitude of the 2000s to be overestimated. The revised Byrd Station record is in very good agreement with the borehole temperature data from nearby WAIS Divide. A new statistical reconstruction shows significant warming over all of West Antarctic in the annual mean, driven by significant warming over most of the region in winter and spring. Summer and fall trends, are insignificant except over the Antarctic Peninsula where they are widespread only in fall. These finding are in good agreement with the 2009 study in Nature, though in general the new results show greater warming in West Antarctica and less warming over East Antarctica as a whole. Nicholas and Bromwich argue that while the warming in East Antarctica is not statistically significant, it would be greater in magnitude if not for the ozone hole. There is no evidence that any significant region of Antarctic has been cooling over the long term, except in fall. In a 2016 paper, Turner and others point out that if one considers just the last ~18 years, the trend on the Antarctic Peninsula has been cooling. This is likely connected with tropical variability, perhaps associated with the phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation.|$|E

The methodology employed {{is based on the}} algorithms currently used with geostationary satellites, modified for use with the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) infrared window and water vapor bands. These bands provide wind information throughout the troposphere in both clear and cloudy conditions. The project presents some unique challenges, including the irregularity of temporal sampling, varying viewing geometries, and uncertainties in wind vector height assignment as a result of low atmospheric water vapor amounts and thin clouds. A 30 -day case study dataset has been produced and is being used in model impact studies.

40|$|International audienceIn-situ {{measurements}} of ozone and water vapour, in the Antarctic lower stratosphere, were made {{as part of}} the APE-GAIA mission in September and October 1999. The measurements show a distinct difference above and below the 415 K isentrope. Above 415 K, the chemically perturbed region of low ozone and water vapour is clearly evident. Below 415 K, but still above the tropopause, no sharp meridional gradients in ozone and water vapour were observed. The observations are consistent with analyses of potential vorticity from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, which show smaller radial gradients at 380 K than at 450 K potential temperature. Ozone loss in the chemically perturbed region above 415 K averages 5 ppbv per day for mid-September to mid-October. Apparent ozone loss rates in the sub-vortex region are greater, at 7 ppbv per day. The data support, therefore, the existence of a sub-vortex region in which meridional transport is more efficient than in the vortex above. The low ozone mixing ratios in the sub-vortex region may be due to in-situ chemical destruction of ozone or transport of ozone-poor air out of the bottom of the vortex.

40|$|This paper investigates a {{prominent}} melting {{event of the}} Antarctic ice-sheet surface near Syowa station occurred in 2012 / 13 summer. We had seen scattering of many ice-pieces on the way of travel from Dome Fuji station (77. 5 S, 40 E, 3810 m a. s. l.) to Syowa station (69 S, 40 E, 22 m a. s. l.). In the 2012 / 13 summer, we had two extreme events, both of which may generate the ice-pieces scattering. During one of them, rainfall was observed at Syowa station, {{which was the first}} time after the previous rainfall nine years ago. During the other, very high surface air temperature (SAT), 8. 6 C, was observed at Syowa station, which was the highest SAT after 1979 / 80 summer. The lower tropospheric warming is mainly due to foehn in down-slope wind which was a branch of atmospheric circulation around a low system centered to the northeast of Syowa station. Analyses of upper air data observed by radiosondes at Syowa station and numerical simulation results by WRF showed that the latter event is more plausible to form the phenomenon of scattering of ice-pieces by surface melting though we cannot specify the event absolutely from the two candidates because there were no in-situ observation. However, such analyses of the two extreme events occurred in 2012 / 13 summer are valuable in terms of mechanism of melting or modification of Antarctic ice-sheet surface. Thus, this paper demonstrates the two synoptic-scale events with the meteorological elements observed at Syowa station, satellite data, and results obtained from numerical simulation using WRF.

40|$|Meteorological and {{physical}} {{results from the}} second version of Global Mars Multiscale Model (GM 3 -v 2) were used to investigate the impact of topography and albedo on the Martian southern polar CO 2 ice cap. Analysis of the numerical simulations revealed {{significant differences in the}} horizontal and vertical cross sections of temperature when model was run for plain topography. Wind streamlines from Ls= 20 ° (early southern fall) to Ls = 200 ° (early southern spring) for every one Ls have been analysed. Wind streamline pattern analysis shows there are two cyclonic circulations during southern winter; one around the Hellas basin (in the eastern hemisphere) and the second one around the Argyre basin (in the western hemisphere). However, between these two cyclonic cells, the pattern is anti-cyclonic. Since the albedo map which is used in the model represents a mean state of albedo for all seasons of the planet, the albedo values have been modified in the polar regions to allow for the formation of the surface ice in the model. Also this modification will be very important in the water cycle simulation. As a second step in this work, the albedo values at the poles (mostly focusing on south polar regions) were modified for a better representation of the physical situation. However, the seasonal carbon dioxide ice in the polar regions is presented in the surface ice simulation by the second version of Global Mars Multiscale Model, but it does not produce a permanent south CO 2 ice cap, and so it must be modified in the physics code in order to capture the real physical and meteorological processes.

40|$|The {{existence}} of the multi-year HALOE CH 4 data set, together with some comparisons of forward with back trajectory calculations which we have carried out, has motivated us to reexamine the question of polar vortex descent. Three-dimensional diabatic trajectory calculations {{have been carried out}} for the seven month fall to spring period in both the northern hemisphere (NH) and southern hemisphere (SH) polar stratosphere for the years 1992 - 1999. These computations are compared to fixed descent computations where the parcels were fixed at their latitude-longitude locations and allowed to descend without circulating. The forward trajectory computed descent is always less than the fixed descent due to horizontal parcel motions and variations in heating rates with latitude and longitude. Although the forward calculations estimate the maximum amount of descent that can occur, they do not necessarily indicate the actual origin of springtime vortex air. This is because more equator-ward air can be entrained within the vortex during its formation. To examine the origin of the springtime vortex air, the trajectory model was run backward for seven months from spring to fall. The back trajectories show a complex distribution of parcels in which one population originates in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere and experiences considerable descent in the polar regions, while the remaining parcels originate at lower altitudes of the middle and lower stratosphere and are mixed into the polar regions during vortex formation without experiencing as much vertical transport. The amount of descent experienced by the first population shows little variability from year to year, while the computed descent and mixing of the remaining parcels show considerable interannual variability due to the varying <b>polar</b> <b>meteorology.</b> Because of this complex parcel distribution it is not meaningful to speak of a net amount of descent experienced over the entire winter period. Since the back trajectories indicate that much of the air can come from lower altitudes than would be implied by the forward calculations, using a comparison between pre-winter and post-winter tracer profiles to estimate the amount of descent over this period will give erroneous descent amounts. In order to evaluate the computed descent, spring methane amounts were computed by mapping HALOE fall observations onto the final latitude-altitude locations of the back trajectories. These locations indicate the origin of the spring vortex air. The agreement between the computed means and the spring HALOE means is generally within 0. 1 - 0. 2 ppmv in the NH and 0. 1 - 0. 4 ppmv in the SH...|$|E
40|$|Marine-terminating outlet glaciers allow Arctic ice masses, {{such as the}} Greenland Ice Sheet, {{to respond}} very rapidly to climate change. Outlet glaciers can undergo {{kilometres}} of retreat {{in just a few}} years and changes at the glacier terminus can be transmitted far inland, resulting in acceleration and thinning of inland ice. At present, accelerated ice discharge from marine-terminating outlet glaciers accounts for one-third to one half of ice loss from Greenland and is a major mass loss mechanism on other Arctic ice caps. Consequently, understanding changes in the dynamics of marine-terminating outlet glaciers is vital for accurately forecasting future sea level rise. However, there are major uncertainties over the factors controlling their behaviour and about their response to climate change. My research focuses on these uncertainties and I use a combination of remote sensing, numerical modelling and fieldwork. I will present a selection of my recent results, in order to highlight important findings and key themes from my work. Assessment of outlet glacier retreat rates across the Arctic shows that they are behaving similarly at decadal timescales and are retreating at an accelerating rate. Of the 273 study glaciers, 97 % retreated between 2000 - 2010, compared to just 74 % between 1992 - 2000 and mean retreat rates increased from 30. 5 ma- 1 to 105. 8 ma- 1. Retreat correlates with strong reductions in sea ice concentrations, but there was very large variability in glacier retreat rates within regions and even between neighbouring glaciers. We attribute this to the shape of the glacier fjord, which strongly effects the rate at which individual glaciers retreat, and means that neighbouring glaciers may respond very differently to the same climate forcing, which makes prediction complicated. Focusing specifically on Novaya Zemlya, which is located in the Russian High Arctic and contains 24, 000 km 2 of ice, glacier retreat was particularly rapid between 2000 and 2013. However, retreat rates have now slowed, which contrasts with the rest of the Arctic. Northern Greenland is an important, but comparatively little-studied region. It covers approximately 40 % of the Greenland Ice Sheet by area and a number of large, floating ice tongues in the region have recently collapsed. At Humboldt Glacier, northern Greenland, we show that basal topography can result in order of magnitude differences in retreat rate on the same glacier. This is very important for forecasting ice loss elsewhere, as many Greenland outlet glaciers are located in similar, deep troughs. Finally, fieldwork results show that debris cover is a very strong control on melt rates in central-west Greenland and this is predicted to become increasingly important, as climate warms and the ice sheet darkens. <b>Polar</b> <b>Meteorology</b> and Glaciology Group seminar / 気水圏コロキウム 日時： 9 月 5 日（月） 14 : 00 - 14 : 50 場所：C 301 （ 3 階セミナー室...|$|E
40|$|Firstly {{the study}} the study {{introduce}} long-term trends of sea ice extent in the Arctic and Southern Ocean, their trends, seasonal variations. Then {{report on the}} sea ice condition in the southern ocean in the last season. Sea ice variations in the Arctic and in the Southern Ocean Sea ice data is indicated usually separated in the Arctic or Antarctic. This study tried to put together and summarized characteristics of their extent, seasonal differences, seasonal march and long-term trends. Although the sea ice in the Southern Ocean has increasing trend, this increasing trend {{is not enough to}} compensate the decreasing trend in the Arctic, The total sea ice in the polar regions has decreased. However total ice extent variation was modified by the seasonal march of sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean. The winter to autumn extent in the Southern Ocean leaded total sea ice area in October and November. This is due to the diverging ice field in the Southern Ocean. Sea ice area around Antarctic Continent can be separated in to several zones by latitude and season. Ice dynamics are important factor in the Antarctic sea ice change due to its high mobility. Sea ice in the Arctic is surrounded by continents and has been neither dynamic nor diverging before. It fills Arctic Ocean in winter, and it was thick. Arctic sea ice was thick and their mobility was not large, however recent decrease of ice area is making new condition of Arctic sea ice. Sea ice in the Arctic is now showing high mobility in summer and also evidenced even in winter season. Recent study introduces importance of sea ice dynamics for the ice thickness change in the Arctic. Sea ice conditions in 2015 in the Antarctic In 2014 the sea ice in the southern ocean had the record maximum of the extent since the satellite observation has started. However sea ice extent in the 2015 was almost minimum in mid-winter season. The extreme event happened in middle of July, and sea ice extent quitted. Air temperature in the Syowa station was very low in early July - 37, then suddenly jumped to - 2 C. Atmospheric circulation pattern switched from cold air burst from inland to the inflow from coastal region by the tropospheric ridge over Indian Ocean sector. AWS inland of the Antarctica, Dome F, JASE 2007, Mizuho recorded also temperature jump under the same atmospheric event. By comparing sea ice distribution in 2014 and 2015, the ice extent in the Pacific sector 120 - 140 E has changed. The upper air charts of both case show drastic difference in the pressure patterns in winter. Low pressure located in Bellingshausen Sea in July 2014, this worked for extent sea ice to the lower latitudes. On the other hand, low pressure located on the continent. This pressure pattern worked sea ice to be drifted eastward without expanding to the lower latitudes. The differences on sea are evident in the sea ice chart. 　We can see even single atmospheric event can change seasonal march of sea ice extent. <b>Polar</b> <b>Meteorology</b> and Glaciology Group seminar / 気水圏コロキウム 日時： 5 月 11 日（水） 10 : 00 - 10 : 50 場所：C 301 （ 3 階セミナー室...|$|E
