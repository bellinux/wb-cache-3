For this reason the Combined Cycle Plants with maximum supplementary firing are only of minimal importance today, {{in comparison to}} simple Combined Cycle installations. However, they have two advantages that is a) coal can be burned in the steam generator as the supplementary fuel, b) has very good <b>part</b> <b>load</b> efficiency.|$|E

This {{is due to}} seal leakages, and {{the shape}} of the {{combustion}} chamber, which results in poor combustion behavior and mean effective pressure at <b>part</b> <b>load,</b> low rpm. Meeting the emissions regulations requirements sometimes mandates a fuel-air ratio that is not conducive to good fuel economy. Acceleration and deceleration in average driving conditions also affect fuel economy. However, operating the engine at a constant speed and load eliminates excess fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|Mazda {{is still}} {{continuing}} development of next-generation of Wankel engines. The company is researching engine laser ignition, which eliminates conventional spark plugs, direct fuel injection, and sparkless HCCI ignition. These {{lead to greater}} rotor eccentricity (equating to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine), with improved elasticity and low revolutions-per-minute torque. Research by T. Kohno proved that installing a glow-plug in the combustion chamber improved <b>part</b> <b>load</b> and low revolutions per minute fuel economy by 7%. These innovations promise to improve fuel consumption and emissions. To improve fuel efficiency further, Mazda is looking at using the Wankel as a range-extender in series-hybrid cars, announcing a prototype, the Mazda2 EV, for press evaluation in November 2013. This configuration improves fuel efficiency and emissions. As a further advantage, running a Wankel engine at a constant speed gives greater engine life. Keeping to a near constant, or narrow band, of revolutions eliminates, or vastly reduces, many of the disadvantages of the Wankel engine.|$|E

2500|$|Like the Magnox, CANDU and RBMK reactors, and in {{contrast}} to the light water reactors, AGRs are designed to be refuelled without being shut down first (see Online refuelling). This on-load refuelling was {{an important part of the}} economic case for choosing the AGR [...] over other reactor types, and in 1965 allowed the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and the government to claim that the AGR would produce electricity cheaper than the best coal-fired power stations. However fuel assembly vibration problems arose during on-load refuelling at full power, so in 1988 full power refuelling was suspended until the mid-1990s, when further trials led to a fuel rod becoming stuck in a reactor core. Only refuelling at <b>part</b> <b>load</b> or when shut down is now undertaken at AGRs.|$|E
2500|$|Problems arose during {{research}} in the 1950s and 1960s. For a while, engineers were faced with what they called [...] "chatter marks" [...] and [...] "devil's scratch" [...] in the inner epitrochoid surface. They discovered that the cause was the apex seals reaching a resonating vibration, and the problem was solved by reducing the thickness and weight of apex seals. Scratches disappeared after the introduction of more compatible materials for seals and housing coatings. Another early problem was the build-up of cracks in the stator surface near the plug hole, which was eliminated by installing the spark plugs in a separate metal insert/ copper sleeve in the housing, instead of plug being screwed directly into the block housing. Toyota found that substituting a glow-plug for the leading site spark plug improved low rpm, <b>part</b> <b>load,</b> specific fuel consumption by 7%, and also emissions and idle. A later alternative solution to spark plug boss cooling was provided with a variable coolant velocity scheme for water-cooled rotaries, which has had widespread use, being patented by Curtiss-Wright, with the last-listed for better air-cooled engine spark plug boss cooling. These approaches did not require a high-conductivity copper insert, but did not preclude its use. Ford tested a rotary engine with the plugs placed in the side plates, {{instead of the usual}} placement in the housing working surface ( [...] , 1978).|$|E

40|$|Natural gas {{combined}} cycle (NGCC) power plants fitted with {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) technologies {{are projected to}} operate as mid-merit plants in the future of the decarbonised energy market. This projection stems from an inherent characteristic of the NGCC plants of being flexible in operation and able to rapidly change their output power. Therefore, it is expected that the NGCC-CCS plants will continue to operate flexibly for a range of operational loads; and therefore compliment the intermittent electricity generation of other low carbon plants to securely maintain the quality of electricity supply. This study aims to evaluate the performance of a triple pressure NGCC power plant fitted with a post combustion CO 2 capture plant (PCC) at power plant <b>part</b> <b>loads,</b> and assess the effect of the temporary shutdown of the PCC plant. Steady state simulations of the integrated plant at <b>part</b> <b>loads</b> were performed, as well as the integrated plant in non-capture operating mode. These demonstrated that the PCC steady state performance is viable at <b>part</b> <b>loads</b> down to 60 %. However, operation in non-capture mode revealed a negative impact on the steam turbine performance, especially on the low pressure (LP) and intermediate pressure (IP) cylinders, as well as the cold end.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the heat treatment operation in a manufacturing plant that produces {{different types of}} cylindrical parts. The immediate prior process to heat treatment is furnace-loading, where <b>parts</b> are <b>loaded</b> into baskets. The furnace-loading process is complex and involves issues relating to geometry, and heterogeneity in the parts and in their processing requirements. Currently, furnace-loading is accomplished by operator ingenuity; consequently, the <b>parts</b> <b>loaded</b> in heat treatment often do not use furnace capacity adequately. Efficiency in furnace operation {{can be achieved by}} improving basket utilization, which is determined by the furnace-loading process. This paper describes the development of integer and mixed integer LP models for 3 D <b>loading</b> of cylindrical <b>parts</b> into furnace baskets. The models consider the exact location of <b>parts</b> to be <b>loaded</b> on the basket and incorporate three models with different objectives; the first {{addresses the}} nesting of parts within one another, the second addresses the number of basket layers used, and the third addresses the number of baskets used.
