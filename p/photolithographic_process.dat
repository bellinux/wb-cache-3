The process of sending this data to the foundry is called tapeout because the data used to be shipped out on a magnetic tape.

40|$|Various <b>photolithographic</b> <b>processes</b> {{in a wide}} {{class of}} {{amorphous}} semiconductor films have been proposed and demonstrated in the past decade. The special features of the photosensitive amorphous semiconductor materials - non graininess, inorganic chemistry, deposition from the vapor phase and durability in dry and wet etchants - make them attractive photoresists for sub-micron fabrication of integrated circuits and integrated optics devices. The <b>photolithographic</b> <b>processes</b> in amorphous semiconductors can be classified according to four photosensitive effects : [1] light enhanced chemical reactivity, [2] photodissolution of metals, [3] light enhanced vaporization and [4] light induced crystallization. For each of these processes the mechanism, the sensitivity and the resolution are described with reference to published data, and its merit for the fabrication process of integrated circuits is discussed.

50|$|In 1971, the appellant, Golden Cape Fruits, {{decided to}} have a new {{brochure}} printed by <b>photolithographic</b> <b>process.</b> It ordered direct from a specialist photolithographer, the respondent, certain photolithographic plates. These the appellant passed on to the printer, who printed the required number of copies. Owing, however, to an error in the plates, the copies could not be used.

50|$|Photography and Chemistry First {{introduced}} in the early 1850s just before the Crimean war (1854-56) because its potential {{as a method of}} photo-reconnaissance was seen. Captain (later Sir) William de Wiveleslie Abney RE, whilst acting as department head in the 1870s, invented the <b>photolithographic</b> <b>process</b> called `Papyrotype'. The interest in chemistry continued through to the First World War and gave rise to the development, by the Corps, of chemical weapons in response to the German use of poison gas in 1915.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of optical microlithography this value {{statistically}} describes the response of a photoresist to radiation and defines the process window where the <b>photolithographic</b> <b>process</b> can vary within (e.g. how well it compensates for spatial non-uniformities of the illumination). In {{the case of}} photography, an artistic case, the measurement of exposure latitude is, by definition dependent on both personal aesthetics and artistic intentions, somewhat subjective. However, the relative differences between mediums are generally agreed upon: reversal film tends to have very little latitude, while color negative film has considerably more. Digital sensors vary.|$|E

In other industries their effects can range from a nuisance to life-threatening defects. Particles can be controlled by use of filtration and ultrafiltration. Sources can include bacterial fragments, the sloughing of the component walls within the conduit’s wetted stream and also the cleanliness of the jointing processes used to build the piping system.|$|R

This paper presents {{details of a}} thick-resist process that improves both of these factors. The technique involves exposing/developing a thick resist to form the desired pattern and then filling the features with thick film material using a doctor blading process. Minimum feature sizes of < 40 um have been achieved with a film thickness of 100 um. Registration accuracy is comparable to standard <b>photolithographic</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

Where the photoresist on the mask is exposed, the chrome can be etched away, leaving a clear path for the illumination light in the stepper/scanner system to travel through.|$|E

40|$|High {{frequency}} {{ultrasound transducer}} arrays that can operate at frequencies above 30 MHz {{are needed for}} high resolution medical imaging. A key issue {{in the development of}} these miniature imaging arrays is the need for photolithographic patterning of array electrodes. To achieve this directly on a 1 - 3 piezocomposite requires not only planar, parallel and smooth surfaces, but also an epoxy composite filler that is resistant to chemicals, heat and vacuum.

The layout is called a mask work because, in <b>photolithographic</b> <b>processes,</b> the multiple etched layers within actual ICs are each created using a mask, called the photomask, to permit or block the light at specific locations, sometimes for hundreds of chips on a wafer simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|Gold is the {{material}} of first choice for the realisation {{of a large number}} of interesting nanoscale devices and structures due to its unique chemical and optical properties. However, conventional <b>photolithographic</b> <b>processes</b> cannot be used to manufacture such tiny structures in gold (or any other material) due to limitations imposed by the diffraction of light.

The paper particularly details the printed antenna array with 8 radiation elements. Its symmetrical tapered feed network with Chebyshev distribution enables side lobe suppression greater than - 44 dB in the E-plane. In addition, the influence of tolerances in the standard <b>photolithographic</b> <b>process</b> has been investigated. The expected tolerances in the standard <b>photolithographic</b> <b>process</b> have been assumed with moderate precision in order to estimate the side lobe suppression degradation due to amplitude and phase deviations, as well as deviations to optimized values in radiating element positioning.

40|$|Novel {{functionalized}} conductive polymers are synthesised using modification {{reactions of}} polyaniline: diazonium coupling, nucleophilic addition and N-nitrosation. Diazonium salt coupling with polyaniline renders modified polymers which are soluble in common solvents and electroactive. Nucleophilic addition {{could also be}} used to modify polyaniline. Modified polymers produced by addition of thiols, carbanions and arylsulphinic acids are described. The nucleophilic addition of arylsulphinic acids to oxidized polyaniline is shown to be controlled by the oxidation and/or protonation state of the polymer. It is also possible to N-nitrosate polyaniline producing a material soluble in common solvents. The reaction could be reversed by acid treatment.

40|$|Ag {{electrodes}} with {{line width}} uniformity for large-sized plasma display panels were successfully fabricated through a <b>photolithographic</b> <b>process</b> using photosensitive Ag pastes with optimized photosensitive properties. The photosensitivity of the Ag electrode pastes in the <b>photolithographic</b> <b>process</b> was investigated {{as a function}} of the types and contents of photoinitiators, the molecular weights and acid values of acrylic binders with carboxylic acid groups, and the process variables, such as the UV-light intensity and dose, with a step tablet. This study revealed that the photoinitiator was a major parameter for the photosensitivity of the Ag electrode pastes. With the photosensitivity of the photosensitive Ag electrode pastes optimized by the study of the photoinitiator contents, Ag electrodes with line width uniformity were achieved with an HSP- 188 photoinitiator content of 15 wt % on the basis of the reactive monomers, regardless of the variation of the light dose from 250 2 2 to 350 mJ/cm(2) and intensity from 15 to 25 mW/cm(2).

50|$|Metal in Gap (MIG) {{heads are}} ferrite heads {{with a small}} piece of metal in the head gap that {{concentrates}} the field. This allows smaller features to be read and written. MIG heads were replaced with thin film heads. Thin film heads were electronically similar to ferrite heads and used the same physics, but they were manufactured using <b>photolithographic</b> <b>processes</b> and thin films of material that allowed fine features to be created. Thin film heads were much smaller than MIG heads and therefore allowed smaller recorded features to be used. Thin film heads allowed 3.5 inch drives to reach 4GB storage capacities in 1995. The geometry of the head gap was a compromise between what worked best for reading and what worked best for writing.|$|R
