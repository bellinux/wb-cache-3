G. Savio, G. Concheri and R. Meneghello designed a progressive lens applying discrete shape modelling techniques which considered both optical and geometrical parameters [2]. Likewise, Wei-Yao Hsu, Yen-Liang Liu and Yuan-Chieh Cheng proposed a <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> lens surface with a B-spline description optimizing from the average power of the far and near view zones [3]. Then a variational-difference numerical method for designing the optical freeform surface of a <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> lens was introduced, it can minimize the functional directly by finite difference method rather than approximate the solution of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation to the functional [4]. Moreover, a multioptical-axis mathematical model based on the human eye in the different observation orientations was developed to design the freeform <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> lens through theoretical and experimental investigations [5].|$|R

40|$|<b>Progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> {{leukoencephalopathy}} (PML) is a rare, deadly {{demyelinating disease}} of the central nervous system, which {{is caused by a}} reactivation of the DNA polyomavirus JC and occurs in immunosuppressed individuals. So far, only 25 cases have been described in patients with SLE and none survived without antiviral therapy and only two cases in RA. We present four additional cases from a defined area, three in SLE, of which one survived without antiviral therapy, and one case in RA, also surviving after reduction of immunosuppressive treatment. In three of these cases, diagnosis could only be confirmed by stereotactical brain biopsy, including the two surviving cases. Thus, this article illustrates the difficulty in diagnosing <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy, the need for brain biopsy in many cases, the importance of reduced immunosuppression as early as possible and the severe damage <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy can cause.

40|$|Introduction <b>Progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> {{leukoencephalopathy}} is an {{opportunistic infection}} occurring {{in patients with}} severe cellular immunodeficiency. This case highlights the role of cellular immunodeficiency in the reactivation of John Cunningham virus {{in a case of}} an early stage plasmacytoma. Case presentation A 76 -year-old Caucasian woman presented with progressive left-sided hemiparesis, accompanied by hypoesthesia, hypoalgesia and neuropsychological symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated new hyperattenuating lesions in the right thalamus and leftsided subcortically. A polymerase chain reaction test revealed 4500 copies of John Cunningham virus-deoxyribonucleic acid/ml in cerebrospinal fluid. Human immunodeficiency virus infection was ruled out. A bone marrow biopsy showed an early stage immunoglobulin G-kappa plasmacytoma. Cidofovir (5 mg/kg) weekly for three weeks was started. A significant improvement of her neuropsychological symptoms was achieved, but motor system and sensory symptoms did not change. Conclusions This case shows a rapid course of <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy with severe residual deficits. In the diagnostic workup of all patients with atypical neurologic symptoms or immunodeficiency, <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> leukoencephalopathy should be included as a differential diagnosis...|$|R
