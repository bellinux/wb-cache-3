40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} for teaching a humanoid-robot a task online without <b>pre-set</b> <b>data</b> provided in advance. In our approach, human acts as a collaborator and also as a teacher. The proposed approach enables the humanoid-robot to learn a task through multi-component interactive architecture. The components are designed with the respect to human methodology for learning a task through empirical interactions. For efficient performance, the components are isolated within one single API. Our approach {{can be divided into}} five main roles: perception, representation, state/knowledge-up-dating, decision making and expression. Important components in our approach such as, decision making, process tracking, observation and knowledge data are described for teaching the robot a task. A conducted empirical experiment for the proposed approach is to be done by teaching a Fujitsu’s humanoid-robot ‘Hoap- 3 ’ an X-O game strategy and its results are to be done and explained...|$|E
40|$|Bullying {{has emerged}} as a {{behavior}} with deleterious effects on youth; however, prevalence estimates vary based on measurement strategies employed. We conducted a systematic review and content analysis of bullying measurement strategies {{to gain a better understanding}} of each strategy including behavioral content. Multiple online databases (i. e., PsychInfo, MedLine, ERIC) were searched to identify measurement strategies published between 1985 and 2012. Included measurement strategies assessed bullying behaviors, were administered to respondents with ages of 12 to 20, were administered in English, and included psychometric data. Each publication was coded independently by two study team members with a <b>pre-set</b> <b>data</b> extraction form, who subsequently met to discuss discrepancies. Forty-one measures were included in the review. A majority used differing terminology; student self-report as primary reporting method; and included verbal forms of bullying in item content. Eleven measures included a definition of bullying, and 13 used the term "bullying" in the measure. Very few definitions or measures captured components of bullying such as repetition, power imbalance, aggression, and intent to harm. Findings demonstrate general inconsistency in measurement strategies on a range of issues, thus, making comparing prevalence rates between measures difficult.

40|$|Background: Phantom limb pain (PLP) is {{characterized}} by the anatomical shifting of neighbouring somatosensory and motor areas into a deafferented cortical area of the brain contralateral to the amputated limb. It has been shown that maladaptive neuroplasticity is positively correlated to the perception of PLP in amputees. Recent studies support the use of graded motor imagery (GMI) and its component to alleviate the severity of PLP and disability. However, there is insufficient collective empirical evidence exploring the effectiveness of these treatment modalities in amputees with PLP. This systematic review will therefore explore the effects of GMI and its individual components on PLP and disability in upper and lower limb amputees. Methods: We will utilize a customized search strategy to search PubMed, Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, DARE, Africa-Wide Information and Web of Science. We will also look at clinicaltrials. gov ([URL] Pactr. gov ([URL] and EU Clinical trials register ([URL] for ongoing research. Two independent reviewers will screen articles for methodological validity. Thereafter, data from included studies will be extracted by two independent reviewers through a customized <b>pre-set</b> <b>data</b> extraction sheet. Studies with a comparable intervention and outcome measure will be pooled for meta-analysis. Studies with high heterogeneity will be analysed through random effects model. A narrative data analysis will be considered where there is insufficient data to perform a meta-analysis. Discussion: Several studies investigating the effectiveness of GMI and its different components on PLP have drawn contrasting conclusions regarding the efficacy and applicability of GMI in clinical practice. This systematic review will therefore gather and critically appraise all relevant data, to generate a substantial conclusion and recommendations for clinical practice and research on this subject...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} new solar radiospectrograph of the University of Athens {{operating}} at the Thermopylae Station since 1996. Observations cover the frequency range from 110 to 688 MHz. The radiospectrograph has a 7 -meter parabolic antenna and two receivers operating in parallel. One is a sweep frequency receiver {{and the other}} a multichannel acousto-optical receiver. The data acquisition system consists of a front-end VME based subsystem and a Sun Sparc- 5 workstation connected through Ethernet. The two subsystems are operated using the VxWorks real-time package. The daily operation is fully automated: pointing of the antenna to the sun, starting and stopping the observations at <b>pre-set</b> times, <b>data</b> acquisition, data compression by ‘silence suppression’, and archiving on DAT tapes. The instrument can be used either by itself to study the onset and evolution of solar radio bursts or in conjunction with other instruments including the Nançay Decametric Array and the WIND/WAVES RAD 1 and RAD 2 low frequency receivers to study associated interplanetary phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{critically}} review, appraise {{and evaluate}} the available literature {{with regard to the}} impact that negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has on the quality of life reported by patients. Methods: A systematic review was undertaken using Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases. Publications between 1950 and 2011 were included and all relevant papers were reviewed irrespective of the data collection method if they reported the use of NPWT and patient-reported quality of life data. Abstracts were read for relevance and to determine if the studies met the predetermined inclusion criteria. Once vetted, full copies of the papers were obtained and two reviewers independently completed a <b>pre-set</b> <b>data</b> collection form that was then sent to the third reviewer to enable central collation and establish the themes reported. Data queries were checked and consensus achieved by discussion. Results: Only five studies met the inclusion criteria, all had methodological flaws, and are of small sample sizes. While there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that NPWT has advantages in reducing healing times as opposed to the use of conventional therapy, there is very little evidence to support the use of NPWT in relation to its impact on patient reported quality of life from either a positive, neutral or negative perspective. Conclusion: It is clear from the review that more studies need to be undertaken in this area of practice before any clear consensus can be achieved. Until such time, practitioners working in the field will have to continue to assess patients on an individual basis by giving information about the therapy with the aim that the patient can make an informed choice about the impact that NPWT may have on their individual quality of life...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{prospect}} of reducing the transmission power required to operate links within an underwater acoustic network by minimizing the total capacity of the network while maintaining certain data flow requirements. This is motivated by an approximate model for underwater acoustic transmission power that demonstrates that decreasing the distance between nodes, the capacity of a link between nodes, or both, reduces the power required to send a signal between those nodes. A procedure for determining a minimum-sum capacity network developed by Gomory and Hu in 1961 is applied to several common network topologies including tree, ring, and mesh structures. The approximate model for transmission power, which {{takes into account the}} large effects of signal attenuation and noise, is used to evaluate these minimal networks. The networks derived from the Gomory-Hu procedure are shown to require less total transmission power to operate the entire network. In order to maintain the <b>pre-set</b> <b>data</b> flow requirements in the Gomory-Hu network, it is necessary to send information across multiple parallel paths in the network. Results show that because of this extra transmission distance, the networks derived via the Gomory-Hu procedure and their consequent parallel routing schemes are less efficient in terms of a single-transmission from one node to another node in the network than their counterpart networks that operate via a direct-access method, although the transmission power requirements per node are reduced. This parallel routing scheme implies that the Gomory-Hu networks could be beneficial for multi-cast transmission. Results show that applying the Gomory-Hu procedure to networks intended for multi-cast instead of single-cast transmission could be a promising way of increasing the efficiency of the overall network. by Kathryn E.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to test the quality of data {{collected}} by a mobile hearing screening application (hEAR) against the gold standard of pure tone audiometry administered by a certified audiologist. hEAR used 7 pre-set frequencies (125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz), which were the independent variables, and recorded measurements as sound pressure levels in decibels (dB) during three trials. In total, 30 subjects were recruited {{from the general population}} at Texas A&M University. Subjects were randomly assigned and counterbalanced in their assignment to a ?quiet? room and a ?noisy? room. Subjects used the hEAR mobile hearing screening application to self-administer hearing screening tests. Subjects also had hearing screening examinations performed by a certified audiologist at the identified <b>pre-set</b> frequencies. <b>Data</b> were analyzed using a mixed effect model and testing for repeated measures at 95 % confidence intervals, results were separated by room. It was found that the hEAR trials differed from the audiologist trial at almost all frequencies in a noisy environment, but only at 2000 Hz and 8000 Hz for the quiet environment. It was also found that the app trials were very similar to one another (trials 1 & 2, trials 1 & 3 and trials 2 & 3 similar to each other) in the noisy environment; while they statistically differed from one another at almost all frequencies except 125 Hz in a quiet environment. Further research is needed so as to develop hEAR as an effective alternative to an audiologist-administered pure tone hearing test, which can consequently be used for better compliance with OSHA?s hearing screening requirements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} new digital solar radio {{spectrograph}} {{located at the}} Thermopyles station, Greece, operated by the University of Athens. Observations cover the range from 110 to 600 MHz, using a 7 -m parabolic antenna. The reception system uses two techniques in parallel: sweep frequency and multi-channel, the latter being based on the Acousto-Optical technique. The data acquisition system is based on two subsystems, a Sun Sparc- 5 workstation and a front end based on a VME Motorola system. The two subsystems are connected through the Ethernet and are operated using the VxWorks real-time package. The daily operation is completely automated: pointing of the antenna to the sun, starting and stopping the observations at <b>pre-set</b> times, acquiring <b>data,</b> compressing data by silence suppression in real time, and archiving the data on a routine manner on DAT tapes. Apart from its usual function, this instrument {{will be used in}} conjunction with other instruments, including the Nançay decameter array and the low frequency radio receivers on the Wind spacecraft. 1...|$|R
40|$|Multimedia {{learning}} {{is widely used}} in life science education where the use of pictures and text can bring complex structures and processes to life. However the impact on academic performance and deeper understanding is not well documented. We therefore carried out a systematic review {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of multimedia resources in tertiary level life science education. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted; studies were selected based on stringent <b>pre-set</b> criteria, and <b>data</b> were extracted for meta-analysis. In total, 17 studies were used in the meta-analyses with a total population of 2, 290 students. The results show that, when used as a substitute for laboratory practicals, multimedia improved student learning gains assessed with an end-of-year examination, (mean difference 7. 06, ± 4. 61). Although it did not improve short-term learning gains in this scenario, multimedia improved learning gains in 10 of the 16 sub-group comparisons made across all the studies. Overall, multimedia learning was more effective than many traditional educational methods although the numbers of studies included in the analysis were ultimately considered to be small due to many exclusions from the studies included in the analysis. Therefore, more good quality trials are required to evaluate a broader range of scenarios relevant to modern practices. Studies would benefit from being rigorous in design with good quality reporting of all aspects of methodology and study results. HEA Subject Centre for Bioscienc...|$|R
40|$|The {{changing}} {{environment and the}} attitude of the world about business have brought immense eccentricities in the behaviour of the organizations. It stimulated direct or indirect influence on the performance of employees. Profit maximization, limited labour, reduction of manufacturing cost, maximum output, customer satisfaction and time management became the major preferences for organizations. It is a matter of fact that employees play a role of human capital in the development of an organization and considered as a back bone of organization. A need developed to balance these current circumstances because employees were mostly affected. The concept of performance management had been introduced as a useful tool for organizations. There are many factors for the success of organization and performance management is one of those influencing factor. It became an integral part of organization and enrooted itself in each and every department. This research is carried out on the role of performance management in a business organization. Most of the researchers have been conducting their research work on the organizations target achieved by performance management. This research brings out another aspect that the employees can also be benefited from this imperative tool in retail sector. Further this research find outs the perception of employees in relation to performance management. Furthermore if the employees of the organization are satisfied with the advanced tools and techniques of performance management then there will be an appropriate working environment which will be beneficial for both of them. There are four aims and objectives of the research. The first objective finds out the level of importance of such techniques which makes organization successful, second investigates on practical implementation of these tools and techniques, third brings information regarding their effects and finally the research analysis is the merits and demerits of such techniques on employees. This research has been conducted with positivism and Interpretivism paradigms. A survey has been carried out on large sample of population in the form of questionnaires and interviews. Deductive approach had been used in this research because of population size and <b>pre-set</b> hypothesis. Primary <b>data</b> has been collected from the survey and secondary data has been collected in literature review in the form of existing material. The results show that the employees have good understanding of the process of performance management and they are in favour of keeping performance management in an organization as a progressive tool. They believe that performance management is that process which can improve the working environment of the organization as well as can make organization to compete against its competitors. On the other hand it has been drawn from the results that in some departments the management {{has not been able to}} transfer information about performance management techniques properly to the employees who resulted in poor performance and brought a bad impact of performance management on employees. However, positive impacts of performance management have been found on the overall performance. The research has pointed out few areas of development and recommends future researches...|$|R
