5|$|From {{the early}} 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added {{programs}} and staff that continued {{the transformation of}} the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from MIT and started the first <b>pathogen-free</b> animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956. Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr. donated $15million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the Association of American Universities, an organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education.|$|E
500|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} of the Mount Pleasant plant was developed to decrease potential hazards to food safety. [...] WLF representatives have stated {{that the goal of}} the Mount Pleasant plant is to create a <b>pathogen-free</b> environment. [...] Because company officials believe that the food safety aspects of the plant are unique in the meat industry, they submitted the plant design for patent approval through the U.S. Patent Office. The Mount Pleasant plant is located about [...] from either the West Liberty or Sigourney plants. [...] This reduces the likelihood that pathogens will be carried either by air or foot traffic from a raw production area to Mount Pleasant's ready-to-eat production.|$|E
500|$|Some {{strains of}} fish are more {{resistant}} than others, even within species; using resistant strains may {{help reduce the}} incidence and severity of whirling disease in aquaculture. [...] There is also some circumstantial evidence that fish populations can develop resistance to the disease over time. [...] Additionally, aquaculturists may avoid M. cerebralis infections by not using earthen ponds for raising young fish; this keeps them away from possibly infected tubificids and {{makes it easier to}} eliminate spores and oligochaetes through filtration, chlorination, and ultraviolet bombardment. To minimise tubificid populations, techniques include periodic disinfection of the hatchery or aquaculture ponds, and the rearing of small trout indoors in <b>pathogen-free</b> water. Smooth-faced concrete or plastic-lined raceways that are kept clean and free of contaminated water keep aquaculture facilities free of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{technological}} {{solution was}} implemented in 1885 – obtaining fresh {{water from the}} sea by desalination. This had been proposed {{as far back as}} 1869, when it was envisaged that condensers would be used to produce [...] of pure water per day from seawater. The idea was initially rejected due to the high cost but by the mid-1880s concern was growing that Gibraltar's water supply would be inadequate {{in the event of a}} new siege. The War Office had a change of heart and agreed to fund the project. The first purified water from the newly installed condensers was produced in March 1885. Because Gibraltar still had no distribution network for drinking water, it could only be delivered from barrels in donkey carts or by hand. Despite the cost, the new water supply enabled the inhabitants of Gibraltar, for the first time in their history, to rely on a source of <b>pathogen-free</b> water. The new system proved its worth only a few weeks after it was installed when cholera broke out in the town of La Línea de la Concepción just across the border with Spain. 191 of La Línea's 12,000 inhabitants died of the disease, but only 22 died in Gibraltar – about five per cent of the death toll in the previous epidemic.|$|E
50|$|The {{price for}} a healthy and <b>pathogen-free</b> monkey is between US$2,000 and US$3,000 each.|$|E
5000|$|... 1980 - Taconic {{developed}} the first Isolated Barrier Unit system, {{a method of}} housing rodents in a <b>pathogen-free</b> environment.|$|E
50|$|Clivus Multrum {{today has}} {{designed}} {{a number of}} different prototypes and sizes. The process is advertised as enclosed, long-term composting and is characterized as being odor-free, low maintenance, and able to yield a clean, <b>pathogen-free</b> fertilizer {{that can be used in}} agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} compounds can {{be added}} to the water of infected adult fish and fry. Alternatively, the antibiotic oxytetracycline can be given to adults, fry and broodstock. To prevent the disease, it is necessary to ensure water is <b>pathogen-free</b> and that water hardening is completed effectively for eggs.|$|E
50|$|This project aims {{to provide}} clean, <b>pathogen-free,</b> {{water to the}} rural {{population}} {{who do not have}} access to electric water purifiers because of high cost and non-availability of electricity. Three different technology water disinfection units are developed: Solar disinfection unit, UV-based disinfection unit, and uLtra filtration fisinfection unit.|$|E
50|$|However, {{disease control}} is {{reasonably}} successful for most crops. Disease control {{is achieved by}} use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as crop rotation, <b>pathogen-free</b> seed, appropriate planting date and plant density, control of field moisture, and pesticide use.|$|E
5000|$|Autoimmunity: The {{idea that}} ageing results from an {{increase}} in autoantibodies that attack the body's tissues. A number of diseases associated with ageing, such as atrophic gastritis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, are probably autoimmune in this way. However, while inflammation is very much evident in old mammals, even completely immunodeficient mice raised in <b>pathogen-free</b> laboratory conditions still experience senescence.|$|E
50|$|Incinerating toilets may be {{powered by}} electric, gas, dried feces or other energy sources. They {{are used in}} environments where human waste cannot be {{otherwise}} dumped, or where normal toilets are too expensive or cumbersome to install. Such toilets gather excrement in a holding tank and then incinerate it, reducing it to <b>pathogen-free</b> ash. Some will also incinerate grey and black water created from showers and sinks.|$|E
50|$|The pigs {{that were}} {{released}} onto Auckland Island {{are derived from}} domestic breeds of European and Asian pig lineages that are now rare or extinct. Population genetic variation is low within the Auckland Island pig population compared to other breeds of pigs such as European and Asian. These relatively <b>pathogen-free</b> pigs {{have been used to}} derive a biocertified herd as a source of cells for xenotransplantationhttp://www.lctglobal.com/products-lct.php.|$|E
50|$|Hering is also widely {{recognized}} {{as a leader in}} islet xenotransplantation. His research group was the first to demonstrate long-term diabetes reversal after adult pig islet xenotransplants in nonhuman primates, an accomplishment that has reinvigorated the field of xenotransplantation. Hering co-founded Spring Point Project, an organization established to generate designated <b>pathogen-free,</b> ‘medical-grade’ source pigs for planned clinical translation of islet xenotransplantation. To minimize the need for recipient immunosuppression, Hering is partnering with leaders in immunology to integrate preemptive treatment with donor antigen and immune-engineering of donor islets into a safe and successful rejection prophylaxis strategy.|$|E
50|$|Some {{cultural}} controls include pruning out infectious plant material, planting in <b>pathogen-free</b> fields, {{and practicing}} proper sanitation techniques. In the Philippines, pruning and cutting out patches of infected tissue {{have prevented the}} spread of the pathogen in the plant during disease outbreaks. General sanitation practices have also reduced the spread of inoculum. When planters failed to maintain sanitary equipment, seeds, and soil, they witnessed severe fruit infections. The more freckles seen on the leaves of the plant, the more the fruit develops symptoms of the disease. Inversely, less freckles corresponded to less disease.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{indicated}} that infection of human tissues by PERVs is very possible, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. An immunosuppressed condition could potentially permit a more rapid and tenacious replication of viral DNA, and would later on have less difficulty adapting to human-to-human transmission. Although known infectious pathogens {{present in the}} donor organ/tissue can be eliminated by breeding <b>pathogen-free</b> herds, unknown retroviruses can {{be present in the}} donor. These retroviruses are often latent and asymptomatic in the donor, but can become active in the recipient. Some examples of endogenous viruses that can infect and multiply in human cells are from baboons (BaEV), cats (RD114), and mice.|$|E
50|$|With aeroponics, the {{deleterious}} effects of seed stocks that {{are infected with}} pathogens can be minimized. As discussed above, {{this is due to}} the separation of the plants and the lack of shared growth matrix. In addition, due to the enclosed, controlled environment, aeroponics can be an ideal growth system in which to grow seed stocks that are <b>pathogen-free.</b> The enclosing of the growth chamber, in addition to the isolation of the plants from each other discussed above, helps to both prevent initial contamination from pathogens introduced from the external environment and minimize the spread from one plant to others of any pathogens that may exist.|$|E
50|$|The anthracnose, a canker {{caused by}} Colletotrichum gloeosporiodes, is a {{pathogen}} {{of the passion}} fruit creating dark and sunken lesions of the trunk. By attacking mature passion fruit trees, these lesions cause intense defoliation and fruit rot. Many leaves die due to the foliar lesions and the skin of fruits becomes papery. Under warm and humid conditions, this disease can worsen, causing red and orange spores eventually killing the plant. Infection is carried out through the residues of the passion flower, infected seeds, seedlings, and cuttings. Managing this disease involves a combination of using <b>pathogen-free</b> seedlings, eliminating infected areas, and improving ventilation and light conditions. Copper-based fungicides on injured areas can {{prevent the spread of}} disease.|$|E

[...] This reduces the likelihood that pathogens will be carried either by air or foot traffic from a raw production area to Mount Pleasant's ready-to-eat production.|$|E
5000|$|Influenza {{vaccines}} {{are produced}} in <b>pathogen-free</b> eggs that are 11 to 12 days old. The {{top of the}} egg is disinfected by wiping it with alcohol and then the egg is candled to identify a non-veinous area in the allantoic cavity where a small hole is poked {{to serve as a}} pressure release. A second hole is made {{at the top of the}} egg, where the influenza virus is injected in the allantoic cavity, past the chorioallantoic membrane. The two holes are then sealed with melted paraffin and the inoculated eggs are incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. During incubation time, the virus replicates and newly replicated viruses are released into the allantoic fluid ...|$|E
50|$|From 2011, a {{team from}} the University of Waterloo led by Tahbit Chowdhury and Gordon Graff {{examined}} vertical RAS aquaculture designs aimed at producing protein-rich fish species. However, because of its high capital and operating costs, RAS has generally been restricted to practices such as broodstock maturation, larval rearing, fingerling production, research animal production, specific <b>pathogen-free</b> animal production, and caviar and ornamental fish production. As such, research and design work by Chowdhury and Graff remains difficult to implement. Although the use of RAS for other species {{is considered by many}} aquaculturalists to be currently impractical, some limited successful implementation of RAS has occurred with high-value product such as barramundi, sturgeon, and live tilapia in the US eels and catfish in the Netherlands, trout in Denmark and salmon is planned in Scotland and Canada.|$|E

50|$|P. gingivalis {{has been}} {{associated}} with increasing the virulence of other commensal bacteria in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. P. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles were found to be necessary for the invasion of epithelial cells of Tannerella forsythia. P. gingivalis short fimbriae were found to be necessary for coculture biofilm formation with Streptococcus gordonii. Interproximal and horizontal alveolar bone loss in mouse models are seen in coinfections involving P. gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The role of P. gingivalis as a community activist in periodontitis is seen in specific <b>pathogen-free</b> mouse models of periodontal infections. In these models, P. gingivalis inoculation causes significant bone loss, which is a significant characteristic of the disease. In contrast, germ free mice inoculated with a P. gingivalis monoinfection incur no bone loss, indicating that P. gingivalis alone cannot induce periodontitis.|$|E
50|$|Effective {{management}} for Alternaria dauci involves preventing the introduction {{and development of}} the disease. One of the best practices to avoid infection is to plant <b>pathogen-free</b> seed or seed treated with hot water at 50 degrees Celsius for twenty minutes. In addition to seed treated with fungicide or hot water, once harvest is complete it is imperative to turn the carrot residue under the soil. The pathogen only survives on infected plant debris, allowing this practice to hasten decomposition of the debris. Crop rotation will allow the debris enough time to decompose. Recommendations vary depending on location, but 2 years is the minimum allowance for rotation. Planting carrots continuously in the same field will result in increased infection. New fields should not be located near previously infected fields in order to prevent contamination through dispersal. Dispersal can occur through multiple avenues such as rain splash, farm equipment, workers, and insects.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial {{chemicals}} {{have generally}} {{proven to be}} ineffective in controlling the pathogen and are not recommended {{as a means of}} control. [...] In regions where the pathogen is, a strategy of integrated disease management is the best strategy to reduce any impact of the pathogen. Using <b>pathogen-free</b> planting materials is a necessity. Planting resistant cultivars minimizes the ill effects of the pathogen, although no completely immune cultivars are now available. Finally, a good rotation system that follows susceptible crops with resistant or nonhost crops can assist in diminishing the pathogen. The pathogen is listed as a select agent in the United States; if the pathogen is detected by a proper authority, a number of management protocols may be implemented. These can range from surveys to quarantines of infected and potentially infected plant material, which in turn may lead to larger eradication and sanitation programs.|$|E

50|$|A large threat {{within the}} cheetah {{population}} is inbreeding in captive cheetahs and the Cheetah Conservation Fund has begun {{the practice of}} assisted reproduction including techniques such as artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, and cryopreservation. Artificial insemination has increased the probability of cheetah impregnation as well as viable offspring. Artificial insemination gives researchers the ability to enhance gene flow between wild cheetahs as well as captive cheetahs, decreasing {{the negative effects of}} inbreeding. Artificial insemination also promotes gene flow because this technique allows scientists to breed sexually incompatible cheetahs (zoos). In vitro fertilization makes breeding cheetahs easier because researchers do not have to transport cheetahs from the wild to breed with the cheetahs in captive-breeding programs. Artificial insemination is important for researchers to be able to produce strong offspring from genetically valuable cheetahs. In vitro fertilization also gives researchers the option to temporarily capture female cheetahs to impregnate and raise healthy young and then release after short periods of time. Due to cheetahs' being easily susceptible to certain types of viral and bacterial diseases, cryopreservation, allows scientists to preserve the embryos and gametes of genetically strong cheetahs from the wild and inseminate captive-bred cheetahs, enhancing the allele frequency of specific genes. Cryopreservation {{is one of the few}} techniques in which researchers are able to inseminate captive cheetahs with <b>pathogen-free</b> gametes. The preservation of gametes and embryos of cheetahs has given researchers and conservationists the tools to understanding the basic reproductive biology of cheetahs, creating a path for researchers to develop better ways to breed and maintain cheetahs.|$|E
50|$|Control {{of plant}} {{diseases}} {{is crucial to}} the reliable production of food, and it provides significant reductions in agricultural use of land, water, fuel and other inputs. Plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent disease resistance, but there are numerous examples of devastating plant disease impacts (see Irish potato famine, chestnut blight), as well as recurrent severe plant diseases (see rice blast, soybean cyst nematode, citrus canker). However, disease control is reasonably successful for most crops. Disease control is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as crop rotation, use of <b>pathogen-free</b> seed, appropriate planting date and plant density, control of field moisture, and pesticide use. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings. Continuing advances in the science of plant pathology are needed to improve disease control, and to keep up with changes in disease pressure caused by the ongoing evolution and movement of plant pathogens and by changes in agricultural practices. Plant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates indeed that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss. To solve this issue, new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and spectroscopy and biophotonics that are able to diagnostic plant health and metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Bacteria {{communicate}} {{among themselves}} and with other living forms in their environment via nano-scale membrane vesicles in their bacterial outer membranes. These vesicles are involved in trafficking bacterial cell signaling biochemicals, which may include DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins and allied virulence molecules. This communication happens in microbial cultures to oceans, inside animal/plant hosts and wherever bacteria may thrive. Gram negative microorganisms deploy their periplasm to secrete bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) for trafficking bacterial biochemicals to target cells in their environment (Fig. 1); OMVs also carry endotoxic lipopolysaccharide initiating disease process in their host. This mechanism imparts a variety of benefits like, long-distance delivery of bacterial secretory cargo with minimized hydrolytic degradation and extra-cellular dilution, also supplemented with other supportive molecules (e.g., virulence factors) to accomplish a specific job and yet, keeping a safe-distance from the defense arsenal of the targeted cells. Biochemical signals trafficked by OMVs may vary largely during 'war and peace' situations. In 'complacent' bacterial colonies, OMVs {{may be used to}} carry DNA to 'related' microbes for genetic transformations, and also translocate cell signaling molecules for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. During 'challenge' from other cell types around, OMVs may be preferred to carry degradation and subversion enzymes. Likewise, OMVs may contain more of invasion proteins at the host-pathogen interface (Fig. 1). It is expected, that environmental factors around the secretory microbes are responsible for inducing these bacteria to synthesize and secrete specifically-enriched OMVs, physiologically suiting the immediate task. Thus, bacterial OMVs, being strong immunomodulators, can be manipulated for their immunogenic contents and utilized as potent <b>pathogen-free</b> vaccines for immunizing humans and animals against threatening infections.|$|E
40|$|Candida albicans, {{administered}} by gastric intubation, persisted in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic mice {{for long periods}} but was eliminated within {{a relatively short period}} of time in <b>pathogen-free</b> mice. Oxytetracycline {{administered by}} mouth had no reproducible effect on the persistence of C. albicans in the gastrointestinal tract of either germ-free or <b>pathogen-free</b> mice. Prolonged administration of streptomycin extended the time that C. albicans could be recovered from feces of <b>pathogen-free</b> mice when compared to mice not receiving the antibiotic or those receiving a single large dose. There was a brief interval of time during which C. albicans could not be recovered from the feces of gnotobiotic mice contaminated with certain intestinal bacteria, but eventually all mice began to shed the fungus again. C. albicans administered by mouth was not pathogenic for germ-free or <b>pathogen-free</b> mice. It can be concluded from these findings that mice do not possess an innate resistance to C. albicans but that <b>pathogen-free</b> mice do possess some ecological mechanism which prevents establishment of the fungus in their gastrointestinal tract. The reason for the difference in colonization of C. albicans in germ-free or gnotobiotic mice and <b>pathogen-free</b> mice was not determined...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{occurrence}} {{and distribution of}} various strains of Haemophilus parasuis in southern Ontario swine, organisms isolated from healthy swine, from specific <b>pathogen-free</b> and conventional herds, and from disease cases were examined using restriction endonuclease fingerprinting analysis. In most herds, several strains of H. parasuis could be detected although one or two strains usually predominated. Individual animals were colonized by a single or limited number of strains. In several cases, the same strains were isolated {{from more than one}} specific <b>pathogen-free</b> herd. Conventional herds carried a more heterogeneous population of H. parasuis. Only one strain was isolated which was common to more than one conventional herd. No strains were isolated which were common to both specific <b>pathogen-free</b> and conventional herds. None of the strains isolated from disease cases were found in healthy conventional or specific <b>pathogen-free</b> swine examined in this study...|$|E

Thus, {{the ability to}} eliminate this agent from pig herds would be {{an important step in}} producing human <b>pathogen-free</b> pork. Pig herds free from Y. enterocolitica O: 3 /biovar 4 have been established and maintained. According to serologic and cultural testing results, 15 of 16 specific <b>pathogen-free</b> herds were free from Y. enterocolitica O: 3 /biovar 4; this closed breeding pyramid has remained free from this organism since 1996.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for the quantification of microsclerotia ofVerticillium dahliae {{with an image}} analysis system was compared with counting by eye. Colonised potato plant material was used from plants grown in <b>pathogen-free</b> soil in a greenhouse and from twelve crops (including four potato cultivars) grown outdoors in pots filled with <b>pathogen-free</b> soil under natural conditions. The values obtained from the potato material from the greenhouse were comparable for both methods. Variation in the results mainly resulted from sampling errors. The numbers of microsclerotia in plants grown outdoors were overestimated by image analysis for most crops. The source of the error {{was related to the}} presence of plant and soil particles that did not discolour during boiling of the samples in sodium hydroxide. Image analysis was a suitable and reliable method for assessing the number of microsclerotia only in potato haulm samples from plants grown in <b>pathogen-free</b> soil in the greenhouse...|$|E
