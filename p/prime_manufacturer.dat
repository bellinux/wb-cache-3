50|$|Over time, the AS350 Écureuil/AStar has {{received}} further development; while the aircraft's design remains broadly similar, various aspects and {{systems such as}} the rotor system, powerplants, and avionics have been progressively improved. On 6 February 1987, a prototype AS350 B2 flew with a fenestron tail-rotor {{in the place of}} its normal conventional counterpart. On 1 March 1997, the first AS350 B3, equipped with an Arriel 2B engine, performed its first flight. Various conversion programs and addons for AS350s have been produced and are offered by multiple third-party 'aftermarket' aerospace firms in addition to those available directly from the type's <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> New variants of the Arriel-powered AS350B, the AS350 B1, AS350 B2, and AS350 B3, were progressively introduced; the later B3 differing from preceding models by the increasing use of digital systems, such as the Garmin-built G500H avionics suite and FADEC engine control system.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} the supply chain (SC) overall {{performance}} expression. The developed idea concerns more particularly {{the performance of the}} manufactured products. Indeed, two companies or more contribute to the manufacturing of products that are generally assembled by the <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturer</b> company. Moreover, in the industrial practice, performance scorecards are defined with regard to each process; and the overall performance is neither expressed for each company, nor for the whole SC. We propose here to identify the SC overall performance to the combination of the performances of the different involved companies in the SC. Thus, in order to obtain a definition of such performance, we choose to focus first on the performance of the <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> In this sense, the approach is based on the SCOR model for the handling of the main processes around the considered product manufacturing. The <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturer</b> performance is then defined as the aggregation of its involved processes' performances. While the <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturer</b> performance is strongly dependent on the suppliers' performance, we suggest the integration of the impacting supplier performance into the <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturer</b> scorecards. From an operational point of view, the MACBETH methodology is used to coherently express both processes and overall performances. More precisely, the Choquet aggregation integral operator is applied in order to model mutual interactions between processes. Finally, the expression of a bearing's manufacturer performance illustrates the proposition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the wide issue of overall {{performance}} expression of a system made of interacting entities. Formal aspects of overall performance expression are considered {{as a first step}} of this reflection in the context of supply chains (SC’s). Indeed, a SC being a network of interconnected business entities, it is proposed to consider it as a system of systems. Because system behavior depends on process dynamics, the performance of any company of the SC highly depends on the performance of its processes. However, while process performance is clearly defined in the literature, performance of complex systems or systems of systems is more difficult to assess due to process interactions. The overall performance concept is usually unsatisfactory either for each company or for the whole SC. To express such performance in SC’s, recent proposals have focused on the performance of the <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> This performance being linked to the ones of the suppliers, the impact of supplier performances on the <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturer</b> performance has to be integrated. It is therefore proposed to respectively use the SCOR model for describing the involved sub-system processes and, from a computational point of view, to use the MAUT (Multi Attribute Utility Theory) MACBETH methodology to consistently compute the expected performances. More specifically, the Choquet integral is used as the aggregation opera-tor to handle interactions between systems and processes. The case of a bearings manufacturer is used to illustrate the pro-posal for a supplier selection problem...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the trend in adoption of two types of external intermediaries in clothing industry: buying office and buying agent. Limited {{research has been conducted}} on the classification of different types of clothing supply network, but this dissertation seeks to differentiate the value added in global sourcing activities of buying office and buying agent. A comprehensive case study is conducted to investigate one buying office and one buying agent that based in Hong Kong, using a new nine-factors global sourcing framework to compare extensively the performance and specialties of each type of intermediary. This dissertation successfully differentiates the functions and characteristics of buying office and buying agent, recognising a trend of adopting intermediaries based on a brand’s development, service expectation from intermediaries and external influences. This observed trend is applicable for all clothing retailers, intermediaries and <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturers...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpacecraft {{charging}} {{issues related}} to GEO concern all dielectric surfaces susceptible to charge to significant voltages because of the space environment. Testing materials helps defining margins and keeping a good level of confidence on spacecraft resistance to damaging effects. Another aspect of spacecraft charging analysis relies on numerical simulation. Several tools aims at calculating surface charging in harsh environments, in the energy range of some to hundreds of keV, produced by geomagnetic sub storms. Main codes include: NASCAP, SPIS, MUSCAT and Coulomb- 2. They use different numerical and sometimes physical models and cross checking their results is a progress need to get better confidence in simulations performed by spacecraft <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> The objective {{of this paper is}} to simulate different GEO spacecraft configurations with NASCAP and SPIS and to compare the results, both in terms of absolute and differential potentials. The first section corresponds to SCATHA spacecraft. The second part of this paper presents efforts to model a modern telecom spacecraft. Lastly, we conclude on the reliability of the simulations performed and possible rooms for modelling amelioration...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} supplier development {{decisions for}} <b>prime</b> <b>manufacturers</b> with extensive supply bases producing complex, highly engineered products. We propose a novel modelling approach to support supply chain managers decide the optimal level of investment to improve quality performance under uncertainty. We develop a Poisson-Gamma model within a Bayesian framework, representing both the epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in non-conformance rates. Estimates are obtained to value a supplier quality improvement activity and assess {{if it is}} worth gaining more information to reduce epistemic uncertainty. The theoretical properties of our model provide new insights {{about the relationship between}} the degree of epistemic uncertainty, the effectiveness of development programmes, and the levels of investment. We find that the optimal level of investment does not have a monotonic relationship with the rate of effectiveness. If investment is deferred until epistemic uncertainty is removed then the expected optimal investment monotonically decreases as prior variance increases but only if the prior mean is above a critical threshold. We develop methods to facilitate practical application of the model to industrial decisions by a) enabling use of the model with typical data available to major companies and b) developing computationally efficient approximations that can be implemented easily. Application to a real industry context illustrates the use of the model to support practical planning decisions to learn more about supplier quality and to invest in improving supplier capability...|$|R
