40|$|Regulation {{of energy}} {{homeostasis}} is fundamental for life. In animal species and humans, the Central Nervous System (CNS) plays {{a critical role}} in such regulation by integrating <b>peripheral</b> <b>signals</b> and modulating behavior and the activity of peripheral organs. A precise interplay between CNS and <b>peripheral</b> <b>signals</b> is necessary for the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure in the maintenance of energy balance.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes to}} {{maintain}} player’s engage-ment by adapting game difficulty according to player’s emotions assessed from physiological signals. The {{validity of this}} approach was first tested by analyzing the questionnaire responses, electro-encephalogram (EEG) <b>signals,</b> and <b>peripheral</b> <b>signals</b> of the players playing a Tetris game at three difficulty levels. This anal-ysis confirms that the different difficulty levels correspond to distinguishable emotions, and that, playing several times at the same difficulty level gives rise to boredom. The {{next step was to}} train several classifiers to automatically detect the three emotional classes from EEG and <b>peripheral</b> <b>signals</b> in a player-independent framework. By using either type of signals, the emotional classes were successfully recovered, with EEG having a better accuracy than <b>peripheral</b> <b>signals</b> on short periods of time.

40|$|AbstractTarget {{innervation}} {{by specific}} neuronal populations involves still incompletely understood interactions between central and peripheral factors. We show that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), initially characterized for {{its role as}} a survival factor, is present early in the plexus of the developing forelimb and later in two muscles: the cutaneus maximus and latissimus dorsi. In the absence of GDNF signaling, motor neurons that normally innervate these muscles are mispositioned within the spinal cord and muscle invasion by their axons is dramatically reduced. The ETS transcription factor PEA 3 is normally expressed by these motor neurons and fails to be induced in most of them in GDNF signaling mutants. Thus, GDNF acts as a <b>peripheral</b> <b>signal</b> to induce PEA 3 expression in specific motor neuron pools thereby regulating both cell body position and muscle innervation...|$|E

We performed a cross-sectional endocrine and metabolic analysis {{of a group of}} elite athletes and dancers in order to establish which variable, if any, was specifically associated with changes in menstruation. By using a step-wise discriminant analysis, two independent predictors, elevated serum cortisol and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP- 1) levels, were found to account for the majority (67 %) of the variance. IGFBP- 1 is a hepatic protein which is acutely and inversely regulated by insulin, and is thought to modulate the peripheral actions of IGF- 1.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity is rising {{around the world and}} prospective studies show that in 2025, Brazil will be the fifth country in the world to have obesity problems. Multifactorial factors are involved in the genesis of obesity including genetic, psychological, metabolic and environmental factors. Recently, adipocytes have been considered an endocrine tissue capable of producing several substances, including adiponectin, angiotensin and leptin. Leptin is the main peptide produced by adipocytes and its serum concentration represents an important <b>peripheral</b> <b>signal</b> in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. In addition to leptin, a new peptide called ghrelin has been recently discovered.

40|$|To {{maintain}} homeostasis, hypothalamic neurons in the {{arcuate nucleus}} must dynamically sense and integrate {{a multitude of}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>signals.</b> Blood-borne molecules must therefore be able to circumvent the tightly sealed vasculature of the blood-brain barrier to rapidly access their target neurons. However, how information encoded by circulating appetite-modifying hormones is conveyed to central hypothalamic neurons remains largely unexplored. Using in vivo multiphoton microscopy together with fluorescently labeled ligands, we demonstrate that circulating ghrelin, a versatile regulator of energy expenditure and feeding behavior, rapidly binds neurons {{in the vicinity of}} fenestrated capillaries, and that the number of labeled cell bodies varies with feeding status. Thus, by virtue of its vascular connections, the hypothalamus is able to directly sense <b>peripheral</b> <b>signals,</b> modifying energy status accordingly...|$|R

The visual stimuli images are selected from the subset International Affective Picture System database. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of <b>peripheral</b> <b>signals</b> are used to select suitable segments of EEG signals for improving the accuracy of signal labeling according to emotional stress states. After pre-processing, wavelet coefficients, fractal dimension, and Lempel-Ziv complexity are used to extract {{the features of the}} EEG signals.

40|$|Acyl ghrelin, a 28 -amino acid peptide hormone, is the {{endogenous}} cognate ligand for {{the growth}} hormone secretagogue receptor. Ghrelin is involved in stimulating growth hormone release, eliciting feeding behavior, inducing adiposity and stimulating gastrointestinal motility. Ghrelin is unique for its post-translational modification of O-n-octanoylation at serine 3 through ghrelin O-acyltransferase, {{and is the only}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>signal</b> to enhance food intake. Plasma ghrelin levels manifest "biphasic changes" in diabetes mellitus (DM). In the early stage of DM, the stomach significantly increases the secretion of ghrelin into the plasma, and elevated plasma ghrelin levels are correlated with diabetic hyperphagic feeding and accelerated gastrointestinal motility.

Taste bud receptor (Type II) cells {{have been identified}} as the source of ATP secretion. Based on studies on isolated taste buds and single taste cells, we have postulated that ATP secreted from receptor cells via pannexin 1 hemichannels acts within the taste bud to excite neighbouring presynaptic (Type III) cells. This hypothesis, however, remains to be tested in intact tissues. In this report we used confocal Ca 2 + imaging and lingual slices containing intact taste buds to test the hypothesis of purinergic signalling between taste cells in a more integral preparation. Incubating lingual slices with apyrase reversibly blocked cell-to-cell communication between receptor cells and presynaptic cells, consistent with ATP being the transmitter. Inhibiting pannexin 1 gap junction hemichannels with CO 2 -saturated buffer or probenecid significantly reduced cell–cell signalling between receptor cells and presynaptic cells. In contrast, anandamide, a blocker of connexin gap junction channels, had no effect of cell-to-cell communication in taste buds.

It is especially unclear how detailed <b>peripheral</b> <b>signal</b> representations are transformed into the object-oriented representations that are independent of object position and are provided by {{the final stages of}} processing. This perspective discusses advances in computational algorithms for fitting large-scale models that make it possible to reconstruct the intermediate steps of visual processing based on neural responses to natural stimuli. In particular, it is now possible to characterize how different types of position invariance, such as local (also known as phase invariance) and more global, are interleaved with nonlinear operations to allow for coding of curved contours. Neurons in the mid-level visual area V 4 exhibit selectivity to pairs of even- and odd-symmetric profiles along curved contours. Such pairing is reminiscent of the response properties of complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V 1) and suggests specific ways in which V 1 signals are transformed within subsequent visual cortical areas. These examples illustrate that large-scale models fitted to neural responses to natural stimuli can provide generative models of successive stages of sensory processing...|$|E

Results suggest that the spatial extent over which signals are integrated may vary in order to maximize the information available for perceptual representations. Experiments 2 and 3 b evaluated central and peripheral interactions in a direction discrimination task, by comparing the effects of different signal strengths and directions in one of the two regions. The presence of noise dots (0 % coherence) in either center or periphery led to a performance decrease from baseline measures. A similar decrease was observed when dots in the two regions moved in opposite directions. When dots in both regions moved in the same direction, a stronger <b>peripheral</b> <b>signal</b> led to facilitation of direction discrimination, whereas a stronger central signal did not. These findings suggest that central and peripheral inputs are not separable in the integration of optic flow, that they contribute equally to the percept under normal conditions (equal signal strength), and that peripheral stimulation seems important under ecologically relevant conditions such as poor visibility...|$|E

Five breast radiologists were asked to independently review the breast MRI results, to grade the degree of high <b>peripheral</b> <b>signal,</b> the rim sign, in the DWI, and to confirm the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(mean)) values. We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy and compared the consensus (when 4 of 5 independent reviewers agreed) results of the rim sign with the ADC(mean) values. Additionally, we evaluated {{the correlation between the}} dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) -MRI morphologic appearance and DWI rim sign.

40|$|In sensory neurons of the {{peripheral}} nervous system, receptor potentials can be amplified by depolarizing Cl currents. In mammalian olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), this anion-based signal amplification {{results from the}} sequential activation of two distinct types of transduction channels: cAMP-gated Ca channels and Ca-activated Cl channels. The Cl current increases the initial receptor current about 10 -fold and leads to the excitation of the neuron. Here we examine the activation mechanism of the Ca-dependent Cl channel. We focus on calmodulin, which is known to mediate Ca effects on various ion channels. We show that the cell line Odora, which is derived from OSN precursor cells in the rat olfactory epithelium, expresses Ca-activated Cl channels. Single-channel conductance, ion selectivity, voltage dependence, sensitivity to niflumic acid, and Ca sensitivity match between Odora channels and OSN channels. Transfection of Odora cells with CaM mutants reduces the Ca sensitivity of the Cl channels. This result points to the participation of calmodulin in the gating process of Ca-ativated Cl channels, and helps to understand how signal amplification works in the olfactory sensory cilia. Calmodulin was previously shown to mediate feedback inhibition of cAMP-synthesis and of the cAMP-gated Ca channels in OSNs.

Usually outside signals prevent people from antisocial behaviors (such as anxiety deterring someone from environmental dangers or empathy deterring someone from harming others) but psychopaths do not attend to these cues if they do not relate to their main goal.|$|R
