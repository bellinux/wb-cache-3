5|$|The nation {{initially}} did {{not know}} what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration; many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence,</b> taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the trial, defence {{lawyers for}} the Birmingham Six applied for their clients to be tried {{separately}} from Sheehan, Kelly and, particularly, Murray, stating that their clients' <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> and denials <b>of</b> association with the IRA would be tainted if they were tried alongside an admitted member of the Provisional IRA, who {{had been convicted of}} causing explosions. This application was rejected by Judge Bridge, who was to preside over the trial.|$|R
40|$|Standards {{of proof}} in law serve {{the purpose of}} instructing juries as to the {{expected}} levels of confidence in determinations of fact. In criminal trials, to reach a guilty verdict a jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, and in civil trials by a preponderance of the evidence. The {{purposes of this study}} are to determine the quantitative thresholds used to make these determinations; to ascertain the levels of juror agreement with basic principles of justice; and to try to predict thresholds and beliefs by juror personality characteristics. Participants read brief case descriptions and indicated thresholds in percentages, their beliefs in various principles, and completed three personality measures. A 92 - 94 % threshold in criminal and an 80 % threshold in civil matters was found; but prediction by personality was not supported. Significant percentages of jurors disavowed the <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> and right to counsel...|$|R
5000|$|The DNA {{fingerprinting}} pioneer Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys condemned UK government {{plans to}} keep the genetic details {{of hundreds of thousands}} of innocent people in England and Wales for up to 12 years. Jeffreys said he was [...] "disappointed" [...] with the proposals, which came after a European court ruled that the current policy breaches people's right to privacy. Jefferys said [...] "It seems to be as about as minimal a response to the European court of human rights judgment as one could conceive. There is a <b>presumption</b> not <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> but <b>of</b> future guilt here … which I find very disturbing indeed".|$|R
25|$|In addition, Article 87 protects and perserves {{the rights}} {{previously}} enjoyed by parties to any criminal or civil proceedings, especially {{the right to}} fair trial by the courts without delay and the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> until convicted by the courts. Article 105 protects the rights of property {{and the right to}} compensation for lawful deprivation of property of individuals and legal persons.|$|E

25|$|With this {{underlying}} law, no defendant had {{challenged the}} constitutionality of the perp walk prior to John Lauro. Despite criticisms that it undermined the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence,</b> defendants who had been convicted or pleaded guilty never claimed their rights had been violated by the perp walk, and could not claim injury to reputation from it. Lauro, who had been perp-walked only to have the charges later dropped, was the first claimant to have standing.|$|E
60|$|Not {{very long}} after this, Philip {{was assassinated in}} the most mysterious and {{extraordinary}} manner.[B] Olympias was generally accused of having been the instigator of this deed. There was no positive evidence of her guilt; nor, on the other hand, had there ever been in her character and conduct any such indications {{of the presence of}} even the ordinary sentiments of justice and humanity in her heart as could form a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> her <b>innocence.</b> In a word, she was such a woman that it was more easy and natural, as it seemed, for mankind to believe her guilty than innocent; and she has accordingly been very generally condemned, though on very slender evidence, as accessory to the crime.|$|R
60|$|When he can himself give no {{account of}} his motives, and even {{declares}} that he cannot assign any cause, I am authorized and required to find motives for him,--corrupt motives for a corrupt act. There is no one capital act of his administration that did not strongly imply corruption. When a man {{is known to be}} free from all imputation of taking money, and it becomes an established part of his character, the errors or even crimes of his administration ought to be, and are in general, traced to other sources. You know it is a maxim. But once convict a man of bribery in any instance, and once by direct evidence, and you are furnished with a rule <b>of</b> irresistible <b>presumption</b> that every other irregular act by which unlawful gain may arise is done upon the same corrupt motive. Semel malus præsumitur semper malus. As for good acts candor, charity, justice oblige me not to assign evil motives, unless they serve some scandalous purpose or terminate in some manifest evil end, so justice, reason, and common sense compel me to suppose that wicked acts have been done upon motives correspondent to their nature: otherwise I reverse all the principles of judgment which can guide the human mind, and accept even the symptoms, the marks and criteria <b>of</b> guilt, as <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence.</b> One that confounds good and evil is an enemy to the good.|$|R
5000|$|Significant {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} any citizen to express certain opinions, including; criticism, or [...] "urging disaffection", of the sovereign, the constitution, the government, the law, or 'different groups'. Exemptions may exist where the target of criticism is agreed to be 'in error'. Exemptions appear to exist where the claim is that a feature of a group of people is in some way offensive to the mainstream of society.

25|$|The {{party that}} does not carry {{the burden of proof}} carries the benefit of {{assumption}} of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American criminal case, where there is a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> by the defendant. Fulfilling the burden of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the burden of proof off to another party.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the terrorism threats, Schäuble proposed several controversial measures. Ahead of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, he repeatedly advocated for amending the constitution to allow the military's use for domestic security purposes. Among the methods that he believed Germans should at least debate are preventative detention of people suspected of terrorist activities and assassinations of the leaders of terrorist organizations. In March 2007, Schäuble {{said in an interview that}} the application of <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> should not be relevant for the authorization of counter-terrorist operations.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{authorities}} to fight crime and fraud, most Mexicans have low confidence in the police or the judicial system, and therefore, few crimes are actually reported by the citizens. The Global Integrity Index which measures the existence and effectiveness of national anti-corruption mechanisms rated Mexico 31st behind Kenya, Thailand, and Russia. In 2008, president Calderón proposed a major reform of the judicial system, which was approved by the Congress of the Union, which included oral trials, the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> for defendants, the authority of local police to investigate crime—until then a prerogative of special police units—and several other changes intended to speed up trials.|$|E
60|$|It was {{observed}} by every one present that the prisoner's face betrayed traces of acute mental suffering. He was deadly pale. His eyes never once wandered {{to the crowd}} in the Court. When certain witnesses appeared against him, he looked at them with a momentary attention. At other times he kept his eyes on the ground. When the evidence touched on his wife's illness and death, he was deeply affected, and covered his face with his hands. It was a subject of general remark and general surprise that the prisoner, in this case (although a man), showed far less self-possession than the last prisoner tried in that Court for murder--a woman, who had been convicted on overwhelming evidence. There were persons present (a small minority only) who considered this want of composure {{on the part of the}} prisoner to be a sign in his favor. Self-possession, in his dreadful position, signified, to their minds, the stark insensibility of a heartless and shameless criminal, and afforded in itself a <b>presumption,</b> not <b>of</b> <b>innocence,</b> but <b>of</b> guilt.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2006, Winnipeg-based coroner Peter Markesteyn {{released}} the Turner Review and Investigation, which concluded that Zachary Turner's death was preventable and criticised Newfoundland and Labrador's social services system {{for failing to}} protect the child from his mother, stating, [...] "Nowhere did I find any ongoing assessment of the safety needs of the children." [...] Markesteyn specifically cited poor communication between social services officials, {{who worked on the}} <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> Shirley Turner's <b>innocence</b> throughout the case and became more concerned for her welfare than for Zachary's. Markesteyn ultimately concluded that internal disagreements between case workers and managers weren't openly discussed, and that an intervention by an outside office should have been made. The provincial government of Newfoundland and Labrador accepted the report's conclusions and its twenty-nine recommendations.|$|R
60|$|The legal {{purpose of}} a {{preliminary}} examination is not {{the discovery of a}} criminal; it is the ascertaining of the probable guilt or <b>innocence</b> <b>of</b> the person already charged. To permit that person's counsel to insult and madden the various assisting witnesses in the hope of making them seem to incriminate themselves instead of him by statements that may afterward be used to confuse a jury--that is perversion of law to defeat justice. The outrageous character of the practice is seen to better advantage what contrasted with the tender consideration enjoyed by the person actually accused and presumably guilty--the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> his <b>innocence</b> being as futile a fiction as that a sheep's tail is a leg when called so. Actually, the prisoner in a criminal trial is the only person supposed to have a knowledge of the facts who is not compelled to testify! And this amazing exemption is given him by way of immunity from the snares and pitfalls with which the paths of all witnesses are wantonly beset! To a visiting Lunarian it would seem strange indeed that in a Terrestrial court of justice it is not deemed desirable for an accused person to incriminate himself, and that it is deemed desirable for a subpoena to be more dreaded than a warrant.|$|R
25|$|In Cochrane v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2007 CanLII 9231 (ON S.C.), Ms. Catherine Cochrane {{sued the}} Province of Ontario {{to prevent it}} from {{enforcing}} the Dog Owner's Liability Act (DOLA) ban on pit bull-type dogs, arguing that the law was unconstitutionally broad because the ban was grossly disproportionate to the risk pit bulls pose to public safety, and that the law was unconstitutionally vague because failed to provide an intelligible definition of pit bulls. She also argued that a provision allowing the Crown to introduce as evidence a veterinarian's certificate certifying that the dog is a pit bull violates the right to a fair trial and the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Civil and {{criminal}} legal codes, based on Belgian and customary law, {{provide for the}} right to a speedy public trial, the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence,</b> and legal counsel. However, these rights were not respected in practice. While some judges allowed public access to trials, other judges, notably those presiding in rape trials, did not. There are no juries. Defendants have the right to appeal most cases except those involving national security, armed robbery, and smuggling, which the Court of State Security generally adjudicates. In some instances special military tribunals, whose jurisdiction is ill defined, adjudicate national security cases. The law provides for court-appointed counsel at state expense in certain cases, but the government often did not provide such counsel.|$|E
25|$|The perp walk arose {{incidentally}} {{from the}} need to transport a defendant from a police station to court after arrest, and the general prohibition of prior restraint under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. Law enforcement agencies often coordinate with the media in scheduling and arranging them. It has been criticized {{as a form of}} public humiliation that violates a defendant's right to privacy and is prejudicial to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence,</b> but is defended as promoting transparency in the criminal justice system. American courts have permitted it {{on the grounds that it}} arises from the limitations and necessity of police procedure, but have also limited it only to those times when it is actually necessary.|$|E
40|$|The article {{begins with}} a {{definition}} of a “fair trial” and some other notions involved. Then the author presents {{a discussion of the}} civil rights and duties and complaints in penal cases, moving on to the requirements set for a court as an institution, i. e. easy access to a court of law, independence of a court, impartiality and statutory guarantees of its establishment, as well as the openness of proceedings and term of case trial. Toward the end the author analyses the “soundness” of trial course, the problem of equality of parties, the issue of personal participation in an oral trial, adversary procedure and the duty to provide grounds for the verdict, in addition to <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> the accused <b>innocence,</b> the requirement to inform about accusation, the right for defense preparation and free defense counsel and interpreter...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was for the}} jury," [...] he said, [...] "to {{consider}} whether the prosecutor had made out his plea. For himself, he sincerely grieved to say, that a shadow of doubt remained not upon his mind concerning the verdict which the inquest had to bring in. He would not follow the prisoner's counsel through the impeachment which he had brought against the statute of King William and Queen Mary. He and the jury were sworn to judge according to the laws as they stood, not to criticise, or evade, or even to justify them. In no civil case would a counsel have been permitted to plead his client's case {{in the teeth of}} the law; but in the hard situation in which counsel were often placed in the Criminal Court, as well as out of favour to all <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence,</b> he had not inclined to interrupt the learned gentleman, or narrow his plea. The present law, as it now stood, had been instituted by the wisdom of their fathers, to check the alarming progress of a dreadful crime; when it was found too severe for its purpose it would doubtless be altered by the wisdom of the Legislature; at present it was the law of the land, the rule of the Court, and, according to the oath which they had taken, it must be that of the jury. This unhappy girl's situation could not be doubted; that she had borne a child, and that the child had disappeared, were certain facts. The learned counsel had failed to show that she had communicated her situation. All the requisites of the case required by the statute were therefore before the jury. The learned gentleman had, indeed, desired them to throw out of consideration the panel's own confession, which was the plea usually urged, in penury of all others, by counsel in his situation, who usually felt that the declarations of their clients bore hard on them. But that the Scottish law designed that a certain weight should be laid on these declarations, which, he admitted, were quodammodo extrajudicial, was evident from the universal practice by which they were always produced and read, as part of the prosecutor's probation. In the present case, no person who had heard the witnesses describe the appearance of the young woman before she left Saddletree's house, and contrasted it with that of her state and condition at her return to her father's, could have any doubt that the fact of delivery had taken place, as set forth in her own declaration, which was, therefore, not a solitary piece of testimony, but adminiculated and supported by the strongest circumstantial proof.|$|R
40|$|The black–white {{paradigm}} {{has been}} the crucial paradigm in racial geography of land use, housing and development. Yet it is worthwhile to consider that, in this context, distinctions based on race are accompanied by a powerful, racialized discourse of middle class versus poor. The black–white paradigm in exclusionary zoning, for example, involves the wealthy or middle-class white person (we need not even use the term white) protesting against or displacing the poor black person. (we also need not even use the term black). Another example of the racialized discourse of middle class versus poor is in the urban-gentrification context. The term 2 ̆ 2 gentrification 2 ̆ 2 suggests wealthier Whites displacing poor Blacks. Little {{attention has been paid}} to the significance of the increasing numbers of Blacks stepping into middle-class roles formerly held almost exclusively by Whites. Taking both race and class into account seems to demand exploration of the significance of Blackness and affluence within an existing societal structure that has evolved from white supremacy to a seemingly less-virulent, or more-benign, white norm - one in which normalcy, wealth, advantage, and <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> are still implicitly predicated on Whiteness and in which an economic structure of white privilege and black disadvantage is inscribed into the geography of the physical landscape. The reality that middle class homeowners, whether Black or White, seek to avoid the disadvantages of poverty presents a divide in black racial solidarity based on class. However, because of structural disadvantage in racially segregated neighborhoods, the black middle class are not as successful at getting away nor in protecting their turf as white middle class are. In effect this is a racial disadvantage but certainly a paradoxical one. It involves a disadvantage in escaping the poor and disadvantage in exercising privilege at the expense of the poor. Using the example of the black middle class, it is possible to see that the vestigial oppression of slavery and the domination of white supremacy have morphed but have not been eliminated. Instead, those institutions have been disaggregated into discrete, wealth-based components of Blackness and Whiteness. Thus, Blacks with money are privileged in certain limited circumstances to be operatively white. Through their wallets and educational or professional attainments they gain access to some of the privileges, goods, and services formerly reserved exclusively for Whites. Thus, this article considers challenges and opportunities of Blackness and middle-classness in its twenty-first century context of being 2 ̆ 2 operatively white. 2 ̆ 2 Specifically, how should neighborhood land use conflicts be regarded if poor Blacks are disproportionately, negatively affected in relation to affluent Blacks? That racialized impact should not be dismissed as being purely about class just because the affluent are also black. Problems of class in the United States are racialized; they are never separate from the racial structures of subordination that still operate here. Accordingly, problems currently cognizable as being merely about class are necessarily still cognizable as problems of race. In order to enrich our ability to give race and class the sophisticated and probing account that their complex interaction calls for, this paper takes the concept of racialized class to its logical end and explores the ways in which racial identity and racial social position are affected by class. Because race and class are structurally inscribed into the landscape, racial justice is considered to require economic liberation. Economic liberation comes, however, at the expense of the black poor. Therefore, there cannot be racial justice without economic justice...|$|R

25|$|The Code of Hammurabi is {{the longest}} {{surviving}} text from the Old Babylonian period. The code {{has been seen as}} an early example of a fundamental law, regulating a government — i.e., a primitive constitution. The code {{is also one of the}} earliest examples of the idea of <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence,</b> and it also suggests that both the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide evidence. The occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the code may be better understood as a codification of Hammurabi's supplementary judicial decisions, and that, by memorializing his wisdom and justice, its purpose may have been the self-glorification of Hammurabi rather than a modern legal code or constitution. However, its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.|$|E
25|$|Deck v. Missouri is a {{significant}} case because it outlines new rights given to convicted defendants. In this case, the majority held {{that even though the}} defendant had been convicted of capital crimes, he still should have the benefit of the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> (to a certain degree). Also, the Court held that such a defendant has a right to having {{a significant}} defense. Furthermore, the court stated that during the sentencing phase of his trial, Deck deserved the right to participate in “dignified courtroom proceedings.” This decision gave Deck constitutional rights just after he had been convicted of multiple capital crimes. This means that an accused defendant has the same rights as a convicted defendant. Rights that only protected defendants in the guilty phase now protect defendants in the penalty phase. This is of profound significance.|$|E

Many of these rights were also included in the Canadian Bill of Rights, which the Canadian Parliament enacted in 1960. However, the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of shortcomings. Unlike the Charter, it was an ordinary Act of Parliament, which could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament, and it was applicable only to the federal government. The courts also chose to interpret the Bill of Rights conservatively, only on rare occasions applying it to find a contrary law inoperative. The Bill of Rights did not contain all {{of the rights}} that are now included in the Charter, omitting, for instance, the right to vote and freedom of movement within Canada.|$|E
25|$|It {{was argued}} by Martin Chanock that, as a {{reaction}} to the rapid social and economic changes {{that took place in the}} late pre-colonial and early colonial periods, older men in many African communities sought to impose their authoritarian and restrictive interpretation of customary law, which they used to control younger men and particularly women. It was this view of traditional law as a punitive instrument rather than a means of mediating disputes that was presented to the Europeans codifying these laws. It was also the view of traditional law in Malawi that inspired both the then-Prime Minister, Banda, and the Minister of Justice Orton Chirwa to criticise such principles of English-based law as the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence,</b> the need to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt and the requirement for corroborating evidence. By 1969, Aleke Banda, the Minister of Finance, openly attacked the use of defence lawyers and the safeguards or restrictions imposed by the English-law Rules of evidence. Dr Banda specifically linked traditional law to punishment, and claimed that lack of evidence was not proof of innocence.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{specific}} rights apply in criminal cases. Persons in custody {{have the right}} to consult a solicitor by virtue of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Access to Justice Act 1999 allows an individual to request confidential and free legal advice.

The accused also benefits from a limited right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. Confessions are admissible as evidence under certain conditions laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The accused additionally benefits from a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>innocence.</b> In discharging the burden of proof, the onus is on the prosecution as established in Woolmington v DPP. For example, in R v Wang it was held that it was never permissible for a judge to direct a jury to find a defendant guilty.
