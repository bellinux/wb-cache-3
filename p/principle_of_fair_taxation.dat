The thesis consists of two main parts - theoretical and analytical. The theoretical part is divided into general and specific. The general theoretical part focuses on the specification <b>of</b> the business <b>principle</b> and its emplacement among other similar private law's principles such as <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith and fair dealing and good manners. The aim of this part was to define divergences of each <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> and the aftermaths <b>of</b> breaking these <b>principles.</b> It is impossible to go through the topic <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> business transactions globally, especially due to the extensiveness and variety of usage <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> in business law relationships. Therefore, special {{attention has been paid to}} the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> business transactions in the field of contractual penalty in the next theoretical part. In the analytical part, I endeavour to deal with the issue of the exercising of the right of a contractual penalty.

40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> play {{is widely}} thought to require simply that costs and {{benefits}} be distributed fairly. This gloss on the principle, while not entirely inaccurate, has invited a host of popular objections based on misunderstandings about fair play. Central to many of these objections is a failure to treat the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> play as a transactional principle—one that allocates special obligations and rights among persons {{as a result of}} their interactions. I offer an interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> play that emphasizes its similarities to another transactional principle: consent. This interpretation reveals that playing fair requires one to reciprocate specifically by following the rules of the cooperative scheme from which one benefits, just as consent requires one to act according to the terms of an agreement. I then draw on the comparison with consent to reply to some popular and persistent objections to the principle...|$|R

The research {{was based on the}} findings of randomly selected match participants made in the context of competition mixed tennis teams to provide insight into the present situation <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> play in these age categories, to identify problematic issues and provide recommendations for practice.

Results: The object of the research were players of tennis in ages under 12 and under 14 born in 2003 - 2005, respectively 2001 - 2002. The results of the two-month research showed that the most serious transgressions, which are contrary to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> play, include break of game rules and inappropriate behavior.

40|$|The {{philosophical}} {{literature on}} state legitimacy has recently seen a significant conceptual revision.

William Edmundson argues that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> play cannot generate power rights, and so any attempt at a <b>fair</b> play account <b>of</b> legitimacy must fail.

40|$|The {{target of}} this study is the attempt of fiscal policy and finance to create the first time uniform income taxes {{throughout}} the whole area of the Deutsche Reich. This study shows, that the first Reichseinkommensteuergesetz of 1920 and its amendment in 1925 was not only a simple harmonisation and consolidation of the diverse Landesgesetze to one Reichsgesetz. With this first Reichseinkommensteuergesetz politics went new ways to create for the first time “modern and fair” income taxes. The laws incorporate comprehensive claims of science for an integral structure, a reasoned definition for income and <b>fair</b> <b>taxation.</b> This lawmaking process is analysed under the aspect of “modern and fair” income taxes and its impact on today’s laws are presented. Besides the economical analysis of the bodies of law, the purpose {{of this study}} is to outline the political and financial decision-making process and its direct impact on the enacted law as well to demonstrate from which sides of the political spectrum and general public ideas flowed in and ultimately implemented. This all happened within the historical background of radical changes after World War I. Apart from the fiscal-budgetary, the economic-political and the tax goals, tax laws demand for the basis <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> <b>taxation.</b> But in the postulate for fair taxes lies the main problem of every scientific consideration of income tax, since fairness is a subjective notion which can only be conclusively accessed via a certain type or concept of society. A close evaluation of theories concerning fairness and their feasibility of implementation to law as well as the analysis of the de facto tax laws are essential for the answer of the question above. This is aggravated by the fact that the term of income has not yet been definitely resolved. Since these two issues interact, it results in the fact that the problematic <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> <b>taxation</b> fascinates both political scientists as well as taxation scientists equally. Yet, to obtain a reasonable answer of the question under the given circumstances, the first establishment of a nation-wide unified taxation laws in Germany is discussed. At this time, the political-philosophical discussion on the term of fairness was firstly implemented into law...|$|R
