30|$|Nevertheless, despite {{inherent}} nuances between <b>physicians</b> {{and resident}} <b>physicians</b> (e.g., level {{of experience and}} expertise), {{it is surprising that}} few studies have targeted potential differences by comparing and contrasting their levels of well-being. Existing studies tend to focus on single or few wellness-related variables and do not compare the levels of well-being of <b>physicians</b> and resident <b>physicians</b> across multiple dimensions. For instance, {{it has been shown that}} resident <b>physicians</b> often have heavier workloads, lower levels of autonomy (Aasland et al. [2008]; Biaggi et al. [2003]; Thomas [2004]), and a higher risk of burnout (Cohen and Patten [2005]; Leiter et al. [2009]) compared to more senior <b>physicians.</b> In light of such differences between <b>physicians</b> and resident <b>physicians</b> and the scarcity of research comparing the two groups, the present study aimed to assess and contrast the psychological well-being of <b>physicians</b> and resident <b>physicians.</b>|$|R

5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, hospice care {{may be difficult}} to access. The first would relate to <b>physician</b> reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having most of their care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, reimbursement for <b>physician</b> visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a <b>physician.</b>|$|E

Practice location {{was associated with the}} level of Medicaid participation for these primary care physicians: Significantly more rural pediatricians and family <b>physicians</b> than those with urban practices accepted Medicaid patients. The average reimbursement level for these <b>physicians</b> was shown to be an important determinant of whether <b>physicians</b> would accept Medicaid patients. Nonparticipatory <b>physicians</b> were more concerned about excessive paperwork compared with <b>physicians</b> with limited participation. Among <b>physicians</b> with limited participation, family <b>physicians</b> and pediatricians both cited problems of excessive paperwork, reimbursement delays, and retroactive denials of payment as important deterrents to accepting Medicaid patients...|$|R

40|$|Many {{patients}} with {{anxiety and depression}} initially seek treatment from their primary care <b>physicians.</b> Changes in insurance coverage and current mental parity laws, make reimbursement for services a problem.
