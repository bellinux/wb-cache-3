40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{differential}} phaseshift keying (DPSK) noncoherent receivers for multicarrier code {{division multiple access}} (MCCDMA) systems in multipath channels. The noncoherent receivers are composed of a linear equalizer and adecisionfeedback differential detector to detect DPSK signals. <b>The</b> <b>performances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed noncoherent receivers can be improved by increasing <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> feedback symbols. For an infinite number <b>of</b> feedback symbols, <b>the</b> <b>performances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed noncoherent receivers approaches that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional coherent receiver.
