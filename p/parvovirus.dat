40|$|The current {{classification}} of <b>parvoviruses</b> {{is based on}} virus host range and helper virus dependence, while little data on evolutionary relationships among viruses are available. We identified and analyzed 472 sequences of <b>parvoviruses,</b> among which there were (virtually) full-length genomes of all 41 viruses currently recognized as individual species within the family Parvoviridae. Our phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes as well as open reading frames distinguished three evolutionary groups of <b>parvoviruses</b> from vertebrates: (i) the human helper-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 1 to 6 and the autonomous avian parvoviruses; (ii) the bovine, chipmunk, and autonomous primate <b>parvoviruses,</b> including human viruses B 19 and V 9; and (iii) the <b>parvoviruses</b> from rodents (except for chipmunks), carnivores, and pigs. Each of these three evolutionary groups could be further subdivided, reflecting both virus-host coevolution and multiple cross-species transmissions in the evolutionary history of <b>parvoviruses.</b> No <b>parvoviruses</b> from invertebrates clustered with vertebrate <b>parvoviruses.</b> Our analysis provided evidence for negative selection among <b>parvoviruses,</b> the independent evolution of their genes, and recombination among <b>parvoviruses</b> from rodents. The topology of the phylogenetic tree of autonomous human and simian <b>parvoviruses</b> matched exactly the topology of the primate family tree, as based on the analysis of primate mitochondrial DNA. Viruses belonging to the AAV group were not evolutionarily linked to other primate <b>parvoviruses</b> but were linked to the <b>parvoviruses</b> of birds. The two lineages of human <b>parvoviruses</b> may have resulted from independent ancient zoonotic infections.

40|$|AbstractBackground: <b>Parvoviruses</b> infect vertebrates, {{insects and}} crustaceans. Many {{arthropod}} <b>parvoviruses</b> (densoviruses) are highly pathogenic and kill approximately 90 % {{of the host}} larvae within days, making them potentially effective as selective pesticides. Improved understanding of densoviral structure and function is therefore desirable. There are four different initiation sites for translation of the densovirus capsid protein mRNA, giving rise to the viral proteins VP 1 to VP 4. Sixty copies of the common, C-terminal domain make up the ordered part of the icosahedral capsid. Results: The Galleria mellonella densovirus (GMDNV) capsid protein consists of a core β-barrel motif, similar to that found in many other viral capsid proteins. The structure most closely resembles that of the vertebrate <b>parvoviruses,</b> but it has diverged beyond recognition {{in many of the}} long loop regions that constitute the surface features and intersubunit contacts. The N termini of twofold-related subunits have swapped their positions relative to those of the vertebrate <b>parvoviruses.</b> Unlike in the vertebrate <b>parvoviruses,</b> in GmDNV there is no continuous electron density in the channels running along the fivefold axes of the virus. Electron density corresponding to some of the single-stranded DNA genome is visible in the crystal structure, but it is not as well defined as in the vertebrate <b>parvoviruses.</b> Conclusions: The sequence of the glycine-rich motif, which occupies each of the channels along the fivefold axes in vertebrate viruses, is conserved between mammalian and insect <b>parvoviruses.</b> This motif may serve to externalize the N-terminal region of the single VP 1 subunit per particle. The domain swapping of the N termini between insect and vertebrate <b>parvoviruses</b> may have the effect of increasing capsid stability in GmDNV...|$|R
40|$|The {{family of}} Parvoviridae is {{composed}} of small, nuclear-replicating viruses that are without envelope and contain an essentially single-stranded, linear DNA genome. Certain <b>parvoviruses</b> proved to have the remarkable capacity to prevent the formation of spontaneous as well as virally- and chemically-induced tumors in laboratory animals. Established tumor cells serve as targets for the antineoplasic activity of <b>parvoviruses,</b> since the growth of preformed cancer cells transplanted in recipient animals can also be inhibited by these viruses. Furthermore, epidemiological studies in humans have revealed a correlation between serological evidence of parvoviral infection and a lower incidence of certain cancers. The parvoviral life-cycle appears to depend on cellular factors that are expressed {{as a function of}} proliferation and differentiation. This subordination may account for the oncotropism of <b>parvoviruses</b> in vivo and for the specificity of their interactions with (pre-) neoplasic cells under appropriate culture conditions. Thus, certain <b>parvoviruses</b> were found to preferentially lyse initiated or stably transformed cells in vitro, as a possible result of the stimulation of the production and/or activity of cytotoxic viral proteins. <b>Parvoviruses</b> can also have a cytostatic effect and cause the reversion of transformation traits, parallel to the down-modulation of the expression of defined genes, in particular oncogenes. Such direct disturbance of neoplasic cells or their precursors may participate in the oncosuppressive activity of <b>parvoviruses,</b> although indirect viral effects mediated by host defense mechanisms also deserve to be considered. Altogether, these properties suggest the possible use of <b>parvoviruses</b> as probes to investigate the process of malignant transformation. Further {{research is needed to determine}} whether infections with <b>parvoviruses</b> may find a place in the prevention and treatment of human cancers.

5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine <b>parvovirus,</b> feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E

Infection of rodent or human cells with the <b>parvoviruses</b> minute virus of mice (MVM), H- 1 or adeno-associated virus (AAV) types 2 or 5 failed to induce expression of the luciferase or beta-galactosidase reporter genes transfected into these cells as constructs containing an IFN-beta promoter. <b>Parvoviruses</b> did weakly induce synthesis of TNF-alpha and of IL- 6 in cell culture and could slightly enhance synthesis of these cytokines when induced by other agents.

40|$|Abstract Background The vast {{sequence}} divergence among different virus groups has presented {{a great challenge}} to alignment-based analysis of virus phylogeny. Due to the problems caused by the uncertainty in alignment, existing tools for phylogenetic analysis based on multiple alignment could not be directly applied to the whole-genome comparison and phylogenomic studies of viruses. There has been a growing interest in alignment-free methods for phylogenetic analysis using complete genome data. Among the alignment-free methods, a dynamical language (DL) method proposed by our group has successfully been applied to the phylogenetic analysis of bacteria and chloroplast genomes. Results In this paper, the DL method is {{used to analyze the}} whole-proteome phylogeny of 124 large dsDNA viruses and 30 <b>parvoviruses,</b> two data sets with large difference in genome size. The trees from our analyses are in good agreement to the latest classification of large dsDNA viruses and <b>parvoviruses</b> by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Conclusions The present method provides a new way for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses and <b>parvoviruses,</b> and also some insights on the affiliation of a number of unclassified viruses. In comparison, some alignment-free methods such as the CV Tree method can be used for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses, but they are not suitable for resolving the phylogeny of <b>parvoviruses</b> with a much smaller genome size. </p...|$|R

Clinically, the intestinal form of the infection can sometimes be confused with coronavirus or other forms of enteritis. <b>Parvovirus,</b> however, is more serious and the presence of bloody diarrhea, a low white blood cell count, and necrosis of the intestinal lining also point more towards <b>parvovirus,</b> especially in an unvaccinated dog.

25|$|Aplastic crises are acute worsenings of the patient's {{baseline}} anaemia, producing pale appearance, fast heart rate, and fatigue. This {{crisis is}} normally triggered by <b>parvovirus</b> B19, which directly affects production of {{red blood cells}} by invading the red cell precursors and multiplying in and destroying them. <b>Parvovirus</b> infection almost completely prevents red blood cell production {{for two to three}} days. In normal individuals, this is of little consequence, but the shortened red cell life of SCD patients results in an abrupt, life-threatening situation. Reticulocyte counts drop dramatically during the disease (causing reticulocytopenia), and the rapid turnover of red cells leads to the drop in haemoglobin. This crisis takes 4 days to one week to disappear. Most patients can be managed supportively; some need blood transfusion.|$|E
