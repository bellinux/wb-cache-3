5|$|Curtis Gates Lloyd {{described}} the variety rochesterensis in 1909, originally {{as a new}} species, <b>Phallus</b> rochesterensis. It was found in Kew, Australia. A form with a pink-coloured indusium was reported by Vincenzo de Cesati in 1879 as Hymenophallus roseus, and later called Dictyophora indusiata f.rosea by Yosio Kobayasi in 1965; it is synonymous with <b>Phallus</b> cinnabarinus. A taxon described in 1936 as Dictyophora lutea and variously known for years as Dictyophora indusiata f.lutea, D.indusiata f.aurantiaca, or <b>Phallus</b> indusiatus f.citrinus, was formally transferred to <b>Phallus</b> in 2008 as a distinct species, <b>Phallus</b> luteus.|$|E
5|$|Phallic {{architecture}} became {{prominent in}} ancient Egypt and Greece, where genitalia and human sexuality received {{a high degree}} of attention. The ancient Greeks honored the <b>phallus</b> and celebrated phallic festivals. The Greco-Roman deity Priapus was worshiped as a god of fertility, depicted with a giant <b>phallus</b> in numerous public architectural pieces.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phallus</b> calongei was {{discovered}} on June 16, 2008, near the Khanspur stream in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly {{known as the}} North Western Frontier Province) in Pakistan. It was described as new to science in a 2009 Mycotaxon publication. The specific epithet calongei honors Spanish mycologist Francisco D. Calonge {{who has written extensively}} on the Gasteromycetes, and who has himself published or co-published three <b>Phallus</b> species: P.atrovolvatus (Kreisel & Calonge), P.maderensis (Calonge) and P.minusculus (Kreisel & Calonge). P.calongei is one of four <b>Phallus</b> species known to exist in Pakistan, the others being P.celebicus, P.impudicus, and P.rubicundus.|$|E
50|$|Alain Daniélou {{says that}} mukhalingas of Shiva {{resemble}} similar depictions of <b>phalluses</b> with carved faces from Greece and those from Celtic Europe. He also notes the <b>phalluses</b> with full human figures {{are also found}} in France and India, citing the second-century icon of Gudimallam as an early example.|$|R
50|$|A lot of {{men that}} participated in this ritual held <b>phalluses</b> as scepters in their hands. The <b>phalluses</b> were made of wood or clay or even of bread and {{constituted}} the most important ceremonial symbol. In the late seventies, women started taking {{an active part in}} the entire ritual especially after the creation of the “Bourani Society” in 1979.|$|R

5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated phallic {{festivals and}} built a shrine with an erect <b>phallus</b> to honor Hermes, {{messenger}} of the gods. Those figures {{may be related to}} the ancient Egyptian deity Min who was depicted holding his erect <b>phallus.</b> Figures of women with a <b>phallus</b> for a head have been found across Greece and Yugoslavia. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient Babylon. The Romans, who were deeply superstitious, also often used phallic imagery in their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the Far East, including Indonesia, India (such as the Lingam), Korea and Japan, used the <b>phallus</b> as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.|$|E
5|$|In North America, <b>Phallus</b> impudicus can be {{distinguished}} from the very similar P. hadriani by the latter's purplish-tinted volva.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by the French botanist Étienne Pierre Ventenat in 1798, and sanctioned by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon under that name in his 1801 Synopsis Methodica Fungorum. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck called the species Hymenophallus hadriani in 1817; this {{name is a}} synonym. According to the taxonomical database Index Fungorum, additional synonyms include: <b>Phallus</b> iosmus, named by Berkeley in 1836; <b>Phallus</b> imperialis, Schulzer, 1873; Ithyphallus impudicus var. imperialis and Ithyphallus impudicus var. iosmos, De Toni, date unknown.|$|E

5|$|Sigurður {{has used}} a variety of {{techniques}} to preserve the penises, including preservation in formaldehyde, pickling, drying, stuffing and salting. One particularly large penis taken from a bull has been converted into a walking stick. Many of the museum's exhibits are illuminated by lamps made by Sigurður from rams' testicles. Sigurður has also carved wooden <b>phalluses,</b> which can be found adorning various objects around the museum, and has a bow tie decorated with images of <b>phalluses</b> that he wears on special occasions.|$|R
5000|$|Drukpa Kunley's {{intention}} was to shock the clergy, who were uppity and prudish in their behaviour and teachings of Buddhism. However, his ways appealed to lay practitioners. It was he who propagated the legend of painting <b>phalluses</b> on walls and flying hanging <b>phalluses</b> from roof tops of houses to drive away evil spirits and subdue demonesses. He is, therefore, also called the [...] "fertility saint", as the monastery he built, Chimi Lhakhang, is visited by not only Bhutanese women but also people from the United States and Japan.|$|R

5|$|Herodotus, {{the ancient}} Greek historian, {{documented}} women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments {{the size of}} a human body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On the island of Delos a pillar supports a colossal <b>phallus,</b> the symbol of Dionysus. <b>Phallus</b> reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices to ward off evil. The elaborate use of phallic architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads and folded arms.|$|E
5|$|In Northern Montenegro, peasants rub <b>Phallus</b> impudicus on the necks of bulls before bull {{fighting}} contests in {{an attempt}} to make them stronger. They are also fed to young bulls as they are thought to be a potent aphrodisiac.|$|E

50|$|The Phall-O-meter is a satirical {{measure that}} critiques medical {{standards}} for normal {{male and female}} <b>phalluses.</b> The tool was developed by Kiira Triea based on a concept by Suzanne Kessler and is used to demonstrate concerns with the medical treatment of intersex bodies.|$|R
5|$|<b>Phallus</b> impudicus has {{the same}} overall {{appearance}} as P.hadriani, but is distinguished by its white volva. Another similar stinkhorn, P.ravenelii has a smooth, not reticulate head.|$|E
5|$|Similar figurines {{of women}} with <b>phallus</b> heads from the Neolithic period have been found across Greece, Macedonia and parts of old Yugoslavia. The vast {{majority}} of the figurines of the Hamangia culture have cylindrical phallus-shaped heads without facial features, although some, particularly of the Aegean culture, had phallic sculptural pieces with phallic heads with a pinched nose and slitty eyes. In these parts of the ancient world, obelisk like structures resembling the human penis were built, often with phallic symbols, representing human fertility and asserting male sexuality and orgasm. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architecture of ancient Babylonia, and in Khametian iconography, the obelisk was considered to be symbolic of the <b>phallus</b> of the masculine earth. The obelisks of ancient Egypt themselves had several functions, existing both as a reference to the cultus of the sun and of the <b>phallus,</b> representing fertility and power.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{considered}} poisonous, P.fusiformis {{is not recommended}} for consumption. Some related species such as <b>Phallus</b> impudicus or Mutinus caninus {{are considered to be}} edible (or even delicacies) in the immature egg stage; however, the foul smell of stinkhorns at maturity would likely deter most individuals from eating them.|$|E
50|$|In western Madagascar, Sakalava and Vezo funerary {{sculpture}} {{is renowned}} internationally for its erotic wooden figures, often depicted during copulation and showing oversized <b>phalluses</b> and breasts. It is unknown {{as to why}} the sculptures have this sort of eroticism, but it may have to do with meeting growing tourist demand.|$|R
50|$|The gods Susanoo and princess Kushinada are {{enshrined}} here. This shrine {{is dedicated}} to marriage and matchmaking. The {{people who come to}} this shrine often pray for a marriage partner, good marital relations, pregnancy and healthy child-bearing.

50|$|Its {{concrete}} {{significance is}} hazy, but {{it appeared in}} bronze, illuminated manuscript, and paint; it manifested as bawdy humour, religious parody, political comment. The Tuscan Massa Marittima mural, featuring oversized <b>phalluses,</b> some erect, complete with testes, was Guelph propaganda warning that if the Ghibellines were allowed to take control, they would bring with them sexual perversion and witchcraft.|$|R
5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect <b>phallus),</b> {{or with a}} full or half <b>phallus</b> and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, and held in place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E
5|$|Phallic {{architecture}} {{consciously or}} unconsciously creates a symbolic representation of the <b>phallus.</b> Buildings intentionally or unintentionally resembling the human penis {{are a source of}} amusement to locals and tourists in various places around the world. Deliberate phallic imagery is found in ancient cultures and in the links to ancient cultures found in traditional artifacts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phallus</b> hadriani {{is known}} to be in Australia (where it is thought to be an {{introduced}} species imported on woodchip mulch used in gardening and landscaping), North America, Europe (including Denmark, Ireland, Latvia, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden, Ukraine, and Wales) Turkey (Iğdır Province), Japan, and China (Jilin Province).|$|E

There are also relics of traditional folk religions such as rocks carved into <b>phalluses</b> and vaginas.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the current}} rhetoric [...] {{about sex and}} intimacy’s {{involving}} more than penile-vaginal intercourse, {{the quest for a}} rigid erection appears to dominate both popular and professional interest. Moreover, it seems likely that our diligence in finding new ways for overcoming erectile difficulties serves unwittingly to reinforce the male myth that rock-hard, ever-available <b>phalluses</b> are a necessary component of male identity. This is indeed a dilemma...|$|R
50|$|The {{first day}} is the Ghost Festival itself, also called Wan Ruam (assembly day). The town’s {{residents}} invite protection from Phra U-pakut, {{the spirit of the}} Mun river. They then hold a series of games and take part in a procession wearing masks made of rice husks or coconut leaves with hats made from rice steamers, plus patchwork clothing. They also wear bells and wave wooden <b>phalluses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ravenel's stinkhorn is {{widespread}} in eastern North America, from Quebec in the north, south to Florida and west to Iowa and Ohio. West of the Mississippi, the common stinkhorn (<b>Phallus</b> impudicus) becomes more dominant. In the early 1900s, Lloyd {{called it the}} most common phalloid in the United States. The fungus {{is also found in}} Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} <b>Phallus</b> species known with a pinkish-colored cap is P.rubicundus; its conical cap has a surface that is wrinkled, not reticulate. Other similar species include P.hadriani, {{which has a}} purple volva, P.macrosporus, which has a reddish volva, and P.formanosus, which has a pale pink stipe and volva.|$|E
5|$|As {{told in the}} Kurma Purana, Bhikshatana-Shiva {{wanted to}} reveal the ignorance of the sages, who were engrossed in Dharma (righteousness) and extreme austerities but had {{forgotten}} the Samkhya (Supreme Knowledge). The naked, handsome, ithyphallic (with an erect <b>phallus,</b> urdhvalinga) beggar Shiva entered the forest, begging for alms from the sages' wives. They were so enamoured of him that while granting alms, they allowed their clothes to fall off and followed him, dancing and singing, love-sick. Bhikshatana was accompanied by Mohini—Vishnu disguised as Bhikshatana's enchanting wife, who maddens the sages' sons in love. The sages, unable to recognise Shiva, abused and cursed him, even assaulting him. They cursed that his Linga (<b>phallus)</b> should fall off. Shiva allowed it to be so and the Linga became an infinite fiery pillar of light. Anusuya, the wife of sage Atri, enlightened the sages that the couple {{was none other than}} Shiva and Vishnu. The sages thereafter worshipped the Linga. Pleased, Shiva returned to the forest as a beggar in an ugly form with his wife Parvati. Eventually, he revealed his supreme form to the sages and exalted the Pashupata vow – by which a man restrains his passion, becomes celibate, and roams naked smeared with ash – declaring that such a lifestyle would lead to moksha (salvation).|$|E
5000|$|In April 2011, Bradley Paul Hampson {{was sentenced}} {{to three years in}} jail after {{pleading}} guilty to two counts of using a carriage service, the Internet, to cause offense, for posts on Facebook memorial pages, and one count each of distributing and possessing child pornography when he posted images on the memorial pages of the deceased with <b>phalluses</b> superimposed alongside phrases such as [...] "Woot I'm dead".|$|R
50|$|In {{the village}} of Tizangara, UN Blue Helmets work as peacekeepers after years of civil war. Five explosions kill five soldiers; only their helmets and their <b>phalluses</b> are left.

Assisted by Joaquim, a local translator, Massimo starts the enquiry and soon discovers that not everything is what it appears to be.|$|R
50|$|In Roman art, apotropaic imagery was {{a common}} theme. Envy was thought to bring bad luck to the person envied. To avoid envy, Romans sought to incite {{laughter}} in their guests by using humorous images. Images such as large <b>phalluses</b> (see fascinus), deformities like hunchbacks, or Pygmies and other non-Roman subjects were common. Romans saw deformity as comical and believed that such images {{could be used to}} deflect the evil eye.|$|R
