5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Positive {{charges in}} Hf-based gate stacks play an {{important}} role in the negative bias temperature instability of pMOSFETs, and their suppression is a pressing issue. The loca-tion of <b>positive</b> <b>charges</b> is not clear, and central to this letter is determining which layer of the stack dominates <b>positive</b> <b>charging.</b> The results clearly show that <b>positive</b> <b>charges</b> are dominated by the interfacial layer (IL) and that they do not pile up at the HfSiON/IL interface. The results support the assumption that <b>positive</b> <b>charges</b> are located close to the IL/substrate interface. Unlike electron trapping that reduces rapidly for thinner Hf dielectric layer, posi-tive charges cannot be reduced by using a thinner HfSiON film.

5|$|Thomson {{suggested}} that atoms were divisible, {{and that the}} corpuscles were their building blocks. To explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge; this was the plum pudding model as the electrons were embedded in the <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> like plums in a plum pudding (although in Thomson's model they were not stationary).|$|E
5|$|Thomson's {{plum pudding}} model was disproved in 1909 {{by one of}} his former students, Ernest Rutherford, who {{discovered}} that most of the mass and <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> of an atom is concentrated in a very small fraction of its volume, which he assumed to be at the very center.|$|E
5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

5|$|Technetium {{is located}} in the seventh group of the {{periodic}} table, between rhenium and manganese. As predicted by the periodic law, its chemical properties are between those two elements. Of the two, technetium more closely resembles rhenium, particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form covalent bonds. Unlike manganese, technetium does not readily form cations (ions with a net <b>positive</b> <b>charge).</b> Technetium exhibits nine oxidation states from −1 to +7, with +4, +5, and +7 being the most common. Technetium dissolves in aqua regia, nitric acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid, but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any concentration.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external field {{is caused by the}} electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E
5|$|The <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> in ions is {{achieved}} by stripping away electrons from atomic nuclei. The number of electrons removed is related to either the increase in temperature or the local density of other ionised matter. This also can be accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds, though this process is distinctly different from chemical processes of ion interactions in liquids or the behavior of ions existing in metals. The response of plasma to electromagnetic fields can be usefully employed in many modern technological devices, such as plasma televisions or plasma etching.|$|E

The direction of conventional current is arbitrarily defined as the same direction as <b>positive</b> <b>charges</b> flow.|$|R

5|$|When {{a charge}} {{is placed in}} a {{location}} with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential {{at a certain point}} in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.|$|E
5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle with a <b>positive</b> <b>charge,</b> {{such as the}} proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper {{essentially}} predicting {{the existence of}} the positron, after a paper by Paul Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the Dirac equation, which unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect. Oppenheimer, drawing on the body of experimental evidence, rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons. He argued {{that they would have to}} have the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, {{experiments}} by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz {{had largely}} established {{the structure of}} an atom as a dense nucleus of <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom. However, Bohr's model failed {{to account for the}} relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.|$|E
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E
40|$|A Hf-based {{dielectric}} {{has been}} selected to replace SiON for CMOS technologies. When compared with SiON, Hf dielectrics can suffer from higher instability. Previous attentions were focused on electron trapping, and <b>positive</b> <b>charging</b> received less attention. The objective {{of this paper is}} to study the impact of <b>positive</b> <b>charging</b> on device performance and to provide a framework for the defect. Three components of threshold voltage instability Delta Vth are unambiguously identified for pMOSFETs, i. e., loop, loop-shift, and up-loop. The loop dominates Delta Vth at a relatively short time (< 1 s). After stressing for a longer time, the whole loop is shifted in the negative direction. Unlike the loop, the up-loop cannot readily be recharged after recovery. In addition to the generated interface states, three different types of <b>positive</b> <b>charges</b> are formed in the Hf-based stacks, i. e., cyclic <b>positive</b> <b>charges</b> (CPC), antineutralization <b>positive</b> <b>charges</b> (ANPC), and as-grown hole trapping (AHT). Each type of defect has its unique signatures and properties. CPC can repeatedly be charged and discharged by alternating the gate bias polarity. ANPC is more difficult to neutralize, whereas AHT is harder to charge. Both the generated interface states and the AHT saturate at longer stress time, but ANPC does not. ANPC reduces at higher measurement temperature, but CPC is insensitive to temperature. The relation between each type of defect and each component of Delta Vth is clarified. status: publishe...|$|R

The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge.

A dash generated a <b>positive</b> <b>charge,</b> and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1.

5|$|In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the <b>positive</b> <b>charge</b> of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus {{at the center of the}} atom.
