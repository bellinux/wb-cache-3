5|$|According to Mummer Kaylan, {{author of}} The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey, Bazna {{said that he}} began spying for the Germans because he needed the money and, {{although}} {{he was not a}} Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to involvement with the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965. The British historian Richard Wires wrote Bazna was motivated entirely by greed as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. Wires described Bazna as a typical <b>petty</b> <b>criminal</b> from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found to try to get rich, but who was easily duped by the Germans.|$|E

He had, in fact, drifted into Chicago where he went under the alias of Jimmy Lawrence, a <b>petty</b> <b>criminal</b> from Wisconsin who bore a close resemblance to Dillinger. Working as a clerk, Dillinger found that, in a large metropolis like Chicago, {{he was able to}} lead an anonymous existence for a while.

25|$|His {{background}} is explored {{further in the}} comic book Serenity: The Shepherd's Tale. Book was born Henry Evans, a boy who was raised by an abusive father. He {{ran away from home}} and began life as a <b>petty</b> <b>criminal</b> before being recruited by the Independence movement and moving out to the Border Worlds. Long before the Alliance begins the Unification War, forward-thinking Browncoats assign Evans to be a long-term mole. He sheds his old identity by killing a random passerby and stealing his identification card, becoming Derrial Book. His Browncoat superiors keep tabs on him by surgically removing one of his eyes and replacing it with a camera. He joins the Alliance military and quickly moves up in rank. Becoming an officer, Book intentionally leads a risky operation that results in a humiliating defeat for the Alliance. He is forced to retire from the Alliance military. It is implied that the Alliance covers up the loss, therefore not officially punishing Book. Homeless, he visits a soup kitchen and finds God while contemplating a bowl of soup. He takes refuge at an abbey where he becomes a shepherd before leaving on Serenity to become a missionary.|$|E
500|$|Jackie Chan {{contacted}} Benny Chan {{shortly after}} the release of New Police Story to discuss plans for a new action film.

Eventually, Benny Chan and scriptwriter Alan Yuen came up with a daring idea: Chan will play Thongs, a <b>petty</b> <b>criminal</b> who has fallen out with his family over his gambling habit. Benny Chan had originally intended for Jackie to play a full-fledged villain, who [...] "hits women and burns people with cigarettes". However, the script was toned down to appease the Chinese censors, who found the character to be too evil. Nevertheless, for only the third time in his acting career, Chan plays a character who is sentenced to prison.|$|E
500|$|Immediately after Spider-Man 2s release, Ivan Raimi wrote a {{treatment}} over two months, with Sam Raimi deciding {{to use the}} film to explore Peter learning {{that he is not}} a sinless vigilante, and that there also can be humanity in those he considers criminals. Harry Osborn was brought back as Raimi wanted to conclude his storyline. Raimi felt that Harry would not follow his father's legacy, but be instead [...] "somewhere between." [...] Sandman was introduced as an antagonist, as Raimi found him a visually fascinating character. While Sandman is a <b>petty</b> <b>criminal</b> in the comics, the screenwriters created a background of the character being Uncle Ben's killer to increase Peter's guilt over his death and challenge his simplistic perception of the event. Overall, Raimi described the film as being about Peter, Mary Jane, Harry, and the Sandman, with Peter's journey being one of forgiveness.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written in 1955, by Mae Boren Axton, {{a high school teacher}} with a {{background}} in musical promotion, and Jacksonville based singer–songwriter Tommy Durden. The lyrics were based on a report supposedly in The Miami Herald about a man who had destroyed all his identity papers and jumped to his death from a hotel window, leaving a suicide note with the single line, [...] "I walk a lonely street". In 2016, an article in Rolling Stone magazine suggested that the story in reality originated from a report about a painter and <b>petty</b> <b>criminal,</b> Alvin Krolik, whose marriage had failed and who wrote a partial autobiography including the line [...] "This {{is the story of a}} person who walked a lonely street." [...] Krolik's story was published in news media, and received further publicity after he was shot and killed in an attempted robbery in El Paso, Texas. [...] On August 25, 1955, the El Paso Times reported Krolik's death under the headline [...] "Story Of Person Who Walked Lonely Street".|$|E
500|$|Murphy made a brief re-appearance as the Scarecrow in Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008), {{the sequel}} to Batman Begins, before {{starring}} in The Edge of Love—about a love quadrangle involving the poet Dylan Thomas—with Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller and Matthew Rhys. Murphy also made a debut appearance in another medium—on a postage stamp: in July 2008, the Irish Post Office, An Post, released a series of four stamps paying homage to the creativity of films recently produced in Ireland, including one featuring Murphy in a still from The Wind That Shakes the Barley. In 2009, Murphy starred opposite rock singer Feist and actor David Fox in The Water, directed by Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene. The 15-minute Canadian short film, released online in April 2009, is nearly silent until the Feist song of the same title plays close to the end. Murphy was attracted to the role as a fan of Broken Social Scene {{and the prospect of}} making a silent movie, which he considered to be the [...] "hardest test for any actor". Murphy also starred in Perrier's Bounty, a crime dramedy from the makers of Intermission, in which he portrayed a <b>petty</b> <b>criminal</b> on the run from a gangster played by Brendan Gleeson.|$|E
500|$|By 1980, {{there were}} a number of {{unlicensed}} nightclubs operating on Denmark Place, running adjacent to the street. The clubs were housed in buildings that had previously functioned as a hostel for musicians, which adjoined a music shop on the street, and the fire brigade had insisted that a fire escape be fitted. By the time the clubs were in operation, the shop had closed and the fire escape had fallen into disrepair. 18 Denmark Place was home to two such clubs; on the first floor was [...] "Rodo's", a salsa club popular with South American immigrants and above that [...] "The Spanish Rooms" [...] on the second floor which was a late night bar frequented by locals including Irish and Jamaican immigrants. On 14 August 1980 John Thompson, a local <b>petty</b> <b>criminal,</b> was ejected from The Spanish Rooms following a fight which may have been caused by a dispute about being overcharged. Thompson returned shortly thereafter and poured petrol into the ground floor of the building and ignited it. The inferno resulting from this act of arson killed 37 people from eight different nationalities and was described as the worst fire in London in terms of loss of life since World War II. Thompson was imprisoned having been convicted of murder and died in prison in 2008 on the anniversary of the tragedy.|$|E
