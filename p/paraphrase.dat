5|$|Nostradamus was {{not only}} a diviner, but a {{professional}} healer. It is known that he wrote at least two books on medical science. One was an extremely free translation (or rather a <b>paraphrase)</b> of The Protreptic of Galen (<b>Paraphrase</b> de C. GALIEN, sus l'Exhortation de Menodote aux estudes des bonnes Artz, mesmement Medicine), and in his so-called Traité des fardemens (basically a medical cookbook containing, once again, materials borrowed mainly from others), he included a description of the methods he used to treat the plague, including bloodletting, none of which apparently worked. The same book also describes the preparation of cosmetics.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} checking the acceptability of <b>paraphrases</b> in context. We use the Google n-gram data and a CCG parser to certify the <b>paraphrasing</b> grammaticality and fluency. We collect a corpus of human judgements to evaluate our system. The ultimate goal of our work is to integrate text <b>paraphrasing</b> into a Linguistic Steganography system, by using <b>paraphrases</b> to hide information in a cover text. We propose automatically generated <b>paraphrases</b> as a new and useful source of transformations for Linguistic Steganography, and show that our method for checking <b>paraphrases</b> is effective at maintaining {{a high level of}} imperceptibility, which is crucial for effective steganography. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a system for}} automatically generating a set of plausible <b>paraphrases</b> for a given noun compound and rank them in decreasing order of their usage represented by the confidence value provided by the human annotators. Our system implements a corpusdriven probabilistic co-occurrence based model for predicting the <b>paraphrases,</b> that uses a seed list of <b>paraphrases</b> extracted from corpus to predict other <b>paraphrases</b> based on their co-occurrences. The corpus study reveals that the prepositional <b>paraphrases</b> for the noun compounds are quite frequent and well covered but the verb <b>paraphrases,</b> on the other hand, are scarce, revealing the unsuitability of the model for standalone corpus-driven approach. Therefore, to predict other <b>paraphrases,</b> we adopt a two-fold approach: (i) Prediction based on Verb-Verb cooccurrences, in case the seed <b>paraphrases</b> are greater than threshold; and (ii) Prediction based on Semantic Relation of NC, otherwise. The system achieves a comparabale score of 0. 23 for the isomorphic system while maintaining a score of 0. 26 for the non-isomorphic system...|$|R
5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or <b>paraphrase</b> by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Several of Josquin's masses {{feature the}} <b>paraphrase</b> technique, and they {{include some of}} his most famous work {{including}} the great Missa Gaudeamus. The relatively early Missa Ave maris stella, which probably dates from his years in the Sistine Chapel choir, paraphrases the Marian antiphon of the same name; {{it is also one of}} his shortest masses. The late Missa de Beata Virgine paraphrases plainchants in praise of the Virgin Mary; it is a Lady Mass, a votive mass for Saturday performance, and was his most popular mass in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|A repeat {{performance}} of BWV243a may have accompanied the first performance of BWV10 on 2July 1724. The libretto of the cantata performed in Leipzig at {{the feast of}} the Visitation of 1725 survives. Maria Aurora von Königsmarck is the possible author of this Magnificat <b>paraphrase.</b> Around a decade before the libretto was reprinted in Leipzig it had already been set by Reinhard Keiser and Johann Mattheson. It is not known whether Bach set the libretto, neither which setting of the libretto was used for the 1725 Visitation feast in Leipzig. A year later Bach performed Der Herr wird ein Neues im Lande, JLB13, a Visitation cantata by his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach. Picander's libretto for the Visitation cantata of 1728 may have been set as part of Bach's fourth cantata cycle: the libretto, surviving without music, starts with a dictum quoted from Luther's German translation of Luke1:46–47.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a <b>paraphrasing</b> method for Japanese honorifics. Japanese honorific expressions, as seen in real world dialogs, have many forms of {{identical}} meanings. This paper discusses a <b>paraphrasing</b> method that simplifies each utterance by removing honorifics. To simplify an utterance, we take a practical approach: investigate a corpus, and construct <b>paraphrasing</b> rules that eliminate honorifics. We discuss how the constructed <b>paraphrasing</b> rules are effective for the simplification of each utterance, and a disambiguation method for some honorific verbs that require disambiguation {{in order to be}} <b>paraphrased.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Some {{particular}} {{classes of}} lexical <b>paraphrases</b> such as verb alteration and compound noun decomposition {{can be handled}} {{by a handful of}} general rules and lexical semantic knowledge. In this paper, we attempt to capture the regularity underlying these classes of <b>paraphrases,</b> focusing on the <b>paraphrasing</b> of Japanese light-verb constructions (LVCs). We propose a <b>paraphrasing</b> model for LVCs that is based on transforming the Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCSs) of verbal elements. We also propose a refinement of an existing LCS dictionary. Experimental results show that our LCS-based <b>paraphrasing</b> model characterizes some of the semantic features of those verbs required for generating <b>paraphrases,</b> such as the direction of an action and the relationship between arguments and surface cases. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective Young children’s {{descriptions}} of maltreatment are often sparse thus creating {{the need for}} techniques that elicit lengthier accounts. One technique {{that can be used}} by interviewers in an attempt to increase children’s reports is ‘paraphrasing’, or repeating information children have disclosed. Although we currently have a general understanding of how <b>paraphrasing</b> may influence children’s reports, {{we do not have a}} clear description of how <b>paraphrasing</b> is actually used in the field. Method The present study assessed the use of <b>paraphrasing</b> in 125 interviews of children aged 4 to 16 years conducted by police officers and social workers. All interviewer prompts were coded into four different categories of <b>paraphrasing.</b> All children’s reports were coded for the number of details in response to each <b>paraphrasing</b> statement. Results ‘Expansion paraphrasing’ (e. g., “you said he hit you. Tell me more about when he hit you”) was used significantly more often and elicited significantly more details, while ‘yes/no paraphrasing’ (e. g., “he hit you?”) resulted in shorter descriptions from children, compared to other <b>paraphrasing</b> styles. Further, interviewers more often distorted children’s words when using yes/no <b>paraphrasing,</b> and children rarely corrected interviewers when they <b>paraphrased</b> inaccurately. Conclusions and Practical Implications Investigative interviewers in this sample frequently used <b>paraphrasing</b> with children of all ages and, though children’s responses differed following the various styles of <b>paraphrasing,</b> the effects did not differ by the age of the child witness. The results suggest that <b>paraphrasing</b> affects the quality of statements by child witnesses. Implications for investigative interviewers will be discussed and recommendations offered for easy ways to use <b>paraphrasing</b> to increase the descriptiveness of children’s reports of their experiences...|$|R
5|$|The {{positioning}} of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a <b>paraphrase</b> of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses {{of some of the}} figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{that they}} could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a {{solution}} at the earliest opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to <b>paraphrase</b> Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world.|$|E
5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to <b>paraphrase</b> the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E

40|$|Translation memory tools lack {{semantic}} knowledge like <b>paraphrasing</b> {{when they}} perform matching and retrieval. As a result, <b>paraphrased</b> segments {{are often not}} retrieved.

5|$|To works, however, {{of which}} the {{excellence}} is not absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and experience, no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time.
