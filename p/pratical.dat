This comparative study of exploring character was carried with the companies owners of Social Stamp IBASE, wich published its Social Balances in the model considered for the institute in the year of 2004. For such, beyond the documentary research involving the published balances, a conceptual revision over the main subjects was necessary and also it constitutes part of the study. The joined results supply measurable and representative information about the main characteristics of social action of the companies, propitiating a comparative analysis and the emission of critical considerations, that do not finish themselves, but establishes a possibility of different readings concerning the models of social responsible management undertaken by companies from public and private segments...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{contradictory}} movement intra and intersocial that characterises the ‘technological convergence’, over all when analyzed {{in the context of}} insertion of the  TICs <b>praticals</b> of one school´s everyday. At this differentiated locus, the main characteristic seems to be continuum of the affirmation and negation movement of the production, appropriation and diffusion processes of the scientific knowledge. From a sociological analysis of the complexity of the expression  “technologic convergence', initially appropriated from the mathematicians, this article has as target the comprehension of the multifaceted way of technologycal construction, going beyond the scope of material production. In function of its economic dimension as instrument for the solution of real problems, the  ‘technological convergence’ tends to add the direction of a movement intra and intersocial in its constitution´s process. This sociological reflection proposal updates the concept using factors that are part of a new technological convergence, giving it a symbolical and ideological dimension, that the deeply study demands...|$|R
40|$|The book “exhibit” {{is part of}} the {{publishing}} serie which has for several yars kept record of research and didactic work of GIDE – Group for international design educarion – developed every year on specific topics member schools. This volume introduces a new editorial and graphic concept promoted and carried out by the Laboratory of visual culture and by the interior design and visual communication bachelor course og the university of applied science and arts of souther switzerlan (supsi lugano) in collaboration with dhoc – interio design for hospitable city research group at politecnico of milano, schools of design, indaco department. The book collects internation contribution of experts, lecturesrs, professors and researchers and the results of a mobile experimental studio in interior design, product design and interior architecture. The studeio get materialized once a year in one of the partner countries to set a common exhibition of students projects and design workshop on the next year subject. The international eorkshop “workshow” that took place in lugano in 2010 was starting point for the work on the shared theme “exhibit”. As a customary, the hosting schools launched the topic with the perspective to diffuse skills and know how in museography and exhibition design, field of research and didactic experience at the school. The “lectures” by Michele amadò and pietro vitali in the first part “essays”, established the theoretical foundations which are provided to the other schools to workshops and didactic <b>praticals</b> in the academic year 2010 / 2011. In the section “approaches” the wide panorama of the topic “exhibit” is presented with the regardings and interpretation in the various countries and schools. Approaches, context, method and instruments, output, future scenarios, research cue and theoretical contribution interweave in the 7 -countries work description. Exhibit is hence explored and expressed. Show as occupation: occupying place, occupying time, occupying imagination is part of Dundee work on echibit. Leeds students where asked to answer the question: should every city look the same, with a homogenous proliferation of chain stores, and diminishing indipendent local family business? The interiors described the Concalo Tavares tale “misters” is one of the subject explored by Ljubljana; how an urban public space could represent the citizen is the starting point for the work performed by Lugano. Interactive Exhibits and the study for a Kinder Natur Museum was done by Magdeburg whereas Mechelen explored on “design for show” in the many possible readings. Milano involved both students from Products and Interior Design working on exhibition as a way to add value to urban public spaces (indoor and outdoor). The 42 more significant outcomes of projects developed during fall semester 2010 / 2011 by each partecipant school are collected in the third part of the book “projects”. The output gives evidence of the added value given opportunity to share and compare smong 7 different European countries experiences, cultures, mixture of approaches to design and distinct aspects of the discipline...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{indicator}} of speeds and distance {{as seen in}} the BSGverse is that during and after the Cylon attack Galactica and other ships are in radio communication with each other as are the various planets without signifgant delay. Adama asks if they are with voice range of Colonial One to speak with Apollo. This means they can’t be more than roughly 186,000 miles apart. Radio waves travel {{at the speed of light}} - 3 x 108 m/s. We know that Galactica is able to communicate with Apollo and Colonial One as well as Caprica and other vessels in the area. Colonial One is with a few hours of Caprica as then by necessity is Galactica. This would seem to suggest that the Galactica and Colonial One are within at least 500,000 miles of Caprica otherwise there would a signifgant time delay in communications. At 500,000 miles there would be a 3 second delay for a radio signal to reach a ship. Sense Laura Roslin appears to talk in real time to cabinet members, as does Adama to Apollo in real time, they must be relative close proximity of a few hundred thousand miles. [...] If we accept this and Colonial One is 1-2 hours from Caprica as stated in pilot then it has to travel at least 500,000mph-250,000mph (804,671kph-402,336kph; 138-69 miles/sec), or 0.07419% the speed of light. However, given that Colonial ships are said to be capable of traveing at relativistic speeds, any speeds slower than 99% light are an absolute possibility. Another very real reason for traveling at significantly less than relativistic speeds are numerous. One of the most signifgant is fuel expenditure. The closer a vessel approaches light speed the greater it's mass increases as dictated by E=mc2 and thus directly related so does it's fuel expenditure. In the original 1978 series Commander Cane in [...] "Living Legend" [...] tells Adama that it will take roughly half his fuel to get the Pegasus to light speed. And second and most <b>pratical,</b> it would be simply insane to travel any faster than half a percent the speed of light in a star system full of asteroids, comets, junk, satellites, other ships, ETC. Objects as small as micro-meteors would be lethal at even fractions of a fraction of relativistic speeds. The time to detect and evade an object in such relative close proximity at near light speeds is literally none existent. And an FTL jump from inside a star system is just as insane for the same reasons. This is highlighted in the pilot part 1 when Colonel Tye says to Commander Adama [...] "You don't want to do this." [...] Adama replies, [...] "I know". Tye responds, [...] "Because no sane man would.", Adama replies, [...] "No choice. Colonel Tye begin preparations for a hyper-light jump." [...] Referring to Adama's decision to execute a FTL jump from inside the Helios alpha system to the Ragnar munitions anchorage orbiting the Helios Delta system. A truly last ditch effort that could very likely end in disaster.|$|E

It is a recent field of theorical computer science, that rapidly developed since it appeared in M. I Shamos' thesis in 1978. Randomization allows to avoid the use of complicated data structures, and has been proved to be very efficient, from both points of view of theoretical complexity and <b>pratical</b> results. We take particular interest in designing dynamic algorithms : in practice, the data of a problem are often acquired progressively.
