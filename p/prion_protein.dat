5|$|All known prion diseases, collectively called {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal. However, {{a vaccine}} developed in mice may provide insight into providing a vaccine to resist prion infections in humans. Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring <b>prion</b> <b>protein</b> are resistant to infection by scrapie <b>prion</b> <b>protein.</b> In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious <b>prion</b> <b>protein</b> that causes vCJD.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Polymorphisms in {{the human}} <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> lead to amino acid substitutions by the {{conversion}} of PrPC to PrPSc and amyloid formation, resulting in prion diseases such as familial Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Gerstmann– Straussler–Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia. Cation–p interaction is a non-covalent binding force that {{plays a significant role}} in protein stability. Here, we employ a novel approach by combining various in silico tools along with molecular dynamics simulation to provide structural and functional insight into the effect of mutation on the stability and activity of mutant <b>prion</b> <b>proteins.</b> We have investigated impressions of prevalent mutations including 1 E 1 S, 1 E 1 P, 1 E 1 U, 1 E 1 P, 1 FKC and 2 K 1 D on the human <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> and compared them with wild type. Structural analyses of the models were performed with the aid of molecular dynamics simulation methods. According to our results, frequently occurred mutations were observed in conserved sequences of human <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> and the most fluctuation values appear in the 2 K 1 D mutant model at around helix 4 with residues ranging from 190 to 194. Our observations in this study could help to further understand the structural stability of <b>prion</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{functions}} and mechanisms of <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> (PrPC) are currently unknown, but most {{experts believe that}} deformed or pathogenic <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> (PrPSc) originate from PrPC, and {{that there may be}} plural main sites for the conversion of normal PrPC into PrPSc. In order to better understand the mechanism of PrPC transformation to PrPSc, the most important step is to determine the replacement or substitution site...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} evidence supports the hypothe-sis that <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> (PrPs) {{are involved in}} the Cu(II) metabolism. Moreover, the copper binding region has been implicated in transmissible spongiform encepha-lopathies, which are caused by the infectious isoform of <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> (PrPSc). In contrast to mammalian PrP, avian <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> have a considerably different N-terminal copper binding region and, most interestingly, are not able to undergo the conversion process into an infectious isoform. Therefore, we applied x-ray absorp-tion spectroscopy to analyze in detail the Cu(II) geome-try of selected synthetic human PrP Cu(II) octapeptide complexes in comparison with the corresponding chicken PrP hexapeptide complexes at pH 6. 5, which mimics the conditions in the endocytic compartments o...|$|R
5|$|Until 2015 {{all known}} {{mammalian}} prion diseases {{were considered to}} be caused by the <b>prion</b> <b>protein,</b> PrP; in 2015 Multiple System Atrophy was found to be likely caused by a new prion, the misfolded form of a protein called alpha-synuclein. The endogenous, properly folded form of the <b>prion</b> <b>protein</b> is denoted PrPC (for Common or Cellular), whereas the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted PrPSc (for Scrapie), after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.) The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrPC, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction. Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.|$|E
5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP gene can modify {{the course of the}} disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms that develop. This gene produces <b>prion</b> <b>protein,</b> which is active in the brain and other tissues and also appears to be involved in transporting copper. A role for the ApoE gene was initially suspected but could not be confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Prions are {{infectious}} agents composed {{entirely of}} a protein material that can fold in multiple, structurally abstract ways, {{at least one}} of which is transmissible to other prion proteins, leading to disease {{in a manner that is}} epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection. Prions composed of the <b>prion</b> <b>protein</b> (PrP) are believed to be the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) among other diseases.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the <b>prion</b> <b>protein</b> (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion disease variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, however, {{is believed to be}} caused by a prion that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|E
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{function of the}} <b>prion</b> <b>protein</b> remains a controversial matter. While data from in vitro experiments suggest many dissimilar roles, studies on PrP knockout mice have provided only limited information because these animals exhibit only minor abnormalities. In research done in mice, {{it was found that}} the cleavage of PrP proteins in peripheral nerves causes the activation of myelin repair in Schwann cells and that the lack of PrP proteins caused demyelination in those cells.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, {{but it did not}} have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the <b>prion</b> <b>protein,</b> the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
40|$|Although {{osteosarcoma}} is {{the most}} common bone malignancy, the molecular and cellular mechanisms influencing its pathogenesis have remained elusive. <b>Prion</b> <b>proteins</b> (PRNP and PRND), known mostly for its involvement in neurodegenerative spongiform encephalopathies, have been recently demonstrated to be involved in resistance to apoptosis, tumorigenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. The main aim of research was to study whether <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> were over-expressed in human osteosarcoma, and if <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> could have a role also in osteosarcomas. We evaluated differential gene expression between 22 cases of osteosarcoma and 40 cases of normal bone specimens through cDNA microarray analysis spanning a substantial fraction of the human genome. PRNP and PRND are significantly over-expressed in osteosarcoma. PRNP and PRND appear involved with some important genes related to tumorigenesis and apoptosis. PRNP is linked to PTK 2, RBBP 9, and TGFB 1 while PRND is linked to TNFSF 10, BCL 2 A 1, NFKB 2, and TP 53 RK. Increased expression on Affymetrix arrays of <b>prion</b> <b>proteins</b> seems {{to be associated with the}} development of osteosarcoma. Prions seem to induce a negative regulation of apoptosis, thus promoting osteosarcoma development and progression. Osteosarcoma is a very aggressive tumor and even after modern chemotherapy and excision of tumors efforts are needed to improve clinical outcome. Since <b>Prion</b> <b>proteins</b> seem to be related to osteosarcoma development, their inhibition could represent a new approach to the molecular treatment of osteosarcoma. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The globular domain in chPrP and tPrP contains three α-helices, one short 310 -helix, and a short antiparallel β-sheet. In xlPrP, the globular domain includes three α-helices and a somewhat longer β-sheet than in the other species. The spatial arrangement of these regular secondary structures coincides closely {{with that of the}} globular domain in mammalian <b>prion</b> <b>proteins.</b> Based on the low sequence identity to mammalian PrPs, comparison of chPrP, tPrP, and xlPrP with mammalian PrPC structures is used to identify a set of essential amino acid positions for the preservation of the same PrPC fold in birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. There are additional conserved residues without apparent structural roles, which are of interest for the ongoing search for physiological functions of PrPC in healthy organisms...|$|R

5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the <b>prion</b> <b>protein</b> gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of a prion-like domain arises {{from the study of}} fungal prions. In yeast, prionogenic proteins have a portable prion domain that is both necessary and sufficient for self-templating and protein aggregation. This has been shown by attaching the prion domain to a reporter protein, which then aggregates like a known prion. Similarly, removing the prion domain from a fungal <b>prion</b> <b>protein</b> inhibits prionogenesis. This modular view of prion behaviour has led to the hypothesis that similar prion domains are present in animal proteins, in addition to PrP. These fungal prion domains have several characteristic sequence features. They are typically enriched in asparagine, glutamine, tyrosine and glycine residues, with an asparagine bias being particularly conducive to the aggregative property of prions. Historically, prionogenesis has been seen as independent of sequence and only dependent on relative residue content. However, this {{has been shown to be}} false, with the spacing of prolines and charged residues having been shown to be critical in amyloid formation.|$|E

Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrPSc form of PrP is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids such as blood or urine.

500|$|In 1982, Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California, San Francisco {{announced}} {{that his team}} had purified the hypothetical infectious prion, and that the infectious agent consisted mainly of a specific protein– though they did not manage to isolate the protein until two years after Prusiner's announcement. [...] While the infectious agent was named a prion, the specific protein that the prion was composed of {{is also known as}} the <b>Prion</b> <b>Protein</b> (PrP), though this protein may occur both in infectious and non-infectious forms.

500|$|Prions may {{propagate}} by transmitting their misfolded protein state. When a prion {{enters a}} healthy organism, it induces existing, properly folded proteins {{to convert into}} the misfolded prion form. In this way, the prion acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more proteins into prion form. In yeast, this refolding is assisted by chaperone proteins such as Hsp104. These refolded prions can {{then go on to}} convert more proteins themselves, leading to a chain reaction resulting in large amounts of the prion form. All known prions induce the formation of an amyloid fold, in which the protein polymerises into an aggregate consisting of tightly packed beta sheets. Amyloid aggregates are fibrils, growing at their ends, and replicate when breakage causes two growing ends to become four growing ends. The incubation period of prion diseases is determined by the exponential growth rate associated with prion replication, which is a balance between the linear growth and the breakage of aggregates. [...] The propagation of the prion depends on the presence of normally folded protein in which the prion can induce misfolding; animals that do not express the normal form of the <b>prion</b> <b>protein</b> can neither develop nor transmit the disease.|$|E
