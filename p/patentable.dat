25|$|A {{competent}} draftsman could attach {{some form}} of post-solution activity to almost any mathematical formula; the Pythagorean theorem {{would not have been}} <b>patentable,</b> or partially <b>patentable,</b> because a patent application contained a final step indicating that the formula, when solved, could be usefully applied to existing surveying techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} patent {{scene has}} become a hotbed of controversy following the decisions of U.S. courts to recognize living things as <b>patentable</b> subject matter. Patent lawyers representing {{the interest of the}} U.S. biotechnology industry are in the forefront of the debate, pressing for other countries to adopt more extensive patent laws recognizing living materials as <b>patentable</b> subject matter, just as U.S. courts and the United States Patent & Trademark Office have.|$|E
25|$|In general, inventions are {{eligible}} for patent protection if they pass the tests of patentability: <b>patentable</b> subject matter, novelty, inventive step or non-obviousness, and industrial applicability (or utility).|$|E
25|$|Whether a {{business}} method {{is regarded as}} <b>patentable</b> subject matter depends on the legal jurisdiction. The World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) does not specifically address business method patents.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{patent office}} did find that Macrossan's process was both novel and {{involved}} an inventive step, but nonetheless rejected the {{application for a}} patent since the claimed subject matter was not <b>patentable</b> subject matter under UK patent law.|$|E
25|$|Aerotel's patent {{was found}} to relate to a <b>patentable</b> {{invention}} in principle because {{the system as a}} whole was new in itself, not merely because it is to be used for the business of selling phone calls. While this system could be implemented using conventional computers, the key to it was a new physical combination of hardware. The judge felt that this was clearly more than just a method of doing business as such. The method claims were construed as relating to a use of the new system and were also deemed to relate to a <b>patentable</b> invention in principle. The additional questions of whether the claimed invention was novel and involved an inventive step were not considered directly by the judge, although the implication is that the invention was at least novel.|$|E
25|$|In addition, as {{scientific}} knowledge has expanded and allowed new industries to arise in {{fields such as}} biotechnology and nanotechnology, originators of technology have sought IP protection for the new technologies. Patents have been granted for living organisms, (and in the United States, certain living organisms have been <b>patentable</b> for over a century).|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} Mayo step, the court must {{determine}} whether the patent claim under examination contains an abstract idea, such as an algorithm, method of computation, or other general principle. If not, the claim is potentially <b>patentable,</b> subject to the other requirements of the patent code. If the answer is affirmative, the court must proceed to the next step.|$|E
25|$|Harney was Ireland's {{representative}} to the European Council of Ministers for the Software Patents Directive. Because the Council's first reading fell during the Irish Presidency of the European Council, she was chair of the meeting that discarded the amendments by the European Parliament which confirmed the exclusion of software innovations from what constitutes <b>patentable</b> subject matter.|$|E
25|$|Following this judgment, the UK Patent Office (now the UK Intellectual Property Office) {{issued a}} Practice Note on 2 November 2006 announcing an {{immediate}} {{change in the}} way patent examiners will assess whether inventions relate to <b>patentable</b> subject matter. The Patent Office also prepared four case studies as examples of how they saw the test being applied in practice.|$|E
25|$|One {{change in}} {{practice}} that occurred was {{that claims to}} a computer program were rejected {{on the basis of}} the form of the claim, even if the process that was performed by the computer program was itself considered to be <b>patentable.</b> This new practice was challenged by Astron Clinica Ltd and others and the UK Patents Court judged that the practice was incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) TRIPS Agreement, patents {{should be}} {{available}} in WTO member states for any invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application. Nevertheless, there are variations on what is <b>patentable</b> subject matter from country to country, even among WTO member states. TRIPS also provides that the term of protection available should be a minimum of twenty years.|$|E
25|$|Some patent {{attorneys}} have expressed surprise at this decision since, while {{the merits of}} Macrossan's case might have been arguable, {{it was felt that}} there are issues with the law that require resolving. Consequently, there is disappointment at this missed opportunity to better establish where the boundary lies between <b>patentable</b> and non-patentable software. The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure have expressed the view that the decision of the House of Lords confirms that the correctness of the Court of Appeal.|$|E
25|$|When {{a feature}} has both artistic (copyrightable) and {{functional}} (<b>patentable)</b> merits, {{when the question}} has appeared in US court, the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can {{be separated from the}} functional aspects of the item. In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing, for example, the design of a useful device to be registered (as a whole) as an industrial design on the understanding that, in case of unauthorized copying, only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of {{biomedical}} research, notably in America, patents were taken out on particular genes, treatments and techniques. From 1991, the NIH permitted patents {{to be taken out}} on anonymous gene fragments. This created extra costs and impediments to creating new treatments and tests. Although in principle rights holders could come together to make a deal, cognitive biases exist in rights owners that can often prevent deals that would likely be beneficial from occurring. For example, tests for certain breast cancer mutations were unavailable since the rights holder for the BRCA human gene did not release them onto the market, which lead to false negative tests for cancer. In the end the courts held that human genes were not <b>patentable.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{opposition}} {{can only}} {{be based on a}} limited number of grounds, i.e. {{on the grounds that the}} subject-matter of the patent is not <b>patentable,</b> that the invention is insufficiently disclosed, or that the content of the patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed. The notice of opposition to a European patent must be filed in writing at the EPO (either at Munich, The Hague or Berlin), along with the payment of an opposition fee, within nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the patent in the European Patent Bulletin. Opposition Divisions of the EPO are responsible for the examination of oppositions. The opposition procedure may involve multiple opponents. According to the EPO, a European patent was once opposed by a record number of 27 opponents.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{pioneering}} work with gas Murdoch {{never made any}} money from this invention due to his failure to obtain a patent. This may have been partly {{a result of the}} advice of James Watt, Junior, that the discovery was not <b>patentable,</b> and partly a result of the commercial failure of his earlier patent of 1791 for an early form of aniline dye. This failure to apply for a patent, despite the commercial participation of Boulton and Watt in this field, left the fledgling industry of gas production and lighting open for exploitation by other commercial interests, such as his former assistant Samuel Clegg and Frederick Albert Winsor. In large part this was due to the failure of Boulton and Watt to make sufficient effort to expand from the factory and mill lighting market which they dominated by 1809 into the street and domestic lighting market. This reason for this lassitude is unknown but can be attributed to lack of interest, a failure to appreciate the size of the potential market, and a lack of desire to be involved in smaller, less prestigious projects. By May 1809 Boulton and Watt faced little competition in any gas market due to their success in lobbying Parliament to block the granting of a charter for the National Heat and Light Company, their only real competitor in this field. However, despite blocking the charter until 1812 this advantage was squandered as Boulton and Watt did not develop the gas market, or technology, and in 1814 abandoned the gas business. A few decades later most towns in Britain were lit by gas and most had their own gasworks.|$|E
2500|$|Algorithms, by themselves, are {{not usually}} <b>patentable.</b> In the United States, a claim {{consisting}} solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute [...] "processes" [...] (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not <b>patentable</b> (as in Gottschalk v. Benson). However, practical applications of algorithms are sometimes <b>patentable.</b> For example, in Diamond v. Diehr, {{the application of a}} simple feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of synthetic rubber was deemed <b>patentable.</b> The patenting of software is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially data compression algorithms, such as Unisys' LZW patent.|$|E

2500|$|Per Chapter II, , part (k) of the Indian Patent Act, {{business}} {{methods are}} not <b>patentable</b> per se. However they are <b>patentable</b> {{if a new}} method solves a [...] "technical" [...] problem and an apparatus/system is involved.|$|E
2500|$|However, a {{business}} method {{that is an}} abstract idea does not become <b>patentable</b> merely {{because it has a}} practical application. [...] For example, a particular business method that is an abstract idea does not become <b>patentable</b> merely because it is programmed into a computer as an algorithm. [...] For {{a business}} method to be <b>patentable,</b> the algorithm cannot be the whole invention, but only one aspect of a novel combination.

2500|$|Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2347 [...] (2014), was a 2014 {{decision}} of the United States Supreme Court about <b>patentable</b> subject matter (patent eligibility). The issue in the case was whether certain claims about a computer-implemented, electronic escrow service for facilitating financial transactions covered abstract ideas ineligible for patent protection. The patents were held to be invalid because the claims were drawn to an abstract idea, and implementing those claims on a computer {{was not enough to}} transform that idea into [...] <b>patentable</b> subject matter.|$|E
2500|$|There is no general {{prohibition}} on the patentability of business methods in Australia. Their patentability {{is determined by}} applying the tests {{used to determine the}} patentability of any type of invention. However, in the decision of Grant v Commissioner of Patents [...] FCAFC 120, at paragraph , the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia held that a business method will only be <b>patentable</b> if it has a physical aspect, being a concrete, tangible, physical, or observable effect or phenomenon. Accordingly, 'pure' business methods, being those that do not have a physical aspect, are not <b>patentable</b> in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Under the European Patent Convention, [...] "chemes, {{rules and}} methods for (...) doing business" [...] are not {{regarded}} as inventions {{and are not}} <b>patentable,</b> [...] "to the extent that a European patent application or European patent relates to such subject-matter or activities as such".|$|E
2500|$|... {{three of}} the thorniest issues in the {{patentability}} thicket: (1) the continued viability of business method patents, (2) what constitutes sufficient physical transformation or machine-implementation to render a process <b>patentable,</b> and (3) {{the extent to which}} computer software and computer-implemented processes constitute statutory subject matter.|$|E
2500|$|Gurney {{assigned}} his {{patent rights}} to Douglas Aircraft, but {{the device was}} not <b>patentable,</b> since it was substantially similar to a movable microflap patented by E.F.

2500|$|... hile {{the court}} struck down what was universally {{said to be}} a bad patent, it didn't do much to say what kinds of {{software}} should be <b>patentable.</b> In other words, the court decided the most basic conflict in the case, but more or less declined to offer guidance for other, future cases.|$|E
2500|$|... {{an unfortunate}} and {{apparently}} unconscious, though clear, commingling of distinct statutory provisions which are conceptually unrelated, namely, those {{pertaining to the}} categories of inventions in § 101 which may be <b>patentable</b> and to the conditions for patentability demanded by the statute for inventions within the statutory categories, particularly the nonobviousness condition of § 103.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{began by}} {{recognizing}} that the patents cover {{what amounts to a}} computerized escrow arrangement. The Court held that Mayo explained how {{to address the problem of}} determining whether a patent claimed a patent-ineligible abstract idea or instead a potentially <b>patentable</b> practical implementation of an idea. This requires using a [...] "two-step" [...] analysis.|$|E
2500|$|According to some, {{the fact}} that the PCT does not deal {{directly}} with the scope of <b>patentable</b> subject matter, in relation to computer programs, adds [...] "weight to the contention that, having been born out of administrative inconvenience rather than any great principle, restrictions on patentability of programs should be limited to the maximum possible extent." ...|$|E
2500|$|The USPTO has reasserted its {{position}} that literary works, compositions of music, compilations of data, legal documents (such as insurance policies), {{and forms of}} energy (such as data packets transmitted over the Internet), are not considered [...] "manufactures" [...] and hence, by themselves, are not <b>patentable.</b> [...] Nonetheless, the USPTO has requested comments from the public on this position.|$|E
2500|$|The USPTO {{continued}} to require, however, that business method inventions must apply, involve, use or advance the [...] "technological arts" [...] {{in order to}} be <b>patentable.</b> [...] This was based on an unpublished decision of the U.S. Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, Ex Parte Bowman, 61 USPQ2d 1665, 1671 (Bd Pat. App. & Inter. 2001). [...] This requirement could be met by merely requiring that the invention be carried out on a computer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{case went}} to the Federal Circuit on an {{interlocutory}} appeal of the denial of summary judgment. The only issue on appeal from the district court was whether seeds and plants grown from seeds of sexually reproduced plants are <b>patentable</b> subject matter {{within the scope of}} 35 U.S.C.§101—i.e., are patent eligible. There was no other issue, such as whether J.E.M.'s conduct (selling seeds) was patent infringement under 35 U.S.C.§271(a) or whether resale of purchased seed in defiance of a label license prohibiting resale was shielded from infringement liability by the exhaustion doctrine or whether growing crops from the seed constituted [...] "making" [...] under that statute. Nonetheless, J.E.M. argued [...] "that the specifications of Pioneer's patents are not enabling; they criticize the written description and the utility of the deposits, and generally challenge validity." [...] The Federal Circuit responded, [...] "These issues were not decided by the district court, and are not before us." [...] Addressing the only issue properly before it, the court held [...] seeds and plants grown from seeds of sexually reproduced plants are <b>patentable</b> subject matter within the scope of 35 U.S.C.§101.|$|E
2500|$|Current US {{case law}} Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International (decided June 2014) {{requires}} {{that in order}} for a business method to be <b>patentable,</b> it must be “significantly more” than simply implementing a well-known business process on a computer. [...] The immediate response of the USPTO to this decision as of July 2014 has been to essentially stop allowing business method patents. [...] The key issue is that examiners do not yet have clear guidance as to what is allowable under the Alice decision.|$|E
