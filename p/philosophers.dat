50|$|Each <b>philosopher</b> must {{alternately}} {{think and}} eat. However, a <b>philosopher</b> can only eat spaghetti {{when they have}} both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one <b>philosopher</b> and so a <b>philosopher</b> can use the fork {{only if it is}} not being used by another <b>philosopher.</b> After an individual <b>philosopher</b> finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A <b>philosopher</b> can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.|$|R

5|$|There is no {{consensus}} among <b>philosophers</b> about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, <b>philosophers</b> of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as biology or physics). Some <b>philosophers</b> of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, Cantor {{published}} his correspondence with several <b>philosophers</b> on the philosophical implications of his set theory. In an extensive attempt to persuade other Christian thinkers and authorities to adopt his views, Cantor had corresponded with Christian <b>philosophers</b> such as Tilman Pesch and Joseph Hontheim, {{as well as}} theologians such as Cardinal Johannes Franzelin, who once replied by equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism. Cantor even sent one letter directly to Pope Leo XIII himself, and addressed several pamphlets to him.|$|E

5|$|A related {{problem is}} how someone's propositional attitudes (e.g. beliefs and desires) cause that individual's neurons to fire and muscles to contract.

5|$|Although {{the ontological}} {{argument}} {{may have been}} implicit {{in the works of}} Greek <b>philosophers</b> such as Plato and the Neoplatonists, the mainstream view is that the ontological argument was first clearly stated and developed by Anselm of Canterbury. Some scholars argued that the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) developed a special kind of ontological argument before Anselm, but other scholars have doubted this position. Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages {{in the development of the}} argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century criticisms of Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological argument in Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century <b>philosophers.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a new {{emphasis}} on observing, classifying, and cataloging nature, 16th century natural <b>philosophers</b> in Europe began to establish extensive collections of fossil objects (as well as collections of plant and animal specimens), which were often stored in specially built cabinets to help organize them. Conrad Gesner published a 1565 work on fossils that contained one of the first detailed descriptions of such a cabinet and collection. The collection belonged to a member of the extensive network of correspondents that Gesner drew on for his works. Such informal correspondence networks among natural <b>philosophers</b> and collectors became increasingly important {{during the course of the}} 16th century and were direct forerunners of the scientific societies that would begin to form in the 17th century. These cabinet collections and correspondence networks played an important role in the development of natural philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone {{as well as}} by its erratic, fantastical and {{fast-moving}} plot. A picaresque novel with a story {{similar to}} that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (Bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As <b>philosophers</b> of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and <b>philosophers</b> through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.|$|E
