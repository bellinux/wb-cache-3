25|$|The shell {{has three}} layers. In the pearly mussels {{there is an}} inner {{iridescent}} layer of nacre (mother-of-pearl) composed of calcium carbonate, which is continuously secreted by the mantle; the prismatic layer, a middle layer of chalky white crystals of calcium carbonate in a protein matrix; and the periostracum, an outer <b>pigmented</b> <b>layer</b> resembling a skin. The periostracum is composed of a protein called conchin, and its function {{is to protect the}} prismatic layer from abrasion and dissolution by acids (especially important in freshwater forms where the decay of leaf materials produces acids).|$|E
500|$|The asci are {{elongated}} reproductive {{structures that}} bear ascospores, {{in groups of}} eight. Banksiamyces species have asci that are cylindrical to club-shaped, and contain a plug at their extreme tips that will absorb color when stained with iodine. The ascospores may be arranged {{in one or two}} rows (uniseriate and biseriate, respectively), or rarely, irregular. The ascospores are ellipsoid, translucent, have a slight curve and may be tapered; most ascospores contain two oil drops. When in the ascus, the ascospores are covered with a translucent mucilage that is highly refractive to light. Paraphyses are [...] hyphal cells present in the fertile spore-bearing tissue, distributed amongst the asci. The free ends of the paraphyses fork and branch, combining with the tips of the asci to form a translucent to brown <b>pigmented</b> <b>layer</b> of tissue.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} cement tile manufacturers worldwide. The primary difference between manufacturers is the hydraulic method used. Small companies employ a hand-operated hydraulic press; {{the quality of}} the tiles varies due to inconsistent pressure. Larger manufacturers use electric-powered hydraulic presses that produce a consistently higher quality product. The higher pressure (1,500 PSI) permits a thicker <b>pigment</b> <b>layer</b> to be embedded into the cement <b>layer.</b> The <b>pigment</b> <b>layer</b> is usually 3-4 mm thick.|$|R
40|$|Gastropod shells {{consist of}} two crystal types of calcium carbonate, an outer, {{prismatic}} calcite layer and an inner nacreous layer made of aragonite. In cross-section, the nacre of the nacreous layer {{appears to have}} a regular brick-like microstructure composed of thin laminae of aragonite crystals, separated by very thin sheets of protein (Lutz and Rhoads, 1980; Nakahara, 1983). In abalone (Genus, Haliotis) and other gastropods, thin <b>layers</b> of non-lamellar <b>pigmented</b> material occur within the nacre and have been termed alternatively, fine lines, growth rings or growth lines (Shepherd et al., 1995). It has been suggested that these <b>pigmented</b> <b>layers</b> are small, prismatic, calcite layers (Shepherd and Avalos-Borja, 1997; Zaremba et al., 1996) but investigations using a Raman laser in Haliotis rubra show that they contain aragonite rather than calcite (Hawkes et al, 1996). Day and Fleming (1992) suggest that the occurrence of <b>pigmented</b> <b>layers</b> is correlated with regular exogenous cues such as reproduction or temperature changes and indeed in some species, <b>pigmented</b> <b>layers</b> in the shell can be used to age abalone (review: Shepherd and Triantafillos, 1997). However, McShane and Smith (1992) suggest that <b>pigmented</b> <b>layers</b> can occur irregularly and therefore may be unreliable indicators of age...|$|R

From the x-ray spectra it was also possible to assign each pigment to the correct <b>pigment</b> <b>layer,</b> {{and in the case of}} metal sheets (e. g. gildings) to identify the correct layer distribution. Several methods have also been developed to determine the thickness of <b>pigment</b> <b>layers</b> and metal sheets.

500|$|Like other mammals, {{the skin}} of baleen whales has an epidermis, a dermis, a hypodermis, and {{connective}} tissue. The epidermis, the <b>pigmented</b> <b>layer,</b> is [...] thick, along with connective tissue. The epidermis itself is only [...] thick. The dermis, the layer underneath the epidermis, is also thin. The hypodermis, containing blubber, is the thickest part of the skin and functions {{as a means to}} conserve heat. Right whales have the thickest hypodermis of any cetacean, averaging , though, as in all whales, it is thinner around openings (such as the blowhole) and limbs. Blubber may also be used to store energy during times of fasting. The connective tissue between the hypodermis and muscles allows only limited movement to occur between them. Unlike in toothed whales, baleen whales have small hairs on the top of their head, stretching from the tip of the rostrum to the blowhole, and, in right whales, on the chin. Like other marine mammals, they lack sebaceous and sweat glands.|$|E
2500|$|The {{walls are}} {{considered}} as a protective shield covering the sensitive internal hoof tissues (like the exoskeleton of arthropods), as a structure devoted to dissipating the energy of concussion, and as a surface to provide grip on different terrains.

This layer has predominately protective role, and is not as resistant to ground contact, where it can break and flake away.|$|E
50|$|MacLaren was the {{assistant}} surgeon to (Professor) James Bainbridge and helped perform the world's first retinal gene therapy treatment.

A faulty gene in the <b>pigment</b> <b>layer,</b> RPE65, prevented his photoreceptor cells from working, so a valid copy of the gene was implanted in one eye to 'patch' the blind-spot and restore function.

The optic cups of two gestational day 11 trisomy (ts) 1 mouse embryos and a normal littermate control were {{examined}} using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). One trisomic embryo had a small lens with a lens stalk; the other was aphakic. The resolution available with TEM allowed detailed evaluation of cell organelles, spatial relationships, and the intra- and extracellular structural environment of the optic cup in normal and abnormal mouse embryos. Differences between the normal littermate and the trisomic optic cups, {{as well as between}} the two ts 1 structures, included the following: 1) melanin granules in the retinal layer and intraretinal space {{as well as in the}} <b>pigment</b> <b>layer,</b> 2) neither pseudostratified nor cuboidal neuroepithelium in trisomic optic cups, 3) increasing cell lysis with severity of eye defect, 4) fusion between retinal and <b>pigment</b> <b>layer</b> cells and cells from the <b>pigment</b> <b>layer</b> and head mesoderm. This investigation not only confirmed some of the abnormal morphology found in light microscopic studies of ts 1 at this gestational age but also identified other anomalies in the ts 1 eye that may play a part in the dysgenesis of this organ.

40|$|I. The histochemistry of the cuticle in {{different}} stages of the moult cycle of Carcinus maenas is described. 3. The newly formed cuticle of a crab exposed at moulting shows evidence of phenolic tanning in the epicuticle. 3. The subsequent tanning of the <b>pigment</b> <b>layer</b> of the endocuticle is confined to a brief period immediately after moulting. 4. The polyphenol oxidase of the epicuticle involved in tanning disappears soon after moulting, but some time later an oxidase is again indicated, {{this time in the}} <b>pigment</b> <b>layer.</b> It appears to be secreted by the tegumental glands. 5. From the concurrent appearance of a polyphenol oxidase and tyrosine and the subsequent formation of dihydroxyphenols and melanin-like substances in the cuticle, it is suggested that the oxidation products of tyrosine are responsible for the pig-mentation of the cuticle. 6. Pigmentation of the cuticle is discussed in relation to phenolic tanning in Crusta-cea and Insecta. ...|$|R
60|$|Section 111. The eye (Figure 8) has a tough, dense, outer coat, the {{sclerotic}} (sc.), {{within which}} is a highly vascular and internally <b>pigmented</b> <b>layer,</b> the choroid, upon which the percipient nervous layer, the retina (r.) rests. The chief chamber of the eye is filled with a transparent jelly, the vitreous humour (v.h.). In front of the eye, the white sclerotic passes into the transparent cornea (c.). The epidermis is continued over the outer face {{of this as a}} thin, transparent epithelium. The choroid coat is continued in front by a ring-shaped muscle, the iris (ir.) the coloured portion of the eyes. This iris enlarges or contracts its central aperture (the black pupil) by reflex action, as the amount of light diminishes or increases. Immediately behind this curtain is the crystalline lens (l.), the curvature of the anterior face or which is controlled by the ciliary muscle (c.m.). In front of the lens is the aqueous humour (a.h.). The description of the action of this apparatus involves the explanation of several of the elementary principles of optics, and will be found by the student in any text-book of that subject. Here it would have no very instructive bearing, either on general physiological considerations or upon anatomical fact.|$|E

30|$|Paint loss can {{be caused}} by the {{deterioration}} of the adhesion materials and other diseases.

Peripherally, the IPE is continuous with the ciliary epithelium, also double-layered but pigmented in only one layer. The ciliary epithelium is continuous in its turn with the multilayered retina, which has an outermost <b>pigmented</b> <b>layer,</b> the retinal {{pigment epithelium}} (RPE).
