Particular favoured habitats include path sides and underneath bracken, while favoured substrates include soil, moss and <b>plant</b> <b>waste,</b> where it feeds as a saprotroph. Fruit bodies are typically encountered from late summer to late autumn in Europe, and from late spring to autumn in North America, where it is the most common Leotia species. It has also been recorded in eastern Asia, in China and Tibet, as well as in New Zealand and Australia.|$|E

In the story, some children read Paradisi in Sole and are inspired to create their own garden. The magazine received much favourable correspondence about the story, and in July 1884 it was suggested that a Parkinson Society should be formed. The objects of the society were to [...] "search out and cultivate old garden flowers which have become scarce; to exchange seeds and plants; to <b>plant</b> <b>waste</b> places with hardy flowers; to circulate books on gardening amongst the Members... to try to prevent the extermination of rare wild flowers, as well as of garden treasures." ...|$|E

40|$|Effectivenes of Brassicaceae <b>plant</b> <b>wastes</b> {{to control}} the root knot {{nematodes}} (Meloidogyne spp.) at a field microplot scale. Meloidogyne spp. is a soil borne pathogen that infects plant roots and causes root galls. Root knot nematodes can reduce crop production by 15 to 95 %, so that the control measures are needed. One of the control methods is using plants as biofumigant. Plants of the family Brassicaceae were reported contain glucosinolate (GSL). During decomposition, GSL is hydrolized to isothiocyanates (ITS) which is a highly toxic compound to soil organisms, including nematodes. The research objective {{was to determine the}} effectiveness of five Brassicaceous <b>plant</b> <b>wastes,</b> namely cabbage (B. oleracea var capitata), radish (Raphanus sativus), broccoli (B. oleracea var italica), chinese cabbage (B. chinensis) and pakcoy (B. rapa var parachinensis) to suppress root knot nematodes (RKN). The experiment was conducted on microplot scale in the field. The experimental design used was a 4 x 5 factorial CRD. The first factors are waste of Brassica and the second factors are the amount of Brassica wastes per microplot. The experiments were made in 6 replications. Application of 5 Brassica <b>plant</b> <b>wastes</b> at all doses tested effectively reduced the number of root knot by 45. 65 % to 94. 43 % and increased the average number of tomato fruits. Tomato plants grew better at microplots when treated with chinese cabbage and pakcoy wastes...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of {{agriculture in the}} twentieth century and aviculture in particular, has made the problem of broiler <b>plant</b> <b>wastes</b> utilization evident. It is obvious that the dumping of the broiler <b>plant</b> <b>wastes</b> is not a solution of this problem. In the modern world, more and more advanced technologies are being developed and implemented to reduce the level of the pollutant emissions in the environment. Such technologies are also presented in Ukraine, although their number is insufficient. In the Ukrainian agriculture one of the greatest broiler plant wastes’ producers are poultry plants. According to the experts’ estimations, the dumping of the poultry <b>plant</b> <b>wastes</b> from the Ukrainian poultry plants per year is: the dumping of the dung of natural humidity is about 5, 2 million tons, the dumping of the perished poultry is 50, 000 tons, the dumping of incubation wastes is 12, 000 tons as well as the dumping of slaughtering wastes is 210, 000 tons. The general effect constituents of economic mechanism of the nonwaste production introduction, as well as economic, social and ecological effects which reflect the circumstances of the nonwaste production introduction that should be taken into consideration, have been analyzed. The economic effect includes the following effects, such as the economiceffect of waste processing into biogas; the economic effect of waste processinginto biofertilizers; the economic effect of waste processing into forage admixtures;and cost saving due to the substituting for the mixed fodder by forage admixtures. The social effect lies in the provision of agricultural enterprises and households with cheap and high-quality fertilizers. It shows the possibility of realization of poultry <b>plant</b> <b>wastes</b> as biofertilizers or forage admixtures. The ecological effect is expressed by the reducing the level of the pollutant emissions in the environment. This will lead to the reduced number of fines for environmental pollution. The general effect is calculated by the determination of the enterprise gross receipts by the factors of 1, 5 and 2 on the condition that the factors of influence are permanent...|$|R
