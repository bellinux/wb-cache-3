40|$|AIM OF STUDY: To {{report the}} {{management}} of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure</b> refractory to standard catecholamine therapy with terlipressin in a patient with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) intoxication. CASE REPORT: A 41 -year-old woman, with suicidal ingestion of 11. 25 g amitriptyline and 1500 mg diclofenac, {{was admitted to the}} emergency department. After 30 min in ventricular fibrillation, with ongoing CPR, she regained a potentially perfusing rhythm, but with hypotension refractory to standard catecholamine therapy with adrenaline, 2 microg/kg/min (norepinephrine); adrenaline, 1 microg/kg/min (epinephrine) until 55 min after admission. An injection of 1 mg terlipressin restored mean arterial blood pressure > 65 mmHg within 10 min. Ten hours after admission to the intensive care unit, catecholamine support could be withdrawn because of a stable haemodynamic state. Within 7 days, all organ function recovered, and the patient regained full neurological function. CONCLUSIONS: Successful management of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure</b> with terlipressin after TCA intoxication refractory to catecholamines suggests a potential role for terlipressin as an adjunct vasopressor in severely hypotensive patients...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Analysis {{of major}} {{perioperative}} morbidity {{has become an}} important factor in assessment of quality of patient care. We have conducted a prospective study of a large population of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), to identify preoperative risk factors and to develop and validate risk-prediction models for peri- and postoperative morbidity. METHODS: Data on 4567 patients who underwent isolated CABG surgery over a 10 -year period were extracted from our clinical database. Five postoperative major morbidity complications (cerebrovascular accident, mediastinitis, acute renal <b>failure,</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure</b> and respiratory failure) were analysed. A composite morbidity outcome (presence of two or more major morbidities) was also analysed. For each one of these endpoints a risk model was developed and validated by logistic regression and bootstrap analysis. Discrimination and calibration were assessed using the under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area and the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test, respectively. RESULTS: Hospital mortality and major composite morbidity were 1. 0 % and 9. 0 %, respectively. Specific major morbidity rates were: cerebrovascular accident (2. 5 %), mediastinitis (1. 2 %), acute renal failure (5. 6 %), <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure</b> (5. 6 %) and respiratory failure (0. 9 %). The risk models developed have acceptable discriminatory power (under the ROC curve area for cerebrovascular accident [0. 715], mediastinitis [0. 696], acute renal <b>failure</b> [0. 778], <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure</b> [0. 710], respiratory failure [0. 787] and composite morbidity [0. 701]).

40|$|Septic shock is {{the leading}} cause of death in {{intensive}} care units worldwide, resulting from a progressive systemic inflammatory reaction causing <b>cardiovascular</b> and organ <b>failure.</b> Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator and inhibition of NO synthases (NOS) can increase blood pressure in septic shock. However, NOS inhibition does not improve outcome, on the contrary, and certain NO donors may even provide protection. In addition, NOS produce superoxide in case of substrate or cofactor deficiency or oxidation. We hypothesized that excessive systemic iNOS-derived NO production is insufficient to trigger <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure</b> and shock. We found that the systemic injection with various synthetic Toll-like receptor- 2 (TLR 2), TLR 3, or TLR 9 agonists triggered systemic NO production identical to that of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumour necrosis factor. In contrast to the latter, however, these agonists did not cause hypothermia or any other signs of discomfort or morbidity, and inflammatory cytokine production was low. TLR 2 stimulation with the triacylated lipopeptide Pam 3 CSK 4 not only caused identical NO levels in circulation, but also identical iNOS expression patterns as LPS. Nevertheless, Pam 3 CSK 4 did not cause hypotension, bradycardia, reduced blood flow, or inadequate tissue perfusion in the kidney or the liver. We demonstrate that excessive iNOS-derived NO in circulation is not necessarily linked to concomitant cardiovascular collapse, morbidity, or mortality. As such, our data indicate that the central role of iNOS-derived NO in inflammation-associated <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure</b> may be overestimated...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} risk factors for {{intensive}} care unit admission among children receiving hematopoietic stem cell trans-plantation (HSCT) and {{to test the hypothesis}} that multiple organ failure (MOF) increases the odds of death among HSCT patients who receive mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods: The chart of all consecutive HSCTs at Seattle Children’s Hospital and pediatric HSCT patients admitted to the pediatric critical care unit of a tertiary care pediatric hospital from January 2000 to September 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Charts of 266 HSCT patients were reviewed. Nonmalignant disease compared to hematologic malignancy, acute graft versus host disease grades III and IV, and second transplant increased the odds of pediatric intensive care unit admission. Among patients receiving MV for> 24 hours, 9 (25 %) survived for 6 months, while 8 patients (22 %) were long-term survivors with a median follow-up time of 3. 6 years, a significant improvement compared to a long-term survival of 7 % (odds ratio 0. 25, 95 % confidence intervals: 0. 09 - 0. 72, P. 01) reported in a previously published cohort of pediatric HSCT patients at the same institution from 1983 to 1996. <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>failure,</b> duration of MV for greater than 1 week, and prolonged receipt of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) increased the risk of mortality.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} and risk factors for adverse cardiac events during catecholamine vasopressor therapy in surgical intensive care unit patients with <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure.</b> METHODS: The occurrence of any of seven predefined adverse cardiac events (prolonged elevated heart rate, tachyarrhythmia, myocardial cell damage, acute cardiac arrest or death, pulmonary hypertension-induced right heart dysfunction, reduction of systemic blood flow) was prospectively recorded during catecholamine vasopressor therapy lasting at least 12  h. RESULTS: Fifty-four of 112 study patients developed a total of 114 adverse cardiac events, an incidence of 48. 2  % (95  % CI, 38. 8 - 57. 6  %). New-onset tachyarrhythmia (49. 1  %), prolonged elevated heart rate (23. 7  %), and myocardial cell damage (17. 5  %) occurred most frequently. Aside from chronic liver diseases, factors independently associated with the occurrence of adverse cardiac events included need for renal replacement therapy, disease severity (assessed by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II), number of catecholamine vasopressors (OR, 1. 73; 95  % CI, 1. 08 - 2. 77; p =  0. 02) and duration of catecholamine vasopressor therapy (OR, 1. 01; 95  % CI, 1 - 1. 01; p =  0. 002). Patients developing adverse cardiac events were on catecholamine vasopressors (p <  0. 001) and mechanical ventilation (p <  0. 001) for longer and had longer intensive care unit stays (p <  0. 001) and greater mortality (25. 9 vs. 1. 7  %; p <  0. 001) than patients who did not.

40|$|Hypoxic-ischaemic {{encephalopathy}} (HIE) is {{of major}} importance in neonatal and paediatric intensive care {{with regard to}} mortality and long-term morbidity. Our aim was to analyse our data in full-term neonates and children with special regard to withdrawal of life support and bad outcome. PATIENTS: All patients with HIE admitted to our unit from 1992 - 96 were analysed. Criteria for HIE were presence of a hypoxic insult followed by coma or altered consciousness with or without convulsions. Severity of HIE was assessed in neonates using Sarnat stages, and in children the duration of coma. In {{the majority of cases}} staging was completed with electrophysiological studies. Outcome was described using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Bad outcome was defined as death, permanent vegetative state or severe disability, good outcome as moderate disability or good recovery. RESULTS: In the neonatal group (n = 38) outcome was significantly associated with Sarnat stages, presence of convulsions, severely abnormal EEG, <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure,</b> and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD). A bad outcome was observed in 27 cases with 14 deaths and 13 survivors. Supportive treatment was withdrawn in 14 cases with 9 subsequent deaths. In the older age group (n = 45) outcome was related to persistent coma of 24 - 48 h, severely abnormal EEG, <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure,</b> liver dysfunction and MOD.

40|$|Current therapy of septic/vasodilatory <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure</b> {{includes}} volume resuscitation and {{infusion of}} inotropic and vasopressor agents. Norepinephrine is the first-line vasoconstrictor, and can stabilize hemodynamic variables in most patients. Nonetheless, irreversible <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>failure</b> which is resistant to conventional hemodynamic therapies {{still is the}} main cause of death in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. In such advanced, catecholamine-resistant shock states, arginine-vasopressin (AVP) has repeatedly caused an increase in mean arterial blood pressure, a decrease in toxic norepinephrine-dosages, as well as further beneficial hemodynamic, endocrinologic and renal effects. Although AVP exerted negative inotropic effects in previous clinical trials and in selected animal experiments, a continuous low-dose AVP infusion during advanced septic/vasodilatory shock caused a decrease in cardiac index only in patients with a hyperdynamic circulation. Adverse effects on gastrointestinal circulation and the systemic microcirculation can not be excluded, but have not yet been confirmed in clinical prospective trials. Negative side effects of a supplementary AVP therapy are an increase in total bilirubin concentrations, and a decrease in platelet count. A transient increase in hepatic transaminases during AVP infusion is most likely related to preceding hypotensive episodes. Important points which must be considered when using AVP as a "rescue vasopressor" in septic/vasodilatory shock states are: 1) AVP infusion only in advanced shock states that can not be adequately reversed by conventional hemodynamic therapy (e. g. norepinephrine > 0, 5 - 0, 6 mug/kg/min), 2) presence of normovolemia, 3) AVP infusion only in combination with norepinephrine, 4) strict avoidance of bolus injections and dosages > 4 IU/h.
