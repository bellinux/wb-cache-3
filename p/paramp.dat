2500|$|When {{operated}} at pump levels below oscillation, the parametric oscillator can amplify a signal, {{becoming a}} parametric amplifier (<b>paramp).</b> [...] Varactor parametric amplifiers {{have been developed}} as low-noise amplifiers in the radio and microwave frequency range. [...] The advantage of a parametric amplifier {{is that it has}} much lower noise than an ordinary amplifier based on a gain device like a transistor or vacuum tube. [...] This is because in the parametric amplifier a reactance is varied instead of a (noise-producing) resistance. [...] They have been used in very low noise radio receivers in radio telescopes and spacecraft communication antennas.|$|E
40|$|A low noise, K sub u-band, {{parametric}} amplifier (<b>paramp)</b> was developed. The unit is a spacecraft-qualifiable, prototype, {{parametric amplifier}} for eventual application in the shuttle orbiter. The amplifier {{was required to}} have a noise temperature of less than 150 K. A noise temperature of less than 120 K at a gain level of 17 db was achieved. A 3 -db bandwidth in excess of 350 MHz was attained, while deviation from phase linearity of about + or - 1 degree over 50 MHz was achieved. The <b>paramp</b> operates within specification over an ambient temperature range of - 5 C to + 50 C. The performance requirements and {{the operation of the}} K sub u-band parametric amplifier system are described. The final test results are also given...|$|E
40|$|The {{superheterodyne}} millimeter-wave radiometer on the Columbia-GISS 4 -ft {{telescope is}} described. This receiver uses a room-temperature Schottky diode mixer, with a resonant-ring filter as LO diplexer. The diplexer has low signal loss, efficient LO power coupling, and suppresses {{most of the}} LO noise at both sidebands. The receiver IF section has a parametric amplifier as its first stage with sufficient gain to overcome the second-stage amplifier noise. A broad-banded quarter-wave impedance transformer minimizes the mismatch between mixer and <b>paramp.</b> At 115 GHz, the SSB receiver noise temperature is 860 K, which {{is believed to be}} the lowest figure so far reported for a room-temperature receiver at this frequency...|$|E

40|$|Though superconducting qubits {{offer the}} {{potential}} for a scalable quantum computing architecture, the high-fidelity readout necessary to execute practical algorithms has thus far remained elusive. Moreover, achievements toward high fidelity have been accompanied by either long measurement times or demolition of the quantum state. In this dissertation, we address these issues with the novel integration of two ultralow-noise, superconducting amplifiers into separate dispersive flux qubit measurements. We first demonstrate a flux qubit inductively coupled to a 1. 294 -GHz nonlinear oscillator formed by a capacitively shunted DC SQUID. The frequency of the oscillator is modulated by the state of the qubit and is detected via microwave reflectometry. A microstrip SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) amplifier (MSA) is used to increase the sensitivity of the measurement over that of a semiconductor amplifier. In the second experiment, we report measurements of a flux qubit coupled via a shared inductance to a quasi-lumped element 5. 78 -GHz readout resonator formed by the parallel combination of an interdigitated capacitor and a meander line inductor. The system noise is substantially reduced by a near-quantum-limited Josephson parametric amplifier (<b>paramp).</b> We present measurements of increased fidelity and reduced measurement backaction using the MSA at readout excitation levels as low as one hundredth of a photon in the readout resonator, observing a 4. 5 -fold increase in the readout visibility. Furthermore, at low readout excitation levels below one tenth of a photon in the readout resonator, no reduction in T 1 is observed, potentially enabling continuous monitoring of the qubit state. Using the <b>paramp,</b> we demonstrate a continuous, high-fidelity readout with sufficient bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio to resolve quantum jumps in the flux qubit. This is enabled by a readout which discriminates between the readout pointer state distributions to an error below one part in 1000. This, along with the ability to make many successive readouts in a time T 1, permits the use of heralding to ensure initialization to a fiducial state, such as the ground state. This method enables us to eliminate errors due to spurious thermal population, increasing the fidelity to 93. 9 %. Finally, we use heralding to introduce a simple, fast qubit reset protocol without changing the system parameters to induce Purcell relaxation...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1980 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaMobile {{satellite}} communications at UHF have gained wide acceptance {{in the past}} several years. This acceptance has been largely a result of the improvement in communication reliability over other long-range systems such as HF. Deficiencies, however, have been noted with respect to the performance of UHF satellite communication (SATCOM) systems where anti-jam (AJ) or low probability of intercept (LPI) characteristics are of importance. Recent advancements in technology coupled with increased requirements for improved AJ and LPI have focused attention on the EHF frequency range for evolutionary replacement and/or augmentation of UHF SATCOM systems. RF equipment in this frequency range has the potential for the implementation of highly compact terminals for mobile application such as required for airborne force elements. In the next 5 - 10 years, a wide range of technologies will be applied to the development of EHF user terminals. Critical trade-offs exist between satellite and terminal complexity as well as within the terminal itself. Within the terminal, antenna gain versus HPA power, antenna mounted solid-state PA's versus TWT PA's, phased arrays versus advanced reflector antennas all must be considered. Although the antenna and HPA are the most significant cost drivers, secondary trade-offs, such as antenna gain versus use of <b>paramps</b> or FET's, and synthesizer approaches for fast hop and signal processing implementation also must be addressed. This paper addresses a typical terminal for a small mobile user such as an airborne force terminal. Typical system and spacecraft characteristics are defined and tradeoffs carried out on a parametric basis between various terminal elements to establish cost-performance relationships...|$|R
