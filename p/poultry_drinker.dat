40|$|The aim {{of poultry}} {{production}} throughout {{the developing world}} is to achieve maximum production or minimum costs, thereby offering increased consumption of animal protein of a type which is subject to few religious or social restrictions. CTA has recently contributed to the realization of this aim by the publication of two books on the subject, and by holding a seminar on 'Smallholder village poultry' in October 1990 at Thessaloniki in Greece. (A report on the Conference {{will be published in}} the next issue of Spore). Poultry by Anthony J Smith is published by Macmillan in association with CTA in the Tropical Agriculturalist series, which comprises practical field guides for those whose interest in the subject is both practical and theoretical. Poultry gives a detailed summary of the characteristics and requirements of types of poultry in various tropical zones and farming systems, of breeds, breeding, diseases and parasites, slaughtering and processing. The book contains black and white photographs, diagrams, line drawings and tables to illustrate the text. Small-scale poultry production in the tropics is one of the Agrodok low-priced series coproduced by Agromisa and CTA. CTA has a long association with this organization whose aim is to improve the lot of disadvantaged groups in developing countries by the transference of agricultural knowledge. It is a simple manual for small - scale poultry-raising in the tropics intended for both beginners and experienced poultry raisers, and concentrating on laying birds rather than broilers. The main subjects covered are replacing chickens (farmer maintains flock levels or buys in); housing <b>poultry</b> (feeders, <b>drinkers,</b> perches, laying nests, crates and lighting); feeding and water; breeds, breeding, hatching and rearing; bird health care; improvement programmes; products and by-products, and the administration of a small-scale poultry business. This 51 -page booklet is illustrated throughout by line drawings and diagrams, and supplemented by tables on infectious diseases, feed deficiencies and examples of formulated rations. It is completed by a short bibliography.

40|$|Water troughs {{from deep}} litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed {{to each of}} the {{different}} 3 -tier cages containing layer chickens in Farms A, B and C were subjected to a 7 -day study which involved the monitoring of <b>poultry</b> farm hygiene. <b>Drinkers</b> were washed before filling with water on Day 1. For Days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. The occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. For the bacterial count on Day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p> 0. 05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p> 0. 05) among the parameters. On Day 5, there was significant difference (p 0. 05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. The bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on Day 1, had no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p> 0. 05) among the parameters. On Days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermis, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus salivarius and Corynebacterium sp. Farm B had Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella sp. while for Farm C, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in Farms A and B, additional 2 bacterial isolates, Lactobacillus salivarius and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. In conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. Those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring...|$|R
