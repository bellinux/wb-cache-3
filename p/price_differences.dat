5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one <b>price.</b> <b>Differences</b> in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E
500|$|In {{accordance}} with its Acceptable Use Policy, Valve retains {{the right to}} block and unblock customers' access to their games and Steam services when Valve's Anti-Cheat (VAC) software determines that the user is cheating in multiplayer games, selling accounts to others or trading games to exploit regional <b>price</b> <b>differences.</b> Blocking such users initially removed access {{to his or her}} other games, leading to some users with high-value accounts losing access because of minor infractions of the AUP. Valve later changed its policy to be similar to that of Electronic Arts' Origin platform, in which blocked users can still access their games but are heavily restricted, limited to playing in offline mode and unable to participate in Steam Community features. Customers also lose access to their games and Steam account if they refuse to accept changes to Steam's end user license agreements; this occurred in August 2012. In April 2015, Valve added Game Bans to its service, allowing developers to set bans on players for their games but enacted and enforced at the Steam level, allowing developers to police their own gaming communities in customizable manner.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{customer}} {{reactions to}} variable pricing (that is, being charged different {{prices for the}} same goods or services {{at one point in}} time across different markets) and finds that customers show asymmetrical responses to an increase in <b>price</b> <b>difference.</b> Specifically, customers who pay a higher price show stronger intentions to switch stores, to complain and to spread negative word-of-mouth when <b>price</b> <b>difference</b> gets larger, while the same amount of increase in <b>price</b> <b>difference</b> shows no effect on those who pay a lower price. In addition, negative emotions experienced by customers mediate the relationship between unfairness perception and behavioural responses. Results suggest that managers should exercise extra caution when introducing a relatively large <b>price</b> <b>difference,</b> and they should try to manage customers' in-store emotional state to reduce the negative effects of variable pricing.

2500|$|Because of its low density, it is {{not easy}} to store natural gas or to {{transport}} it by vehicle. Natural gas pipelines are impractical across oceans, since the gas needs to be cooled down and compressed, as the friction in the pipeline causes the gas to heat up. Many existing pipelines in America are close to reaching their capacity, prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages. The large trade cost implies that natural gas markets are globally much less integrated, causing significant <b>price</b> <b>differences</b> across countries. [...] In Western Europe, the gas pipeline network is already dense. New pipelines are planned or under construction in Eastern Europe and between gas fields in Russia, Near East and Northern Africa and Western Europe. See also List of natural gas pipelines.|$|E

40|$|The time {{evolution}} {{of the price of}} resources sold to the market and of the <b>price</b> <b>difference,</b> between sold and extracted resources, is investigated in case of no accumulation of the resources; i. e. when the resources are extracted and sold to the market at the same mass flow rate. The price {{evolution of}} sold resources varies with time according to the relation between the price increase factor, PIF, of sold and extracted resources. The price evolutions of sold resources and <b>price</b> <b>difference</b> are investigated according to the relation between extraction rate and interest rate of extracted and sold resources. The price of sold resources and the <b>price</b> <b>difference</b> increase with time if the PIF of sold resources is greater than the PIF of extracted resources and the initial price is greater than the critical price of sold resources, which depends on the initial price of extracted resources and the interest rate of non-extracted and extracted resources. The price of sold resources and the <b>price</b> <b>difference</b> decrease with time if the PIF of sold resources is greater than the PIF of extracted resources and the initial price is smaller than the critical price of sold resources. The other cases are discussed extensively in the paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
