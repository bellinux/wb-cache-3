40|$|The {{influence}} of substrate, light intensity, temperature and growth phase {{on the dry}} weight per unit biovolume of both living Phormidium autumnale trichomes and living single cells was investigated microinterferometrically. With a Mach-Zehnder Interference Microscope, both the interference-stripe-field method and the <b>phase-shift</b> <b>method</b> were {{used to measure the}} optical path differences (OPD) of cells and trichomes. To calculate the cellular dry weight of trichomes, the trichome diameters have to be measured. Widths between 4 and 7 µm were determined. Thick trichomes are characteristic for growth on agar-solidified medium, whereas this was observed in single cases only from trichomes growing on soil surfaces. A reliable prediction of trichome width from growth conditions is not possible. The dry weights per unit biovolume (fg µm- 3) are independent of the studied parameters during the exponential growth phase (296 ± 22 fg µm- 3) with exception of the agar-based cultures growing at low light intensity (259 ± 16 fg µm- 3). During the stationary phase, dry weights per unit biovolume increase independently of growth conditions (353 ± 39 fg µm- 3). Two separate factors of 0. 14 and 0. 17 for converting biovolume (mm 3) of cells to milligrams carbon could be determined by comparing the growth phase and stationary phase-dependent average values of dry weights per unit biovolume, respectively. These conversion factors could be used as species-specific factors for Phormidium growing on soil surfaces. Irrespective of the method, both the stripe-field and <b>phase-shift</b> <b>method</b> gave similar results. However, the <b>phase-shift</b> <b>method</b> measured lower variances of values. Additionally, detailed quantifying investigations of structures within cells are possible.

All 3 D range data patches, ac-quired from either different sensors or the same sensor in different view-ing angles, have to be merged into a single piece to facilitate future data analysis. A novel method for 3 D data merging using Holoimage is pro-posed. Similar to the 3 D shape measurement system using a <b>phase-shifting</b> <b>method,</b> Holoimage is a phase-shifting–based computer synthe-sized fringe image. The 3 D information is retrieved from Holoimage using a <b>phase-shifting</b> <b>method.</b> If two patches of 3 D data with overlap-ping areas are rendered by OpenGL, the overlapping areas are resolved by the graphics pipeline, that is, only the front geometry can be visual-ized. Therefore, the merging is performed if the front geometry informa-tion can be obtained. Holoimage is to obtain the front geometry by pro-jecting the fringe patterns onto the rendered scene. We also demonstrated that each point of the geometry in the overlapping area {{can be obtained by}} averaging the corresponding point of the geometries reconstructed from Holoimage for each patch.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 -D) surface-geometry {{measurement}} using {{structured light}} {{is commonly used}} for digital modeling of an object or environment when the geometry is unknown. Digital fringe projection with phase-shifting has become an increasingly common measurement method {{as it is a}} full-field method to improve acquisition speed over point-by-point and line-by-line methods, and it encodes all lines in the pattern to reduce the ambiguity problem that occurs with multiple-line projection <b>methods.</b> However, fringe-projection <b>phase-shifting</b> techniques are still limited in the speed of measurement, partly due to the use of projected light patterns that require complex computation, or that require several steps of repeated measurements with several images in order to reconstruct the 3 -D object surface. This doctoral dissertation addresses the development of new methods for real-time full-field range sensing by fringe-projection phase-shifting techniques, to use more efficient algorithms. It also addresses the design, calibration, and measurement-accuracy testing of a new full-field real-time range-sensing system based on the developed methods. A novel 3 -D shape measurement technique, called triangular-pattern phase-shifting profilometry, is developed in this research. The proposed method utilizes triangular gray-level-coded fringe patterns and newly developed intensity-ratio generation algorithms, essential to reconstruct a 3 -D object surface. The minimum number of measurements required to reconstruct an unknown 3 -D object is two, which is less than the minimum number of measurements required for the traditional sinusoidal-pattern and trapezoidal-pattern <b>phase-shifting</b> <b>methods.</b> Compared with the sinusoidal-pattern and trapezoidal-pattern <b>phase-shifting</b> <b>methods,</b> the new method involves less processing because of the simple intensity-ratio computation used and because fewer images or measurement steps are required to reconstruct the 3 -D object. Extension of the method by increasing the number of phase-shifting steps was found to increase measurement accuracy. An optimal value of pitch of the projected triangular fringe pattern was found for each extended method. Two error compensation methods, repeated phase-offset and intensity-ratio error compensation, are proposed to reduce the measurement error, mainly caused by fringe projection non-linearity and image defocus. Error reductions of 24. 0 % and 28. 5 % were achieved, respectively.
