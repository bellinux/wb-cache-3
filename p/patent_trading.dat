30|$|The {{strength}} {{of intellectual property}} (IP) such as <b>patents,</b> <b>trade</b> secrets, and copyrights is often illusory. For instance, patents are not self-enforcing; <b>patent</b> infringement and <b>trade</b> secret misappropriation is frequent, sometimes leading to costly litigation. Moreover, many patents can be “invented around” at modest costs (Mansfield 1985; Mansfield et al. 1981). The pioneer’s business challenge is usually quite a hard one; followers often have it easier. To help with appropriability, the pioneer of a core technology can try to seek complementary patents on new features and/or processes and, in some cases, on designs, but these activities may delay efforts at licensing or commercialization.|$|R
