Molly sees Gus reciting notes into his <b>pen</b> <b>recorder</b> and {{when he goes to}} take a phone call she leaves a message on it for him. Soon after, Molly and Gus begin to date. Molly does not yet realize it, but Gus is unableto make new memories due to having had a brain aneurysm years before. As a result, he forgets the day's events every time he goes to sleep. Molly soon finds out that he has been recording all of their conversations on his pen. Gus tries to explain, but Molly mistakes it for being a disturbing and creepy habit. A few weeks later Molly returns to the apartment to find Gus's sister Lucy who explains everything and gives Molly the file folder Gus had filled with mementos and notes of their time together. Molly visits the hospital where Gus is under observation and introduces herself as his girlfriend. She shows him the folder so he can learn more about their relationship. We learn that prior to having his aneurysm, Gus was meant to be the next Einstein working at Caltech and the Mt. Wilson telescope in southern California. Molly takes Gus there, where he visits with his old colleagues. While visiting, they let him know that his work will help them to better understand the universe. Molly also meets Gus's ex-fiancee (one of his former co-workers) who explains why things had ended between them and warns her of the difficulties that any sort of serious relationship will have. Gus also tells Molly to leave him if an operation to fix his brain damage does not work. Gus's sister tells Molly that Gus has actually already had this operation, but it did not work. That night Molly sees a note on Gus's laptop to ask her to marry him the next day. Molly deletes the note after reflecting on what Gus had told her to do and Gus wakes up the next day without any memory of her. Molly continues her life with almost a quarter million dollars that she finally received from her great aunt's inheritance. With those extra funds she pays off her student loans and achieves her long standing dream of starting her own flower business. One day, while working at a wedding, a shooting star appears and Molly is reminded of Gus. She visits him at the jewelry shop he works at the next day. He recognizes her name from an envelope he had kept containing an antique ring that had belonged to Molly's great aunt. Shortly after they had originally met, Molly had come to the shop and had sold the ring to Gus for $200 that she had desperately needed. At the time the ring was in bad shape and missing half its stones. Gus had repaired the ring and kept it to return to Molly someday at no expense. He gives it back to her and she begins to cry tears of happiness and hints to him that they know each other. It is obvious that Gus is remembering something - her name - when he goes to retrieve the ring {{from the back of the}} store where he put it for safe keeping. We may take this as a hint that his ability to remember is slowly returning or, romantically, love has not forgotten her. Molly asks Gus if he would like to go out for coffee with her and says she knows a great place.|$|E

It {{is suitable for}} direct measurement of ascorbic acid in serum and urine. NIlANY CLINICIANS have reported that ascorbic acid, when administered in large concentration, has some therapeutic value {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia (1). Other authors have reported finding specific meta-bolic abnormalities associated with ascorbic acid deficiencies (2). It is known that a biochemical abnormality involving ascorbic acid exists in schizophrenic patients, and this knowledge has increased the number of requests for its determination in serum and urine. There are many suitable methods for the detection of ascorbic acid in blood plasma, serum, and urine; however, {{for the most part they}} have not been automated. With an increasing demand for a greater number of chemical determinations and a decreasing supply of skilled personnel, continued automation for many more laboratory methods seems to be the answer to the problem. With this thought in mind, an attempt was made to develop a method suitable for determining ascorbic acid in serum and urine. The automated method as described by Nesset etal (3) involved the preparation of filtrates. With large volumes of determinations, the extra manipulation makes the procedure undesirable. Therefore, a di-rect color reaction taking place with serum or urine in the presence of proteins was sought. The method of Schmall et at.

40|$|The auroral {{observations}} {{carried out}} by the 8 th wintering party of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition, 1967 - 68, included 1 All-sky camera 2 Visual and photographic observations of aurora 3 Observation of auroral pulsations 4 Auroral photometry along the geomagnetic meridian 5 Observation of the auroral radio noise A description of each observation and obtained results are briefly given 1 Auroral pulsations A special photometer was designed for investigating the detailed characteristics of auroral pulsations and their relationships with geomagnetic pulsations The photometer (Fig 1) consists of a single telescope equipped with a band-pass filter (4278 A) The field of view is 5 Â° The amplified anode current of the RCA lp 21 photomultipliers is fed to three electrical band-pass filters (f_ 1, 001 - 01 Hz, f_ 2, 01 - 2 Hz, f_ 3, 2 - 30 Hz), and recorded by a slow running tape-recorder The outputs of the band-pass filters are separately registered on multi-channel <b>pen</b> <b>recorders</b> together with the signals of the geomagnetic pulsations By means of this photometric system, data of more than 300 clear night hours were recorded (Fig 3) Figs 4 - 8 illustlate the various types of auroral luminosity fluctuations together with the geomagnetic field fluctuations Auroral pulsations observed at Syowa Station can be classified into the following five types. A. Irregular fluctuations with large amplitudes (a few tens of KR) observed mostly at the onset of an auroral substorm (Fig 4) B Pulse-like auroral pulsations with a period of about 20 - 40 seconds, the amplitudes of which are sometimes greater than 10 KR Pulsations of this type are frequently observed {{in the early morning hours}} of magnetic disturbed days (Fig 5). C Long-lived auroral pulsations with a sinusoidal waveform. Their periods and amplitudes are about 10 seconds and a few KR, respectively. This type is dominant in the morning hours (Fig. 6). D. Rapid fluctuations of auroral luminosity with a period of about 2 - 0. 5 seconds (Fig 7, A and B). E. Extremely rapid fluctuations with a frequency of about 20 - 30 Hz (Fig. 8, A and B) Waveform correlation between auroral and geomagnetic pulsations depends on their periods. Most auroral rapid fluctuations of period shorter than 5 seconds are not accompanied by geomagnetic fluctuations Auroral and geomagnetic pulsations of period longer than 10 seconds have similar waveforms. 2. Photometry of aurora along the geomagnetic meridian A meridian scanning photometer was designed for investigating the time and space variations of the auroral luminosity (Fig 2). A rotating mirror scans from north to south along the geomagnetic meridian. The scanning time of this photometer is 12 seconds. In the auroral zone, it is desirable to measure the auroral luminosity from 0. 1 KR to a few hundreds KR (about 50 - 60 dB). Therefore, signals of the auroral luminosity are amplified by the high, medium and low gain amplifiers and are separately registered on a 3 -channel pen-recorder. Fig. 10 illustrates an example of the chart record obtained The data shown in Figs. 11 and 12 were derived from the above records. Considering the data taken over a period of 25 days (listed in Table 2), the following relationships were thought to exist at the time of occurrence of auroral substorms. a. Auroral arcs begin to move equatorwards about an hour- 20 minutes before the onset of the auroral substorm. b. The equatorward movement of auroral arcs take place generally in about 5 - 10 minutes. c. At the onset-time of an auroral substorm, the luminosity of auroral arcs suddenly intensified. d. Within a few minutes after the onset of the storm, the aurora spreads and blankets the sky, in which very bright arcs exist, with rapidly fluctuating luminosity. These arcs move towards the pole, in general, at a speed of about 200 - 300 km/s. e. At the end phase of the substorm, the aurora become active on the polar side of Syowa Station 3. Spatial and temporal variations of auroral forms Continuous photographic observations of aurora were carried out. Fig. 13 illustrates the auroral forms during an auroral substorm.
