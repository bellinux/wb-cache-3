60|$|Then {{the wizard}} cast a wizzy spell and mumbled several very learned {{words in the}} wizardese {{language}} over the glass dog. Whereupon the little animal first wagged its tail from side to side, then winked his left eye knowingly, and at last began barking in a most frightful manner--that is, when you stop to consider the noise came from a <b>pink</b> <b>glass</b> dog.

60|$|They had no {{difficulty}} in entering unnoticed, for Mrs. Hoskyn considered obscurity beautiful; and her rooms were but dimly lighted by two curious lanterns of <b>pink</b> <b>glass,</b> within which were vaporous flames. In {{the middle of}} the larger apartment was a small table covered with garnet-colored plush, with a reading-desk upon it, and two candles in silver candlesticks, the light of which, being brighter than the lanterns, cast strong double shadows from a group of standing figures about the table. The surrounding space was crowded with chairs, occupied chiefly by ladies. Behind them, along the wall, stood a row of men, among whom was Lucian Webber. All were staring at Cashel Byron, who was making a speech to some bearded and spectacled gentlemen at the table. Lydia, who had never before seen him either in evening dress or quite at his ease, was astonished at his bearing. His eyes were sparkling, his confidence overbore the company, and his rough voice created the silence it broke. He was in high good-humor, and marked his periods by the swing of his extended left arm, while he held his right hand close to his body and occasionally pointed his remarks by slyly wagging his forefinger.|$|E
60|$|Everything was oppressively new. The brilliantly-varnished door cracked with {{a report}} like a pistol when it was opened; the paper on the walls, with its gaudy pattern of birds, trellis-work, and flowers, in gold, red, and green on a white ground, looked hardly dry yet; the showy window-curtains of white and sky-blue, and the still showier carpet of red and yellow, seemed {{as if they had}} come out of the shop yesterday; the round {{rosewood}} table was in a painfully high state of polish; the morocco-bound picture books that lay on it, looked as if they had never been moved or opened since they had been bought; not one leaf even of the music on the piano was dogs-eared or worn. Never was a richly furnished room more thoroughly comfortless than this--the eye ached at looking round it. There was no repose anywhere. The print of the Queen, hanging lonely on the wall, in its heavy gilt frame, with a large crown at the top, glared on you: the paper, the curtains, the carpet glared on you: the books, the wax-flowers in glass-cases, the chairs in flaring chintz-covers, the china plates on the door, the blue and <b>pink</b> <b>glass</b> vases and cups ranged on the chimney-piece, the over-ornamented chiffoniers with Tonbridge toys and long-necked smelling bottles on their upper shelves--all glared on you. There was no look of shadow, shelter, secrecy, or retirement in any one nook or corner of those four gaudy walls. All surrounding objects seemed startlingly near to the eye; much nearer than they really were. The room would have given a nervous man the headache, before he had been in it a quarter of an hour.|$|E

50|$|Although William Wailes {{employed}} {{a number of}} designers, the products of his workshop are often identifiable by type of glass and the particular colour combinations that prevailed. Wailes’ glass is often a little paler and more brightly coloured than many English workshops of the same date, being rather more like glass from Germany or Limoges. There are certain distinctive colour combinations that occur repeatedly in the clothing of figures in Wailes’ windows- mauve lined with bright red, yellow lined with bright blue, red lined with acid green.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we make a}} {{comparison}} between the spectroscopy of bismuth-doped lead–aluminum– germanate (Bi:PAG) glass and bismuth-doped yttrium–aluminum–silicate (Bi:YAS) glass. We report the variation in Bi absorption, emission and lifetime as the PbO, Bi 2 O 3 and Y 2 O 3 contents of the two glass systems were varied. As PbO and Y 2 O 3 contents were increased the absorption strength of Bi decreased in both Bi: PAG and Bi:YAS glasses. This is because they both increase the optical basicity of the glasses. Higher optical basicity favors higher Bi oxidation states which may be optically inactive. In Bi:YAS the Bi absorption strength had a quadratic dependence on Bi 2 O 3 content. This suggested that Bi 2 dimers are the origin of Bi emission. In contrast to Bi:YAS glass, Bi:PAG glass had a non-monotonic color change with increasing Bi 2 O 3 content, switching {{back and forth between}} yellow and <b>pink.</b> The yellow <b>glasses</b> were characterized by an isolated absorption band at 350 – 380 nm without the 500 and 700 nm absorption bands that were observed in the <b>pink</b> <b>glasses.</b> This was evidence that the 350 – 380 nm absorption band was related to a different Bi absorption center than the other absorption bands...|$|R
50|$|In an {{oxidising}} environment metal (and some non-metal) ions {{will lose}} electrons. In iron oxides, Fe2+ (ferrous) ions will become Fe3+ (ferric) ions. In molten glass {{this will result}} in a change in glass colour from pale blue to yellow/brown. In a reducing environment the iron will gain electrons and colour will change from yellow/brown to pale blue. Similarly manganese will change in colour depending on its oxidation state. The lower oxidation state of manganese (Mn2+) is yellow in common glass while the higher oxidation states (Mn3+ or higher) is purple. A combination of the two states will give a <b>pink</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E

50|$|A major {{product of}} the factory was {{decorative}} quarry glass which was mass-produced by moulding and printing, rather than hand-cutting and painting. This product {{could be used in}} church windows as a cheap substitute for stained glass. It was often installed in new churches, to be later replaced by pictorial windows. Most of this quarry glass was clear, printed in black and detailed in bright yellow silver stain. Occasionally the quarries were produced in red, blue or <b>pink</b> <b>glass,</b> but these are rare. Surprisingly few entire windows of Powell quarries are to be seen in English churches, although they survive in little-seen locations such as vestries, ringing chambers and behind pipe organs. St Philip's Church, Sydney, retains a full set of Powell quarry windows. Powell also produced many windows in which pictorial mandorlas or roundels are set against a background of quarries.|$|E

5|$|Manganese {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds. In the glass industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III). Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce <b>pink</b> colored <b>glass.</b>|$|R

50|$|Begun in 1999, the Kandor project (2007) {{deals with}} the town of Kandor, on the planet Krypton from which the child Kal-El escaped to Earth, where he became Superman. Kandor’s {{depiction}} in these narratives is inconsistent and fragmentary, prompting Kelley to create multiple versions of it, cast in colorful resins and illuminated like reliquaries. The installation Kandor-Con 2000 was first presented in the millennium show at Kunstmuseum Bonn and later at the Technical University Berlin (2007), the Deichtorhallen/Sammlung Falckenberg, Hamburg (2007); ZKM, Karlsruhe (2008); the Shanghai Biennial (2008); and the Centre Pompidou, Paris (2010). Kandor-Con 2000 is conceived - and continued to develop - as a work in progress. Throughout the exhibitions, architecture students built cardboard models of Kandor inspired by the original comics. These models were sent to Pasadena, where Kelley made scaled down casts. Kandor 10A (2010), a yellow city housed in a hand-blown, <b>pink</b> <b>glass</b> bottle, is a grouping of tall skyscrapers situated within a full-scale rock grotto. Kandor 10B (Exploded Fortress of Solitude) (2011) is a pile of dark boulders and slabs forming a cave with a quarry-like foyer made from faux black rock and built {{on a scale that}} invites the viewer into the forbidden fortress. Set within the cave’s inner recesses is a glowing rose-colored city-in-a-bottle. Kandor 12, constructed in off-white resin and evocative of a group of chess pawns, or minarets, is encased in a shadowy brown bottle, which sits on a platform resembling a Greek column positioned in front of a chest of drawers and an illuminated translucent green wall.|$|E
40|$|The Colony meteorite, {{found in}} Oklahoma around 1975, has an unrecrystallized texture and {{contains}} heterogeneous olivine and low Ca pyroxene, kamacite with low Ni and Co and high Cr, amoeboid inclusions with low FeO and MnO, and numerous small chondrules with clear <b>pink</b> <b>glass.</b> These characteristics {{are shared by}} members of the least metamorphosed subgroup of CO 3 chondrites. Colony contains a fine grained matrix that has higher FeO and K 2 O and lower MgO and Na 2 O than normal CO 3 matrices. Allan Hills A 77307 is another unmetamorphosed meteorite that has many petrologic similarities to normal CO chondrites, including matrix abundance, mineral compositions and chondrule size. However, it differs from them in its abundance of magnetite and presence of iron carbides. The olivine and low Ca pyroxene compositional distributions of Colony and A 77307 are very similar. The shapes of the thermoluminescence glow curves of Colony and A 77307 are very similar, but differ significantly from those of normal CO chondrites. It is suggested that Colony and A 77307 represent a distinct chemical subgroup of CO 3 chondrites, characterized by low Ni, Co, S, Ca, Mg, Mn and, possibly, high Cd...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} the genetic defect in two Pakistani families with autosomal recessive achromatopsia. Methods: Two families (RP 26 and RP 44) were originally diagnosed with retinal dystrophy {{based upon their}} medical history. To localize the causative genes in these families, homozygosity mapping was performed using Affymetrix 10 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Sequence {{analysis was used to}} find the mutations in candidate genes cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha- 3 (CNGA 3; family RP 26) and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta- 3 (CNGB 3; family RP 44). Control individuals were analyzed by allele-specific PCR for the CNGA 3 mutation and BstXI restriction analysis for the CNGB 3 mutation. After genetic analysis, clinical diagnosis was re-evaluated by electroretinography and color vision testing. During the course of this study, selected affected members of family RP 26 were given <b>pink</b> <b>glasses</b> as supportive therapy. Results: Sequence analysis of the positional candidate genes identified a novel missense mutation in CNGA 3 (c. 822 G>T; p.
