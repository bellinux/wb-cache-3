40|$|The {{reform to}} replace the Business Tax (BT) with the VAT is the largest tax reform {{initiative}} in China since 1994. This article assesses {{the first two years}} of the reform from a tax policy perspective. It shows that the government has tried to preempt resistance to reform through highly unusual tax design and by allowing local governments to retain revenue from <b>pilot</b> <b>sectors.</b> The VAT for <b>pilot</b> <b>sectors</b> is characterized by two new reduced rates that apply to a wide range of business-to-business transactions as well as consumer services (such as internet and mobile data services) not generally regarded in other VAT systems as requiring reduced rates. Moreover, a broad population of new VAT taxpayers is subject to 2 ̆ 2 simplified collection 2 ̆ 2 — a low-rate cascading levy. One characterization is that a second VAT has emerged that perpetuate many of the BT’s distortionary characteristics while also taking on the flaws of China’s traditional VAT. This renders both the prospects and benefits of extending the reform to further sectors (most consumer services, real estate, and financial services) uncertain...|$|E
40|$|The {{division}} {{of a network}} in different sectors is a usual practice in Water Companies. It improves {{the management of the}} network in different senses. Sectors have more homogenous characteristics and need specific cares and treatments that is not the same all through the network. Specifically for leakage detection and assessment it is interesting to know the performance of the sector before any leakage detection strategy is applied. In this paper a characterisation methodology for the sectors is presented. This methodology is based on the knowledge provided by the company but has been analysed using clustering techniques.

40|$|The matured laser-diagnostic {{techniques}} of planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) {{were applied to}} a prototype gas turbine burner operating on various fuels. The work was performed to provide verification of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models of the combustion of atypical fuels in a gas turbine combustor. The burner was operated using methane and three synthesized fuels of interest- one with hydrogen as the principle component and two with a low heating value (15 MJ/m 3). Experiments were performed at pressures from 1 to 9 bar, with the fuel/air mixture at both ambient (~ 300 K) and elevated temperature. The burner, which was supplied by Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery, is a down-scaled prototype of that used in the SGT- 750 gas turbine. It is composed of three individual sectors that are arranged concentrically, a centermost <b>pilot</b> <b>sector,</b> intermediate sector and main sector. Each sector contributes a premixed fuel/air flow, while swirl elements in each sector promote flame stabilization and recirculation in the combustion region. There are dedicated fuel feeds allowing for localized setting of fuel/air mixture {{at each of the}} <b>sectors.</b> The central <b>pilot</b> <b>sector</b> of the burner was separable from the full burner assembly and was examined in detail. Information was generated regarding the use of syngas to fuel the burner. This information is intended to be used for the validation of CFD models of the experiments, including optimization of reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms for the specific fuels. Laminar flame speed measurements were made for several syngas fuel candidates from which the high-hydrogen syngas fuel was selected. Burner performance at the lean stability limit was examined using the fuels of interest. It was found that increasing the fuel/air ratio in the central <b>pilot</b> <b>sector</b> improved the lean limit onset of flame extinction up {{to the point that the}} central pilot extinguished. Optimization of the burner nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission by fuel partitioning among the three sectors was performed. The response in emission level with fuel/air ratio was not universal among the fuels tested. The largest portion of work in this thesis is the visualization of the burner combustion field by laser diagnostic methods. The flame shape was imaged by the PLIF of the OH radical distribution. PLIF imaging of the central <b>pilot</b> <b>sector</b> was recorded for atmospheric and elevated pressure for iterations of inlet air temperature, fuel type and equivalence ratio. When comparing the OH-LIF distribution for various fuels and pressures it was found that equivalence ratio had the greatest effect on the distribution of OH signal from the exit of the central <b>pilot</b> <b>sector.</b> Lean equivalence ratios showed a diffuse signal typical of the post combustion region. Near stoichiometric equivalence ratios yielded a distribution having a clearly defined inner edge indicating combustion occurring outside of the <b>pilot</b> <b>sector.</b> At rich equivalence ratios the OH signal was lifted away from the pilot burner exit. Comparison of OH-PLIF and chemiluminescence signal for methane combustion supported the characterization that the <b>pilot</b> <b>sector</b> efflux varied from post combustion to attached and then lifted flame in conjunction with the increase in equivalence ratio from lean to rich. OH-PLIF imaging was collected for staging of fuel to all three sectors of the burner at atmospheric pressure. The flow field in the combustion region produced by the full burner was visualized using PIV for each of fuels of interest, illustrating the recirculation zone. Finally the OH-LIF distribution was imaged for the combustion region of the entire burner at elevated pressure during operation at a single equivalence ratio with various dilutions of natural gas. There was little discernible change in flame shape as the pressure was changed from 3, 4. 5 and 6 bar and energy content was changed from 30, 40 and 45 MJ/m^ 3 Wobbe index...|$|R

40|$|The lean {{stability}} limit of a prototype syngas burner is investigated. The burner is a three sector system, {{consisting of a}} separate igniter, stabilizer and Main burner. The ignition sector, Rich-Pilot-Lean (RPL), can be operated with both rich or lean equivalence values, and serves to ignite the <b>Pilot</b> <b>sector</b> which stabilizes the Main combustion sector. The RPL and Main sectors are fully premixed, while the <b>Pilot</b> <b>sector</b> is partially premixed. The complexity of this burner design, especially the ability to vary equivalence ratios in all three sectors, allows for the burner to be adapted to various gases and achieve optimal combustion. The gases examined are methane and a high H 2 model syngas (10 % CH 4, 22. 5 % CO, 67. 5 % H 2). Both gases are combusted at their original compositions and the syngas was also diluted with N 2 to a low calorific value fuel with a Wobbe index of 15 MJ/m 3. The syngas is a typical product of gasification of biomass or coal. Gasification of biomass can {{be considered to be}} CO 2 neutral. The lean {{stability limit}} is localized by lowering the equivalence ratio from stable combustion until the limit is reached. To get a comparable blowout definition the CO emissions is measured using a non-dispersive infrared sensor analyzer. The stability limit is defined when the measured CO emissions exceed 200 ppm. The stability limit is measured for the 3 gas mixtures at atmospheric pressure. The RPL equivalence ratio is varied to investigate how this affected the lean blowout limit. A small decrease in stability limit can be observed when increasing the RPL equivalence ratio. The experimental values are compared with values from a perfectly stirred reactor modeled (PSR), under burner conditions, using the GRI 3. 0 kinetic mechanism for methane and the San Diego mechanism for the syngas fuels...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s, the Government of Sri Lanka {{considered}} engaging private sector operators to manage {{water and sewerage services}} {{in two separate}} service areas: one in the town of Negombo (north of Colombo), and one stretching along the coastal strip (south from Colombo) from the towns of Kalutara to Galle. Since then, the government has abandoned the idea of setting up a public-private partnership in these two areas. This paper is part of a series of investigations to determine how these <b>pilot</b> private <b>sector</b> transactions (forming part of the overall water sector reform strategy) could be designed in such a manner that they would benefit the poor. The authors describe the results of a conjoint survey evaluating the factors that drive customer demand for alternative water supply and sanitation services in Sri Lanka. They show how conjoint surveys can be used to unpackage household demand for attributes of urban services and improve the design of infrastructure policies. They present conjoint surveys as a tool for field experiments and a source of valuable empirical data. In the study of three coastal towns in southwestern Sri Lanka the conjoint survey allows the authors to compare household preferences for four water supply attributes-price, quantity, safety, and reliability. They examine subpopulations of different income levels to determine if demand is heterogeneous. The case study suggests that households care about service quality (not just price). In general, the authors find that households have diverse preferences in terms of quantity, safety, and service options, but not with regard to hours of supply. In particular, they find that the poor have lower ability to trade off income for services, a finding that has significant equity implications in terms of allocating scarce public services and achieving universal water access.

40|$|The Air Traffic Management System, {{as it is}} used today, is a {{centrally}} organised system. One controller, sometimes {{assisted by}} a planner, is responsible for maintaining the separation between all aircraft in his/her <b>sector.</b> <b>Pilots</b> merely follow the directions received from the controller and have no {{active role in the}} separation assurance. To maintain an orderly traffic pattern, airways are used to structure the traffic flow and flight levels are used as layers to separate aircraft. This often inhibits a more optimal direct route at the optimal altitude. The need for maintaining situational awareness also limits the number of aircraft a controller can handle. This is a limiting factor for airspace capacity and contributes to delays. The study described in this report investigates a revolutionary alternative for this system, called the Free Flight concept. In Free Flight Airspace, aircraft fly their own preferred route at their preferred altitude. They only need to deviate from this route if it conflicts with the route of another aircraft.

40|$|Abstract only. In many fisheries, {{harvesters}} {{of different}} scales, different gears, or on different sides of political boundaries crossed {{by a single}} stock are effectively managed separately. The New England Multispecies (groundfish) fishery is about to dramatically expand the number of management systems in place concurrently, by allocating portions of the total allowable catch (TAC) to self-identified groups of harvesters, to manage in any way they wish. Under this "catch share" system, groups (called "sectors") would receive quota allocations proportional to the harvest history of their members, and some groups' vessels may operate under individual quotas, while others may operate under daily trip limits, and yet other vessels will not associate with a group and remain in a common pool fishery. Understanding the economic consequences of this arrangement requires understanding how effort and harvesting patterns are affected when multiple management systems are applied concurrently to the same stock. We use human subject experiments to evaluate the interaction of groups of harvesters being managed by different systems, testing the predictions of control theoretic models. We focus on the interaction of a common pool derby fishery with an individual quota managed <b>sector.</b> <b>Pilot</b> data suggest that, {{in the presence of}} a harvest congestion externality, subjects in the common pool do race to fish, dissipating rents, and subjects managed by individual quotas wait for the common pool to exhaust its quota and be shut down, then apply a lower level of effort through the balance of the season to collect high rents...|$|R

The outcome of that process was the passage of Senate Bill 2771 sub A—otherwise known as Rhode Island Gen. Law 20. 2 - 1 (2002). The legislation ended a moratorium on the issuance of new commercial fishing licenses in the state, and called for the establishment of license limitation programs that accommodate new entry into state waters fisheries. In 2009, the state approved a catch share pilot program, effectively changing how access to the resource is constructed. ^ This research seeks to better understand the impetus for preserving access to the fishery in 2002, and determine if the catch share pilot program is consistent with the original intent of the Act. A Grounded Theory methodology is employed to illustrate the entire management situation leading up to the passage of Rhode Island Gen. Law 20. 2 - 1 (2002). The results of this research indicate that while access has not been functionally compromised for new entrants through the enactment of a <b>sector</b> <b>pilot</b> program, a normative and cognitive disconnect exists between the intent of the legislation and the catch share pilot program. Moreover, the values and worldviews of fisheries stakeholders in Rhode Island are influenced by a range of regional and international institutions that did not inform the 2002 legislation. ...|$|R
40|$|Governments {{across the}} globe are now {{recognising}} {{the need to take}} steps to better manage their property portfolios due to the escalating costs of operating these buildings over their lifetime. This has seen them turn towards innovative work practices and technologies offered by Building Information Modelling (BIM). It is now becoming increasingly evident that BIM can bring significant added value to the design, construction and most importantly to the operational life of a public sector development project. This experience has resulted in a number of governments moving towards implementing BIM for all public works projects. BIM allows the building to be designed collaboratively within a unique integrated environment which aims to produce a more rewarding and cost efficient building for the end-user. Despite enhanced Facilities Management (FM) being the goal of this collaborative BIM approach, there is still a reluctance and a lack of perceived benefits of having the Facility Manager involved earlier in the design phase. Some of the reasons for this is a clear lack of metrics to quantify the contribution that the Facility Manager can provide at the early design phase. This paper will detail a new process, in which the Facilities Manager will operate as a key professional at an early stage and further suggest a unique set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of their contribution. The data collation methodology includes the use of data from a number of public <b>sector</b> <b>pilot</b> projects and extensive surveys that have been scientifically analysed through thematic analysis to establish common themes and trends. These common themes represent some of the key areas where the Facilities Manager can have the greatest effect when introduced into the construction team. It is hoped that the research findings will support the business case for the adoption of a more robust FM process for the public sector, facilitated by the use of a suite of unique KPIs...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} based on the {{preliminary}} results of the research project “Women in Roma political movement and NGO <b>sector.</b> <b>Pilot</b> study of Poland and Slovakia. ” It contributes to the discussion which approach to Roma mobilization is more efficient: one that assumes more or less homogeneous nature of Romani communities and treats their problems in a holistic, culturally-determined way, or one that prefers a diversified, socio-economic perspective and aims at solutions to particular groups of problems (respectively: to the problems of particular groups). The interviews with the female Roma activists from Poland (belonging to Polska Roma and Carpathian Roma groups) and Slovakia present an interesting material regarding the issues of education of the Roma women, discrimination they experience (multiple and intersectional, among Roma and non-Roma), patriarchy, attitudes to women’s organizational activity, and the ways Roma women may seek assistance, especially regarding the matters of sexual life. The results indicate that women who belong to culturally different groups (that is those who live according to romanipen and those, who do not) may have similar thoughts regarding their situation while women who belong to culturally similar groups may significantly differ. This means that it is not “Roma culture” that determines the situation of women in Roma communities but rather the socio-economic issues and patriarchal cultural features that Roma communities share with their non-Roma environment.

40|$|The European Union has set {{environmental}} targets {{on climate}} change in three areas: energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, and reduction of emissions. These targets are the main driver for the change in today’s power system. The defined targets do not only affect the production and distribution of electricity but also raise questions on how electricity is being consumed. An essential building block of an efficient power system {{is often referred to}} as the smart grid. One of the important components of a smart grid is dynamic market models that facilitate demand response. Residential customers account for a relatively large portion of the total electricity consumption in Europe but relatively little is known about dynamic market models used in the residential <b>sector.</b> <b>Pilot</b> projects concerning dynamic market models have been conducted, but there is a lack of common evaluation methods to assess them.     This report investigates how pilot projects concerning demand response can be evaluated and presents a compilation of 135 international pilot projects and their results. The evaluations methods and findings from the international compilation are then applied to assess the proposed dynamic market model for the Stockholm Royal Seaport. Four evaluation criterions have been identified. The first relates to the demand response resource that is being studied and its impact on the results of the pilot project. Secondly, design principles of the pilot project must be considered. Thirdly, the division of costs and benefits among stakeholders must be calculated. Lastly, the precision of these measures must be taken into consideration. The compilation of international pilot projects reveals that dynamic markets models are often combined with modern technology. Combinations of market models, feedback and technology have an impact on overall electricity conservation and peak reduction. The reductions also depend on what electrical appliances are being used by the household members and their willingness to change their behavior. Customer acceptance is generally large among participants in pilot projects concerning dynamic market models. The hypothesis for the Stockholm Royal Seaport, in which five to fifteen percent of the load can be shifted from peak hours to off-peak hours with the proposed market model for the Stockholm Royal Seaport, is estimated to be reasonable. Load shift would lead to savings in the range between 64 – 266 SEK per year, which accounts for 1 – 4 % in bill savings. If the proposed dynamic market model is compared to fixed one month contracts, which includes retail price and fixed network tariffs, the bill savings were estimated to have been 563 - 766 SEK in year 2010. This corresponds to bill savings in the range of 8 – 11 %. Keywords: Smart grid, demand response, market model, evaluation methods for pilot projects, Stockholm Royal Seapor...|$|R
40|$|This thesis uses {{document}} analysis and semi-structured personal interviews {{to look at}} current strategies and policies of major companies to manage the life cycle environmental risks associated with their products and processes, which I refer to as corporate environmental responsibility (CER); The thesis also explores what some national governments are and could be doing to encourage greater environmental responsibility from companies. As environmentalists and climate scientists have been warning for decades, and now world leaders are coming to realise, the world faces serious environmental challenges, none more urgent than climate change. A failure to act to mitigate {{the risks associated with}} this one challenge, as Stern (2006, pii) asserts ï¿½could create risks of major disruptions to economic and social activityï¿½. A major proportion of the worldï¿½s environmental problems can be attributed directly to production, use and disposal of products (Tukker &amp; Jansen, 2006), and as this thesis will argue, national government policies to encourage or force greater environmental responsibility from producers are required to reduce risks and mitigate impacts. In recent decades national governments have been reluctant to intervene in the market place, preferring to rely on voluntary mechanisms, but as will be discussed in greater detail, there is now an increasingly critical voice (Zarsky, Roht-Ariaza &amp; Brottem, 2002; Hirschland, 2003; Archer &amp; Piper, 2003; Vogel 2005; Hay et al, 2005) that questions the effectiveness of voluntary corporate responsibility as it is currently practiced, which subsequently raises the question: what role national governments, and international governance should take? The primary data sources for this thesis are personal interviews with senior business leaders from 25 major companies, recorded public speeches, both web and non-web based corporate public relations material, and personal interviews with key academics in the field, environmentalists and corporate analysts, conducted mainly between 2002 and 2004. The analysis of this data has sought to investigate the attitudes of major companies to: - corporate environmental responsibility, though some interrelated aspects of social responsibility are also considered; - what drives them to take greater responsibility to reduce their environmental risks; - government policies, especially possible legislation to encourage and/or force CER. In addition through case studies of: - one industry sector - two major companies, and - one industry <b>sector</b> <b>pilot</b> study; as well as secondary research on several other companies, this thesis investigates what some companies are saying and doing about corporate environmental responsibility. This will lead to a short discussion {{of the degree to which}} these companiesï¿½ rhetoric of responsibility matches their actions ï¿½ that is how much they are ï¿½walking the talkï¿½. The thesis also looks at the current potential of national governments in encouraging and/or forcing greater CER, then contrasts the development and implementation of national policies for CER in Australia with those in Europe, focussing on CER as it relates to products in the electrical and electronics industry. The thesis concludes with some observations and suggestions on policies of major companies and of national governments, as well as international governance, to encourage greater CER...|$|R
