50|$|Typically, {{the signal}} on port L will occupy a single low {{frequency}} band and the signal on port H will occupy a higher frequency band. In that situation, the diplexer {{consists of a}} lowpass filter connecting <b>ports</b> L and <b>S</b> and high pass filter connecting <b>ports</b> H and <b>S.</b> Ideally, all the lowband signal power on port L is transferred to the <b>S</b> <b>port</b> and vice versa.

60|$|Southward of the Rio Negro, {{the cliffs}} along the great bay of S. Antonio are capped with gravel: at San Josef, I {{found that the}} pebbles closely resembled those on the plain of the Rio Negro, but {{that they were not}} {{cemented}} by calcareous matter. Between San Josef and Port Desire, I was assured by the Officers of the Survey that the whole face of the country is coated with gravel. At Port Desire and over a space of twenty-five miles inland, on the three step-formed plains and in the valleys, I everywhere passed over gravel which, where thickest, was between thirty and forty feet. Here, as in other parts of Patagonia, the gravel, or its sandy covering, was, as we have seen, often strewed with recent marine shells. The sandy covering sometimes fills up furrows in the gravel, as does the gravel in the underlying tertiary formations. The pebbles are frequently whitewashed and even cemented together by a peculiar, white, friable, aluminous, fusible substance, which I believe is decomposed feldspar. At Port Desire, the gravel rested sometimes on the basal formation of porphyry, and sometimes on the upper or the lower denuded tertiary strata. It is remarkable that most of the porphyritic pebbles differ from those varieties of porphyry which occur here abundantly in situ. The peculiar gallstone-yellow variety was common, but less numerous than at <b>Port</b> <b>S.</b> Julian, where it formed nearly one-third of the mass of the gravel; the remaining part there consisting of pale grey and greenish porphyries with many crystals of feldspar. At <b>Port</b> <b>S.</b> Julian, I ascended one of the flat- topped hills, the denuded remnant of the highest plain, and found it, at the height of 950 feet, capped with the usual bed of gravel.|$|R

50|$|Prior to {{effective}} {{engine control unit}} computers, engine vacuum was used for many functions in an automobile. Vacuum switches were employed to regulate this flow. For instance a dual port vacuum switch located in a port on the intake manifold monitored the coolant temperature in the coolant crossover. It received vacuum (port E on the switch) from the carburetor. The vacuum flowed through the switch to a vacuum solenoid (such as a heat riser, used to restrict exhaust allowing the engine to heat up faster). When the coolant heated to operating temperature the vacuum switch closed off the <b>port</b> (<b>port</b> <b>S</b> on the vacuum switch) turning off the vacuum to the heat riser. The result is to clear the exhaust restriction. The switch monitored the temperature and when conditions were right it performed its designed function.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An ultra-wideband (UWB) planar {{microstrip}} antenna integrated with a narrow–band cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) is presented for cognitive radio applications. The proposed antenna {{is a combination}} of semicircular-semi hexagon shape microstrip patch, which is fed by coplanar waveguide (CPW). The dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) is cylindrical in shape excited by a microstrip slot fed on the rear side which shows a narrow band (NB) characteristics. The {{microstrip antenna}} provides a wide bandwidth operates from 2. 58 GHz to 14 GHz. The DRA provides a narrow bandwidth operates from 10. 07 GHz to 11. 38 GHz. The UWB antenna is used for sensing the spectrum and the narrow-band DRA used for communication operation. A very good isolation between the two antenna <b>ports</b> (<b>S</b> 21 less than- 15 dB) are also achieved. Compared to the existing designs the peak gain of the antenna is highly increased around 6. 15 dB. Index Terms — Cognitive radio, coplanar waveguide, dielectri...|$|R
