50|$|The epic laws of folk {{narrative}} were {{a series}} of principles identified by Axel Olrik for understanding the structure and form of folktales, and have a foundational significance in European folklore studies. Olrik was inspired in this by an idea of Moltke Moe, but Olrik's approach is structural whereas Moe sought to derive rules for {{the historical development of}} narratives. The principles were articulated in various publications, the first prominent one appearing in Danish in 1908.
