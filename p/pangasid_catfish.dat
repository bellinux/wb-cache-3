Four treatments each with three replicates were used. The fishes were stocked at the rate of 120 fishes/decimal. The stocking ratios were: 100 % <b>pangasid</b> <b>catfish</b> in Treatment 1 (T 1), 0 % <b>pangasid</b> <b>catfish</b> plus 50 % silver carp in Treatment 2 (T 2), 0 % <b>pangasid</b> <b>catfish</b> plus 40 % silver carp in Treatment 3 (T 3) and 50 % <b>pangasid</b> <b>catfish</b> plus 50 % silver carp in Treatment 4 (T 4). Bamboo made fence were used in treatments 2 and 3 to keep the <b>pangasid</b> <b>catfish</b> and silver carp separately along the breadth wise considering the density of each species. Treatment 4 was set without fence. During the period of study, significant differences were found in dissolved oxygen, N 0 3 -N and chlorophyll-a concentrations among different stocking ratios of <b>pangasid</b> <b>catfish</b> and silver carp. The highest concentration of P 0 4 -P and NO 3 -N were found in T 1 (2. 7 and 3. 1 mg L - 1, respectively) followed by treatments T 3, T 2 and T 4. This higher concentration of NO 3 -N and PO 4 -P enhanced the plankton biomass especially Cyanophyceae and Euglenophyceae in ponds of treatment 1 and identified dominant bloom forming cyanophytes were Microcystis and Gloeocapsa, which formed the heavy phytoplankton bloom throughout the culture period and deteriorated the water quality in <b>pangasid</b> <b>catfish</b> monoculture ponds (100 % <b>pangasid</b> <b>catfish).</b> Whereas better water quality were found in composite culture. Among different stocking ratios, in composite culture 1 : 1 without fence (treatment 4) gave the best result in better water quality maintenances than 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 (with fence, treatment 3 and 2) ratios. In treatment 4 when the nutrients concentrations enhanced the phytoplankton production then silver carp grazed over phytoplankton throughout water body, which prevented the phytoplankton bloom formation during culture period and maintained a better environmental condition. Some algal bloom occurred in the portion of <b>pangasid</b> <b>catfish</b> in treatment 2 and treatment 3. It might be due to the grazing activity of silver carp over phytoplankton was restricted by the fence in those treatments. Considering the above facts composite culture of <b>pangasid</b> <b>catfish</b> and silver carp with 1 : 1 ratio and without fence may help in maintaining the good environmental condition of catfish farming through preventing the algal bloom...|$|E

40|$|The main {{species of}} <b>Pangasid</b> <b>catfishes</b> {{recently}} adopted for culture with Indian Major Carps are Yellowtail catfish (Pangasius pangasius) and Sutchi catfish (Pangasius sutchi). These fishes were {{introduced into the}} farming system of Bengal from Thailand through Bangladesh in 1994 - 95. Though carnivorous at an early stage, the fish are compatible with Indian Major Carps from five days onwards and can grow to 3 kg/year on a balanced diet 1, 2.
