Additional studies were identified through searches of bibliographies. Studies included those comparing PTH peptides with placebo, with anti-osteoporotic treatments and in combination therapies.

40|$|Microtubule {{disruption}} has dramatic {{effects on}} the normal centrosomal localization of the Golgi complex, with Golgi elements remaining as competent functional units but undergoing a reversible "fragmentation" and dispersal throughout the cytoplasm. In this study we have analyzed this process using digital fluorescence image processing microscopy combined with biochemical and ultrastructural approaches. After microtubule depolymerization, Golgi membrane components were found to redistribute to a distinct number of <b>peripheral</b> <b>sites</b> that were not randomly distributed, but corresponded to sites of protein exit from the ER. Whereas Golgi enzymes redistributed gradually over several hours to these <b>peripheral</b> <b>sites,</b> ERGIC- 53 (a protein which constitutively cycles between the ER and Golgi) redistributed rapidly (within 15 minutes) to these sites after first moving through the ER. Prior to this redistribution, Golgi enzyme processing of proteins exported from the ER was inhibited and only returned to normal levels after Golgi enzymes redistributed to <b>peripheral</b> ER exit <b>sites</b> where Golgi stacks were regenerated. Experiments examining the effects of microtubule disruption on the membrane pathways connecting the ER and Golgi suggested their potential role in the dispersal process. Whereas clustering of peripheral pre-Golgi elements into the centrosomal region failed to occur after microtubule disruption, Golgi-to-ER membrane recycling was only slightly inhibited. Moreover, conditions that impeded Golgi-to-ER recycling completely blocked Golgi fragmentation. Based on these findings we propose that a slow but constitutive flux of Golgi resident proteins through the same ER/Golgi cycling pathways as ERGIC- 53 underlies Golgi Dispersal upon microtubule depolymerization. Both ERGIC- 53 and Golgi proteins would accumulate at <b>peripheral</b> ER exit <b>sites</b> due to failure of membranes at these sites to cluster into the centrosomal region.

40|$|AbstractInsect acetylcholinesterase, {{an enzyme}} whose {{catalytic}} site {{is located at}} the bottom of a gorge, can metabolise its substrate in a wide range of concentrations (from 1 μM to 200 mM) since it is activated at low substrate concentrations. It also presents inhibition at high substrate concentrations. Among the various rival kinetic models tested to analyse the kinetic behaviour of the enzyme, the simplest able to explain all the experimental data suggests that there are two sites for substrate molecules on the protein. Binding on the catalytic site located at the bottom of the gorge seems to be irreversible, suggesting that each molecule of substrate which enters the active site gorge is metabolised. Reversible binding at the <b>peripheral</b> <b>site</b> of the free enzyme has high affinity (2 μM), suggesting that this binding increases the probability of the substrate entering the active site gorge. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>site</b> occupation decreases the entrance rate constant of the second substrate molecule to the catalytic site and strongly affects the catalytic activity of the enzyme. On the other hand, catalytic site occupation lowers the affinity of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>site</b> for the substrate (34 mM). These effects between the two sites result both in apparent activation at low substrate concentration and in general inhibition at high substrate concentration...|$|E
40|$|Tacrine (THA) is {{approved}} by the FDA for the palliative treatment of Alzheimer's disease, but its use has been greatly limited by dose-dependent liver toxicity. A possible solution to the toxicity problem {{lies in the fact}} that tacrine homodimers A 7 A -Al 0 A have greatly enhanced potency for inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) relative to THA itself (Chapter 1). The enhanced potency of these tacrine dimers was proposed to be due to dual-site binding of the tacrine units to the catalytic and peripheral sites of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). To provide a further test of the dual binding site hypothesis proposed for A 7 A-Al 0 A, the second chapter describes the syntheses and evaluation of short tether homologs A 2 A-A 6 A. En route to these compounds, convenient and scaleable syntheses of useful pharmaceutical intermediate 9 -chloro- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroacridine (9) and A 7 A were developed. AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition assays of A 2 A-Al 0 A confirm that a seven methylene tether (A 7 A) optimizes AChE inhibition potency and AChE/BChE selectivity. These studies also indicate that simultaneous binding of alkylene-linked 9 -amino- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroacridine dimers to the catalytic and peripheral sites of AChE is possible with a tether length as short as 5 methylenes. At tether lengths of 3 - 4 methylenes the AChE IC 50 values are close to that of THA, suggesting only one inhibitor unit can bind the enzyme. In the third chapter, dimeric acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors containing a single 9 -amino- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroacridine (THA) unit were constructed in an effort to further delineate structural requirements for optimal binding to the AChE <b>peripheral</b> <b>site.</b> Basic amines of differing hydrophobicity were selected as <b>peripheral</b> <b>site</b> ligands, and in each case, improvements in inhibitory potency and selectivity were seen relative to THA itself. AChE IC 50 values of the optimum dimers decrease significantly as the <b>peripheral</b> <b>site</b> ligand was permuted in the series ammonia > dimethylamine > 4 -aminopyridine > 4 -aminoquinoline > tacrine.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{viscoelasticity}} of the arterial wall and its influence on the pulse waves. We describe the viscoelasticity by a non-linear Kelvin-Voigt model in which the coefficients are fitted using experimental time series of pressure and radius measured on a sheep's arterial network. We obtained a good agreement between {{the results of the}} nonlinear Kelvin-Voigt model and the experimental measurements. We found that the viscoelastic relaxation time-defined by the ratio between the viscoelastic coefficient and the Young's modulus-is nearly constant throughout the network. Therefore, as {{it is well known that}} smaller arteries are stiffer, the viscoelastic coefficient rises when approaching the <b>peripheral</b> <b>sites</b> to compensate the rise of the Young's modulus, resulting in a higher damping effect. We incorporated the fitted viscoelastic coefficients in a nonlinear 1 D fluid model to compute the pulse waves in the network. The damping effect of viscoelasticity on the high frequency waves is clear especially at the <b>peripheral</b> <b>sites.</b> Comment: in Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 201...|$|R
