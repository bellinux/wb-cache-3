5|$|Despite an {{extensive}} <b>police</b> <b>investigation,</b> {{the killer was}} never found and his identity is still a mystery. Both {{at the time and}} subsequently, many amateur and professional investigators have proposed solutions but no single theory is widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} {{introduces}} two major groups of characters: the Baltimore Police Department and a drug dealing organization {{run by the}} Barksdale family. The season follows the <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> of the latter over its 13 episodes.|$|E
5|$|A <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> was {{initiated}} in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too long because they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E

5|$|An autopsy was {{performed}} on August 16, 1983, {{but was unable to}} determine cause of death. New Haven police investigated the death, but were unable to find evidence of foul play. In November 1983, the office of the Connecticut state medical examiner issued a report stating that Slee's death may have been related to stress. The <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> into the matter was closed the same month.|$|E
5|$|Barton's brother Michael Barton {{was sentenced}} to life {{imprisonment}} (with a tariff of 17 years) for his involvement in the racially motivated murder of Anthony Walker in 2005. Joey made a public appeal to his brother to come forward and help with the <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> following the attack, and also made a series of calls to Michael, enquiring about his involvement in the incident.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury {{went missing}} while in France, {{prompting}} an international <b>police</b> <b>investigation.</b> His remains {{were found at}} the bottom of a remote ravine in the foothills of the French Alps five months after his death. Investigations revealed that he was murdered by his brother-in-law during an argument regarding a divorce from his wife, Jamila M'Barek, both of whom were convicted of his murder.|$|E

5|$|On 13 August 1994, a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA near the pier was defused by a {{controlled}} explosion. A similar bomb {{by the same}} perpetrators had exploded in Bognor Regis on the same day. The bombing was intended to mark the 25th anniversary of the start of The Troubles. The pier was closed for several days owing to <b>police</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1999, Combs and his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez were at Club New York in Manhattan when gunfire broke out. After a <b>police</b> <b>investigation,</b> Combs {{and fellow}} rapper Shyne {{were arrested for}} weapons {{violations}} and other charges. Combs was charged with four weapons-related charges and bribing his driver, Wardel Fenderson, to claim ownership of his gun.|$|E
5|$|The Animals in War Memorial {{was opened}} at the {{northeast}} edge of Park Lane in 2004 by Anne, Princess Royal. It commemorates animals that served in wars, and alongside servicemen. In June 2007, a car bomb was successfully defused in an underground car park on Park Lane. The road was closed {{for most of the}} day for <b>police</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The show is {{realistic}} in depicting {{the processes of}} both police work and criminal activity. There have even been reports of real-life criminals watching the show {{to learn how to}} counter <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> techniques. The fifth season portrayed a working newsroom at The Baltimore Sun and was described by Brian Lowry of Variety magazine in 2007 as the most realistic portrayal of the media in film and television.|$|E
5|$|Within Britain, {{there has}} been {{continuing}} interest in Lucan's fate. Since Rivett's murder, hundreds of reported sightings {{have been made in}} various countries around the world; none have been substantiated. Despite a <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> and huge press interest, Lucan has not been found and is presumed dead; a death certificate was issued in 2016.|$|E
5|$|A <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> did {{not find}} a motive behind the shooting, {{although}} Gale's mother said that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and that he believed the brothers had stolen his lyrics while trying to steal his identity. She {{did not know if}} her son took the medication he was given for his condition, but was proud of his military service following his discharge, and had given him the Beretta 92F that was used in the shooting. Major Jason Johnston, a Marine Corps spokesman at The Pentagon, was unable to comment on Gale's discharge.|$|E

5|$|After he {{completed}} the portrait {{his reputation as}} an artist, {{and the value of}} his works increased. He was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2006. Then, in 2013, he was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, a <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> into child sexual abuse by media celebrities, and was convicted for indecent assault and imprisoned for five years nine months in June 2014. His art work was largely withdrawn for sale, and became worthless, and the CBE was cancelled and annulled.|$|E
5|$|After ten days' investigation, Oxley was {{surprised}} to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned that the <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed This Weeks investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the trial}} judge had criticized the <b>police</b> <b>investigation,</b> Essex Police held an {{internal}} inquiry, conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Dickinson. Bamber alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been withheld by the police, so he made a formal complaint, which was investigated in 1991 by the City of London Police. This process uncovered more documentation, which Bamber used to petition the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes {{convinced}} that Gorman's story is true. The lack of tangible evidence, he claims, {{is due to}} a government cover-up and deliberate misdirection of the <b>police</b> <b>investigation.</b> To back up the claims of a masonic conspiracy, he notes supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper killings and alleged masonic ritual murders, and accuses Sir Charles Warren, Commissioner of Police, of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies. Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders, was a freemason.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the <b>police</b> <b>investigation,</b> deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out by Namdal Police District and the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation (HSL). A conflict arose between the two as the latter {{in cooperation with the}} Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want a <b>police</b> <b>investigation</b> until after their report was finished. This caused the police to use two years to gain court permission to access the evidence. The report found no technical problems with the aircraft. However, it found several pilot errors and laid a large responsibility on the airline for lack of proper organization and routines. No-one was charged after the accident, but lead to a major restructure of operations and procedures in Widerøe.|$|E
