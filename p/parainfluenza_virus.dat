5|$|The {{symptoms}} of the common cold {{are believed to be}} primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>virus</b> typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the {{symptoms of}} croup due to the small size of their airways.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{spread by}} droplet {{transmission}} include respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>virus,</b> adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus), Bordetella pertussis, pneumococci, diphtheria, and rubella.|$|E
25|$|Common cold: rhinovirus, coronavirus, {{respiratory}} syncytial virus, <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>virus</b> {{can cause}} {{infection of the}} throat, ear, and lungs causing standard cold-like symptoms and often pain.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} identified agents in children are respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses.</b>|$|R
40|$|HMV-II, a human {{malignant}} melanoma cell line, was {{compared with other}} cell lines (MDCK, Vero, and LLC-MK 2) and primary cultures of monkey kidney (PMK) cells for the isolation and quantification of influenza and <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses.</b> HMV-II cells were superior to MDCK and LLC-MK 2 cells in quantification of the influenza C virus and were used successfully in {{the isolation of the}} virus from clinical specimens. The HMV-II cell line was also more sensitive for isolating <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses</b> from clinical specimens than were Vero and PMK cells; there was, however, {{no significant difference in the}} quantification of the viruses among these cultures. As far as influenza A and B viruses were concerned, the HMV-II cell line was significantly less sensitive than MDCK cells, and no virus was isolated from clinical specimens with HMV-II cells. Thus, HMV-II cells are useful for the isolation of influenza C and <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses</b> as an alternative to embryonated hen's eggs and PMK cells...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Pityriasis Rosea (PR) is {{an acute}} inflamatory skin disease with un-known {{etiology}} {{considered to be}} the most associated with infections. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the role of influenza <b>viruses</b> A-B, <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses</b> 1 - 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus in the etiology of PR patients. Method: Thirty out-patients, applying to the dermatology depart-ment of Konya Education and Research Hospital, who were diagnosed with PR, and healty PR negative control group at the same number, age and sex with PR patients were included into the study. In order to enlighten whether an association of PR with the influenza <b>viruses</b> A-B, <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses</b> 1 - 3, RSV and adenovirus viruses existed or not. RNA materials from influenza <b>viruses</b> A-B, <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses</b> 1 - 3 and RSV; DNA material from adenovirus were investigated by using DNA reverse-hybridization method in the nasofarengeal samples ob-tained from patients with PR and control groups included to the study. Result: No RNA positivity was determined, related to influenza vi-ruses A-B, <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses</b> 1 - 3, RSV and DNA to adenovirus in any of the patients and control groups. Conclusion: As a consequence, viral etiology of the PR disease still remains unknown, whether to be viral or not, thus further studies are needed to enlighten the unknown etiology of the disease...|$|R

500|$|Viral croup or acute laryngotracheitis is most {{commonly}} caused by <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>virus</b> (a {{member of the}} paramyxovirus family), primarily types 1 and 2, in 75% of cases. Other viral causes include influenza A and B, measles, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

2500|$|Rhinoviruses are {{the most}} common cause of the common cold; other viruses such as {{respiratory}} syncytial virus, <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>virus</b> and adenoviruses can cause them too.

2500|$|Vaccinations are an {{important}} preventative animal health measure. The specific vaccinations recommended for dogs varies depending on geographic location, environment, travel history, and the activities the animal frequently engages in. In the United States, regardless {{of any of these}} factors, it is usually highly recommended that dogs be vaccinated against rabies, canine parvovirus, canine distemper, and infectious canine hepatitis (using canine adenovirus type 2 to avoid reaction). [...] The decision on whether to vaccinate against other diseases, including leptospirosis, Lyme disease, Bordetella bronchiseptica, <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>virus,</b> and canine coronavirus, should be made between an owner and a veterinarian, taking into account factors specific to the dog.|$|E
40|$|Rhesus and cynomolgus monkey kidney tissue {{cultures}} and two continuous lines, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and LLC-MK 2, were compared in titrations and isolations of influenza and <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses.</b> Tube cultures were inoculated with laboratory virus strains or stored patient specimens and observed for hemadsorption. Trypsin {{was added to}} the medium of the continuous lines to increase sensitivity. All four tissue cultures gave similar titers of influenza A/USSR (H 1 N 1), A/Texas (H 3 N 2), and B/HK, but lower titers of parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3 were observed with MDCK. Cynomolgus kidney was the best single tissue culture for reisolation of the six viruses, but foamy-virus contamination of many lots was a serious problem. Reisolation of influenza viruses was as successful with MDCK as with primary monkey kidney. LLC-MK 2 was similar to rhesus kidney but less successful than cynomolgus kidney. For reisolation of <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses,</b> LLC-MK 2 was superior to rhesus monkey kidney and similar to cynomolgus kidney. MDCK was less useful for <b>parainfluenza</b> <b>viruses.</b> Thus, LLC-MK 2 would be an acceptable single tissue alternative to primary monkey kidney. The combination of MDCK and LLC-MK 2 would provide optimal sensitivity for isolation of all six viruses...|$|R
