40|$|This study investigates {{executive}} compensation, {{corporate governance}} and {{the determination of}} CEO equity incentives in US entrepreneurial high technology firms. We find the following. First, CEO equity incentives in these new enterprise firms are twenty times larger than that which previous large firm studies have found. Second, both economic factors (firm size, growth opportunities, and risk) and governance factors (founder, venture capitalist <b>presence,</b> <b>board</b> structure, and ownership distribution) determine CEO incentives in these firms. We document instances where direct monitoring arrangements (e. g. venture capitalist monitoring) act as substitutes for explicit incentives in aligning shareholder and CEO interests...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) defines common {{interfaces}} to server‟s hardware {{that used}} to monitor a server‟s physical health such as fans, voltage, temperature, power supplies, power status, and chassis. The server‟s physical health gets report to Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) by different sensors that built into the system. All the sensors information is provided by Sensor Data Records (SDRs). SDRs provide the data records that contain information about the type and number of sensors in the platform, sensor threshold support, chassis intrusion, power supply monitoring, fan speeds, fan <b>presence,</b> <b>board</b> voltages, board temperatures, bus errors, memory errors. SDR are created manually by the users using the information provided by Configuration sheet. In this paper the need to automate the generation of SDR is discussed in two ways: the SDR mapping to the spreadsheets and provided the details without spreadsheets. This paper proposed a solution by implementing of the SDR creation automation tool. We proposed a prototype including an implementation of IPMI‟s Sensor Data Records format module that {{has been applied to}} different configuration sheet provided by different engineers. Any changes to the configuration sheet values get updated by using the SDR generation tool. Keywords:- Baseboard Management controller, Field Replacement U nit, IPMI, sensors I...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{examine the}} {{association}} between the <b>presence</b> of monitoring <b>board</b> committees (i. e., audit, nomination, and remuneration) and market valuation in South Africa using a sample of 169 listed corporations from 2002 to 2007. Design/methodology/approach: We distinctively employ fixed-effects and two-stage least squares regressions to innovatively investigate {{the association between}} the <b>presence</b> of monitoring <b>board</b> committees and market valuation. Findings: We find a significant positive connection between the <b>presence</b> of monitoring <b>board</b> committees and market valuation, but only in corporations that have independent monitoring board committees and/or all three monitoring board committees that we have investigated simultaneously. This implies that the market values corporations with independent and/or the three monitoring board committees more highly. Our results provide empirical support for agency theory, which indicates that the <b>presence</b> of independent <b>board</b> committees increases the capacity of corporate boards to effectively advise, monitor and discipline top management, and thereby improving market valuation. Originality/value: There is an acute dearth of studies examining {{the connection between the}} <b>presence</b> of monitoring <b>board</b> committees and market valuation generally, but particularly in developing countries. Therefore, our evidence contributes to the literature by demonstrating how the <b>presence</b> of monitoring <b>board</b> committees affects market valuation in a major developing African country. Further, we distinctively employ a number of econometric models that adequately control for different types of endogeneity problems and market valuation proxies.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the determinants of}} corporate reputation, derived from the assessments of managers and market analysts, of a sample of large UK firms. Along with the influences {{of a variety of}} firm attributes, we find a reputational effect associated with a female <b>presence</b> at <b>board</b> level. This effect varies across sectors and demonstrates the influence of a firm's stakeholder environment in determining whether a female <b>presence</b> on the <b>board</b> enhances or harms the reputation of the firm. The pattern that emerges indicates that the presence of women on the board is favourably viewed in only those sectors that operate close to final consumers. We argue that the nature of this effect reflects an imperative for equality of representation that highlights the need to reflect gender diversity among customers. 13 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This study explores {{underlying}} {{assumptions about}} board devel-opment practices in nonprofit governance.

The sample consisted of 1, 051 survey responses from CEOs and board chairs repre-senting 713 credit unions. As member-benefit nonprofit organi-zations, credit unions rely almost exclusively on voluntary board members in an oversight capacity.
