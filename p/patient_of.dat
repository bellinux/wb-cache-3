It concluded that Meyer's clinical skills were exemplary and unquestionable, although the Board, aware that Meyer's penchant for taking extremely difficult cases has made hospital death rates appear bad, remove Meyer's discretion to decide when to operate in such cases. This decision angers Meyer, who argues that he performs operations that are {{in the interests of the}} patients not league tables.

Materials and methods. The study involved 30 persons with the average body mass index (BMI) 35. 1 kg/м 2. They were divided into three groups by this index depending on the obesity severity. Results. The indexes of insulin, С-peptide, HOMA index with the enhanced BMI {{had a tendency to}} the increase. Their average indexes were highest in patients with III stage obesity. An increased level of ТSH was determined for the 31 % <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the first group, in 25 % <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the second group and in 50 % <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the third group.

RESULTS: The positive expression of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 in patients with LSCC was 50 % (36 / 72) and 73. 6 % (53 / 72), respectively.

5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game {{and that he was}} looking for a manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to another <b>patient</b> <b>of</b> his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not had a hit game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success.|$|E

40|$|Background Benefits of utilising {{professional}} interpreters {{in clinical}} settings {{have been well}} documented. However, not many {{studies have focused on}} use of professional interpreters by dialysis <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> Non-English Speaking Background (NESB) who are in the clinical settings every second day of their lives. The underlying question for this research was to determine the level of interpreter utilisation by dialysis <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> NESB at a major urban teaching hospital. Method A multi-method approach was used involving (a) in-depth interviews of health care professionals working with dialysis patients to elicit their views regarding interpreter access and use by dialysis <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> NESB, (b) observations of interactions between staff and dialysis <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> NESB and (c) review of medical records belonging to dialysis <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> NESB who were admitted 24 months prior to the study. Results Interviews revealed that only 50 % of Health Care Workers (HCWs) had accessed an interpreter for dialysis <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> NESB over a period of six months. Observations <b>of</b> staff/NESB <b>patient</b> interactions showed that professional interpreters were used in only 25 % of the observed occasions. The review of medical records revealed that {{there was no evidence of}} interpreter use in 32 % of the records belonging to dialysis <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> NESB. The study also showed that non-compliance with dialysis treatment regime was more likely to occur among patients who had limited access to interpreters.

40|$|Objective and Methods: This trial {{investigates the}} role of {{drainage}} {{in the prevention of}} complications after elective colorectal resections. Many surgeons continue to place a prophylactic drain after completion of a colorectal anastomosis, despite considerable evidence that this practice may not be useful. Between August 2000 and March 2002, 40 patients (13 men and 27 women), mean age 60, 98 years, with either carcinoma, benign tumor, diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon, or another disorder located from the right colon to the rectum were not randomized to undergo either drainage (n= 20) with easy-flow-drains or no drainage (n= 20). The <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the both groups were examined about their postoperative course. Drain-related complications include those possibly benefiting from drainage (leakage,intra-abdominal infection, bleeding) and those possibly caused by drainage (wound infection, hernia, intestinal obstruction, fistula) has been questioned. Results: There were 4 patients with fever in the drainage group (dg) and one patient in the non-drainage group (ndg). In the ndg the patients have higher leukocytes. The average loss of weight was 5, 4 % in ndg and 3, 52 % in dg, there was a significant difference. The <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the ndg could be discharged earlier on average than the <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the dg (14, 25 vs 14, 85 days). 20 <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the dg and 16 <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the ndg showed hyponatremia. 3 <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the dg showed hypernatremia. Also there were fewer hyper-/hypokalemias in <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> ndg compared to <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the dg. (hyperkalemia 3 patients vs. 4 patients, hypokalemia 7 patients vs. 9 patients). Those differences were statistically significant. 15 patients had postoperative complications, the most <b>of</b> these <b>patients</b> had secondary illnesses. Nausea was found in 10 <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the dg and in 3 <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the ndg. 3 <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the dg and 2 <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the ndg were vomiting. During this trial examination it was no relaparatomy needed. The ultrasonographic detection showed that 30 % dg patients and 25 % ndg patients have intraabdominal fluid. The first flatus in the dg was after 4, 8 days and in the ndg after 4, 15 days. The dg patients had fewer subjective pain than the <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the ndg. On average the drains removed after 7, 53 days with an average fluid volume of 497, 06 ml. Conclusions: In conclusion, we have been unable to demonstrate any advantage for the use of prophylactic drains following colonic anastomosis. There were no differences in the incidence of postoperative complications in the two groups. This prospective, not randomized trial showed that there is no advantage in inserting prophylactic drains after colonic anastomoses and their routine use needs to be reconsidered...|$|R
