5|$|In 1958 Poulenc {{embarked}} on a collaboration with his old friend Cocteau, in an operatic version of the latter's 1930 monodrama La Voix humaine. The work was produced in February 1959 at the Opéra-Comique, under Cocteau's direction, with Duval as the tragic deserted woman speaking to her former lover by telephone. In May Poulenc's 60th birthday was marked, a few months late, by his last concert with Bernac before the latter's retirement from <b>public</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E
5|$|In spring 1949 {{he wrote}} his Cello Sonata in C, Op. 119, for the 22-year-old Mstislav Rostropovich, who gave the first {{performance}} in 1950, with Sviatoslav Richter. For Rostropovich, Prokofiev also extensively recomposed his Cello Concerto, transforming it into a Symphony-Concerto, his last major masterpiece and a landmark in the cello and orchestra repertory today. The last <b>public</b> <b>performance</b> he attended was the première of the Seventh Symphony in 1952. The music was written for the Children's Radio Division.|$|E

They were known for incorporating various styles of music into their DJ sets at that time.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the <b>public</b> <b>performance,</b> L'Estrange {{undertook}} {{the crossing}} for a select audience {{including members of}} the press. That crossing was a success, and was well reviewed in the papers, no doubt adding to the crowd's anticipation for the Saturday show.

5|$|The first <b>public</b> <b>performance</b> {{of opera}} {{in the new}} theatre took place on 26 January 1793, the dispute with the Lord Chamberlain over the licence having been settled.

5|$|Bonstelle's mother, who {{herself had}} wanted to be an actress, home-schooled her in reading, writing, singing, dancing, and even in reciting Shakespeare. Jessie's first <b>public</b> <b>performance</b> was singing temperance songs in church at the age of two years. Helen gave her {{daughter}} a passion for acting by often taking her to theaters in nearby Rochester. Around the age of ten Jessie auditioned for critic Thomas Keane, and with his encouragement she left on tour with a production of Bertha, the Beautiful Sewing Machine Girl, a melodrama. After returning home from California she briefly studied at Nazareth Academy, a convent school in Rochester. In 1886 she returned to the stage, working for local opera house owner Edward D. Stair and touring in his productions.|$|E

5|$|Different factions {{may have}} {{existed in the}} royal court. The k'uhul ahaw and his {{household}} would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, <b>public</b> <b>performance</b> was vital. Such performances included ritual dances, presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 {{the pianist}} {{reformed}} his quintet with Konitz and Marsh for a two-month engagement at the Half Note and more performances in Canada. The quartet, missing Konitz, played in Toronto {{again in the}} following year. Tristano played on occasion at the Half Note Club until the mid-1960s, and toured Europe in 1965. His European tour was mainly as a solo pianist, and the playing was {{in the style of}} his The New Tristano recordings. He performed with Ind and others in concerts in the UK in 1968; they were well received, and Tristano returned the following year. His last <b>public</b> <b>performance</b> in the US was in 1968.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, Streep was {{president}} of the main competition jury at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival.

For her performance, Streep won the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in a Comedy, and received Academy Award, Golden Globe, SAG and BAFTA nominations.|$|E

5|$|Once Tchaikovsky {{graduated}} in 1865, Rubinstein's brother Nikolai offered him {{the post of}} Professor of Music Theory at the soon-to-open Moscow Conservatory. While the salary for his professorship was only 50 rubles a month, the offer itself boosted Tchaikovsky's morale and he accepted the post eagerly. He was further heartened by news of the first <b>public</b> <b>performance</b> {{of one of his}} works, his Characteristic Dances, conducted by Johann Strauss II at a concert in Pavlovsk Park on 11 September 1865 (Tchaikovsky later included this work, re-titled, Dances of the Hay Maidens, in his opera The Voyevoda).|$|E

5|$|Smetana was {{naturally}} gifted as a composer, {{and gave}} his first <b>public</b> <b>performance</b> {{at the age of}} 6. After conventional schooling, he studied music under Josef Proksch in Prague. His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising, in which he briefly participated. After failing to establish his career in Prague, he left for Sweden, where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in Gothenburg, and began to write large-scale orchestral works. During this period of his life Smetana was twice married; of six daughters, three died in infancy.|$|E
5|$|The Philippine Constabulary Band {{was formed}} on {{the orders of}} Colonel Henry Allen, the first chief of the Philippine Constabulary. Walter Loving, a former United States Army regimental band leader who had been educated at the New England Conservatory of Music, {{successfully}} applied for the directorship of the new organization which saw its first <b>public</b> <b>performance</b> in late 1902 at the Manila Elks Club. The band's first members were recruited by Loving from community ensembles that performed in the small towns of Luzon, {{some of whom were}} former musicians in Spanish Army bands. Auditions for the ensemble were fierce; 300 clarinetists, for instance, tried out for just eight billets.|$|E
5|$|Visual art study {{begins with}} drawing and {{painting}} and then advances to more complex techniques such as sculpture, stained glass, architecture, photography, and pottery. Students learn {{in a variety of}} media, including watercolor, oil pastels, charcoal, and clay. Music study begins in the early childhood program. As they progress, Avery Coonley students participate in vocal music, playing Orff instruments and recorders, dancing, and <b>public</b> <b>performance.</b> In middle school, students develop music literacy by reading and writing music, playing choir chimes, and choral singing. The study of music in culture and the history of jazz and opera are taught alongside theory and performance.|$|E
