But, for fluoropolymers, the situation is 10 different since iodine transfer polymerization of fluoroalkenes led to commercially available thermoplastic 11 elastomers as soon as 1984. Abrowse or CRPof fluorinated monomers is presented and is classified into three 12 families: (i) the CRP of fluorine-containing styrenic monomers mainly occur from nitroxide-mediated 13 polymerization (NMP) or by atom radical transfer polymerization (ATRP); (ii) that of fluorinated 14 (meth) acrylic monomers from NMP, ATRP, and {{in the presence of}} iniferters; and finally (iii) fluoroalkenes 15 (which is a real challenge since these monomers are gaseous) can be (co) polymerized by iodine transfer poly- 16 merization or by processes that required either borinates or xanthates (MADIX). Apeculiar interest lies in the 17 CR copolymerization of fluoroalkenes with other comonomers (such as vinylidene fluoride, chlorotri- 18 fluoroethylene, 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropene, hexafluoropropylene, <b>perfluoromethyl</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether,</b> orR-trifluoromethacrylic 19 acid) in the presence of either xanthates, borinates, or iodo compounds.

The copolymer compositions, the molecular weights and end-groups of these random-type copolymers were assessed by means of 19 F NMR spectroscopy. Model molecules containing only one PMVE unit were synthesized by the radical addition of different CTAs (ICl, ICF 2 I, CF 3 I) onto PMVE to help in the assignments by 19 F NMR spectroscopy of the characteristic signals of the end group, i. e. -CF 2 CF(OCF 3) I and -CF(OCF 3) CF 2 I. Indeed, only -CH 2 CF 2 -I (major amount) and -CF 2 CH 2 -I end-groups of these poly(VDF-co-PMVE) copolymers were noted showing the high reactivity of PMVE-I in the iodine transfer polymerization of VDF. The CTA concentration enabled one to control the molecular weights of the resulting telechelic diiodo-poly(VDF-co-PMVE) copolymers ranging from 1, 000 to 18, 000 g mol- 1 (assessed by 19 F NMR), produced for the first time. It was also noted that the higher the molar masses, the higher the amount of -CF 2 CH 2 -I end-group. The controlled behavior of that polymerization was also evidenced by the absence of the reversed -CH 2 CF 2 -CF 2 CH 2 - VDF dyads, narrow polydispersity indices (< 1. 75), and by the linear “molar mass versus monomer conversions” relationship. Finally, the thermal properties, i. e. the glass transition temperatures (Tg) and degradation temperatures, of these copolymers were assessed and were found to depend on the molecular weights and on the monomer composition of the copolymers. These fluoroelastomers had Tgs ranging from - 63 to - 35 oC according to their molecular weights and the contents of both comonomers, with decomposition temperatures greater than 250 oC under air...|$|E

The carbocationic polymer end generated by polymerization of isobutyl <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> was effectively trapped by various nucleophiles such as trimethyl(1 -phenylvinyloxy) silane and allyltrimethylsilane to give polymers with very narrow molecular weight distribution.
