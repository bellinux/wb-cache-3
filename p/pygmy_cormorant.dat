25|$|Ada is {{also the}} {{wintering}} ground for some threatened migratory birds, most notably the <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorant</b> which winters in Belgrade in large numbers. <b>Pygmy</b> <b>cormorant</b> inhabited the Pančevački Rit marshland, just north of Belgrade, in the early 20th century, but after that area was drained and urbanized, they disappeared. Several hundreds of birds in the early 1990s began spending winters on the Malo Ratno Ostrvo, in the Danube. When their number exceeded 1,000, they resettled to three new locations: first at the willow grove on the Sava's bank (Belgrade Fair) {{and then to the}} area near the tip of Ada and the neighboring Mala Ciganlija. Their number rose every year to 6,750 in 2007/08, but since then is generally reducing and in 2015 it was 3,850 which is still 5,4% of the European and 2% of the world's <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorant</b> population. There were concerns that the building of the new Ada Bridge in 2008-12 would disturb the habitat, but the birds endured it well. Their habitat was protected by law in 2008.

Many of these species are endangered, {{which was one of}} the primary factors considered when placing the delta under national protection. Some of the more common bird species observed here include <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorants</b> (Microcarbo pygmeus), little egrets (Egretta garzetta), lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni), Kentish plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus), white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla), and the Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus), for which the park is a key nesting place. Marine life consists of species typical of the Aegean Sea, as well as some species usually found elsewhere.|$|R

50|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorant</b> {{occupies}} an {{area from}} the south-east of Europe (east of Italy) and south-west of Asia, in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The largest distribution is in south-east Europe, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, the Balkan countries, Turkey, Cyprus, Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Israel, Syria. In Romania, according to studies of Czech ornithologist Robert Ritter von Dombrowski, {{at the end of}} the 19th century, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorant</b> was present in large colonies in the Danube Delta, Brăila and Ialomița Pond, on Vederoasa Lake (Constanța County), on certain pools and ponds with reeds and willows in Muntenia. The number of <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorant</b> pairs was 10,000 without taking in account the breeding population of the Danube Delta. Populations of <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorant</b> in Romania have dramatically declined, especially in 1960 when, due to the communist agricultural policies, the Great Brăila Island and important parts of Ialomiţa Pond were drained in order to practice agriculture, so the habitats of a great number of aquatic birds were destroyed. The <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorant</b> can be found in the Danube Delta, Jijia Largă Pond (Iasi County), probably on Maţa, Rădeanu, Vădeni Ponds (in Galați County), Cârja Pond (Vaslui County), at Vlădeşti on Prut River (Galați County), on Calinovăţ Island from Caraș-Severin County, on Small Brăila Island, on Dunăreni Pond (Mârleanu, Constanța County), in Danubian Plain on Parches Pond-Somova (Tulcea County). At the global scale, it was estimated that the entire population of pygmy cormorants is 85,000-180,000 individuals (a study effectuated by Wetlands International in 2006) and 74-94% of total population lives in Europe. The biggest colony is in the Danube Delta, numbering 4,000 pairs, but this seems certain to plunge due to a massive canalization scheme, which despite the protected status of the delta, commenced in May 2004. According to a study made by BirdLife International in 2004, it was estimated that population of <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorant</b> in Romania was 11,500-14,000 pairs and during the winter 1,500-4,000 pairs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pygmy</b> <b>cormorants</b> like pools {{with plenty}} of vegetation, lakes and river deltas. They avoid mountainous and cold and dry areas. They love rice fields or other flooded areas where trees and shrubs can be found. During winter they also go to waters with higher salinity, in {{estuaries}} or on barrier lakes. These are birds who can live alone or in groups and they have adapted to human presence. They build nests from sticks and reeds in dense vegetation, in trees, shrubs, willows but occasionally in reeds on small floating islets. At the end of May, beginning of June, both parents incubate for 27-30 days, and nestlings become independent after 70 days. The young are fed by their parents with small fish and other aquatic animals. This bird frequently shares {{the same type of}} habitat with egrets, herons and spoonbills.|$|R
50|$|The little {{cormorant}} {{is about}} 50 cm long and only slightly {{smaller than the}} Indian cormorant (Phalacrocorax fuscicollis). The Indian cormorant has a narrower and longer bill which ends in a prominent hook tip, blue iris and a more pointed head profile. The breeding adult bird has a glistening all black plumage with some white spots and filoplumes on the face. There is also a short crest {{on the back of}} the head. The eyes, gular skin and face are dark. In the non-breeding bird or juvenile, the plumage is brownish and the bill and gular skin can appear more fleshy. The crest becomes inconspicuous and a small and well-marked white patch on the throat is sometimes visible. Towards the west of the Indus River valley, its range can overlap with vagrant <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorants</b> (Microcarbo pygmaeus), which can be difficult to differentiate in the field and are sometimes even considered conspecific. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field, but males tend to be larger. Some abnormal silvery-grey plumages have been described.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{occupying a}} {{relatively}} small area, 265 bird species have been observed in the protected area Poda. 46 bird species nest {{in the area and}} it is the only location on the Black Sea Coast with a mixed heron breeding colony of spoonbill, glossy ibis, purple heron, grey heron, night heron, great white egret and little egret. Other species breeding in the area are marsh harriers, common terns and little terns, and great cormorants - which have forsaken their usual breeding sites in reed beds and made their nests in the abandoned electrical pylons in the area. Its rich biodiversity is attributed to the three different types of water habitats it contains - brackish, fresh, and hyper-saline salt water. During the winter months in the bay at Poda, <b>pygmy</b> <b>cormorants,</b> a globally endangered species, rest at Poda. Other endangered species in the area at this time are Dalmatian pelicans and white-headed ducks. They share the bay with thousands of coots, pochards, and other ducks. Poda is located along Europe's second largest bird migration route, the Via Pontica. Annually, 75% of the European white stork population (over 250,000), 100% of the white pelican population (over 40,000) and thousands of raptors, waterfowl and song birds can be observed during the months of migration in March-April and August-September.|$|R

The most frequently ringed species were Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla and Great Tit Parus major. In ringed nestlings, Great Tits and Tree Sparrows Passer montanus predominated.

Concerning recoveries of birds ringed in Slovenia and later recorded abroad and birds ringed abroad and later recorded in Slovenia, the commonest were Mute Swans Cygnus olor and Black-headed Gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus.

Among the interesting finds were also the first finds of ringed <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Cormorants</b> Microcarbo pygmeus so far from breeding sites in Hungary. Among rare species, Yellow-browed Warbler Phylloscopus inornatus, Spanish Sparrow Passer hispaniolensis and a pair of Parrot Crossbills Loxia pytyopsittacus were caught and ringed, the latter {{for the very first time}} in Slovenia after more than 100 years. An overview of records of the Parrot Crossbill is given herein, as well as analysis of irruptive years of the Red Crossbills Loxia curvirostra between 1980 and 2015, when the probability of boreal Crossbill species occurrence is the highest. According to the ringers’ data, the irruptive years of Red Crossbills in Slovenia were 1984, 1985, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The article points to the probability that Parrot Crossbills have been overlooked in the past, since larger specimens of Crossbills were ringed mostly in irruptive years, but no specific bill measurements important for distinguishing between Parrot and Red Crossbill had been taken...|$|R
