5|$|Domesday {{makes it}} obvious that Urse {{was the most}} {{powerful}} layman in Worcester, and the only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> contest his power in the county was the Bishop of Worcester. The power struggle continued into the 12th century, as Urse's descendants still contested the bishops. Only one other layman is recorded as having a castle in Worcestershire in Domesday, and he held much less land than Urse.|$|E
5|$|During {{his career}} in Wisconsin, Kindt was {{considered}} to be the team's best all-around player, a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> run, throw, and kick efficiently, as well as playing defense. He also punted and played safety for Wisconsin. Kindt was named to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1988 and the University of Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Wilder's agent {{sent him}} a script for a film called Super Chief. Wilder accepted, but told the film's {{producers}} that he thought the only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> keep the film from being offensive was Richard Pryor. Pryor accepted the role in the film, which had been renamed Silver Streak, the first film to team Wilder and Pryor. They became Hollywood's first successful interracial movie comedy duo.|$|E

The purpose {{of the project was}} to provide machine-readable economic and social history statistics relating to the whole of Ireland for the period 1821 - 1971. Further information about the project is available on the QUB Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis website. Main Topics : The main tables are: Total number of <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> read and write, read only, or neither read nor write, grouped by baronies and gender (1841 - 1861). Total number of <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> read and write, read only, or neither read nor write, grouped by counties, gender and age groups (1841, 1901 - 1911). Total number of <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> read and write, read only, or neither read nor write, grouped by counties and gender (1851 - 1861). Total number of <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> read and write, read only, or neither read nor write, grouped by counties, gender, age groups and religion (1871 - 1891). Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|R

5|$|Originally, the {{compensation}} total offered to survivors was $7 million, which aroused controversy. The legislature eventually settled on $1.5 million: this would enable payment of $150,000 to each <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> prove {{he or she}} lived in Rosewood during 1923, and provide a $500,000 pool for people who could apply for the funds after demonstrating that they had an ancestor who owned property in Rosewood during the same time. The four survivors who testified automatically qualified; four others had to apply. More than 400 applications were received from around the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the book was terminated by Bernoulli's death in 1705; thus the book is essentially incomplete when compared with Bernoulli's original vision. The quarrel with his younger brother Johann, who was the most competent <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> have fulfilled Jacob's project, prevented Johann {{to get hold of}} the manuscript. Jacob's own children were not mathematicians and were not up to the task of editing and publishing the manuscript. Finally Jacob's nephew Niklaus, 7 years after Jacob's death in 1705, managed to publish the manuscript in 1713.|$|E
5|$|She {{was known}} for her honesty and {{moderate}} life style. Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 {{as soon as she}} began earning her keep. She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. She and her husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not be corrupted by fame.|$|E
50|$|Justice Scalia wrote a {{dissenting opinion}} {{asserting that the}} fact the statute {{differentiated}} between 'any person' (in defining the class of <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> file {{a complaint with the}} FEC over a violation) and 'any party aggrieved' (in defining the class of <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> bring suit in federal court over the FEC's decision on the complaint) demonstrated the limiting force of the latter provision - anyone could file a complaint with the FEC if they believed a violation had occurred, but only parties who had actually been aggrieved (suffered a particularized injury) {{as a result of the}} FEC's decision on the complaint could sue.|$|R
5000|$|A Keweenaw County jury acquitted a woman, {{one of two}} <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> be {{identified}} {{among a group of}} individuals who beat Alfred Anderson, an employee of the Ahmeek mine, so badly that his recovery was in doubt for a time.|$|R

5|$|The {{compensation}} package {{led to the}} Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA), {{announced on}} May 8, 2006, and implemented in September 2007. At the time, there were about 86,000 living victims. The IRSSA included funding for the AHF, for commemoration, for health support, and for a Truth and Reconciliation program, {{as well as an}} individual Common Experience Payment (CEP). Any <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> be verified as having resided at a federally run Indian residential school in Canada was entitled to a CEP. The amount of compensation was {{based on the number of}} years a particular former student resided at the residential schools: $10,000 for the first year attended (from one night residing there to a full school year) plus $3,000 for every year thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Vijay is {{admitted}} to hospital, where Dr.Ashok Gilwani gives him scars identical to Don's. When Don suddenly dies, the masquerade begins. Vijay, as Don, joins the gang in Kuala Lumpur. DeSilva asks Vijay {{to find a}} computer disc containing details about the cartel {{and bring it to}} him. When Vijay finds it, Roma attempts to kill him, but DeSilva tells her about his plan, and she agrees to help him. Vijay hands over the disc to DeSilva. When DeSilva murders Singhania, the police arrive and arrest Vijay. DeSilva is killed in the shoot-out, which is unfortunate for Vijay because DeSilva was the only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> prove that he is not the real Don. Having discovered his true identity, Don's associates turn against Vijay and the group engage in a fight. Vijay escapes and reconciles with Roma to recover the disc and prove his innocence.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the {{pressure}} on Stephen to get Eustace confirmed as his legitimate heir continued to grow. The King gave Eustace the County of Boulogne in 1147, but it remained unclear whether Eustace would inherit England. Stephen's preferred option was to have Eustace crowned while he himself was still alive, as was the custom in France, {{but this was not}} the normal practice in England, and Celestine II, during his brief tenure as pope between 1143 and 1144, had banned any change to this practice. Since the only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> crown Eustace was Archbishop Theobald, who refused to do so without agreement from the current pope, Eugene III, the matter reached an impasse. At the end of 1148, Stephen and Theobald came to a temporary compromise that allowed Theobald to return to England. Theobald was appointed a papal legate in 1151, adding to his authority. Stephen then made a fresh attempt to have Eustace crowned at Easter 1152, gathering his nobles to swear fealty to Eustace, and then insisting that Theobald and his bishops anoint him king. When Theobald refused yet again, Stephen and Eustace imprisoned both him and the bishops and refused to release them unless they agreed to crown Eustace. Theobald escaped again into temporary exile in Flanders, pursued to the coast by Stephen's knights, marking a low point in Stephen's relationship with the church.|$|E

25|$|At {{around this}} time, the British head of Palestine’s Criminal Investigation Division told an American {{military}} attaché that the Mufti {{might be the}} only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> unite the Palestinian Arabs and 'cool off the Zionists'.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{confusion}} {{appears to be a}} result of misapplying PVHO (pressure vessel for human occupancy) guidelines which prescribe a maximum ambient oxygen content of 25% when a human is sealed into a pressure vessel (chamber). The concern here is for a fire hazard to a living <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> be trapped in an oxygen-rich burning environment.|$|E
25|$|Neither Charles nor Henry had male {{issue and}} the Shelburne title passed to Anne's son John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne, who took his mother's surname, and whose {{descendants}} hold the title Marquis of Lansdowne.

50|$|Subsequently, {{the flow}} of Cubans to the United States fluctuated, due to both the {{domestic}} situation in the 40s and 50s in Cuba, and U.S. immigration policies, plus intermittent anti-immigrant sentiment. Cuban migration in those years included <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> afford {{to leave the country}} and live abroad.|$|R

25|$|The {{wealth and}} {{properties}} of Bhumibol and {{the royal family}} are managed by the Privy Purse. The CPB manages {{the assets of the}} Crown as an institution. It was established by law, but is directed without the involvement of the Thai Government and reports only to the king. The CPB receives many state privileges. Although the Minister of Finance presides over the CPB's Board of Directors, final decisions were made solely by Bhumibol. During his lifetime Bhumibol was the only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> view the CPB's annual report, which was not released to the public.|$|E
25|$|Nina {{decided that}} it was time she re-discovered her lost {{memories}} and {{came to the conclusion that}} the only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> help her was her sister, Anna Williams. Anna meets with Nina soon after. However, Nina's memories and hatred instinctively returned, and they rapidly engaged in a gun battle. The duel lasted for days and the two later agreed to meet at The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 and finish their battle. The two promised that only one would walk away from the coming battle, however, when Nina won, she refused to take Anna's life as their fight was not satisfactory.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there was}} some {{criticism}} in the final evaluations of her performance as governor general, mostly for a perceived aloofness and sense of self-importance—which her closing of the Rideau Hall estate to the public came to symbolise—Sauvé was also described as having been elegant, charming, and a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> mingle well with common Canadians—especially children—while also maintaining {{a sense of the}} dignity of state. She was said to have enjoyed both entertaining and ceremony, two necessary parts {{of the role of the}} Queen's representative. However, she was pointed out unfavourably by Canadian monarchists for her republican attitudes, as illustrated in her stated opinion that the monarchy should be abolished.|$|E
50|$|In 1909, as {{president}} of the Aero Club of America, Bishop offered a $250 prize to the first four <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> fly one kilometer.

25|$|Smith and Black {{had argued}} that at the very least, the Court should only uphold Oregon's ban on peyote as applied to them if Oregon had a {{compelling}} interest in prohibiting their religious use of peyote. The Court had invalidated three other unemployment compensation restrictions under this standard. But those other restrictions themselves required consideration of individualized circumstances, such as when unemployment compensation was denied to a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not, for religious reasons, work on Saturdays. If a state has in place a system of individualized consideration, the constitution did not allow the state to refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without a compelling reason.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} the {{potential}} for a substantial harm to occur that is permanent in nature, such as the execution of a death penalty or the deportation of a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> face torture, then the author of the complaint can request that it be greeted with Urgency. Cases such as these are covered by Rule 86 of the Committee's Rules of Procedure. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur on New Communications can issue 'interim measures' in order to prevent the harm occurring while the complaint is being considered. The Committee views any failure by the State to adhere by these interim measures a breach of their obligations under the First Optional Protocol.|$|E
25|$|Puyi's wet nurse, Wang Wen-Chao, was {{the only}} one who could console him, and {{therefore}} she accompanied him to the Forbidden City. Puyi did not see his biological mother, Princess Consort Chun, for the next seven years. He developed a special bond with Wen-Chao Wang and credited her with being the only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> control him. She was sent away when he was eight years old. After Puyi married, he would occasionally bring her to the Forbidden City, and later Manchukuo, to visit him. After his special government pardon in 1959, he visited her adopted son and only then learned of her personal sacrifices to be his nurse.|$|E
