5000|$|In {{classical}} {{statistical mechanics}} (continuous energies) {{the concept of}} phase space provides a classical analog to the partition function (sum over states) known as the <b>phase</b> <b>integral.</b> [...] Instead of summing the Boltzmann factor over discretely spaced energy states (defined byappropriate integer quantum numbers for each degree of freedom) one may integrate over continuous phase space. Such integration essentially consists of two parts: integration of the momentum component of all degrees of freedom (momentum space) and integration of the position component of all degrees of freedom (configuration space). Once the <b>phase</b> <b>integral</b> is known, it {{may be related to}} the classical partition function by multiplication of a normalization constant representing the number of quantum energy states per unit phase space.

A very powerful method of analysis is that of <b>Phase</b> <b>Integrals,</b> described by Heading. Key to this analysis are the Stokes constants and the rules for analytic continuation of an asymptotic solution through the complex plane.

However, with the conventional approach of using the next-to-lowest (third) order correction to the integrand in the <b>phase</b> <b>integral</b> as a platform for calculating higher (fifth, seventh, ninth, [...] .) order corrections, the higher-order calculations very often become quite complicated.

40|$|We study spin {{tunneling}} in magnetic molecules, {{with special}} reference to Fe 8. The article aims {{to give a}} pedagogical discussion of {{what is meant by}} the tunneling of a spin, and how tunneling amplitudes or energy level splittings may be calculated using path integral and discrete <b>phase</b> <b>integral</b> methods. In the case of Fe 8, an issue of great interest is the oscillatory tunnel splittings as a function of applied magnetic field that have recently been observed. These oscillations are due to the occurrence of diabolical points in the magnetic field space. It is shown how this effect comes about in both the path-integral and the discrete <b>phase</b> <b>integral</b> methods. In the former it arises due to the presence of a Berry-like phase in the action, which gives rise to an interference between tunneling trajectories. In the latter, it arises due to the presence of further neighbor terms in the recursion relation for the energy eigenfunction. These terms give rise to turning points which have no analog in the one-dimensional continuum quasiclassical method. Explicit results are obtained for the location of the diabolical points in Fe 8.

40|$|Volatile {{transport}} {{of carbon dioxide}} is most relevant on two planetary bodies in our solar system: Mars and Iapetus. We experimentally measured the sublimation rate of CO 2 ice under simulated martian conditions and developed a model based on our experimental results. We experimentally verified that solar irradiance is the primary control for the sublimation of CO 2 ice on the martian poles {{with the amount of}} radiation striking the surface being controlled by variations in the optical depth, ensuring the formation and sublimation of the seasonal cap. Our model, supported by comparison of MGS-MOC and MRO-HiRISE images, shows that ~ 0. 4 m is currently being lost from the south perennial cap per martian year. In order to build a similar model for Iapetus, one key parameter was needed: the bolometric Bond albedo. We used photometry of Cassini VIMS observations of Iapetus to produce the first <b>phase</b> <b>integrals</b> calculated directly from solar phase curves of Iapetus for the leading hemisphere and to estimate the <b>phase</b> <b>integrals</b> for the trailing hemisphere. Our <b>phase</b> <b>integrals,</b> which are lower than previous results, have profound implications for the analyses of the energy balance and volatile transport on this icy satellite. We also utilized Cassini VIMS and ISS and Voyager ISS observations of Iapetus to produce the first bolometric Bond albedo map of Iapetus; the average albedo values for the leading and trailing hemispheres are 0. 25 ± 0. 03 and 0. 05 ± 0. 01 respectively. On Iapetus, which has no detectable atmosphere, any carbon dioxide sublimating from the dark material, where it was discovered by reflectance spectroscopy, would either escape the body or migrate on ballistic trajectories to a possible polar cold trap. However, through proof by contradiction, we show that if dry ice {{is the source of the}} detected signal in the dark material, it produces an impossible scenario where an extensive polar cap is produced along with incorrect temperatures for the dark material at equatorial latitudes.
