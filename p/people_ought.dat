5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
25|$|Many views value unity as a good: to {{go beyond}} eudaimonia by saying that an {{individual}} person's flourishing is valuable only {{as a means to}} the flourishing of society as a whole. In other words, a single person's life is, ultimately, not important or worthwhile in itself, but is good only as a means to the success of society as a whole. Some elements of Confucianism are an example of this, encouraging the view that <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> to conform as individuals to demands of a peaceful and ordered society.|$|E

He applied to an advanced position in government through court examination. His discourse included ideas from Confucianism, administrative philosophy (Chinese Legalism) and Mohism; namely, that capable <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> to be employed in positions that match their talents (Mohism and Shen Buhai); secondly, encouraging high standards of morality, harmonious relationships, and employing moral persons (Confucianism and Mohism); and that common people should be allowed opportunity for farming while discouraging useless articles (Mohism and Shang Yang).|$|E

25|$|It is usual to {{say that}} Mill is {{committing}} a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the naturalistic fallacy, because {{he is trying to}} deduce what <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> to do from what they in fact do; the fallacy of equivocation, because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and the fallacy of composition, because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.|$|E

500|$|Motion {{describes}} the Coleman poems as [...] "a world of comfortless jealousies, breathless bike-rides and deathless crushes", mixing elements from writers and poets such as Angela Brazil, Richmal Crompton, John Betjeman and W.H. Auden. Larkin's own attitude to these poems appears equivocal. He expresses pleasure that his friend Bruce Montgomery liked them, especially [...] "The School in August". However, to Amis he writes: [...] "I think all wrong-thinking <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> to like them. I {{used to write}} them whenever I'd seen any particularly ripe schoolgirl... Writing about grown women is less perverse and therefore less satisfying". Booth finds the poems the most impressive of all the Coleman works, in their evidence of Larkin's early ability to create striking and moving images from conventional school story clichés. They are an early demonstration of Larkin's talent for finding depths in ordinariness, an ability that characterised many of his later poems. Booth draws specific attention to the elegiac quality of the final lines of [...] "The School in August": [...] "And even swimming groups can fade / Games mistresses turn grey". In Booth's view the Coleman poems {{are among the best}} Larkin wrote in the 1940s, well beyond anything in his first published selection The North Ship (1945).|$|E

The American Colonization Society formed in 1816 {{to address the issue}} of free African Americans through resettlement abroad. By 1860, the ACS had settled thousands of Africans in Liberia. But colonization was slow and unappealing to many, and as mass emancipation loomed there was no clear understanding of what might happen to millions of soon-to-be-free blacks.

2500|$|Leftist {{economic}} beliefs {{range from}} Keynesian economics and {{the welfare state}} through industrial democracy and the social market to nationalization {{of the economy and}} central planning, to the anarcho-syndicalist advocacy of a council- and assembly-based self-managed anarchist communism. During the industrial revolution, leftists supported trade unions. At the beginning of the 20th century, many leftists advocated strong government intervention in the economy. Leftists continue to criticize what they perceive as the exploitative nature of globalization, the [...] "race to the bottom" [...] and unjust lay-offs. In {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, the belief that government (ruling in accordance with the interests of the <b>people)</b> <b>ought</b> to be directly involved in the day-to-day workings of an economy declined in popularity amongst the center-left, especially social democrats who became influenced by [...] "Third Way" [...] ideology.|$|E

2500|$|Judge Willis {{frequently}} {{referred to}} the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Aborigines throughout his judgment.

He also quoted from the submission of the Attorney-General of New South Wales Saxe Bannister, who had argued that the customary laws of the Aboriginal <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> to be studied and recorded, so that they could be followed and respected by the colonial courts in appropriate cases. From these and other opinions, the Judge concluded, it was evident that the Aboriginal people had their own legal system, and that treaties ought to be made with them.|$|E
2500|$|The Discovery Institute aggressively {{promotes}} its Teach the Controversy {{campaign and}} intelligent design to the public, education officials and public policymakers.

[...] As a measure of their success in this effort, on 1 August 2005, during a round-table interview with reporters from five Texas newspapers, President Bush said that he believes schools should discuss intelligent design alongside evolution when teaching students {{about the origin of}} life. Bush, a conservative Christian, declined to go into detail on his personal views of the origin of life, but advocated the Teach the Controversy approach - [...] "I think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought... you're asking me whether or not <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes." [...] Christian conservatives, a substantial part of Bush's voting base, have been central in promoting the Teach the Controversy campaign.|$|E
2500|$|At his trial, Servetus was {{condemned}} on two counts, for spreading and preaching Nontrinitarianism, specifically, Modalistic Monarchianism, or Sabellianism, and anti-paedobaptism (anti-infant baptism). Of paedobaptism Servetus had said, [...] "It is an {{invention of the}} devil, an infernal falsity {{for the destruction of}} all Christianity." [...] In the case the procureur général (chief public prosecutor) added some curious-sounding accusations in the form of inquiries—the most odd-sounding perhaps being, [...] "whether he has married, and if he answers that he has not, he shall be asked why, in consideration of his age, he could refrain so long from marriage." [...] To this oblique imputation about his sexuality, Servetus replied that rupture (inguinal hernia) had long since made him incapable of that particular sin. Another question was [...] "whether he did not know that his doctrine was pernicious, considering that he favours Jews and Turks, by making excuses for them, and if he has not studied the Koran in order to disprove and controvert the doctrine and religion that the Christian churches hold, together with other profane books, from which <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> to abstain in matters of religion, according to the doctrine of St. Paul." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pundits accused Dole {{of being}} a [...] "flip-flopper and a hypocrite." [...] Editorials ran in major newspapers, {{including}} The Washington Post, The New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and the Times of London, condemning Dole's action, joined by radio commentators Rush Limbaugh and Don Imus. [...] Under the pressure, Dole admitted during an October 1995 press briefing on Capitol Hill that he regretted the decision to return the check, and that his campaign was responsible for it without consulting him. [...] "I think if they'd have consulted me, we wouldn't have done that, wouldn't have returned it," [...] Dole said. Dole later told Washington Post editor and author Bob Woodward that the LCR episode was a [...] "mistake" [...] because the decision to return the check [...] "gets into Bob Dole the person.

2500|$|There {{are also}} case based {{exceptions}} to the Salomon principle, though their restrictive scope is not wholly stable. The present rule under English law is that only where a company {{was set up to}} commission fraud, or to avoid a pre-existing obligation can its separate identity be ignored. This follows from a Court of Appeal case, Adams v Cape Industries plc. A group of employees suffered asbestos diseases after working for the American wholly owned subsidiary of Cape Industries plc. They were suing in New York to make Cape Industries plc pay for the debts of the subsidiary. Under conflict of laws principles, this could only be done if Cape Industries plc was treated as [...] "present" [...] in America through its US subsidiary (i.e. ignoring the separate legal personality of the two companies). Rejecting the claim, and following the reasoning in Jones v Lipman, the Court of Appeal emphasised that the US subsidiary had been set up for a lawful purpose of creating a group structure overseas, and had not aimed to circumvent liability in the event of asbestos litigation. The potentially unjust result for tort victims, who are unable to contract around limited liability and may be left only with a worthless claim against a bankrupt entity, has been changed in Chandler v Cape plc so that a duty of care may be owed by a parent to workers of a subsidiary regardless of separated legal personality. However even though tort victims are protected, the restrictive position remains subject to criticism where a company group is involved, since {{it is not clear that}} companies and actual <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> to get the protection of limited liability in identical ways. An influential decision, although subsequently doubted strongly by the House of Lords, was passed by Lord Denning MR in DHN Ltd v Tower Hamlets BC. Here Lord Denning MR held that a group of companies, two subsidiaries wholly owned by a parent, constituted a single economic unit. Because the companies' shareholders and controlling minds were identical, their rights were to be treated as the same. This allowed the parent company to claim compensation from the council for compulsory purchase of its business, which it could not have done without showing an address on the premises that its subsidiary possessed. Similar approaches to treating corporate [...] "groups" [...] or a [...] "concern" [...] as single economic entities exist in many continental European jurisdictions. This is done for tax and accounting purposes in English law, however for general civil liability the rule still followed is that in Adams v Cape Industries plc. It is very rare for English courts to lift the veil. The liability of the company is generally attributed to the company alone.|$|E

40|$|Discrepancies between <b>people’s</b> <b>ought</b> selves {{and their}} actual selves and their ideal selves and actual selves predict the emo-tions that {{individuals}} experience. The authors predicted that internal versus external causal attributions for self-discrepancies should moderate {{the relationship between}} self-discrepancies and emotions, resulting in more refined predictions for both agitation-and dejection-related emotions and for two additional types of emotion, namely, anger-related and discontent-related emo-tions. Results of two studies generally supported the predictions that agitation-related emotions and dejection-related emotions were positively associated with actual-ought discrepancies and actual-ideal discrepancies, respectively, only when causal attri-butions for the discrepancies were internally based. Anger-related emotions and emotions of discontent were positively asso-ciated with actual-ought and actual-ideal discrepancies, respec-tively, primarily when causal attributions were externally based. Study 2, which addressed group discrepancies and group-based emotions, generally replicated the findings when group identifi-cation was high, yielding a more complex model {{of the link between}} discrepancies and emotions...|$|R
