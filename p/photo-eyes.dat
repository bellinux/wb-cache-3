5000|$|Coordinating the {{activities}} of the various material handling sub-systems {{is the role of the}} warehouse control system (WCS). The WCS directs the [...] "real-time" [...] data management and interface responsibilities of the material handling system as well as provides common user interface screens for monitoring, control, and diagnostics. As the focal point for managing the operational aspects of the material handling system, the WCS provides the critical link between the non-real time based host and the real-time MHE control system. It receives information from the upper level Host and coordinates the various real-time control devices (conveyors, print and apply applicators, etc.) to accomplish the daily workload. At each decision point, the WCS determines the most efficient routing of the product and transmits directives to the equipment controllers to achieve the desired result.At the lowest level, closest to the physical equipment, are the equipment controller(s). These controllers are typically some form of a programmable logic controller (PLC) or a dedicated, real-time PC control system. They interface to peripheral Input/Output (I/O) devices such as <b>photo-eyes</b> scanners, motors, etc. as well as data collection devices such as bar code scanners (barcode reader) and weigh scales and are responsible for the physical operation of the material handling equipment. The equipment controllers are also responsible for the physical handling of product and tracking it from point-to-point based on the direction from the upper level control systems. Typically a single controller is only concerned with the operations of a defined area or sub-system of the overall material handling system.|$|E

50|$|The {{selection}} of works {{was made by}} several well known figures including Moholy-Nagy, {{who was one of}} the selectors for European photography, and Edward Weston, who was in charge of the American section. Artists included Berenice Abbott, Willi Baumeister, Marcel Duchamp, Hein Gorny, Hannah Höch, Eugène Atget, Man Ray, Alexander Rodchenko, Edward Steichen, Imogen Cunningham, Charles Sheeler and Brett Weston, among others. The selected works were characterised by unexpected angles, such as the photographs taken by Willi Ruge from a parachute, the use of photomontage, etc. After seeing the exhibition, the critic Franz Roh wrote an essay entitled Foto-Auge (<b>Photo-eye),</b> asserting that photography had changed in a definitive manner.
