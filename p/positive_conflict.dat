A sample of 116 heterosexual married couples completed scales of relational humour use as well as conflict resolution behaviour. Behaviour of couples while attempting to resolve a relationship based conflict was also coded by independent raters. Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) analyses showed patterns of actor and partner effects for each type of humour use. Specifically, positive humour use of both partners predicted more <b>positive</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution, whereas negative humour use of both partners predicted less <b>positive</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution. Additionally, instrumental humour use of both partners seemed to predict greater apathy during conflict resolution. Implications for considering couple humor use, assessed for both partners of the dyad, for understanding relational well-being are discussed...|$|E

However, previous research has rarely examined the extent to which child symptomatology and family environment are associated with social skills and adaptability in children. Furthermore, no studies have looked at these associations longitudinally in preschool children with behavior problems, for whom social functioning may be especially important. The current study examined the relationship of five predictors (child oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), child attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), marital conflict strategies, parental depression, and parental warmth) with social skills and adaptability measured in preschoolers with behavior problems at age 3. The relationship was assessed concurrently, as it changed over time (controlling for initial starting point), and at age 6. One hundred sixty three children, mainly of European American and Puerto-Rican descent, were included. At age 3, ADHD, ODD, and maternal depression were associated with fewer social skills and lower adaptability. Paternal warmth and maternal <b>positive</b> <b>conflict</b> strategies were associated with higher social skills. Greater paternal <b>positive</b> <b>conflict</b> strategies were associated with greater improvement in social skills and adaptability from age 3 to 6. Paternal depression and paternal negative conflict strategies were associated with less improvement in adaptability. Paternal warmth was associated with greater improvement in social skills. At age 6, greater paternal <b>positive</b> <b>conflict</b> strategies were associated with higher social skills and adaptability. Maternal depression, paternal depression, and ODD were associated with lower social skills and adaptability. ADHD was associated with lower social skills and maternal negative conflict strategies were associated with lower adaptability. The findings shed light on how maternal factors, paternal factors, and child factors are related to the development of social skills and adaptability...|$|E

Conflict management behavior is studied through observed behavior and categorized by experts. Two conflict management behavior categories are differentiated: positive and negative conflict manage-ment behavior. A laboratory experiment was carried out comparing 12 groups of 4 members each, working over two communication media (6 groups FTF and 6 groups over CMC). Groups performed three types of tasks (idea-generation tasks, intellective tasks, and mixed-motive tasks) during weekly sessions over a 2 -month period. Results obtained for the idea-generation task show that negative conflict management is significantly higher in CMC than in FTF. For the groups working on intellective tasks, <b>positive</b> <b>conflict</b> management is signifi-cantly higher in FTF than in CMC. Conversely, negative conflict management is signifi-cantly higher in CMC than in FTF. No significant differences appear in positive or in nega-tive conflict management on the mixed-motive task.

John Gottman has claimed that he has developed a concept that can buffer children from the negative effects of marital distress. The concept is emotion coachin g (EC), which teaches children about emotions. emotion regulation. and effective problem-solving. Children who are emotion coached have better out comes regardless of level of marital di stress. Gottman also claims that emotion coaching parents report higher marital satisfaction and tend to score higher in <b>positive</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution styles and lower in negative conflict resolution styles. This study set out to test Gottman 2 ̆ 7 s concepts of EC and emotion dismissing (ED) and their relationships with marital satisfaction and marital conflict. In addition, this study explored the relationships between marital conflict and marital satisfaction. Lastly, this study set out to use a se lf- report instrument to measure EC and ED, the Maternal Emotional Style Questionnaire (MESQ: Legace-Seguin, 200 I). Unfortunately, the MESQ in this study d id not have adequate reliability to answer the questions of how EC and ED were related to marital satisfaction and marital conflict. However, results were reported for relationships between marital conflict, marital satisfaction. and demographic variables. Results suggest that when one uses one negative way o f resolving conflict, one is likely to use other negative strategies.

Furthermore, several studies examined variables that mediate the relationship between diversity and team learning.

Topologies of trees resulting from the combined analyses of the two ribosomal genes generally show no <b>positive</b> <b>conflicts</b> with those obtained from separate analyses. We show that termitophilic fungi constitute a strongly supported monophyletic group within lyophylloid species. The genera Sinotermitomyces and Podabrella are derived within Termitomyces, and do not form monophyletic groups. Identical sequences were frequently found among samples of basidiomes from the same continents and among fungi utilized by termites from the same continent.

Several TMs use signatures, which summarize unbounded read/write sets in bounded hardware at a performance cost of false <b>positives</b> (<b>conflicts</b> detected when none exists). This paper examines different organizations to achieve hardware-efficient and accurate TM signatures. First, we find that implementing each signature with a single k-hashfunction Bloom filter (True Bloom signature) is inefficient, as it requires multi-ported SRAMs. Instead, we advocate using k single-hash-function Bloom filters in parallel (Parallel Bloom signature), using area-efficient single-ported SRAMs. Our formal analysis shows that both organizations perform equally well in theory and our simulationbased evaluation shows this to hold approximately in practice. We also show that by choosing high-quality hash functions we can achieve signature designs noticeably more accurate than the previously proposed implementations. Finally, we adapt Pagh and Rodler’s cuckoo hashing to implement Cuckoo-Bloom signatures. While this representation does not support set intersection, it mitigates false positives for the common case of small read/write sets and performs like a Bloom filter for large sets. 1...|$|R

40|$|Transactional Memory (TM) systems ease multithreaded {{application}} development {{by giving the}} program-mer the ability to specify that some regions of code, called transactions, must be executed atomically. To achieve high efficiency, TM systems optimistically try to execute multiple transactions concurrently and either stall or abort some of them if a conflict occurs. A conflict happens if two or more transactions ac-cess to the same memory address, {{and at least one}} of the accesses is a write. TM systems must track the read and write sets —items read and written during a transaction — to detect possible conflicts. Several TMs, including Bulk, LogTM-SE, BulkSC, and SigTM, represent read and write sets with signatures, which allow unbounded read/write sets to be summarized in bounded hardware at a performance cost of false <b>positives</b> (<b>conflicts</b> detected when none actually existed). This study addresses the aspects of signature design and implementation for conflict detection in TM systems. We first cover the design of Bloom signatures (i. e. signatures implemented with Bloom filters), identifying their three design dimensions: size, number of hash functions, and type of hash functions.
