5|$|Gottesman did his {{graduate}} {{work at the}} University of Minnesota, which then patterned its clinical psychology program on the Boulder model, which emphasized research theory and clinical practice. He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy, supported by the Korean War G.I. Bill. He began investigating personality traits in identical and fraternal twins who had filled out the Minnesota Multiphasic <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory</b> (MMPI). His Ph.D. thesis, submitted to Psychological Monographs, was rejected before a review {{on the grounds that}} the nature–nurture issue it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture. On appeal, the thesis was reviewed and accepted for publication.|$|E

25|$|Eysenck's {{theory of}} {{personality}} is closely {{linked with the}} psychometric scales {{that he and his}} co-workers constructed. These included the Maudsley <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory</b> (MPI), the Eysenck <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory</b> (EPI), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), as well as the revised version (EPQ-R) and its corresponding short-form (EPQ-R-S). The Eysenck Personality Profiler (EPP) breaks down different facets of each trait considered in the model. There has been some debate about whether these facets should include impulsivity as a facet of extraversion as Eysenck declared in his early work, or of psychoticism, as he declared in his later work.|$|E
50|$|Adroitness {{is often}} {{compared}} to both psychopathy and Machiavellianism, as all three {{can be measured}} by similar scales on <b>personality</b> <b>inventories.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{previously}} stated, adroitness is {{not clearly}} measured {{as a specific}} personality trait, but is instead measured by different scales and clusters.Most <b>personality</b> <b>inventories</b> have some measure of honesty built in. Traits like psychopathy and Machiavellianism are usually measured as negative honesty traits. While adroitness is considered a positive trait compared to these two, the inherent manipulation makes {{it almost impossible to}} accurately place it on an honesty scale, which may account for why it is not more specifically measured on <b>personality</b> <b>inventories.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} why the use of a frame-of-reference leads to increased criterion-related validity of <b>personality</b> <b>inventories.</b> Two competing explanations are described and tested. A between-subjects (N 337) and a within-subject (N 105) study are conducted to test the hypothesized effects of use of a frame of reference on reliability and validity. Regarding the effects on reliability, use of a frame of reference reduces within-person inconsistency (instead of between-person variability) in responding to generic items. Use of a frame of reference further leads to higher validity {{as a result of the}} reduction of between-person variability and within-person inconsistency. Yet, reducing these inconsistencies is not enough. It is also important to use a frame of reference that is conceptually relevant to the criterion. Besides implications for contextualized <b>personality</b> <b>inventories,</b> these results provide an explanation for the moderate validities of generic <b>personality</b> <b>inventories...</b>|$|R
25|$|In psychology, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) is a {{questionnaire}} {{to assess the}} personality traits of a person, {{this is not the}} same questionnaire as the Eysenck's <b>personality</b> <b>Inventory</b> or EPI which was an earlier instrument also produced by Hans Eysenck.|$|E
25|$|Nominees for {{president}} and vice president registered their candidacy at the central General Election Commission office in Jakarta on 16 May. Candidates underwent physical and psychological evaluations at Gatot Subroto Army Hospital following registration. Personality tests were also conducted using the Minnesota Multiphasic <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yet another conceptualization, the triarchic model, {{suggests}} that other conceptualizations of psychopathy emphasize three observable characteristics to varying degrees. Analyses {{have been made}} {{with respect to the}} applicability of measurement tools such as the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL, PCL-R) and Psychopathic <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory</b> (PPI) to this model.|$|E
50|$|Tests {{are often}} used in career {{counseling}} to help clients make realistic career decisions. Tests used in career counseling generally fall into three categories: interest <b>inventories,</b> <b>personality</b> <b>inventories,</b> and aptitude tests.|$|R
30|$|Three {{possible}} explanations {{can be given}} for these findings. Firstly, {{it is possible that}} the entry test is not a good instrument to measure cognitive skills and personality traits that are predictive of dropout. We consider this to be an invalid argument, because the AMN is a certified and validated instrument that bears close resemblance to other cognitive and <b>personality</b> <b>inventories.</b> The cognitive subtests of the AMN closely resemble those commonly used in intelligence test batteries such as the WAIS (Wechsler 2009), while the personality questions are typical of those used in other big five-based <b>personality</b> <b>inventories.</b>|$|R
50|$|Psychasthenia is a {{psychological}} disorder characterized by phobias, obsessions, compulsions, or excessive anxiety. The term {{is no longer}} in psychiatric diagnostic use, although it still forms one of the ten clinical subscales of the popular self-report <b>personality</b> <b>inventories</b> MMPI and MMPI-2.|$|R
25|$|There {{are some}} {{traditional}} personality tests that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they assess relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior. These include the Minnesota Multiphasic <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory</b> (Psychopathic Deviate scale), California Psychological Inventory (Socialization scale), and Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory Antisocial Personality Disorder scale. There {{is also the}} Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP) and the Hare Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (HSRP), {{but in terms of}} self-report tests, the PPI/PPI-R has become more used than either of these in modern psychopathy research on adults.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, Ellis {{began his}} studies for a PhD in {{clinical}} psychology at Teachers College, Columbia University, which trained psychologists mostly in psychoanalysis. He completed his Master of Arts in clinical psychology from Teachers College in June 1943, {{and started a}} part-time private practice while still working on his PhD degree – possibly {{because there was no}} licensing of psychologists in New York at that time. Ellis began publishing articles even before receiving his PhD; in 1946 he wrote a critique of many widely used pencil-and-paper personality tests. He concluded that only the Minnesota Multiphasic <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory</b> met the standards of a research-based instrument.|$|E
25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory,</b> {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories {{are more likely to}} engage in counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are {{more likely to engage in}} CWB when they feel threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E

40|$|Response {{distortion}} (RD), or faking, among {{job applicants}} completing personality inven-tories {{has been a}} concern for selection specialists. In a field study using the NEO Personal-ity Inventory, Revised, the authors show that RD is significantly greater among job applicants than among job incumbents, that there are significant individual differences in RD, and that RD among job applicants can {{have a significant effect}} on who is hired. These results are discussed in the context of recent studies suggesting that RD has little effect on the predictive validity of <b>personality</b> <b>inventories.</b> The authors conclude that future research, rather than focusing on predictive validity, should focus instead on the effect of RD on construct validity and hiring decisions. Personality assessment as a preemployment screening procedure is receiving renewed interest from researchers and practitioners. A number of quantitative reviews have demonstrated that <b>personality</b> <b>inventories</b> can be useful predictors of job performance, particularly if specific, job-relevant personality constructs are used to predict spe...|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} to the proprietary nature of personality measurement is the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) [...] developed by Lewis Goldberg (1999). Including more than 2,400 items {{in the form of}} sentence stems, the IPIP collaboratory has at least 269 scales targeted at everything from achievement striving to vitality/zest and includes public domain scales meant to reflect constructs found in at least 17 commonly used <b>personality</b> <b>inventories.</b> All of the IPIP items and the common <b>personality</b> <b>inventories</b> have been given to the same community sample in Eugene/Springfield, Oregon, and item statistics are freely available from Goldberg and his associates. Some have questioned the open and free use of the IPIP items with respect to the possibility of the public learning to fake personality tests used in employment settings. Others have worried about whether the freedom to select items will lead to fragmentation of constructs rather than the hoped for integration (Goldberg et al., 2006).|$|R
25|$|Unlike the PCL, the Psychopathic <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory</b> (PPI) was {{developed}} to comprehensively index personality traits without explicitly referring to antisocial or criminal behaviors themselves. It is a self-report scale that {{was developed}} originally for non-clinical samples (e.g. university students) rather than prisoners, though may be used with the latter. It was revised in 2005 to become the PPI-R and now comprises 154 items organized into eight subscales. The item scores {{have been found to}} group into two overarching and largely separate factors (unlike the PCL-R factors), Fearless-Dominance and Impulsive Antisociality, plus a third factor, Coldheartedness, which is largely dependent on scores on the other two. Factor 1 is associated with social efficacy while Factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies. A person may score at different levels on the different factors, but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic personality.|$|E
25|$|A {{generalization}} of Student's t statistic, called Hotelling's t-squared statistic, {{allows for the}} testing of hypotheses on multiple (often correlated) measures within the same sample. For instance, a researcher might submit a number of subjects to a personality test consisting of multiple personality scales (e.g. the Minnesota Multiphasic <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory).</b> Because measures of this type are usually positively correlated, it is not advisable to conduct separate univariate t-tests to test hypotheses, as these would neglect the covariance among measures and inflate the chance of falsely rejecting at least one hypothesis (Type I error). In this case a single multivariate test is preferable for hypothesis testing. Fisher's Method for combining multiple tests with alpha reduced for positive correlation among tests is one. Another is Hotelling's T2 statistic follows a T2 distribution. However, in practice the distribution is rarely used, since tabulated values for T2 are hard to find. Usually, T2 is converted instead to an F statistic.|$|E
500|$|A 2011 {{prospective}} study by Roland R.Griffiths and colleagues {{suggests that a}} single high dosage of psilocybin can cause long-term changes in the personality of its users. About half of the study participants—described as healthy, [...] "spiritually active", and many possessing postgraduate degrees—showed {{an increase in the}} personality dimension of openness (assessed using the Revised NEO <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory),</b> and this positive effect was apparent {{more than a year after}} the psilocybin session. According to the study authors, the finding is significant because [...] "no study has prospectively demonstrated personality change in healthy adults after an experimentally manipulated discrete event." [...] Although other researchers have described instances of psychedelic drug usage leading to new psychological understandings and personal insights, it is not known whether these experimental results can be generalized to larger populations.|$|E
30|$|Like motivation, {{self-control}} – alternatively self-regulation or self-discipline – {{has also}} been {{at the core of}} research in psychology for decades. In their meta-analysis, for example, Duckworth and Kern (2011) identify over 100 unique self- and informant-reported questionnaires designed to measure self-control either on its own or as a subscale of broader <b>personality</b> <b>inventories.</b> Some of these draw a direct link between self-control and perceptions of control.|$|R

2500|$|Beginning in the 1970s, Paul Costa and Robert McCrae began {{researching the}} {{development}} of personality assessments based on factor models. Beginning with cluster analyses of Cattell's 16 Personality Factors, Costa and McCrae initially settled on a three-factor model of personality. These three factors were neuroticism (vs. emotional stability), extraversion (vs. introversion), and openness (vs. closedness) to experience, resulting in the acronym [...] "NEO." [...] Due to similarities between their three-factor NEO <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory</b> and Goldberg's Big Five, Costa and McCrae began to develop scales to assess agreeableness and conscientiousness in the early 1980s. This work culminated in the 1985 publication of the first NEO PI Manual {{to be based on}} the full Five Factor Model. Although this marked the introduction of agreeableness to the NEO PI, Costa and McCrae worked for an additional seven years to identify and elaborate on the facets comprising this factor in the Revised NEO <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory.</b>|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} {{and problems of}} usage of <b>personality</b> <b>inventories</b> in psychological diagnostic of persons with "heavy pathology", from aspect of validity and applicability in the first place. <b>Personality</b> <b>inventories</b> are usually designed for health population. By their usage in clinical psychology we often meet problems like specific tendencies when answering defined questions. This could {{be the result of}} situational factors but also the impact of their disorders and personality. The possibilities of classical interpretation of results are in this way limited. Do we have the opportunity of development of the diagnostic instruments that we could, not only recognise, but use such deformations (which represent cognitive style or defence of person) in diagnostic purpose? The MMPI- 2, most famous inventory in this field, offer us great aid, especially because its items are selected empirically. By the analysis of its items from aspect of sensing and localisation of subjects problems, we found differences between clinical scales which represent patients of different clinical groups. These differences are in accordance with psychoanalytical assumptions about characteristics of sensing self and other people...|$|R

Low modesty is otherwise known as conceitedness or Narcissism and, in extreme cases, can manifest as Narcissistic personality disorder.

2500|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{category of}} sociopathic personality in early {{editions of the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) had some key similarities to Cleckley's ideas, though in 1980 when renamed Antisocial Personality Disorder some of the underlying personality assumptions were removed. In 1980, Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare introduced an alternative measure, the [...] "Psychopathy Checklist" [...] (PCL) based largely on Cleckley's criteria, which was revised in 1991 (PCL-R), and is {{the most widely used}} measure of psychopathy.

2500|$|The {{trait of}} extraversion–introversion [...] {{is a central}} {{dimension}} of human personality theories. The terms introversion and extraversion were popularized by Carl Jung, although both the popular understanding and psychological usage differ from his original intent. Extraversion tends to be manifested in outgoing, talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in more reserved and solitary behavior. Virtually all comprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms. Examples include the Big Five model, Jung's analytical psychology, Hans Eysenck's three-factor model, Raymond Cattell's 16 personality factors, the Minnesota Multiphasic <b>Personality</b> <b>Inventory,</b> and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator.|$|E
