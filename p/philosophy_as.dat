5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and <b>philosophy.</b> <b>As</b> a result, it {{has become one of the}} liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion.

5|$|Born in Trier to {{a middle-class}} family, Marx later studied {{political}} economy and Hegelian <b>philosophy.</b> <b>As</b> an adult, Marx became stateless and {{spent much of}} his life in London, England, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works, of which the two most well-known are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto and the three-volume Das Kapital. His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic and political history.|$|E

5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} <b>philosophy,</b> <b>as</b> a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues. Cheng Yi, patriarch of the Neo-Confucian Cheng–Zhu school, read the I Ching as a guide to moral perfection.

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{prosperity}} and cultural life, the Komnenian period {{was one of}} the peaks in Byzantine history, and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth, and culture.

Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west during this period was enormous and of long lasting significance.|$|E

On March 14, 1893 he was appointed an instructor {{in the department of}} <b>philosophy.</b> <b>As</b> an instructor, he began teaching psychology and logic courses, in addition to a philosophy course.|$|E
5|$|The common {{element to}} both church and palazzi {{interior}} design was the stucco work. Stucco {{is an important}} component of the Baroque design and <b>philosophy,</b> <b>as</b> it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'oeil ceilings and walls in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, in a private house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.|$|E

5|$|While {{some other}} designs use clamps to couple the disc to the platter, Roksan shares the same <b>philosophy</b> <b>as</b> Linn in believing that rigid {{coupling}} would cause rumble to be transmitted {{from the main}} bearing, thus colouring the sound.

5|$|In 1967, {{the college}} added its first lay {{faculty members in}} its Departments of Theology and <b>Philosophy,</b> <b>as</b> well as its first {{full-time}} female faculty member. Two years later, the student dress code was abolished. In 1970, the college decided to admit women starting with the 1971–1972 school year. The same year, the first female administrator was hired. By 1975, the first year women graduated after completing a four-year course of study, women had attained highly visible positions in school organizations. Anne Martha Frank was the first women to edit The Cowl, the school weekly newspaper. Patricia Slonina {{became the first woman}} editor of the literary magazine, The Alembic. Ana Margarita Cabrera was the first woman to edit the school yearbook, The Veritas.|$|E

5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political <b>philosophy</b> <b>as</b> it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the {{strategy}} of the Imperial Japanese Navy {{was based on the}} radical Jeune Ecole naval <b>philosophy,</b> <b>as</b> promoted by French military advisor and naval architect Emile Bertin. This emphasised cheap torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive, heavily armoured ships. The acquisition of two German-built s by the Imperial Chinese Beiyang Fleet in 1885 threatened Japan's interests in Korea. A visit by the Chinese warships to Japan in early 1891 forced the Japanese government to acknowledge that the IJN required similarly armed and armoured ships of its own to counter the ironclads; the three lightly armoured s ordered from France would not suffice, despite their powerful guns. The IJN decided to order a pair of the latest battleships from the United Kingdom as Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their <b>philosophy</b> <b>as</b> a way of life (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E

40|$|Through the {{increased}} use of qualitative research methods, the term phenomenology has become a quite familiar notion for researchers in adapted physical activity (APA). In contrast to this increasing interest in phenomenology as methodology, relatively little work has focused on phenomenology <b>as</b> <b>philosophy</b> or <b>as</b> an approach to professional practice. Therefore, {{the purpose of this article}} is to examine the relevance of phenomenology <b>as</b> <b>philosophy</b> and <b>as</b> pedagogy to the field of APA. First, phenomenology <b>as</b> <b>philosophy</b> is introduced through three key notions, namely the first-person perspective, embodiment, and life-world. The relevance of these terms to APA is then outlined. Second, the concept of phenomenological pedagogy is introduced, and its application and potential for APA are discussed. In conclusion, it is argued that phenomenology can help theorize ways of understanding human difference in movement contexts and form a basis of action-oriented research aiming at developing professional practice...|$|R
