5|$|The {{opportunity}} to create an entire batch of locomotives within the 8P category was declined by the Railway Executive. It had been said this was because the design process had been highly expensive and complex, {{so that when the}} locomotive emerged from Crewe Works in 1954, such thoughts had to be precluded, especially {{with the advent of the}} 1955 Modernisation Plan. As a result, 71000 remained the solitary member of a <b>proposed</b> <b>class</b> of Standard 8P locomotives.|$|E
5|$|Triton {{was to be}} {{the lead}} ship of a <b>proposed</b> <b>class</b> of nuclear-powered radar picket submarines. A December 1955 {{long-range}} naval planning report envisioned five carrier strike groups, each supported by two radar picket submarines. The total force included two non-nuclear Sailfish class submarines and eight nuclear submarines. With construction costs for Triton escalating, this long-range requirement was revised in 1957 to provide four nuclear-powered radar picket submarines for a single nuclear-powered carrier group, with the four remaining conventionally powered carrier groups supported by two diesel-electric radar picket submarines each.|$|E

40|$|This paper <b>proposes</b> <b>classes</b> of intertemporal poverty {{measures}} {{which take}} into account both the debilitating impact of prolonged spells in poverty and the mitigating effect of periods of a­ffluence on subsequent poverty. The weight assigned {{to the level of}} poverty in each time period depends on the length of the preceding spell of poverty or of non-poverty. The <b>proposed</b> <b>classes</b> of intertemporal poverty measures are quite general and allow for a range of possible judgements as to the overall impact on a poor period of preceding spells of poverty or a­ffluence.

The <b>proposed</b> <b>classes</b> of shrunken estimators and preliminary test estimators are compared with the usual unbiased estimator and MMSE estimator. Eventually, empirical study is carried out to demonstrate the performance of some shrunken estimators and preliminary test estimators of the <b>proposed</b> <b>classes</b> over the MMSE estimator.

2500|$|On February 17, 2009, John Parkhurst, {{the father}} of twin boys living on Capitol Hill, through his {{attorneys}} Stefanie Roemer and David Sanford of Sanford, Wittels & Heisler, filed a class action lawsuit against WASA in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, seeking $200 million in compensatory damages plus punitive damages. Parkhurst, a 50-year-old single father and psychologist, prepared food and formula for the boys using tap water {{from the time they}} were 8 months old until 2002, when they were two years old. The complaint was later amended to add additional five children, on behalf of a <b>proposed</b> <b>class</b> consisting of all children who, at any time from 2000 to 2004, while six years of age or younger, consumed water supplied by WASA that passed through a line containing lead (whether directly or prenatally through their birth mothers), and who had blood-lead levels of 10μg/dl or higher. [...] The suit claims that WASA [...] "undertook Herculean efforts to shield itself from liability and to otherwise deny responsibility". Contemporary news reports indicated that WASA had not seen the lawsuit at the time the story broke, but included comments from WASA spokespeople that more studies would be needed before lead in drinking water could be linked to health and behavioral issues. [...] The agency said that such claims would need to be substantiated on a case-by-case basis. WASA's motion to dismiss the complaint was denied in October 2009. In 2012 the named plaintiffs on the case sought to make the case a class action, but on April 8, 2013, judge Anthony C. Epstein denied their motion for class certification stating that the [...] "class of tap water drinkers under 7 years old with elevated blood lead levels was too broad", and that it was not clear the class had or even possibly would suffer any injury.|$|E
