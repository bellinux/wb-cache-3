40|$|The {{classical}} {{test for}} the detection of pyrogenic contaminations in pharmaceuticals is the rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test.</b> The most frequently occuring and most important pyrogenic contamination in biological and biotechnological pharmaceutical preparations are bacterial endotoxins, originating from the cellular wall of Gram-negative bacteria. There is an alternative in vitro {{test for the}} detection of these bacterial endotoxins available, the so-called LAL-test. However, due to some drawbacks, e. g. interfering factors in some pharmaceuticals, this LAL-test cannot always be applied as a suitable alternative for the rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test.</b> Experiments were performed to determine the suitability of a so-called 'cytokine release test' as an alternative for the rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test.</b> Cells of the monocyte cell-line MonoMac- 6 were incubated in the presence of several vaccines and blood products, and the cytokine (IL- 6 and TNFalpha) release promoting activity of these vaccines and blood products was determined. The results of the cytokine release test were then compared with the results of both the LAL-test and the rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test.</b> Regarding some bacterial vaccines both the cytokine release test and the LAL-test are considered to be suitable alternatives for the rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pyrogenic {{contaminations}} of some {{classes of}} injectable drugs, e. g. toxic or immunomodulatory {{as well as}} false-positive drugs, represent a major risk which cannot yet be excluded due to the limitations of current tests. Here we describe a modification of the In vitro <b>Pyrogen</b> <b>Test</b> termed AWIPT (Adsorb, Wash, In vitro <b>Pyrogen</b> <b>Test),</b> which addresses this problem by introducing a preincubation step in which pyrogenic contaminations in the test sample are adsorbed to albumin-coated beads. After rinsing, the beads are incubated with human whole blood {{and the release of}} the endogenous pyrogen interleukin- 1 ß is measured as a marker of pyrogenic activity. Intentional contaminations with lipopolysaccharide were retrieved from the chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel, cisplatin and liposomal daunorubicin, the antibiotic gentamicin, the antifungal agent liposomal amphotericin B, and the corticosteroid prednisolone at lower dilutions than in the standard in vitro <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test.</b> This represents a promising new approach for the detection of pyrogenic contamination in drugs or in drugs containing interfering additives and should lead to improved safety levels.

40|$|The {{availability}} of generator {{systems for the}} pro duction of short-lived radionuclides in hospital labo ratories has introduced new problems into the field of nuclear medicine. Chief among these is quality control of these newer nuclides and their com pounds. Although after the fact bacteriological and <b>pyrogen</b> <b>testing</b> does not insure {{the safety of the}} materials at the time of injection, it is presently the only feasible method for dealing with nuclides that have half-lives on the order of hours. Some system of quality control must be instituted at an earlier stage of production so that compounds meet certain specified standards before injection. Because there are no standards for radiopharmaceuticals set forth in USP XVII (1), the individual laboratory must set up its own system using the specifications of the USP XVII as a guideline. In the Nuclear Medicine Department at Chicago Wesley Memorial Hospital we have instituted a sys tem of quality control for compounds of oomTcand lismln along these lines, which allows some testing before injection to assure the bacteriological purity, nonpyrogenicity, radiochemical purity and identity of all the compounds produced in our laboratory.

40|$|The human {{whole blood}} IL- 1 test {{exploits}} the reaction of mono-cytes/macrophages {{for the detection of}} pyrogens: {{human whole blood}} taken from healthy volunteers is incubated in the pres-ence of the test sample in any form, be it a solution, a powder or even solid material. Pyrogenic contaminations initiate the release of the “endogenous pyrogen ” Interleukin- 1 ß deter-mined by ELISA after incubation. In order to understand any differences between the pyrogenic activity in this test and the existing live rabbit test (species differences versus aberrant response of the particular blood sample), the rabbit whole blood test was developed.

Differences, up to 100 -fold, exist in the sensitivity of the various LAL preparations to the same endotoxin. The LAL tests in general were 3 to 300 times more sensitive than was the USP rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> method. The LAL and the USP rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> data correlated well when the endotoxin in a relatively pure and undegraded form was examined. However, large discrepancies in correlation were found when partially degraded endotoxins were compared. One LAL preparation responded to both intact and degraded endotoxin, whereas others responded only to intact endotoxin; the latter closely correlated with the febrile response of the rabbit.

40|$|AbstractSafety control {{tests for}} {{vaccines}} {{need to be}} capable of quantifying in vivo toxicity of vaccines. Endotoxin contamination is a threat for vaccine safety and has traditionally been controlled using either an in vivo rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> or the in vitro Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. An in vitro <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> was developed using prostaglandin E 2 induction in rabbit peripheral blood. Responsiveness of LAL and rabbits to various endotoxins, however, differ from that of humans. A monocyte activation test was developed using human monocytes but is not applicable where the use of donated blood is limited to therapeutic purposes. Therefore, a clinically relevant in vitro <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> was developed using a human monocytic cell line responsive to various pyrogens {{in a manner consistent with}} that of human peripheral blood. Residual pertussis toxin (PT) activity of acellular pertussis vaccines (aPs) is quantified by the mouse histamine sensitization (HS) test. The Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell clustering test can sensitively detect PT activity but is not adequate for testing aPs due to hampered interaction of aggregated PT molecules with cell surface receptors. An in vitro test system has been developed to estimate HS activity using the combined assay results of carbohydrate binding ELISA (B-subunit) and enzymatic-HPLC (A-subunit). Potency tests need to evaluate protective immunogenicity of vaccines. Protective potency of whole cell pertussis vaccine can be measured by the method whose results were shown to correlate with clinical protection. Identifying and quantifying the structures of antigen molecules relevant to the induction of protective immunity may be the ultimate goal...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of an in vitro <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> {{system based on}} proinflammatory cytokine release from human monocytic cells was assessed by comparison with a test system based on a human whole blood culture {{as well as with}} the conventional rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test.</b> The human cells used as the pyrogen indicator cells were newly selected by subcloning of a human monocytic cell line, Mono-Mac- 6. The selected cells, named MM 6 -CA 8, responded to various pyrogens, including endotoxin, peptidoglycan (PG), Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 (SAC), and poly(I[*]·[*][*]C), with a high sensitivity and produced proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1 (IL- 1), IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Among these cytokines, IL- 6 was produced most sensitively in response to traces of the pyrogens and detected in the largest quantities in the culture medium. The cytokine-producing responses of MM 6 -CA 8 cells correlated significantly with the responses of cultured human whole blood, which represents an ex vivo culture test system reproducing pyrogen-induced cytokine production in the human body. In terms of cytokine inducibility, the pyrogens were ranked in the order endotoxin > PG > poly (I[*]·[*]C) > SAC in both culture systems, a ranking which almost agreed with the ranking of their pyrogenicity as assessed by the rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test.</b> These results suggest that the in vitro responsiveness of MM 6 -CA 8 cells to various pyrogens is highly relevant for human pyrogenic reactions. Therefore, the in vitro test system is useful and reliable for detecting the presence of materials that are pyrogenic for humans...|$|E

In vivo, peripheral blood platelet counts remained unchanged after SPE treatment. Cycloheximide pretreatment of rabbits did not inhibit fever production by SP C. In contrast to the hypothermia observed in mice treated with endotoxin intravenously susceptibility to lethal endotoxin shock.

Three groups of 6 rabbits were administered 30 mg/kg c 1 indamycin phosphate intravenously on day 1. One group was untreated; 2 groups were treated daily by gavage with 2 g cholestyramine in 20 ml water until day 21, starting on either day 1 or 3. Daily body weights, faecal output, faecal occult blood, food and water consumption, and body temperatures were determined. Four of 6 rabbits in the untreated group either died or were mori-bund and euthanased. There were no deaths in either treatment groups.

40|$|Selected ion-monitoring gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} {{was used}} for detection of beta-hydroxy fatty acids as an independent assay for {{the presence or absence}} of endotoxin in materials claimed to induce nonspecific activation of Limulus amoebocyte lysate. To this end, suspensions of gram-negative and -positive bacteria, one fungal species, cerebrospinal fluid, and hollow-fiber hemodialyzer rinses were assayed for endotoxin by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Good qualitative agreement was shown for both methods when suspensions of test organisms were assayed. Two false-negative results were obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assays of cerebrospinal fluid and were shown to be a result of insufficient endotoxin in the cerebrospinal fluid specimens for detection by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hemodialyzer rinses were Limulus assay positive; however, no beta-hydroxy fatty acids were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These data were compared with data obtained from USP rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>tests</b> of the rinse materials (nonpyrogenic) and chemical characterization of the Limulus assay-reactive rinses, which showed the rinses to be cellulosic in nature.

A series of deletion mutants were prepared with knockouts of {{one or more of the}} lpxL 1, lpxL 2, or synX genes. The ΔlpxL 2 mutants had a reduced growth rate, reduced level of LOS expression, and increased sensitivity to surfactants. In addition, ΔsynX ΔlpxL 2 double mutants had reduced viability in stationary phase. The ΔlpxL 1 ΔlpxL 2 double mutant behaved essentially the same as the ΔlpxL 2 single mutant. LOS from both lpxL mutant strains exhibited altered migration on polyacrylamide gels. The LOS of ΔlpxL 2 mutants of L 3, 7 strains were fully sialylated. NOMV prepared from lpxL 2 mutants was about 200 -fold less active than wild-type NOMV in rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>tests</b> and in tumor necrosis factor alpha release assays. Bactericidal titers induced in animals by ΔlpxL 2 mutant NOMV were lower than those induced by ΔlpxL 1 or wild-type NOMV. However, immunogenicity could be largely restored by use of an adjuvant.

40|$|Fifty {{years after}} the elucidation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, endotoxin) as the {{principal}} structure of Gram-negative bacteria activating the human immune system, its Gram-positive counterpart is still under debate. <b>Pyrogen</b> <b>tests</b> based on the human monocyte activation have been validated for LPS detection {{as an alternative to}} the rabbit test and, increasingly, the limulus amebocyte lysate test. For full replacement, international validations with non-endotoxin pyrogens are in preparation. Following evidence-based medicine approaches, a systematic review of existing evidence as to the structural nature of the Gram-positive pyrogen was undertaken. For the three major constituents suggested, i. e. peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acids (LTA), and bacterial lipoproteins, the questions to be answered and a search strategy for relevant literature was developed, starting in MedLine. The evaluation was based on the Koch-Dale criteria for a mediator of an effect. A total of 380 articles for peptidoglycan, 391 for lipoproteins, and 285 for LTA were retrieved of which 12, 8 and 24, respectively, fulfilled inclusion criteria. The compiled data suggest that for peptidoglycan two Koch-Dale criteria are fulfilled, four for LTA, and two for bacterial lipoproteins. In conclusion, based on the best currently available evidence, LTA is the only substance that fulfils all criteria. LTA has been isolated from a large number of bacteria, results in cytokine release patterns inducible also with synthetic LTA. Reduction in bacterial cytokine induction with an inhibitor for LTA was shown.

The current study shows how {{to overcome these problems}} using frozen pooled MNCs. The MAT is performed by thawing pooled MNC and co-culture overnight with a test substance, LPS or non-endotoxin pyrogens, with IL- 6 production as the readout. The study demonstrates that fresh and frozen pooled MNC have comparable sensitivity. The reproducibility of the MAT performed with different batches of frozen pooled MNC was excellent. Different non-endotoxin pyrogens induce IL- 6, confirming the ability of the MAT to detect a variety of pyrogens.

40|$|Human {{growth hormone}} is biosynthetically {{produced}} in recombinant strains of Escherichia coli as methionyl human growth hormone (met-hGH). When purified from the bacterial culture, met-hGH is biologically active in established assays for growth hormone. Therefore, a phase I trial of met-hGH {{was carried out in}} healthy human adults; during the first trial, however, signs, symptoms, and clinical laboratory tests characteristic of an acute-phase response to pyrogenic agents was observed. Prior testing of the met-hGH preparation used in the phase I trial did not reveal evidence of toxicity, and the U. S. Pharmacopeial Convention rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test,</b> as well as the Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test, had not detected significant levels of exogenous pyrogens or endotoxin. In addition, standard inhibition studies with added endotoxin showed no inhibition by the LAL test. When this preparation of met-hGH was incubated with human blood mononuclear cells, leukocytic pyrogen (LP) was released into the supernatant medium, suggesting that the preparation contained pyrogenic material. Various lots of met-hGH based on different purification and formulating methods were tested by the human LP assay for contaminating pyrogens. The results of these tests aided in the identification of procedures for met-hGH preparations which did not induce LP in vitro. Thus, subsequent lots of met-hGH which had passed the LP test were used in repeat clinical studies, and no inflammatory or pyrogenic reactions were observed. When the LP test was used, experiments revealed that the original lot of met-hGH was contaminated with endotoxin which had not been detected in the LAL or rabbit pyrogen tests. Lyophilization in glycine-phosphate buffer had resulted in a 10 - to 20 -fold reduction of endotoxin reactivity in the LAL test and the U. S. Pharmacopeial Convention rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test.</b> These data provide a probable explanation for the negative result from the LAL and rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> in the initial lot of met-hGH which induced acute-phase reactions.

40|$|Fever is {{mediated}} by an endogenously produced {{low molecular weight}} protein called leukocytic pyrogen (LP), 1 which acts {{in or near the}} thermoregulatory center of the pre-optic anterior hypothalamus (1). Human LP is synthesized by phagocytic leukocytes after stimulation by a variety of substances; however, with the exception of certain pyrogenic steroids, these substances have been microbial agents or their products (2). In studies on immunologically mediated fever, the use of soluble antigens or antigen-antibody complexes to stimulate LP in sensitized animals is well established (3 - 5). On the other hand, antigens have not been demonstrated to stimulate human LP production even when antigens such as tetanus toxoid, penicillin, or tuberculin are incubated with leukocytes from known sensitized individuals in the presence of autologous serum. Thus, the mechanism of LP production in immunologically mediated febrile disease in humans remains unexplained. The present investigations concern the role of alloantigens in the stimulation of LP production and the results demonstrate the release of a soluble factor in the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) that induces the synthesis of LP from human monocytes. This factor was produced in the absence of materials of microbial or plant origin, and its ability to induce LP synthesis may be important in the pathogenesis of fever in humans with certain immunologically mediated diseases.

40|$|Pyrogens are {{substances}} that may induce fever {{in the human}} body. They can be parts of bacteria, virus or fungi and due to the reaction they may cause in the body, they are routinely looked for in the medical technology industries. A method called in vitro <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> (IPT) has been developed to detect these pyrogens. It {{is based on the}} fever reaction in the human body and only requires blood in combination with a solution believed to contain pyrogens. If the result is positive, the production of cytokines is started. The cytokines of interest in the IPT method are those involved in the fever process and two of them are IL- 1 β and TNF-α, which are the cytokines used as markers of infection in this study. Since the production of cytokines is in proportion to the amount of pyrogens, the inflammation-inducing potential of the sample can be decided. Due to problems in standardizing the method, mainly because it handles with living blood cells, focus is still pointed at improving it. The aim {{of this study was to}} optimize parameters within the IPT method by analysing air samples taken in indoor surroundings believed to contain pyrogens. The different parameters included extraction of the filter from the air sampling, incubation of whole blood and sample extract and analysis of the incubation with ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). More specific, some of the issues concerned extraction media, time and shaking intensity for the extraction, blood ratio for the whole blood incubation and cytokines suitable for the method. A possible approach for the IPT method, when analysing air samples containing pyrogens, was reached. Pyrogener kallas ämnen som framkallar feber och de kan exempelvis bestå av hela eller delar av bakterier, virus eller svamp (fungi). En metod som kallas för in vitro <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> (IPT) har utvecklats för att detektera dessa pyrogener. Metoden bygger på att en lösning som misstänks innehålla pyrogener får komma i kontakt med blod från en människa. Efter en inkubering på mellan 4 - 24 timmar har blodet reagerat på eventuella pyrogener och bildat cytokiner, där mängden cytokiner är proportionell mot mängden pyrogener. De intressanta cytokinerna i den här studien var IL- 1 β och TNF-α, som båda är involverade i feberprocessen. Det har varit svårigheter med att standardisera metoden, mycket beroende på att det är levande celler som hela metoden bygger på, så syftet med den här studien var att förbättra in vitro <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test.</b> Luftprover tagna i inomhusmiljöer som misstänks innehålla pyrogener har använts i försöken att optimera varje steg i processen. De olika stegen inkluderade extraktion av filter som använts vid luftprovtagningen, inkubering med helblod och provextrakt och analys av inkuberingen med ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). Några av de parametrar som undersöktes gällde extraktionsmedium, skaktid och skakintensitet under extraktionen, blodförhållande under helblodsinkuberingen och lämpliga cytokiner för metoden. Studien resulterade i att en metodik, för att analysera luftprov innehållande pyrogener med in vitro <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test,</b> kunde tas fram...|$|E

This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Dar es Salaam Region. Samples of quinine syrups (QNSs) and water for injection (WFI) of different batches were randomly purchased. Each QNS was inspected for label disclosure, and physicochemical properties were examined {{by the use of}} sense of organs and pH meter. Isolation and quantification of microbial contaminants from each sample was preceded by 24 - 48 h incubation at 37 ºC, and the microbial contaminants were expressed as colony forming unit per millilitre (cfu/ml). Microbiological identification of contaminants was performed by examination of colony morphologies and growth characteristics. Gram staining technique, as well as biochemical and serological tests were also conducted for further identification. Albino rabbits were used for the <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> to determine the presence of microbial contamination in WFI. Twenty-four samples of QNS underwent label disclosure, physical-chemical and microbiological assessments. All QNS samples complied with the guidelines and microbial limits as per United States Pharmacopoeia (USP).

40|$|Nomination of a {{validated}} {{in vitro}} test method for assessing pyrogenicity of pharmaceuticals and other products for further evaluation in order to expand its applicability domain to nonendotoxin pyrogens to the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) Background information on the recognition and status of validation processes regarding national and international regulations- The {{extent to which the}} Monocyte Activation Test (MAT) is applicable to regulatory testing needs Following international validation studies, the MAT has been peer-reviewed and accepted with restrictions to Gram-negative endotoxins by ICCVAM, ECVAM and JaCVAM. Here, the work suggested in the peer-review process shall be carried out to expand the applicability domain and fully replace the rabbit assay. National pharmacopoeias limit the pyrogen content of pharmaceutical products for parenteral application and require the use of appropriate tests. Several decades after the Rabbit <b>Pyrogen</b> <b>Test</b> (RPT) and the Bacterial Endotoxin Test (BET) the Monocyte Activation Test (MAT) has been established as an in vitro method for the detection of pyrogens (1). The method was incorporated in the European Pharmacopoeia (EP 6. 7 Chapter 2. 6. 30) in April 2010 as a replacement for the RPT (2). The respective reception into the Pharmacopoeias of the United States (USP) and Japan (JP) so far has not taken place, though a positive peerreview was carried out by JaCVAM. The test method was recommended by ICCVAM following a comprehensive evaluation of its validation status. FDA endorsed the ICCVAM recommendation that these in vitro <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> methods may be considered on a case by case basis for the detection of Gram negative endotoxin in parenteral drugs, subject to product-specifi...|$|E

The reference standard was a 0. 9 % sodium chloride solution prepared to be pyrogen-free. Details of the preparation were described. The hypothesis was explored that the temperature response of rabbits after intravenous injection of the standard solution was independent of exogenous pyrogen. Reactions observed among the rabbits in our colony allowed a classification of these animals ranging from “consistently reliable” to “consistently unreliable. ” Details of the experimental results and implications for pyrogen testing are discussed. The recommendation was made that all rabbit test animals be “screened” in sham and actual tests before being used for pyrogen testing...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an in vitro test system for {{pyrogenic}} substances. Three clones derived from human monocytoid cell lines, which were selected by their high sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were assessed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Their response to pyrogen-containing samples was compared with that in a Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay and the rabbit <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test.</b> We show here that the induction of TNF in these clones is a valid in vitro alternative to determine endotoxin in commercial preparations requiring pyrogenicity testing. Cell clones derived from Mono Mac 6 (MM 6 2 H 8 and MM 6 4 B 5) responded to sub-ng/ml concentrations of complete rough-strain and smooth-strain LPS, to ng/ml concentrations of diphosphoryl-lipid A, and to microgram/ml concentrations of monophosphoryl-lipid A and to detoxified LPS. Cells reacted to > or = 1 microgram/ml lipoteichoic acid by TNF production, and were relatively insensitive to toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1) and to muramyl dipeptide adjuvant peptide. The reaction pattern of a clone derived from THP- 1 (THP- 1 1 G 3) was in general, similar to that of the MM 6 clones, except that THP- 1 1 G 3 failed to react to diphosphoryl-lipid A. When tested on commercial samples destined for parenteral use, there was a close correlation between a sensitive Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test and the cell culture test on the one hand, and between the <b>pyrogen</b> <b>test</b> and the cell culture test on the other hand. The data suggest that this cell-based test is able to recognize pyrogens derived from gram-negative organisms in test samples with appropriate sensitivity and specificity. This test appears to be able to eliminate some of the false-positive data obtained in the LAL test...|$|E
