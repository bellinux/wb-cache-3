The sodium nitrite induces methemoglobinemia in swine, i.e., it reduces the amount of oxygen that is released from hemoglobin, so the animal will feel faint and pass out, and then die in a humane manner after first being rendered unconscious. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department operates a research facility at Kerr Wildlife Management Area, where they examine feral <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> preferences and bait tactics to administer sodium nitrite.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two related}} Greek {{versions}} of the fable. Illustrating the ingratitude of those who requite good deeds with cruelty, it concerns a walnut tree (καρυα) standing by the roadside whose nuts the passersby used to knock off by throwing sticks and stones. It then complained, 'People gladly enjoy my fruits, {{but they have a}} terrible way of showing their gratitude.' Its complaint is related to a debate on gratitude that occurs in a parallel Indian story from the Panchatantra. There a mango tree is asked whether it is lawful to return evil for good and replies that its experience of man is violent treatment despite providing him with fruit and shade. On the other hand, the 18th century German rationalist, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, questioned whether there are real grounds for gratitude in his fable of [...] "The Oak Tree and the Swine". The <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> at the foot of an oak is reproached for its motives of pure greed by the tree and replies that it would only feel grateful if it could be sure that the oak had scattered the acorns there out of love for it.|$|E

40|$|Limited {{access to}} quality feeds and {{reliable}} feed supply are amongst the priority constraints of smallholder pig production in Uganda. Among the feeds given to pigs, sweetpotato (SP), banana and other root tubers residues are common. However, information on farmers’ perceptions and practices {{on the proper}} use of these residues for <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> is limited. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing those aspects, as well as to identify opportunities for better use of these residues in the pig-SP systems. A qualitative survey was undertaken in Masaka and Kamuli, two districts of Uganda with high pig population and SP production. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and Key Informant Interviews (KII) were undertaken with 80 small scale pig and SP producers and 24 key informants. Results from this study revealed that the majority of pig farmers in those districts use SP and other RTB crop residues as animal feed. During the rainy season, farmers scored high the utilization of SP crop residues, with the latter being the leading contributor to the pig diet especially in the rural area. SP crop residues are usually fed to pigs fresh without processing. Among the residues, fresh raw vines represent the largest part fed to pig (70 %), as compared to roots and peels. The way these residues are offered vary, for example in peri-urban areas with easier access to commercial feeds, farmers feed the crop residues mixed with concentrates; whereas in rural areas with limited access to commercial feeds, crop residues tend to be given without supplementation. However, the full potential of SP and other RTB crop residues for <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> is not yet fully exploited as farmers accept that a large amount is wasted (37 % in Masaka and 40 % in Kamuli). In Masaka, the proportion of SP crop residues utilized at household level mostly for <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> was 40 %, while in Kamuli was 52 %. This study demonstrated that there is potential for better use of SP and other RTB crop residues as pig feed in the smallholder pig farming systems in Uganda, but the major constraint as pointed out by farmers is the poor access to technologies for preserving these resources. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} further exploration of strategies for conserving SP and other RTB crop residues during the harvesting period for use in <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> during times of feed scarcity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{disposal}} of food waste {{is a large}} environmental problem. In the United Kingdom (UK), approximately 15 million tonnes of food are wasted each year, mostly disposed of in landfill, via composting, or anaerobic digestion (AD). European Union (EU) guidelines state that food waste should preferentially be used as animal feed though for most food waste this practice is currently illegal, because of disease control concerns. Interest in the potential diversion of food waste for animal feed is however growing, {{with a number of}} East Asian states offering working examples of safe food waste recycling – based on tight regulation and rendering food waste safe through heat treatment. This study investigates the potential benefits of diverting food waste for <b>pig</b> <b>feed</b> in the UK. A hybrid, consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to compare the environmental and health impacts of four technologies for food waste processing: two technologies of South Korean style-animal feed production (as a wet <b>pig</b> <b>feed</b> and a dry <b>pig</b> <b>feed)</b> were compared with two widespread UK disposal technologies: AD and composting.

The low impact of food waste feed stems in large part from its substitution of conventional feed, the production of which has substantial environmental and health impacts.

40|$|Corn must {{necessarily}} be more freely used {{than any other}} concentrated feed for pigs in the Corn Belt, because if properly used it is especially well adapted to <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> and can usually be marketed in this way to the very best advantage. But it is generally coming to be recognized that so far as health, thrift and rapidity of gains are concerned, corn alone, at least in dry lot feeding, does not give as satisfactory results, especially for growing pigs, as a combination of corn and some feed adding protein to the ration. Wheat shorts is very commonly considered as the best feed to use with corn for young pigs, but other feeds are. upon the market which contain still larger quantities of protein and their merits for <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> deserve investigation. If a small reduction {{in the cost of}} feeding each- hog in Iowa can be effected by the judicious uses of these feeds, the aggregate for the state will be enormous.

During the past season Iowa raised more corn than any other state, the crop being about 388, 000, 000 bushels. With feeds at the usual prices, it is an easy matter by their judicious selection to so supplement com as to add five to fifteen cents per bushel to the profit from feeding corn, thus effecting a reduction of 50 cents to $ 1. 00 on each 100 lbs. gain in weight by the pigs.

Overall, 11 isotope ratios were examined in three ham fractions: defatted dry matter of biceps femoris muscle and fat of biceps femoris muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue. The experimental hams were made out of pigs reared in three geographical areas (two in Italy – Friuli and Emilia – and one in Spain). In every location different productive factors were assessed as a potential source of isotope ratio variability, following suitable experimental designs. In particular, the effect of pig genetic type and rearing system was examined on 36 hams from heavy pigs belonging to three genotypes (Cinta Senese, Mora Romagnola and a commercial hybrid) kept on the same diet in Friuli both in stable or outdoor, in a fenced woody area. The influence of <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> regime was analysed by comparing the isotope ratios of 26 Dehesa de Extremadura PDO hams, obtained from heavy pigs fattened outdoor on grazed feedstuffs without (“Bellota” Iberian hams) or with concentrate supplement (“Campo” Iberian hams). The processing influence was examined on 36 hams from pigs reared on the same farm and diet in Emilia and seasoned for three different periods following the procedures of the three main Italian PDO hams (Parma, San Daniele and Toscano). The subcutaneous fat of these hams was sampled at both the outer (as usual) and inner layer.

40|$|By {{acquiring}} livestock poor {{farmers can}} ascend out of poverty. Pigs require minimal inputs and raising them is often within disadvantaged members of society’s means. In East Africa, 2. 2 million pigs are raised by resource-poor, subsistence farmers most with under 2 hectares of cropland. They typically raise 1 – 4 pigs {{to pay for}} school, medical costs, food, and seeds, but pig productivity is low. Lack of feed, seasonal feed shortages and unbalanced diets contribute to slow growth, resulting in compromised earnings from pig-raising. We estimated East African pig feedstuff nutrient composition through nutrient analysis and from literature. Seasonal availability was identified by local experts. Performance results from local-breed <b>pig</b> <b>feeding</b> trials were used to adjust the NRC (2012) nutrient requirement model for growing-finishing pigs. Local pigs’ nutrient requirements under typical management conditions (intestinal parasites present and free-ranging) were estimated. A least-cost diet formulation programme was used to generate diets minimising cost and human/pig competition for food, maximising agricultural co-products and forages use, considering seasonal availability, and satisfying minimal requirements for digestible energy 2960 kcal per kg of dry matter [DM]), calcium, standardised total tract digestible phosphorous, standardised ileal digestible crude protein and lysine (0. 28, 0. 13, 8. 5, and 0. 58 % of DM respectively) Feedstuffs availability differed between November-February; June-August; and March-May plus September-October. Estimated growth performance potential of local pigs is less when free-ranging, or intestinal parasite infected, than when restrained and non-infected (80; 217; and 259 g per day respectively) A typical least-cost diet for June-August (all as % of DM) is: maize flour 20. 6; cassava leaf 20. 0; sweet potato vine 19. 2; ripe avocado 15. 0; Bidens pilosa 7. 9; limestone 7. 7; molasses 5. 0; cattle blood 3. 9; Amaranthus spinosus 0. 3; table salt 0. 24; premix 0. 10.
