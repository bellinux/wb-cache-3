Although Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are attracting greater commercial interest, current research has not adequately captured the real-world constraints in VANET handover techniques. Therefore, {{in order to have}} the best practice for VANET services, it is necessary to have seamless connectivity for optimal coverage and ideal channel utilization: this comes at the cost of overlapping signals of adjacent RSUs. This overlapping effect can be investigated using concepts such Network Dwell <b>Time,</b> <b>Time</b> Before <b>Handover</b> and Exit <b>Times.</b> In this simulation study we investigate the feasibility and benefits of providing a ubiquitous communication in VANET under different mobile environments. We also study the impact of beacon frequency and velocity on Network Dwell <b>Time,</b> <b>Time</b> Before <b>Handover</b> and Exit <b>Times,</b> which will help us to <b>predict</b> the <b>handover</b> <b>times</b> and thus make proactive handover possible.

40|$|When {{performing}} handovers in an IEEE 802. 11 wire-less network, a {{low latency}} handover can be crucial for some applications. Previous attempts to obtain low latency <b>handover</b> <b>times</b> are {{often based on}} hardware or driver specific solutions. This paper outlines two hardware and driver independent methods to decrease the <b>handover</b> <b>time.</b> The first method use fixed size wait states in order to resolve timing issues that arises during a handover procedure. The second method re-solves the same timing issues, using a dynamic ap-proach. Results show that the two methods achieve <b>handover</b> <b>times</b> below 73 ms and 100 ms respectively with 95 % confidence.

40|$|Today, the {{computation}} {{power and}} storage capability on mobile devices are increasing rapidly, and together with new interactive services {{this creates a}} demand for more bandwidth. To keep track of this evolution, the use of heterogeneous networks has gained focus. Instead of only using one type of network, it is desired to utilize all carriers available on a device, and hence choose the one best suited. This thesis describes and discusses different approaches to session continuity. The different solutions include Mobile IP, Generic Access Networks (GAN), and proposals based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Current solutions are not satisfactory {{in the terms of}} handover delay, and hence best suited for non-realtime applications.

40|$|Abstract—: Existing {{wireless}} networks aim {{to provide}} information communication services between mobile nodes. As a mobile node move between different radio networks, a handover process is needed to change its point of attachment to the predicted radio network. Since traditional (based on one metric Received Signal Strength Indicator) predictions of handover decisions do not perform well, it is a pressing need to develop an intelligent approach to <b>predict</b> the <b>handover</b> decision process, thus yielding seamless handovers. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Mobility and Signal Strength-Aware Hand-off Decision (MSSHD) approach to <b>predict</b> the <b>handover</b> decision in wireless networks. The Received Signal Strength Indicator and the direction of Mobile Node parameters are considered as inputs to the fuzzy inference system to <b>predict</b> the <b>handover</b> decision, and hence switching to the best preferable access point. To achieve a fair comparison with a standard handover performance, we have implemented a MSSHD approach in Omnet++.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of vertical handover (VHO) algorithms for seamless mobility between WiFi and UMTS networks. We focus on a no-coupling scenario, characterized {{by the lack of}} any form of cooperation between the involved players (users and network operators). In this “hostile ” scenario, the VHO operations are completely operated by the mobile terminal (MT), and the network authentication procedures are unoptimized, leading to typically long <b>handover</b> <b>times.</b> In this context, we first propose a low-complexity Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) -based algorithm and, then, an improved hybrid RSSI/goodput version. We present experimental results based on the implementation of a real testbed with commercial WiFi (Guglielmo) and UMTS (Telecom Italia) Italian deployed networks. Despite the relatively long <b>handover</b> <b>times</b> experienced in our testbed, the proposed RSSI-based VHO algorithm guarantees an effective goodput increase at the MTs. Moreover, this algorithm mitigates the ping-pong phenomenon. Our results show that, by using simple MT-driven VHO mechanisms, the users can benefit from redundant and heterogeneous wireless network infrastructures. This can be done by leveraging on pre-existing commercially deployed networks, without the need for any modification of them. ...|$|R
