5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, I think maybe, the most passionate {{one on the}} record. I mean, I'm really <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> because that's really one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has really very good sexual images, images of cars - which I always like.|$|E
5|$|The GWR has {{featured}} in many television programmes, {{such as the}} BBC children's drama series God's Wonderful Railway in 1980. It was also immortalised in Bob Godfrey's animated film Great, which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film of 1975 which {{tells the story of}} Brunel's engineering accomplishments. In The Railway Series by the Rev. Wilbert Awdry, two of the North Western Railway's engines, Duck, and Oliver, and a brakevan named Toad, are from the Great Western Railway, with Duck being especially <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

25|$|Many rival fans in Argentina {{refer to}} the Boca Juniors' fans as Los Bosteros (the manure handlers), {{originating}} from the horse manure used in the brick factory which occupied the ground where La Bombonera stands.

Hermes is also a former champion in Olympic Limbo, a sport derived from the popular party activity. He gave up limbo after the 2980 Olympics when a young fan, imitating him, broke his back and died. Hermes has a wife, LaBarbara, and a 12-year-old son, Dwight.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, Thomas Edison {{created the}} Motion Picture Patents Company {{as a way}} to control the film {{industry}} in the United States and Europe. The companies that joined the conglomerate were Edison, Biograph, Vitagraph, Essanay, Selig, Lubin, Kalem, American Pathé and Méliès' Star Film Company, with Edison acting as president of the collective. Star Films was obligated to supply the MPPC with one thousand feet of film per week, and Méliès made fifty eight films that year in fulfillment of the obligation. Gaston Méliès established his own studio in Chicago, the Méliès Manufacturing Company, which helped his brother fulfill the obligation to Edison, although Gaston produced no films in 1908. That year, Méliès made one of his most ambitious films: Humanity Through the Ages. This pessimistic film retells the history of humans from Cain and Abel to the Hague Peace Conference of 1907. The film was unsuccessful, yet Méliès was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|The {{good news}} is, I'm finally {{working on my}} debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

[...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. It took me a while but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|E
500|$|On Metacritic, a site {{which uses}} a {{weighted}} mean score, the season scored a 79/100 from six critics, translating to [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] However, the show was controversial from its beginning. The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents to characterize him as a poor role model for children. Several US public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts, such as one featuring Bart and the caption [...] "Underachiever ('And <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> man!')". Despite the ban, The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated US$2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales.|$|E

Cawley later said [...] "Marc is all about using this production to further his own career, a stark difference between his goal {{and all the others}} who were there doing it, did we aspire to be a pro-looking production? Yup. And we were and are <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Did we take salaries and/or compensation? Nope. That was a tough episode to shoot for many reasons." ...|$|E

The scene they always cut out is the scene when Heathcliff digs up Catherine's body and dances in the {{moonlight}} and on the beach with it. I think you can't get much more operatic or passionate than that. I was trying to write a song about dead things coming to life. I was trying to write a song about being enslaved and obsessed by love, not just enchanted and happy with it. It was about the dark side of love; about the ability to be resurrected by it...

500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think {{the thing is that}} I have a lot of younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E

500|$|Within days {{of their}} arrival at Scapa Flow, Battleship Division Nine began {{participating}} in the frequent maneuvers and drills that typified the day to day existence of the Grand Fleet. Because of the good condition and high speed of the American battleships, Admiral Beatty assigned them {{to be one of}} the two divisions of [...] "fast battleships" [...] that operated at either ends of the Grand Fleet when it was steaming in battle line formation. As stipulated by the Grand Fleet Battle Orders, the Sixth Battle Squadron was to take station at the rear of the line, where its duty was to engage the rear division of German battleships. However, should the fleet execute a sudden turnaround maneuver, the American ships would become the van squadron, meaning they would lead into battle. The position was an important one, and the Americans were particularly <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

I'm so <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and hope you love it – enjoy!". The video was released on 12 February 2010. In the video, scenes of Lewis performing in front of a heart engulfed in flames, as well as sitting on an apartment floor barefoot, are intercut throughout the video amongst the narrative of the video.

500|$|The Simpsons was the Fox network's first {{television}} series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. In 1990, Bart quickly {{became one of}} the most popular characters on television in what was termed [...] "Bartmania". He became the most prevalent Simpsons character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts. In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; as many as one million were sold on some days. Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as [...] "I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?" [...] and [...] "Underachiever ('And <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> man!')". The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated $2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales.
