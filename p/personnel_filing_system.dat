40|$|The {{research}} {{area of the}} new economics of personnel has a short but important and insightful history. Theory ahead of measurement asks for testing newly developed human resource concepts. These tests often need detailed firm-specific data. Repetition and comparison of results is key in finding out what holds true in general and what marks idiosyncrasy. In this paper, we compare results from the existing literature with the outcomes from analyzing personnel data of the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker during the period January 1, 1987, the day the company started with their electronic <b>personnel</b> <b>filing</b> <b>system,</b> until March 15, 1996, the day the company filed for bankruptcy. We shed light on differences in the functioning of internal labor markets during periods of workforce growth and decline. We find multiple ports of entry that are concentrated in low blue and white-collar levels. New entrants are younger and have higher educational levels than incumbent workers who are promoted to similar jobs. Despite substantial variation in individual wages, careers are important as wages are strongly related to job levels. Promotion rates fall and demotion rates rise when the firm enters the stage of demise. Job-rotation improves promotion chances, stimulates wage growth, and reduces the lay-off risk...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2012, {{however, the}} Washington Times {{reported}} that Ellerbe was never fully vetted before being hired by Gray. The newspaper {{said that the}} Gray administration {{did not ask for}} Ellerbe's <b>personnel</b> <b>file</b> from Sarasota, where he spent nearly six months as chief before returning to Washington, D.C. The <b>personnel</b> <b>file,</b> obtained by the newspaper, revealed that several female firefighters in Sarasota had accused Ellerbe of sexual harassment. Ellerbe allegedly defended his actions to Sarasota Battalion Chief Joe Robinson that staring at women's breasts was [...] "part of my heritage" [...] and that none {{of the women in the}} department were good-looking. Robinson also claimed that Ellerbe warned staff not to [...] "cross" [...] him and that he was vindictive. Ellerbe denied harassing anyone, denied making the statements, and claimed the charges were made by union members upset with changes he made in the department. Ellerbe also claimed that Sarasota County found the allegations false, although the Washington Times reported there was no such finding in the <b>personnel</b> <b>file.</b> Sarasota County administrator Dave Bullock told the newspaper that Ellerbe was counseled regarding the county's sexual harassment policy after the incident, but that such counseling is routine after any such allegation (legitimate or not).

40|$|From its inception, UNIX {{has been}} built around two {{fundamental}} entities: processes and files. In this chapter, {{we look at the}} implementation of files in Solaris and discuss the framework for <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> 14. 1 <b>File</b> <b>System</b> Framework Solaris OS includes a framework, the virtual <b>file</b> <b>system</b> framework, under which multiple <b>file</b> <b>system</b> types are implemented. Earlier implementations of UNIX used a single <b>file</b> <b>system</b> type for all of the mounted <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> typically, the UFS <b>file</b> <b>system</b> from BSD UNIX. The virtual <b>file</b> <b>system</b> framework was developed to allow Sunâ€™s distributed computing <b>file</b> <b>system</b> (NFS) to coexist with the UFS <b>file</b> <b>system</b> in SunOS 2. 0; it became a standard part of System V in SVR 4 and Solaris OS. We can categorize Solaris <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> into the following types: Storage-based. Regular <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> that provide facilities for persistent storage and management of data. The Solaris UFS and PC/DOS <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> are examples. Network <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> that provide <b>files</b> that are accessible in a local directory structure but are stored on a remote network server; for example, NFS. Pseudo <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> that present various abstractions as files in a <b>file</b> <b>system.</b> The /proc pseudo <b>file</b> <b>system</b> represents the address space of a process as a series of files. 657 658 Chapter 14 <b>File</b> <b>System</b> Framework The framework provides a single set of well-defined interfaces that are <b>file</b> <b>system</b> independent; the implementation details of each <b>file</b> <b>system</b> are hidden behind these interfaces. Two key objects represent these interfaces: the virtual file, or vnode, and the virtual <b>file</b> <b>system,</b> or vfs objects. The vnode interfaces implement file-related functions, and the vfs interfaces implement <b>file</b> <b>system</b> management functions. The vnode and vfs interfaces direct functions to specific <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> {{depending on the type of}} <b>file</b> <b>system</b> being operated on. Figure 14. 1 shows the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> layers. File-related functions are initiated through a system call or from another kernel subsystem and are directed to the appropriate <b>file</b> <b>system</b> by the vnode/vfs layer...|$|R

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of Storage Networking, distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> that allow data sharing through shared disks will become vital. We refer to Cluster <b>File</b> <b>Systems</b> as a distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> optimized for environments of clustered servers. The requirements such <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> is that they guarantee <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> consistency while allowing shared access from multiple nodes in a shared-disk environment. In this paper we evaluate three approaches for designing a cluster <b>file</b> <b>system</b> - conventional client/server distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> symmetric shared <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> and asymmetric shared <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> These alternatives are considered by using our prototype cluster <b>file</b> <b>system,</b> HAMFS (Highly Available Multi-server <b>File</b> <b>System).</b> HAMFS is classified as an asymmetric shared <b>file</b> <b>system.</b> Its technologies are incorporated into our commercial cluster <b>file</b> <b>system</b> product named SafeFILE. SafeFILE offers a disk pooling facility that supports off-the-shelf disks, and balances file load across these disks automatically and dynamically. From our measurements, we identify the required disk capabilities, such as multi-node tag queuing. We also identify the advantages of an asymmetric shared <b>file</b> <b>system</b> over other alternatives...|$|R
