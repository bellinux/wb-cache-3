50|$|Burma reed damages native Florida {{ecosystems}} by crowding and shading out understory {{plant species}} and by creating conditions for extremely hot and destructive wildfires. In southern Florida, in Miami-Dade County, including Everglades National Park, it {{is a serious}} threat to the globally imperiled pine rocklands community whose pine canopy was largely destroyed in 1992 by Hurricane Andrew. Burma reed is a highly combustible fuel source because of its high overall <b>plant</b> <b>mass,</b> its large feathery flower plumes, and its production of dense, hay-like leaf litter. This litter enhances fire movement along the ground, while the flower plumes carry the flames high into the air. With the aid of winds, these plumes often detach and fly through the air like torches, providing the potential for additional spread. Photographs of its ignition during a wildfire show flames leaping over 30 ft high, threatening nearby tree canopies.|$|E

50|$|Philodendron bipinnatifidum is a {{tropical}} plant {{that is usually}} grown in full sun, but can tolerate and adapt to deep shade. It grows best in rich, moisture-retentive soil that can be slightly alkaline. However, it cannot tolerate high salt concentration in soil.It is capable of supporting itself at massive heights by producing tree-like bases. However, it will exhibit epiphytic characteristics if {{given the opportunity to}} attach itself to a nearby supporting tree and climb upon it. The trunk of this plant can send down many strong aerial roots that not only give support to the overall <b>plant</b> <b>mass,</b> but also serve to absorb water and nutrients from the soil. This plant is greatly known for its ease in covering a land mass, and typically spread out its tree-like trunk from anywhere between eight and ten feet. Alternatively, if grown in cooler climates with at least some freezing winter weather, its entire aboveground structures will die back completely at a hard frost and then sprout back from the roots the following spring.|$|E
50|$|Leymus arenarius {{can grow}} {{exponentially}} {{in terms of}} height and root growth {{in the presence of}} nitrogen. Leymus arenarius is known to take up nitrogen into its root system. Raising nitrogen concentrations can aid in growth as over time <b>plant</b> <b>mass</b> above to surface will not change, but will accumulate in the root system. The roots themselves also retain nitrogen as they come in contact with it and in the surrounding un-vegetated areas. This assists in primary succession with surrounding flora and fauna, and a decrease in soil erosion. After volcanic events L. arenarius causes dunes and their soil depth to grow exponentially over time. Nitrogen increases seed production, raising the yield of seeds as much as 70% in Icelandic L. arenarius. The seed density also increased with the addition of nitrogen, in comparison to phosphorus and potassium which only produce marginal increases for both seed yield and density. Leaf size and density are also influenced by nutrient additions. Removing nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium resulted in a reduction of leaf mass up to 20%. Nitrogen usage is a cost effective tool to use to increase abundance and effectiveness of L.arenarius.|$|E
5000|$|Cultivating {{the type}} of {{determined}} bushy plants, like eggplant, tomato, chili and peppers, many growers decided to guide/tutor their plants with two [...] "walls" [...] of netting, {{one on each side}} of the furrow, therefore creating a growing system where the branches will be supported on their own without any need for manual tutoring. With this system, the lower string of the bottom mesh nearest the soil on one side of the plant is tied gently (leaving about 4-10 cm, 2-4 inches in between the two nets) with the lowest string on the other side (this job is done when the plant is about 40 cm in height, 16 inches). As the plant keeps growing, the distance in between the two walls of net also keeps increasing (30-60 cm) so that each higher branch will be supported by the nearest mesh and be able to reach full vegetative development. By allowing the plant to grow at 360 degrees, and to fully express its vegetative vigor, it will allow any fumigation to reach vegetable matter and leaves far into the <b>plant</b> <b>mass</b> so that the chemical may attack the targeted pathogens effectively and therefore reduce the recurrence of diseases and further chemical uses.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the weevils, research has been conducted on the effects of weevils in different habitats of S. minima. In 2005-2006, a research group from Louisiana State University (LSU) introduced salvinia weevils into Gramercy, LA, where S. minima is present. The salvinia weevils were collected from Florida and kept in greenhouses on the LSU campus in Baton Rouge. In the study, the effects of the weevils on S. minima were compared to the effects of the salvinia stem-borer moth, Samea multiplicalis. The stem-borer moth is a species native to the southern United States and is known to feed on other salvinia species in the same genus. Both the moth and the weevil feed on salvinia plants and control its spread. The study had four treatments: the weevil alone, the moth larvae alone, the weevil and moth larvae combined, and a control group. Each group was placed in a 1-m2 poyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe frame that was placed over a section of S. minima in a waterway in Gramercy. There were four replicates of each treatment. Each month during the research, S. minima <b>plant</b> <b>mass</b> was collected from each treatment square and then measured to find the dry weight of the plant. Data were compiled into bar charts to compare the effects of the four treatments over time. The results of this study found that the three treatments all had a significant effect in decreasing the amount of S. minima in an area when compared to the control group, though none of the three experimental treatments were statistically better than the other two. From June to October 2006, the average biomass of S. minima in the treatment groups was 100-375 grams, whereas the average biomass of S. minima in the control frames was 450-600 grams. The salvinia stem-borer moth is native to the United States and presents no threat to the environment. There are also no known negative impacts of introducing the non-indigenous salvinia weevils to the environment, as they feed exclusively on S. minima and S. molesta.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduced}} tree, Sapium sebiferum, is {{a serious}} invader throughout the southeastern United States. Low herbivore loads, commonly attributed to high herbivore resistance, are assumed to give Sapium a competitive advantage over native vegetation. Because herbivory resistance is considered energetically expensive, we predicted that if Sapium experienced higher levels of damage its growth would significantly decrease. We {{examined the effects of}} different levels of simulated leaf herbivory on the growth of Sapium and Celtis laevigata, a native tree, at three levels of nitrogen and three lev-els of light availability. Potted seedlings were grown in a complete factorial design. Stem height growth rate, diameter growth rate and <b>plant</b> <b>mass</b> of both Sapium and Celtis were significantly af-fected by shade and nitrogen treatments.
