40|$|AbstractWe have {{recently}} developed from {{red blood cells}} a new delivery system called nanoErythrosomes. These nanovesicles offer {{a high degree of}} versatility for the encapsulation of biological or nonbiological compounds and for the binding of targeting agents. In particular, <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> can be conjugated by a covalent link to the basic amino acid residues constitutive of the different proteins. The binding of <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> to the nanoErythrosome membrane could be interesting for the therapeutic use of this delivery system since it could overcome heterologous immunogenicity and reduce rapid clearance from circulation. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of temperature on the nanoErythrosome behavior in the absence and presence of conjugated <b>polyethyleneglycols.</b> More specifically, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to evaluate the lipid order and dynamics, the hydration and the degree of protein aggregation of the nanoErythrosomes after covalent binding of <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> having molecular weights of 2000 and 5000 g mol− 1. The results indicate that the nanoErythrosome lipid chain order is not significantly affected by heating the nanoErythrosomes at temperatures up to 50 °C. They also indicate that the nanoErythrosome proteins aggregate irreversibly at temperatures above 37 °C, this effect being abolished in the presence of <b>polyethyleneglycols.</b> The presence of <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> decreases the accessibility of water to the lipid head groups. On the other hand, 31 P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy results reveal that the presence of <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> prevents the aggregation of the nanoErythrosome structures...|$|R

Piglets of varying age (0 - 168 h) {{were given a}} mixture of different sized <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> (414 - 942 dalton <b>polyethyleneglycols)</b> together with ovalbumin and bovine serum albumin by stomach tube, and the serum concentrations were determined two hours after feeding. Considerable amounts of ovalbumin and bovine serum albumin {{were found in the}} serum of animals up to 24 hours of age, whereas very little or none at all was found in sera from older animals. By contrast, an {{intestinal permeability}} barrier to <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> in the 414 - 942 dalton range was found not only in the older animals but in all pigs investigated, including the newborn, unsuckled. In addition, the permeability barrier to <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> was found in a pig which was starved to prevent macromolecular closure and, therefore, absorbed considerable amounts of bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin. These findings indicate that 414 - 942 dalton <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> cross the intestinal mucosa at different rates due to size regardless of age of the animals and regardless of whether the mucosa is permeable to protein or not. This suggests that low molecular weight molecules like 414 - 942 dalton <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> and macromolecules (proteins) cross the neonatal gut wall through different routes...|$|R

These so-called straight phase column sets are very suitable for Hydrocarbon analysis. Therefore, these are still used most frequent in Oil and Gas industry. If the application is to determine more polar compounds in a non-polar matrix. The reverse phase column set gives more resolution for the polar compounds. The first dimension column in this situation is a polar column, followed by a mid-polar second dimension column.For each application there can be an optimal column set. In this respective you can use also chiral columns for optical isomer separation or for example PLOT columns for volatiles and gas samples.To optimize the application {{is a bit more}} complex compared to 1D separations, as there are more parameters involved. Flow and oven temperature program are still very important but also hot jet pulse duration, length of the second dimension column and modulation time have a big influence on the final results. The outcome is also different. No longer a traditional chromatogram is produced, but now a 3 dimensional plot is produced by specially designed software [...] packages. It is a different way of evaluate data, but you get much more information.

These ligands make their surface {{hydrophobic}} and hence are not dispersible in aqueous solution, preventing their biological applications. One simple method to increase solubility in aqueous solvents is direct ligand exchange. This requires a more favored ligand to replace the initial ones. The hydrophobic native ligand capping the NP during synthesis (usually a long chain molecule like oleic acid) is directly substituted with a more polar hydrophilic one, which are usually multi chelating (e.g. <b>poly(ethyleneglycol)</b> (PEG)-phosphate, poly(acrylic acid)) and hence provides better stabilisation/ binding resulting in their exchange. A shortcoming of this method is the slow kinetics associated with the exchange. Generally the new ligand is also functionalized with a group like thiol that allows for facile binding to the NP surface. The protocol for direct exchange is simple, generally involving mixing {{for an extended period}} of time, but the work-up can be tedious, conditions must be optimized for each system, and aggregation may occur However the two-step process of ligand exchange involves the removal of original ligands followed by coating hydrophilic ones, which is a better method. The ligand removal step here was reported through various ways. A simple way was wash the particles with ethanol under ultrasonic treatment. Reagents like NOBF4 or acids are used to strip the native ligands off of the NP surface to attach favorable ones later on. This method shows less tendency for NP aggregation than the direct exchange, and can be generalized to other types of nanoparticles.|$|E
