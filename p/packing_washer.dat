5000|$|Special {{attention}} {{had to be}} paid to drawbar clearance in the drawbar pockets. Where clearance was insufficient, {{the buffer}} beam could be cut away within reason, and where clearance was excessive, a suitable <b>packing</b> <b>washer</b> could be inserted under the engine end of the drawbar, while taking care that there was ample clearance between the drawbar and the top of the opening in the tender.|$|E
40|$|A two-component foam {{spray gun}} is readily {{disassembled}} for cleaning. It includes a body (1) with reactant (12, 14) and purge gas (16) inlet ports. A moldable valve packing (32) {{inside the body}} has a tapered conical interior surface (142), and apertures which match the reactant ports. A valve/tip (40) has a conical outer surface (48) which mates with the valve packing (32). The valve/tip (40) is {{held in place by}} a moldable <b>packing</b> <b>washer</b> (34), held at non-constant pressure by a screw (36, 38). The interior of the valve/tip (40) houses a removable mixing chamber (50). The mixing chamber (50) has direct flow orifices (60) and an auxiliary flow path (58, 60) which ameliorate pressure surges. The spray gun can be disassembled for cleaning without disturbing the seal, by removing the valve/tip (40) to the rear, thereby breaking it free of the conical packing. Rotation of the valve/tip (40) relative to the body (1) shuts off the reactant flow, and starts the purge gas flow...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{laboratory}} scale research {{have been presented}} {{on the effects of}} an oxidizing reactor on ozone consumption and by-producs composition and separation of simultaneous NOx and SO 2 removal from a carrier gas by ozonation method and absorption in an alkaline solution. The additional Dreschel washer added before two washers containing 100 ml of 0. 1 molar NaOH solution played the role of an oxidation reactor. Its effect was investigated using an empty (dry or wetted) or filled with <b>packing</b> elements <b>washer.</b> The measured by-products in a scrubber and in the oxidizing reactor were SO 32 -, SO 42 -, NO 2 - and NO 3 - ions, respectively. It has been shown that use of oxidizing reactor improves NOx removal efficiency reducing ozone consumption. Wetting of the oxidation reactor with water enables a preliminary separation of sulphur and nitrogen species between the oxidizing reactor and an alkaline absorber. Application of packing elements in the oxidizing reactor allows to retain 90 % of nitrogen compounds in it. Some results were confirmed by tests in pilot scale...|$|R
40|$|Fusel oil is a {{side product}} of ethanol {{manufacturing}} process through the fermentation of molasses. Sometimes, fusel oil is accidently mixed with liquid waste {{from the bottom}} of alcohol rectifying column. This mixture is called lutter washer. Fusel oil contains isoamyl alcohol, n-amyl alcohol, and other alcohols. Isoamyl alcohol is the raw material of organic ester. Further processing is required to increase the economic value of fusel oil, such as the separation of components by distillation. In this study, the composition of isoamyl alcohol and n-amyl alcohol in the residue in the distillation process as a function of distillation time in a packing column was evaluated. An artificial waste lutter washer was used as a raw materials in this experiment. The processes were conducted using a distillation column with a cylindrical dan spherical glass <b>packing</b> materials. Lutter <b>washer</b> was distilled with total reflux until the equilibrium temperature was reached, then the data of the experiment was taken during 180 minutes at the condition of reflux at 5 / 5 (5 minutes distillate was returned to the tower and 5 minutes distillate was collected). The composition of the distillation residue were evaluated at interval time of 30 minutes. The same processes were evaluated using different heights of packing materials. The data show that the highest composition of isoamyl alcohol and n-amyl alcohol are 21. 99 % and 3. 70 % of the 15 mL total residue, respectively. It is obtained in the distillation process that used the packing materials with ball shape, the column with 85 cm of height and 3. 5 cm of diameter...|$|R
