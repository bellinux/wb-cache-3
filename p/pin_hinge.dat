5000|$|Hinge screws — {{longer or}} {{specialized}} screws that prevent {{the door from}} being simply pulled out after removing the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins.</b> Often the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> itself is screwed, from the inside while the door is open, into the hinge to prevent removal of the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> without first opening the door.|$|R
40|$|A hinge (20) {{includes}} two hinge plates (22, 24) and a connecting <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32). A coil spring (48) supported on a bushing (44) overlies the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32), which {{is free to}} move along its longitudinal axis (30). A cam follower (42) on the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32) engages a cam (32) mounted {{to one of the}} hinge plates (22), so that the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32) slides longitudinally as the hinge plates (22, 24) pivot relative to each other about the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32). As the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32) slides longitudinally, it axially compresses or decompresses the spring (48). The cam (32) is oriented such that pivoting of the hinge plates (22, 24) in either direction from an open position compresses the spring (48), providing a restoring force which tends to retain the hinge plates (22, 24) in the open position...|$|R

40|$|To {{the untrained}} observer, the knee joint {{may appear to}} {{function}} as a simple <b>pinned</b> <b>hinge</b> joint (ginglymus), with flexion-extension rotation the only apparent motion between the tibia and femur; however, this is not the case. The motion characteristics of the articular surfaces of the tibia relative to the femur are very complex and are guided by the ACL and the other primary ligaments that span the knee. Studies performed using cadaveric models have revealed that the ACL is the primary restraint to anterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur 51, 94 and acts as a restraint to internal-external rotation, 89, 138, 178 varus-valgus angulation, 175 and combinations thereof. 138, 177 With the advent of advanced image-based measurement tech-niques, research has progressed to study knee biomechan-ics in humans during dynamic activities.

50|$|A {{substantial}} <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{joins the}} {{two parts of the}} rifle or shotgun; the stock with its firing mechanism and the fore-piece and barrel, which hold the round to be fired. In some cases the <b>hinging</b> <b>pin</b> may be easily removable, allowing the two portions of the weapon to be compactly and safely stored. In other cases the hinge will consist of a hook over a pin; releasing an auxiliary latch will allow sufficient travel to allow the hinge to be unhooked.|$|R

50|$|Other {{changes were}} implemented, some during the war, {{but not all}} M1917s {{received}} these updates. Beginning in 1938, the pivot in the top cover was replaced with a new one that would become standard on all M1919 series guns. While the World War I pattern top cover <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{appears to have been}} retained on most converted M1917s, the later production M1917A1s had a positive locking top cover <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> that allowed the top cover to remain open lessening the chance of it dropping closed on one's hands while working on the gun—this became the standard on all M1919 series guns.|$|R
30|$|The {{assessment}} {{was based on}} crack initiation only and hence complete dislocation was not investigated here. But as the wall thickness from the drilled hole to the outer surface of the bone is small, {{it can be concluded}} by simple engineering reasoning that complete rupture of the opposite cortex follows soon after crack initiation. These data suggest that the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> offers no relevant benefit for the treatment of malalignment since the need for correction in patients with varus alignment is frequently above 8 ° of correction. It is well documented that the risk of revarisation {{in the presence of the}} opposite cortex fracture increases with every degree of valgus correction (Pape et al. 2004 a, 2004 b). Obviously, the current study suggests that the cortex-preserving <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> effect is absent in larger corrections exceeding 5 °. This observation is confirmed in an experimental study by Reyle et al. (2017), which used human cadaver tibial bone, artificial Synbones and Sawbones to investigate the fracture of the lateral hinge in an open-wedge HTO with and without a <b>hinge</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Contender is how the barrel is {{attached}} to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is exposed; by pushing this <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber or length can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for this change.|$|R
50|$|The core, foot {{deck and}} {{peduncle}} are constructed of anodized CNC machined aluminum. The flukes are {{a composite of}} rubber compression molded around an aluminum core frame. The <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is 316 stainless steel with a delrin bearing.|$|R
30|$|The {{current study}} {{suggests}} that the drill hole (<b>hinge</b> <b>pin)</b> {{at the end of}} the horizontal osteotomy reduces the stresses in the contralateral cortex and hence increases the critical opening angle prior to cracking of the opposite cortex in specimen with small correction angles. But the difference from having a drill hole or not is not so significant, especially for older patients. The ductility of the cortical bone is the decisive parameter for the calculated critical opening angle. Transferred to clinical practice, these data suggest that the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is an asset, but not the decisive parameter, and it cannot avoid cracking and rupture of the opposite cortex in cases of larger correction angles.|$|R
50|$|The Contender, first {{introduced}} in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle {{with a number}} of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is exposed; by pushing this <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out.|$|R
5000|$|This {{style of}} rifle {{is made by}} {{combining}} an AR-15 upper receiver with an AR-15 lower receiver {{which has not been}} banned by specific name, and which has a fixed, non-detachable 10-round (maximum, anything above 10 is a felony) magazine. In such a configuration, otherwise prohibited features such as a telescoping stock, pistol grip, and flash hider may be present. While formerly prohibited under the now-expired federal assault weapon ban of 1994-2004, the presence of a bayonet lug is not prohibited by California state law and can be present on firearms without violation. However, the magazine cannot be detachable, so to load the rifle the shooter must either [...] "top load" [...] or use a tool to release the magazine lock (such as the tip of a bullet in [...] "bullet button" [...] equipped rifles). To top-load, the shooter pulls the rear takedown <b>pin,</b> <b>hinges</b> the upper receiver on the front pivot pin, and loads the now exposed magazine. Alternatively, several [...] "magazine lock" [...] devices are available which replace the magazine release button with an inset pin that requires the use of a special tool to release the magazine, thereby, disallowing a readily [...] "detachable magazine", to be compliant with California state firearms law.|$|R

40|$|During {{the time}} frame {{allocated}} by the delivery order, members of the UAH Applied Research Program, {{with the cooperation of}} representatives from NASA investigated and conducted stress analysis of the SEDSAT 1 satellite. The main area of concern was with the design of the deployable 10 m antennas. The placement of the holes for the antenna door <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> was too close {{to the edge of the}} antenna canister. Because of the load placed on the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin,</b> the stress analysis of this area suggested that more space would be needed between the holes and the edge of the material. Due to other conflicts, SEDSATI was removed from flying on the space shuttle and moved to the Delta Launch Vehicle. This changed many of the design requirements for the mounting and deployment of the satellite that forced a new design for the satellite. Once this happened, the stress analysis became obsolete, and the task was concluded...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} regularities of {{the influence}} of forces of viscous resistance generated by the damper device in the cylindrical hinges of the nodes connect the links of the crane-manipulator units mobile transport-technological ma-chines. The specified effect is considered on the efficiency of the damping of oscillations of the metal in the process of operation, due to the presence of increased clearances due to wear of the holes of the hinge eyes. It is shown that the force of viscous resistance should be considered in addition to the generated damping devices forces of elastic resis-tance, as the latter determine the effectiveness of damping in general. The main role of forces of viscous resistance is the dissipation of energy of an oscillatory turning movement of the mating parts of the metal structures due to oscilla-tory displacement of the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> within the <b>hinge</b> gap until the complete decay of oscillations. Considered in relation to the crane-manipulator installing mobile transport-technological machines AST- 4 -A the effect of the action of forces of viscous resistance is almost not observed when the coefficient of viscous damping less than 0. 01 MN∙s/m, in the range 0, 01 [...] . 0, 05 MN∙s/m this influence begins to manifest itself more and more noticeable, in the range of 0, 05 [...] . 0, 4 MN∙s/m has a lot of damping vibrational displacement of the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> within the gap, while the coefficient of viscous damping more than 0. 4 MN∙s/m oscillatory process becomes aperiodic with an almost complete attenuation in the range of one oscillation of the hinged finger...|$|R

50|$|The {{receiver}} on a Contender, whether G1 or G2, is {{the portion}} of the combined grip/buttstock assembly containing the trigger mechanism, and this is legally considered the serial-numbered gun. Hence, barrels with iron sights, barrels with telescopic sights, and even the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin,</b> are all simply gun parts, with no serial numbers, making the choice of changing cartridges from a multitude of rimfire, centerfire rifle and pistol cartridges, and even shotgun shells, very simple.|$|R
50|$|All {{the timber}} members were glue-laminated and {{pressure}} treated with preservative pentachlorophenol in oil. Any wooden portions which were cut or drilled {{also had an}} application of copper naphthenate. The steel <b>pins</b> in the <b>hinges</b> at the crown and abutments were chrome plated to reduce friction and prevent corrosion. All other steel was hot-dipped galvanized, given a tie-coat, and covered by epoxy and a top coat of brown urethane, a system designed to provide thirty years of protection.|$|R
50|$|Friction welding is {{also used}} with thermoplastics, which act in a fashion {{analogous}} to metals under heat and pressure. The heat and pressure used on these materials is much lower than metals, but the technique {{can be used to}} join metals to plastics with the metal interface being machined. For instance, the technique can be used to join eyeglass frames to the <b>pins</b> in their <b>hinges.</b> The lower energies and pressures used allows for a wider variety of techniques to be used.|$|R
50|$|In door hinges, {{bearings}} sit {{between the}} <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> and housing to ensure smooth {{movement of the}} door when it is opened and closed by passengers. Composite bearings are used {{in a number of}} automotive hinge systems due to their durability under high loads and corrosion resistance.
