25|$|Clinical <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> {{focus on}} {{treating}} mental health specialize in evaluating patients and providing psychotherapy. They do not prescribe medication {{as this is}} a role of a psychiatrist (physician who specializes in psychiatry). There are {{a wide variety of}} therapeutic techniques and perspectives that guide practitioners, although most fall into the major categories of Psychodynamic, Cognitive Behavioral, Existential-Humanistic, and Systems Therapy (e.g. family or couples therapy).|$|E
25|$|In {{clinical}} practice, clinical psychologists {{may work}} with individuals, couples, families, or {{groups in a}} variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Clinical <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> provide clinical services may also choose to specialize. Some specializations are codified and credentialed by regulatory agencies within the country of practice. In the United States such specializations are credentialed by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP).|$|E
25|$|Given {{that sexual}} {{reproduction}} is {{the means by}} which genes are propagated into future generations, sexual selection plays a large role in human evolution. Human mating, then, is of interest to evolutionary <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> aim to investigate evolved mechanisms to attract and secure mates. Several lines of research have stemmed from this interest, such as studies of mate selection mate poaching, mate retention, mating preferences and conflict between the sexes.|$|E
5000|$|A medical <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> holds {{prescriptive}} {{authority for}} specific psychiatric medications and other pharmaceutical drugs must first obtain specific qualifications in Psychopharmacology. A trained medical <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> has prescriptive authority is equated with a mid-level provider {{who has the}} authority to prescribe psychotropic medication such as antidepressants for neurotic disorders. [...] However, a medical psychologist does not automatically equate with a <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> {{has the authority to}} prescribe medication. In fact, most medical psychologists do not prescribe medication and do not have the authority to do so.|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the most}} {{influential}} theorists on emotion from the 20th century have died in the last decade. They include Magda B. Arnold (1903-2002), an American <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> developed the appraisal theory of emotions; Richard Lazarus (1922-2002), an American <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> specialized in emotion and stress, especially in relation to cognition; Herbert A. Simon (1916-2001), who included emotions into decision making and artificial intelligence; Robert Plutchik (1928-2006), an American <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> developed a psychoevolutionary theory of emotion; Robert Zajonc (1923-2008) a Polish-American social <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> specialized in social and cognitive processes such as social facilitation; Robert C. Solomon (1942-2007), an American philosopher who contributed to the theories on the philosophy of emotions with books such as What Is An Emotion?: Classic and Contemporary Readings (Oxford, 2003); Peter Goldie (1946-2011), a British philosopher who specialized in ethics, aesthetics, emotion, mood and character; Nico Frijda (1927-2015), a Dutch <b>psychologist</b> <b>who</b> advanced the theory that human emotions serve to promote a tendency to undertake actions that are appropriate in the circumstances, detailed in his book The Emotions (1986).|$|R
25|$|As noted above, {{the status}} of APD as a {{distinct}} disorder has been queried, especially by speech-language pathologists and <b>psychologists,</b> <b>who</b> note the overlap between clinical profiles of children diagnosed with APD and those with other forms of specific learning disability. Many audiologists, however, would dispute that APD is just an alternative label for dyslexia, SLI, or ADHD, noting that although it often co-occurs with these conditions, {{it can be found}} in isolation.|$|E
25|$|The Princeton University Department of Psychology, {{located in}} Peretsman-Scully Hall, is an {{academic}} department of Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. For over a century, {{the department has}} been one of the most notable psychology departments in the country. It has been home to <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> have made well-known scientific discoveries in the fields of psychology and neuroscience (e.g., adult neurogenesis in primate brains, cognitive miser, bystander non-intervention, face-selective neurons in primate brains, feature integration theory, mental models theory, prospect theory).|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of deception {{has been challenged}} by some <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical, and that other research strategies (e.g., role-playing) should be used instead. Unfortunately, {{research has shown that}} role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity. In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the Milgram experiment and Stanford prison experiment), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.|$|E

25|$|The {{automaticity}} model, {{which became}} widespread following exposition by John Bargh {{and others in}} the 1980s, describes sophisticated processes for executing goals which can be selected and performed over an extended duration without conscious awareness. Some experimental data suggests that the brain begins to consider taking actions before the mind becomes aware of them. This influence of unconscious forces on people's choices naturally bears on philosophical questions free will. John Bargh, Daniel Wegner, and Ellen Langer are some prominent contemporary <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> describe free will as an illusion.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{there were}} many {{challenges}} {{to the concept of}} mental illness itself. These challenges came from psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz, who argued that mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts; from sociologists such as Erving Goffman, who said mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; from behavioural <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; and from gay rights activists who criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. A study published in Science by Rosenhan received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Although {{clinical}} {{psychologists and}} psychiatrists {{can be said}} to share a same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the medical model to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and rely on psychotropic medications as the chief method of addressing the illness—although many also employ psychotherapy as well. Psychiatrists and medical <b>psychologists</b> (<b>who</b> are clinical psychologists that are also licensed to prescribe) are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and EEGs, and may order brain imaging studies such as CT or CAT, MRI, and PET scanning.|$|E

500|$|Kaczynski's lawyers, {{headed by}} Montana federal defender Michael Donahoe and Judy Clarke, {{attempted}} to enter an insanity defense {{to avoid the}} death penalty, but he rejected this plea. On January 8, 1998, he requested to dismiss his lawyers and hire Tony Serra as his counsel; Serra had agreed to not use an insanity defense and instead base a defense on Kaczynski's anti-technology views. This request was unsuccessful and Kaczynski subsequently {{tried to commit suicide}} by hanging on January 9. Several, though not all, forensic psychiatrists and <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> examined Kaczynski diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz said Kaczynski was not psychotic but had a schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder. In his 2010 book Technological Slavery, Kaczynski said that two prison <b>psychologists,</b> <b>who</b> visited him frequently for four years, told him they saw no indication that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and the diagnosis was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and a [...] "political diagnosis".|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of Sesame Street's first season, producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material. Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969. [...] The results were [...] "generally very positive"; children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and their attention was sustained over the full hour. [...] However, {{the researchers found that}} although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the [...] "Street" [...] segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.|$|E
500|$|The 41-day {{trial was}} the second longest to have been held in the courts of Singapore at the time. [...] None of the {{defendants}} denied their guilt. [...] Their appointed counsels tried to spare their clients the death sentence by pleading diminished responsibility, arguing that the accused were mentally ill {{and could not be}} held entirely responsible for the killings. [...] To support their case they brought in doctors and <b>psychologists,</b> <b>who</b> analysed the defendants and concluded that they had exhibited schizophrenia, and depressions of the psychotic and manic order. The prosecution's expert, however, refuted these testimonies and argued that they were in full control of their mental faculties when they planned and carried out the murders. [...] The judges agreed with the prosecution's case and sentenced the trio to death. [...] While on death row, the women appealed to the Privy Council in London and pleaded for clemency from the President of Singapore to no avail. [...] Lim did not seek any pardons; instead, he accepted his fate and went smiling to the gallows. [...] The three were hanged on 25November 1988.|$|E

500|$|The {{results of}} the test shows, which were never {{intended}} for broadcast and shown to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969, were [...] "generally very positive". The researchers found that children learned from the shows, that the show's appeal was high, and that children's attention was sustained over the full hour. However, they found that, although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered when there were only humans on screen. The producers had followed the advice of child <b>psychologists</b> <b>who</b> were concerned that children would be confused, and had recommended that human actors and Muppets not be shown together. As {{a result of this}} decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than they would have liked, so the show's producers knew they needed to make significant changes, including defying the recommendations of their advisers and show the human and Muppet characters together. Lesser called this decision [...] "a turning point in the history of Sesame Street". [...] Muppet creator Jim Henson and his coworkers created Muppets for Sesame Street that could interact with the human actors, and many segments were re-shot.|$|E
500|$|During Sesame Streets {{development}} in 1968, the producers followed {{the recommendation of}} child <b>psychologists,</b> <b>who</b> advised them to not allow the direct interaction of the human actors and Muppets because the experts were concerned it would confuse and mislead young children. [...] Shortly before the show's premiere, the producers created five one-hour episodes {{so that they could}} test if children found them comprehensible and appealing. They were never intended for broadcast, but were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia in July 1969. The producers found that the results were [...] "generally very positive". [...] However, children attended to the shows during the Muppet segments, but their interest was lost during the street scenes, which featured only humans and were considered [...] "the glue" [...] that [...] "pulled the show together". [...] The appeal of the test episodes was lower than they preferred, so the producers re-shot the street segments. [...] Henson and his team created Muppets that could interact with the human actors; specifically, as the show's researchers put it, [...] "two of Sesame Streets most enduring Muppets: Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird". [...] The test episodes were responsible for what writer Malcolm Gladwell called [...] "the essence of Sesame Street—the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults". [...] CTW researcher Gerald Lesser called the producers' decision to defy the recommendations of their advisers [...] "a turning point in the history of Sesame Street".|$|E
