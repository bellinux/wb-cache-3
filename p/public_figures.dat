In the context of defamation actions (libel and slander) as well as invasion of privacy, a <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> cannot base a lawsuit on incorrect harmful statements unless there is proof that the writer or publisher acted with actual malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth).

Based on factor analytic techniques a model of <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> preoccupation was devised. In a second study (N = 215), the new model was then compared to disassociation and absorption scores to provide a greater clinical understanding of <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> preoccupation and its psychological correlates...|$|R

40|$|Research {{examining}} stalking with <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> {{and community}} samples overlap but have developed separately {{as a consequence}} of different focal points. It has been demonstrated that if ex-intimates are removed from analyses, research using <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> and community stalker samples can produce very similar findings. The present study examines whether 5 independent variables previously identified as predictors of stalker approach in <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> samples (Meloy et al., 2011) were related to stalker approach within a self-defined community sample of stalking victims (N = 1, 440). These variables have been found to predict stalker approach within <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> and community stalker samples. None predicted stalker approach in the present study. Our sample differed from earlier samples in important ways, recording far lower rates of serious mental disorder in stalkers and including stalkers who were not apprehended by police and/or referred to forensic mental health services. In addition, research examining stalking using <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> samples categorizes attempted approaches as approaches whereas the present study used a more literal classification. It is concluded that findings from research within a <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> context cannot simply be extrapolated to a community context. Caution must be applied, {{and the nature of the}} base sample appears to dictate the transferability of findings...|$|R
