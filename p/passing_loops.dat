5|$|The route {{was built}} with freight {{provision}} from the beginning. It has spurs leading {{to and from}} the freight terminal at Dollands Moor (Folkestone) and the freight depot at Barking (Ripple Lane), north of the River Thames. Long <b>passing</b> <b>loops</b> to hold freight trains while passenger trains overtake them were built at Lenham Heath and Singlewell.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway opened Cullompton {{railway station}} when the railway opened on 1 May 1844. Around 1931 {{the lines were}} widened to provide two <b>passing</b> <b>loops</b> and a new goods shed and waiting room were constructed. It closed to {{passengers}} on 5 October 1964, the site now being used for the M5 motorway Cullompton services. The nearest railway station is now Tiverton Parkway open by British Rail.|$|E
5|$|The Duke and Jones {{intended}} to run {{no more than}} one train on each section of the line so the line was not built with <b>passing</b> <b>loops</b> or signalling. When more than one horse-drawn train or locomotive was in operation, the Tramway operated a token system using colour-coded staffs to ensure only one train could be on a section. Drivers between Quainton Road and Wotton carried a blue staff, those on west of Wotton and the Kingswood siding a red staff.|$|E

5|$|The line stopped {{carrying}} {{passengers on}} 5 December 1964, {{as part of}} the rationalisation known as the Beeching Axe. All stations were closed, and all goods yards, <b>passing</b> <b>loops</b> and sidings removed, except the marshalling yard for the Octel freight. Octel's freight traffic totaled 70,000 tons annually, and the railway was kept in order to serve this traffic. Local freight services ceased, and the electric staff system was withdrawn, so that only one train could be on the branch at a time, although that was sufficient for Octel's requirements. The double junction at Gaerwen was also remodelled. Once the freight trains were being worked by diesel locomotives, arrangements were made for the British Rail engines to operate {{all the way to the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|The Clevedon branch {{was seeing}} {{increased}} passenger traffic, up to 26 trains daily and 10 on Sundays by 1958, and in 1956 the unusual canopy was taken down, {{replaced by a}} second-hand canopy from Dauntsey railway station. However, this uptick was not to last: coal traffic along the line ended in 1951, and by 1963 there were no longer any freight workings. The line closed completely on 3 October 1966, taking the station's bookstall with it. The Claverham loops had been closed on 6 September 1964, and the goods yard at Yatton was closed on 29 November 1965. The now-redundant bay platforms were converted into car parks, and the canopy on the westbound platform removed along with the two water towers. On 24 January 1972, the <b>passing</b> <b>loops</b> {{to the west of}} the station were cut back to , and the station's signal box, which had had 129 levers, closed on 31 January the same year.|$|E
5|$|The {{goods service}} at {{individual}} stations was also withdrawn after Beeching's report. A freightliner depot opened at Aberdeen in 1966, allowing the Peterhead line to close completely on 7 September 1970. In 1969–70 {{the line between}} Aberdeen and Keith was singled, with <b>passing</b> <b>loops,</b> the line to Fraserburgh closing completely in 1979 and that from Keith to Dufftown in 1985. In the 1969 timetable there were early morning trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie, and five services a day between Aberdeen to Inverness, supplemented by two Aberdeen to Elgin services that by the late 1970s were running through to Inverness. The cross-country DMUs were replaced in 1980 by diesel locomotives hauling Mark I compartment coaches, later Mark II open saloons. These were similarly replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by newer DMUs, first the Class 156 Super Sprinter and then Class 158 Express and Class 170 units.|$|E

5|$|The system {{initially}} {{had four}} standard gauge, single tracked lines, which had <b>passing</b> <b>loops</b> to allow trams to pass. Three originated at Stortorvet: the Gamlebyen Line, running east to Gamlebyen (now Old Oslo, but then called just Oslo); the Vestbanen Line, which ran west to Vestbanen station (Oslo West station); and the Ullevål Hageby Line, which ran west to Homansbyen, where the depot was located. In addition, {{there was a}} short connecting line between the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Vestbanen Line, but it was closed on 19 October 1875. The two lines that connected to the station only ran services that corresponded with train arrivals and departures; the other two lines had fixed fifteen-minute headway—decreasing to ten minutes from 22 June 1876. During the winter of 1875 and 1876, the company attempted to use sleds instead of wagons. They took delivery of seventeen units, but these were not as suitable as the wagons and the company instead chose to salt the rail tracks.|$|E
5|$|Politicians have signalized {{that they}} want to {{electrify}} the tracks from Trondheim to Steinkjer along with the Meråker Line. NSB will need to replace the Class 92 trains towards the end the 2010s, and want to coordinate the new stock with electrification. The county municipalities of Nord-Trøndelag and Sør-Trøndelag proposed during the early 2000s that the Nordland Line between Trondheim and Steinkjer be upgraded reduce travel time to one hour. This would require the average speed to be increased to , mainly through a modernization of the existing line. Specific projects include electrification, double track between Trondheim and Trondheim Airport, additional <b>passing</b> <b>loops,</b> a new bridge over Stjørdalselva and a rearrangement of the tracks at Hell. This would have to be combined with a {{reduction in the number of}} stops. The National Rail Administration estimates that the mentioned investments, which would cost between NOK4 and 6 billion, will allow a travel time of one hour and ten minutes. If a number of curves are straightened, increased capacity is introduced between Stjørdal and Steinkjer and a further number of stops are removed, travel time could be reduced to one hour.|$|E

25|$|The {{line was}} built with single track and had <b>passing</b> <b>loops</b> at the intersections of Professor Dahls gate, Oscars gate, Huitfeldts gate, Tivoli and Nedre Slottsgate.

Services were extended from 07 to 01 hours every day from 1 November 1895.|$|E
25|$|Designed under {{instructions}} from LB Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, {{the line was}} constructed to take double track. However, only the section between East Grinstead and Horsted Keynes (and thence to Haywards Heath via Ardingly) was laid as such; south of the junction at Horsted Keynes the line was single track with <b>passing</b> <b>loops</b> at stations.
