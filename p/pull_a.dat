5|$|There {{are several}} {{non-contact}} variants of American football, such as flag football. In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim to <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> flag tied around his waist. Another variant, touch football, simply requires the ballcarrier {{to be touched}} to be considered downed. A game of touch football may require that the player be touched with either one or two hands to be considered down, depending on the rules used.|$|E
5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who walked on the towpaths pulling the barge with a harness over their shoulder. It took about 18 hours to <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> barge through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the barge {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped manoeuver the barges using a boat hook. Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E

50|$|In {{behavioral}} psychology, reinforcement is {{a consequence}} that will strengthen an organism's future behavior whenever that behavior is preceded by a specific antecedent stimulus. This strengthening effect may be measured as a higher frequency of behavior (e.g., <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> lever more frequently), longer duration (e.g., <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> lever {{for longer periods of}} time), greater magnitude (e.g., <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> lever with greater force), or shorter latency (e.g., <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> lever more quickly following the antecedent stimulus).|$|R
50|$|He is {{a serial}} breaker and setter of Guinness World Records {{and at last}} count is noted as holding 31, {{including}} <b>pulling</b> <b>an</b> empty double-decker bus over 55 feet with his teeth, <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> double-decker with 54 passengers on board with one hand for a distance of 180 feet and <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> similar bus with 30 people aboard for 256 feet using only his ponytail, using his ears to lift 85 kg and hauling an 8 tonne mobile library for 1800cm. In 1995 he <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> 203,000-pound Vulcan bomber for 15.24 cm using a harness round his body.|$|R
5|$|As {{soldiers}} {{approached the}} sacristy, {{one of the}} young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> blanket over his shoulders. In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, who attempted to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Many humans enjoy {{venturing into}} the sea: {{children}} paddle and splash in the shallows, while others swim or relax on the beach. This {{was not always}} the case, with sea bathing becoming the vogue in Europe in the 18th century after Dr. William Buchan advocated the practice for health reasons. Surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, {{with or without a}} surfboard. Other water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water; windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, maneuverable sail; and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> skier.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{horses are}} often used to reenact many of their {{historical}} work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles. Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events. Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> beer wagon {{similar to that used}} before the invention of the modern motorized truck.|$|E

After a few false starts and chases, the Lone Gunmen corner the bioterrorist with only a few minutes before his virus is due to be released. They realize that they lack the time to destroy his virus-filled organ and {{therefore}} <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> fire alarm, causing large emergency doors to seal shut, simultaneously containing the virus and entrapping them with it. Their sacrifice earns them a final resting place in Arlington National Cemetery, where Fletcher, John Doggett, Monica Reyes, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), Harlow and Jimmy Bond (Stephen Snedden) pay their respects to them.|$|E
5|$|At first Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang {{is just a}} big and {{powerful}} car, but as the book progresses the car surprises the family by beginning to exhibit independent actions. This first happens while the family is caught in a traffic jam {{on their way to}} the beach for a picnic. The car suddenly instructs Commander Pott to <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> switch which causes Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang to sprout wings and take flight over the stopped cars on the road. Commander Pott flies them to Goodwin Sands in the English Channel where the family picnics, swims, and sleeps. While the family naps, the tide comes in threatening to drown them. Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang wakes them just in time with a hiss of steam. At the car's direction, Commander Pott pulls another switch which causes it to transform into a hovercraft-like vehicle. They make for the French coast and land on a beach near Calais. They explore along the beach and find a cave boobytrapped with some devices intended to scare off intruders. At the back of the cave is a store of armaments and explosives. The family detonates the cache of explosives and flees the cave.|$|E
5|$|In April 1948 he {{once again}} {{travelled}} with England to Hampden Park, helping his country to a 2–0 victory; however after the match {{he was the}} subject of an FA inquiry after he claimed tea and scones on his expenses (at the cost of sixpence). Regardless of this treatment by the FA, the next month he helped England record a 4–0 victory over Italy in Turin. Folklore told that he beat Alberto Eliani only to have the audacity to then <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> comb from his shorts pocket and comb his hair; the reality was that he simply used his hand to wipe his sweating brow in the beating Italian sun. However the legend would follow him around the world in later life, and spectators in the crowd were convinced that they had witnessed it. Later in the year he played in a goalless draw with Denmark, a 6–2 win over Northern Ireland, a 1–0 win over Wales, and a 6–0 triumph over Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) pranking {{has caused}} Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to ask Andy {{to move her}} to a {{different}} desk. In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and {{the target of the}} prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in his desk and blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will not touch their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E

5|$|The Qing Emperor's {{undercover}} emissary Jack Knife {{arrives in}} the village to monitor the gold and takes up residence in the Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom, Lady Silk's madame. Silver sends members of the Rodent clan to kill Zen-Yi before he can reach the village, but Zen-Yi kills them. The mercenary Brass Body {{arrives in the}} village and meets with Silver; he is sent to kill Zen-Yi. The blacksmith meets with Silk in the brothel and delivers the final payment needed to free her. After arriving in the village, Zen-Yi and his men are confronted by Brass and find that they cannot physically harm him because his skin turns to metal on impact. Brass beats Zen-Yi and destroys his blade-laden armor. Zen-Yi's last surviving man sacrifices himself to <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> canopy support beam loose, burying Brass under heavy stone.

5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shots were}} fired at 12:30 by Persanne close to the island of Pelagosa (Palagruža), but the main action did not begin for another hour, when Alceste and Pomone {{exchanged}} shots from their stern and bow guns. By 13:40, Alceste was firing her broadside into Pomone and simultaneously pressing on all sail {{in an effort to}} reach Pauline, but this ambition was thwarted when a shot from Pomone brought down Alcestes main topmast, slowing her suddenly and allowing Pauline to <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> little ahead. At 14:00, Active had arrived in action and was also firing into Pomone, forcing Montfort to bring Pauline round to protect her outgunned colleague. By 14:20 the conflicts between Active and Pomone and Alceste and Pauline had separated into different duels, Pomone particularly suffering severely but Active also taking heavy damage, a 32-pounder carronade shot severing Captain Gordon's leg {{at the height of the}} engagement.|$|E
5|$|Things {{then take}} {{a turn for the}} very worst, as McLaren unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to kill Waingro, who in turn betrays the team to the police. When Hanna arrives on the scene unexpectedly with the police, McLaren and his crew engage them in a mid-street shootout, in which most of McLaren's crew are killed. After making an unlikely escape, McLaren is presented with an opportunity to leave Los Angeles for a new life with Eady, but he decides to first take revenge for Waingro's betrayal. However, after McLaren tracks down Waingro to a hotel room, he is ambushed by Hanna and his team. Waingro takes advantage of the confusion to shoot McLaren through a closed door. While Hanna advises Waingro of his options in jail, for a string of previous murders, Waingro resists arrest and tries to <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> gun. In self-defence, Hanna forces Waingro through a hotel window, and Waingro falls fifteen floors to his death. In the final sequences, Hanna is reunited with his wife.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, England progressed strongly. Nightwatchman Alec Bedser hit three {{consecutive}} fours from Toshack, prompting Bradman {{to replace him}} with Johnson. Bedser surveyed Johnson's wares for one over before hitting him into the leg side {{three times in the}} next, yielding a six and two fours. Bradman responded by removing Johnson from the attack. When the off spinner came back, Edrich hit him for another six to reach 96. However, Johnson soon had his revenge. England reached 2/423 when Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson, patting the ball back to the bowler when he could have hit it decisively. His on-drive was intercepted by the bowler, who dived across the pitch to his right-hand side to complete the catch. This ended a 155-run third-wicket partnership. Edrich attempted to <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> Johnson long hop to the leg side, targeting the large gap between square leg and mid-on, but only ballooned the ball to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on. This came only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 4/426. Johnson's two wickets brought two new batsmen were to the crease and precipitated a collapse that saw England dismissed for 496. Johnson ended with 2/89 from 33 overs and was the least economical of the frontline bowlers except Toshack, who broke down with a knee injury.|$|E
