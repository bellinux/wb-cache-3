[...] The {{chemistry is}} foremost determined by inputs from the geology of its watershed, or catchment area, {{but can also}} be influenced by precipitation {{and the addition of}} pollutants from human sources. Large differences in chemistry do not usually exist within small lotic systems due to a high rate of mixing. [...] In larger river systems, however, the concentrations of most nutrients, dissolved salts, and <b>pH</b> <b>decrease</b> as distance increases from the river’s source.|$|E
50|$|Water ionizes into {{hydronium}} (H3O+) cations and hydroxide (OH−) anions. The {{concentration of}} ionized hydrogen (as protonated water) is expressed as pH. Low pH values increase {{rate of corrosion}} while high pH values encourage scale formation. Amphoterism is uncommon among metals used in water cooling systems, but aluminum corrosion rates increase with pH values above 9. Galvanic corrosion may be severe in water systems with copper and aluminum components. Acid may be added to cooling water systems to prevent scale formation if the <b>pH</b> <b>decrease</b> will offset increased salinity and dissolved solids.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} of geomicrobiology is bioleaching, {{the use of}} microbes to extract metals from mine waste. For example, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) produce H2S which precipitates metals as a metal sulfide. This process removed heavy metals from mine waste {{which is one of}} the major environmental issues associated with acid mine drainage (along with a low pH). Bioremediation techniques are also used on contaminated surface water and ground water often associated with acid mine drainage. Studies have shown that the production of bicarbonate by microbes such as sulfate-reducing bacteria adds alkalinity to neutralize the acidity of the mine drainage waters. Hydrogen ions are consumed while bicarbonate is produced which leads to an increase in <b>pH</b> (<b>decrease</b> in acidity).|$|E

50|$|Bipolar {{electrochemistry}} is {{a phenomenon}} in electrochemistry based on the polarization of conducting objects in electric fields. Indeed, this polarization generates a potential {{difference between the two}} extremities of the substrate that is equal to the electric field value multiplied {{by the size of the}} object. If this potential difference is important enough, then redox reactions can be generated at the extremities of the object, oxidations will occur at one extremity coupled simultaneously to reductions at the other extremity. In a simple experimental setup consisting of a platinum wire in a weighing boat containing a pH indicator solution, a 30 V voltage across two electrodes will cause water reduction at one end of the wire (the cathode) and a pH increase (OH− formation) and water oxidation at the anodic end and a <b>pH</b> <b>decrease.</b> The poles of the bipolar electrode also align themselves with the applied electric field.|$|E
5000|$|... has a value {{close to}} 10−14 at 25 °C, so the {{concentration}} of hydroxide ions in pure water is close to 10−7 mol∙dm−3, {{in order to satisfy}} the equal charge constraint. The pH of a solution is equal to the decimal cologarithm of the hydrogen cation concentration; the pH of pure water is close to 7 at ambient temperatures. The concentration of hydroxide ions can be expressed in terms of pOH, which is close to 14 − pH, so pOH of pure water is also close to 7. Addition of a base to water will reduce the hydrogen cation concentration and therefore increase the hydroxide ion concentration (increase <b>pH,</b> <b>decrease</b> pOH) even if the base does not itself contain hydroxide. For example, ammonia solutions have a pH greater than 7 due to the reaction NH3 + H+ [...] , which results in a decrease in hydrogen cation concentration and an increase in hydroxide ion concentration. pOH can be kept at a nearly constant value with various buffer solutions.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of the <b>pH</b> <b>decrease</b> and 3 -phosphoglyceric acid (3 PGA) {{accumulation}} in the forespore compartment of sporulating {{cells of}} Bacillus subtilis {{showed that the}} <b>pH</b> <b>decrease</b> of 1 to 1. 2 units at approximately 4 h of sporulation preceded 3 PGA accumulation, as observed previously in B. megaterium. These data, as well as analysis of the forespore <b>pH</b> <b>decrease</b> in asporogenous mutants of B. subtilis, indicated that sigma G-dependent forespore transcription, but not sigma K-dependent mother cell transcription, {{is required for the}} forespore <b>pH</b> <b>decrease.</b> Further analysis of these asporogenous mutants showed an excellent correlation between the forespore <b>pH</b> <b>decrease</b> and the forespore's accumulation of 3 PGA. These latter results are consistent with our previous suggestion that the decrease in forespore pH results in greatly decreased activity of phosphoglycerate mutase in the forespore, which in turn leads to 3 PGA accumulation. In further support of this suggestion, we found that (i) elevating the pH of developing forespores of B. megaterium resulted in rapid utilization of the forespore's 3 PGA depot and (ii) increasing forespore levels of PGM approximately 10 -fold in B. subtilis resulted in a large decrease in the spore's depot of 3 PGA. The B. subtilis strain with a high phosphoglycerate mutase level sporulated, and the spores germinated and went through outgrowth normally, indicating that forespore accumulation of a large 3 PGA depot is not essential for these processes...|$|E

The computed pH time series both for 25 years in winter (late January to early February) and for 21 years in summer (June to July) exhibited significant decreasing trends in the extensive subtropical to equatorial zones, with interannual variations that were larger in summer.

40|$|BACKGROUND: During storage at room temperature, {{platelets}} (PLTs) undergo several changes, {{a process}} known as PLT storage lesion. The pH is one of the variables changing and has been suggested to be a good surrogate marker for the quality of PLT concentrates. It is unknown whether the <b>pH</b> <b>decrease</b> as such induces the PLT storage lesion or that the deterioration of the PLTs results in the <b>pH</b> <b>decrease.</b> In this study, the responses of PLTs to applied pH values were investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLTs were washed three times in PLT additive solution (PAS-IIIM) and were resuspended in PAS-IIIM buffers with or without 30 percent plasma with different pH values over a range from 6. 0 to 7. 5 (at 37 degrees C). The PLTs were stored in 50 -mL culture flasks at 22 degrees C. RESULTS: During 3 days of storage in 100 percent additive solution (AS), the extracellular pH did not affect in vitro quality measures. Both at the lower and at the higher end of the pH range, we observed an increased glycolytic flux, accelerated at Day 6. Also in the presence of 30 percent plasma, the effect of extracellular pH was very limited, but all variables indicated better PLT quality with stable values up to Day 6 of storage. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PLTs stored in 100 percent AS are able to cope with high and low pH values without a strong deterioration within 3 days. PLTs stored in 30 percent plasma- 70 percent AS are more capable in dealing with different pH values than PLTs stored in AS and remained stable for 6 days.
