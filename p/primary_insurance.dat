5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, hospice care {{may be difficult}} to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their <b>primary</b> <b>insurance</b> to having most of their care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E
25|$|To {{calculate}} the total benefits a retiree is eligible for, the average indexed monthly salary (AIME) is then {{divided into three}} separate salary brackets—each multiplied by a different benefit percentage. The benefits receivable (the so-called <b>Primary</b> <b>Insurance</b> Amount, PIA) are {{the sum of the}} salary in each bracket times the benefit percentages that apply to each bracket. The benefit percentages are set by Congress and so can easily change in the future. The bendpoints, where the brackets change, are adjusted for inflation each year by Social Security. For example, in 2013 the first bracket runs from $1 to $791/month and is multiplied by the benefit percentage of 90%, the second salary bracket extends from $791 to $4,781/month is multiplied by 32%, the third salary bracket of more than $4,781/month is multiplied by 15%. Any higher incomes than the ceiling income are not FICA covered and are not considered in the benefits calculation or in determining the average indexed monthly salary, AIME. At full retirement age the projected retirement income amount (PIA) is the sum of these three brackets of income multiplied by the appropriate benefit percentages—90%, 32% and 15%. Unlike income tax brackets, the Social Security benefits are heavily biased towards lower salaried workers. Social Security has always been primarily a retirement, disability and spousal insurance policy for low wage workers and a very poor retirement plan for higher salaried workers who hopefully have a supplemental retirement plan unless they want to live on significantly less after retirement than they used to earn.|$|E
2500|$|Often a {{commercial}} insured's liability insurance program consists of several layers. [...] The first layer of insurance generally consists of <b>primary</b> <b>insurance,</b> which provides first dollar indemnity for judgments and settlements {{up to the}} limits of liability of the primary policy.

[...] In many instances, {{a commercial}} insured may elect to self-insure. [...] Above the <b>primary</b> <b>insurance</b> or self-insured retention, the insured may have one or more layers of excess insurance to provide coverage additional limits of indemnity protection.

2500|$|The current Social Security formula used in {{calculating the}} benefit level (<b>primary</b> <b>insurance</b> amount or PIA) is {{progressive}} vis-à-vis lower average salaries. Anyone {{who worked in}} OASDI covered employment and other retirement would be entitled to both the alternative non-OASDI pension and an Old Age retirement benefit from Social Security. Because of their limited time working in OASDI covered employment the sum of their covered salaries times inflation factor divided by 420 months yields a low adjusted indexed monthly salary over 35 years, AIME. The progressive nature of the PIA formula would in effect allow these workers to also get a slightly higher Social Security Benefit percentage on this low average salary. Congress passed in 1983 the Windfall Elimination Provision to minimize Social Security benefits for these recipients. The basic provision {{is that the first}} salary bracket, $0–791/month (2013) has its normal benefit percentage of 90% reduced to 40–90%—see Social Security for the exact percentage. The reduction is limited to roughly 50% of what you would be eligible for if you had always worked under OASDI taxes. The 90% benefit percentage factor is not reduced if you have 30 or more years of [...] "substantial" [...] earnings.|$|E
