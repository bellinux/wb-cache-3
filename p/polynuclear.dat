25|$|Liverpool and Manchester are {{sometimes}} considered {{parts of a}} single large <b>polynuclear</b> metropolitan area, or megalopolis but are usually treated as separate metropolitan areas. In some studies, part of Wigan in Greater Manchester is {{considered part of the}} Liverpool metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs, also poly{{aromatic hydrocarbons}} or <b>polynuclear</b> aromatic hydrocarbons) are hydrocarbons—organic compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen—that {{are composed of}} multiple aromatic rings (organic rings in which the electrons are delocalized). Formally, the class is further defined as lacking further branching substituents on these ring structures. The simplest such chemicals are naphthalene, having two aromatic rings, and the three-ring compounds anthracene and phenanthrene.|$|E
25|$|A study {{issued in}} 2002 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization {{concluded}} that non-smokers {{are exposed to}} the same carcinogens on account of tobacco smoke as active smokers. Sidestream smoke contains 69 known carcinogens, particularly benzopyrene and other <b>polynuclear</b> aromatic hydrocarbons, and radioactive decay products, such as polonium-210. Several well-established carcinogens have been shown by the tobacco companies' own research to be present at higher concentrations in second-hand smoke than in mainstream smoke.|$|E
25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{amount of}} Bửu Hội's contributions {{are in the}} field of chemical carcinogenesis and the synthesis of related organic chemical compounds. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he had extensive collaborations with the quantum chemistry personnel of the Radium Institute on various aspects of the electronic theory of carcinogenesis. Bửu Hội was the first to propose the involvement of noncovalent forces. Together with Lacassagne and Rudali, in the 1940s he became the first to describe the phenomena of synergisma and antagonism between carcinogens. He demonstrated this by using hydrocarbons on the skin of mice and later extended this to hepatic and other carcinogens. Starting in 1947, he collaborated with François Zajdela and Lacassagne in exploring the relationships between the structure and carcinogenic activity of <b>polynuclear</b> compounds. The study spanned a groundbreaking scale and depth.|$|E

2500|$|These {{involved}} the fundamental ring systems and derivatives of 1,2-benzanthracene, the dibenzopyrenes, steranthrenes, anthanthrene, 1,2,3,4-dibenzanthracene, {{a variety of}} benzo and dibenzofluoranthenes. This was extended to large-molecular-size and [...] "hypercondensed" [...] hydrocarbons, ring opening and partial hydrogenation. During his study of dibenzopyrenes, he discovered a molecular arrangement involving the framework of aromatic hydrocarbons. His studies of the carcinogenic azulenophenalenes led him to question the role of aromaticity. Aside from his studies with aza-replaced hydrocarbons, benz- and dibenzacridines and –carbazoles, he also synthesised and tested {{a number of new}} structural types of heteroaromatics with reference to the nature, nuimber and position of the heteroatoms. These included the naphtho and benzo derivatives of pyridocarbazole and beta-carboline, heteroaromatics with sulfur, arsenic or selenium replacements. These were either alone or in association with nitrogen, as well as sulfur and nitrogen containing pseudoazulenes. A series of hydrocarbon-like <b>polynuclear</b> lactones were explored with the intent of establishing a connection between <b>polynuclear</b> aromatics and aflatoxins. Such studies of heteroatomic polynuclears led him to propose a [...] "newer picture" [...] of a carcinogenic hydrocarbon, helping the generalise the classical K-region hypothesis.|$|E

The analysis grouped the Merseyside metropolitan county with the borough of Halton, Wigan in Greater Manchester, the city of Chester as well as number of towns in Lancashire and Cheshire including Ormskirk and Warrington, estimating the <b>polynuclear</b> metropolitan area to have a population of 2,241,000 people.|$|E
2500|$|SnF2 {{acts as a}} Lewis acid. For example, {{it forms}} a 1:1 complex (CH3)3NSnF2 and 2:1 complex 2SnF2 with trimethylamine, and a 1:1 complex with dimethylsulfoxide, (CH3)2SO.SnF2. In {{solutions}} containing the fluoride ion, F−, it forms the fluoride complexes SnF3−, Sn2F5−, and SnF2(OH2). Crystallization from an aqueous solution containing NaF produces compounds containing <b>polynuclear</b> anions, e.g. NaSn2F5 or Na4Sn3F10 depending on the reaction conditions, rather than NaSnF3. The compound NaSnF3, containing the pyramidal SnF3− anion, can be produced from a pyridine – water solution. (BING-12) and Sn3F3PO4 ...|$|E
2500|$|Zeolites still {{cannot be}} {{obtained}} in enantiopure form, which precludes their applications in catalytic asymmetric synthesis, e.g., for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and fragrance industries. Enantiopure chiral ligands or their metal complexes have {{been incorporated into}} MOFs to lead to efficient asymmetric catalysts. Even some MOF materials may {{bridge the gap between}} zeolites and enzymes when they combine isolated <b>polynuclear</b> sites, [...] host-guest responses, and a hydrophobic cavity environment. MOFs might be useful for making semi-conductors. Theoretical calculations show that MOFs are semiconductors or insulators with band gaps between 1.0 and 5.5 eV which can be altered by changing the degree of conjugation in the ligands indicating its possibility for being photocatalysts.|$|E
2500|$|Some MOF {{materials}} may resemble enzymes {{when they}} combine isolated <b>polynuclear</b> sites, dynamic host-guest responses, and hydrophobic cavity environment which are characteristics of an enzyme. Some well-known examples of cooperative catalysis involving two metal ions in biological systems include: the diiron sites in methane monooxygenase, dicopper in cytochrome c oxidase, and tricopper oxidases which have analogy with <b>polynuclear</b> clusters {{found in the}} 0D coordination polymers, such as binuclear Cu2 paddlewheel units found in MOP-1(CO2)4 Paddle-Wheel Building Blocks |year=2001 |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=123 |page=4368 |doi=10.1021/ja0104352 |last1=Eddaoudi |first1=M. |last2=Kim |first2=Jaheon |last3=Wachter |first3=J.

In enzymatic systems, protein units show [...] "molecular recognition", high affinity for specific substrates. It seems that molecular recognition effects are limited in zeolites by the rigid zeolite structure. In contrast, dynamic features and guest-shape response make MOFs more similar to enzymes. Indeed, many hybrid frameworks contain organic parts that can rotate {{as a result of}} stimuli, such as light and heat. The porous channels in MOF structures can be used as photocatalysis sites. In photocatalysis, the use of mononuclear complexes is usually limited either because they only undergo single- electron process or from the need for high-energy irradiation. In this case, binuclear systems have a number of attractive features for the development of photocatalysts. For 0D MOF structures, polycationic nodes can act as semiconductor quantum dots which can be activated upon photostimuli with the linkers serving as photon antennae. Theoretical calculations show that MOFs are semiconductors or insulators with band gaps between 1.0 and 5.5 eV which can be altered by changing the degree of conjugation in the ligands. Experimental results show that the band gap of IRMOF-type samples can be tuned by varying the functionality of the linker.|$|E
