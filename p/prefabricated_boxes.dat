50|$|Electronic {{packaging}} {{is a major}} discipline {{within the}} field of electronic engineering, and includes a wide variety of technologies. It refers to enclosures and protective features built into the product itself, and not to shipping containers. It applies both to end products and to components. Packaging of an electronic system must consider protection from mechanical damage, cooling, radio frequency noise emission, protection from electrostatic discharge, maintenance, operator convenience, and cost. Prototypes and industrial equipment made in small quantities may use standardized commercially available enclosures such as card cages or <b>prefabricated</b> <b>boxes.</b> Mass-market consumer devices may have highly specialized packaging to increase consumer appeal. The same electronic system may be packaged as a portable device or adapted for fixed mounting in an instrument rack or permanent installation. Packaging for aerospace, marine, or military systems imposes different types of design criteria.|$|E
40|$|Archaeology shares {{some common}} safety {{concerns}} with other trenching operations such as grave digging and pipe laying. Foremost amongst {{these are the}} dangers of work-ing in unshored or inadequately shored excavations. It is not uncommon far archaeological excavations {{to be more than}} 1. 5 m deep and deep shafts 4 - 6 m deep have occa-sionally been dug (e. g. at Devils Lair, Koonalda Cave, Malakunanja 11 and Mushroom Rock). Shoring has been used in some cases. For instance, Jones used it in his excavations at Rocky Cape in 1 % 5 - 67 (R. Jones pers. comm.), at Nauwalabila 1 in 1981 (Jones and Johnson 1985) and most recently at Allens Cave (R. Jones and S. Cane p m. comm.). Dortch installed an internal scaf-folding of pipe-work and heavy duty timber shoring in the deep trench at Devils Lair (Dortch 1984). Sim used a series of nested <b>prefabricated</b> <b>boxes</b> in her excavations on King Island (Sim and Thorne 1990) and Horton and Wright used timber soldier sets in trenches at Trinkey (Wright pers. comm.). These however are the exceptions and it is still all too rare for shoring to be used on prehis-toric sites. The usual practice is to install some form of shoring only when deposits are demonstrably loose and unconsolidated or where slumping or fretting of the sec-tions is actively taking p k e. In cases where shoring has been used there is also some question as to whether it has been adequately engineered for the lateral stresses that would be imposed should the trench fail catastrophically. Many of us are reluctant to shore because it is seen as time-consuming, expensive and it interferes with access to the faces of an excavation. This is exacerbated by the fact that most Australian-trained field archaeologists lack dir-ect experience in the proper installation of shoring and that the industrial shoring equipment available for hire (e. g. acrow props, drag boxes, steel sheet pilings and trench linings) is clearly not suitable for most archaeologi-cal applications. However, excavating in deep unshored trenches is a form of 'Russian roulette ' in which we stake our lives on a rather casual assessment that the trench walls will continue to be self-supporting. Sooner or later a trench wall will fail and without the safety margin p m vided by shoring, someone will be killed (cf. Haywar...|$|E
5000|$|Particularly in Andalucia and {{increasingly}} also much of Spain, such installations are a popular feature of markets, fiestas and eventos, {{where they are}} called casetas since they often trade out of standardized <b>prefabricated</b> wooden <b>boxes</b> routinely set up in streets and town squares.|$|R
50|$|A {{box caisson}} is a <b>prefabricated</b> {{concrete}} <b>box</b> (it has sides and a bottom); {{it is set}} down on prepared bases. Once in place, {{it is filled with}} concrete {{to become part of the}} permanent works, such as the foundation for a bridge pier. Hollow concrete structures are usually less dense than water so a box caisson must be ballasted or anchored to keep it from floating until it can be filled with concrete. Sometimes elaborate anchoring systems may be required, such as in tidal zones. Adjustable anchoring systems combined with a GPS survey enable engineers to position a box caisson with pinpoint accuracy.|$|R
50|$|The Scottish-born Robert Gair {{invented the}} pre-cut {{cardboard}} or paperboard box in 1890 - flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came {{about as a}} result of an accident: he was a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, and one day, while he was printing an order of seed bags, a metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make <b>prefabricated</b> paperboard <b>boxes.</b> Applying this idea to corrugated boxboard was a straightforward development when the material became available around the turn of the twentieth century.|$|R

50|$|Curing tobacco {{has always}} been a process {{necessary}} to prepare the leaf for consumption because, in its raw, freshly picked state, the green tobacco leaf is too wet to ignite and be smoked. In recent time, traditional curing barns in the U.S. are falling into disuse, as the trend toward using <b>prefabricated</b> metal curing <b>boxes</b> has become more and more prevalent. Temporary curing boxes are often found on location at tobacco farms.|$|R
25|$|Roynton Cottage {{began in}} 1902 as a {{relatively}} functional, <b>prefabricated</b> ‘shooting <b>box</b> with tiled roof’ erected just {{after the turn of}} the century in Lever's newly acquired 18 hectare estate located on the southern flank of the West Pennine Moors. By 1913, it had developed into a large, many-bedroomed, two-storied country mansion replete with a servants’ hall, butler’s pantry and quarters for several live-in retainers including a housekeeper and a secretary. Accoutred and appointed like a minor stately home, it was surrounded by a stout metal fence, and its approaches were guarded by three substantial lodges, each of which was occupied by a trusted employee and his family. In 1913, this structure was destroyed by fire, attributed for many years to an arson attack by suffragette, Edith Rigby. Lever lost no time in replacing Roynton Cottage, and within a few weeks the ruins had been cleared and work started on the construction of a somewhat larger and less combustible structure. By 1914, as Europe began the madness that precipitated its degeneration into decades of hardship and anxiety, Roynton Cottage mark II was completed. It remained one of Lever's favourite summer homes util his death.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in mainland China in 1949 by the victorious Communists, who ended all Christian missionary work, treaties were signed between the Soviet and Chinese governments that provided for the turning over of Russian churches to Chinese control. The cathedral was thus closed from the period of the Great Leap Forward (1958-61) and Cultural Revolution (1966-76).Although the cathedral's sturdy structure withstood its intended destruction during the Cultural Revolution, its empty hull became a warehouse for a nearby state-run department store, its windows were bricked up and saplings grew from the roof. <b>Prefabricated</b> concrete high-rises <b>boxed</b> the church in on all four sides, coming within yards of its walls, making the cathedral inaccessible and invisible from the street. For decades it remained the invisible center of the city, surrounded by decorative material stalls, an auto body shop, a pen factory, and apartments for city government employees, until the Beijing government designated the cathedral a national cultural heritage site in 1996 as part of a nationwide campaign to protect historical sites.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{consists}} of a 50 m bridge deck of three 17 by 17 m steel and concrete decking segments covered with tarmac. The deck is supported by twenty-two 51 mm diameter spiral steel cables originating {{from both sides of}} a 25 m high arch. The parabolic arch is made of six <b>prefabricated</b> trapezoid steel <b>box</b> sections, and spans the bridge diagonally. The bridge is illuminated at night.The arch varies between 1.6 m wide by 1.5 m deep at the bases to 3 m wide and 0.7 m deep at the top. It is supported by a pair of 8.5 by 6.5 by 5.5 m (27.9 by 21.3 by 18 ft) concrete blocks, which bear most of the weight of the bridge. The deck is supported by piled abutments, which incorporate areas for bearing and expansion joint inspection and maintenance. The arch is kept in shape by a number of internal stiffeners and diaphragms, with the top section filled with concrete. To minimise internal rust, the lower sections of the arch were coated with a vapour corrosion inhibitor, with portholes with removable covers inserted into the arch so that the inside can have additional coats applied in the future.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the soil friction restraint on oblique pipelines in loose sand. A series of experimental tests are {{conducted in a}} <b>prefabricated</b> large-scale drag <b>box</b> with dimensions 1. 83 m x 1. 83 m x 1. 22 m. Model pipes 0. 61 m long with diameters of 152. 4, 228. 6, and 304. 8 mm are obliquely moved from an axial-longitudinal to lateral-transversal direction in the drag box to study the associated soil restraints of the oblique pipes with various shallow embedded depths. All the test results indicate that for the axial pipes, the longitudinal soil restraint could be estimated {{as the product of}} the average of the vertical and horizontal earth pressures at the centerline of the pipe and the tangent value of soil-pipe friction angle, whereas for the lateral pipes, the transversal soil restraint could be predicted by using the limit equilibrium model with the assumption of the planar sliding failure surface. The longitudinal and transversal, soil restraints of the oblique pipes could geometrically be obtained by multiplying the corresponding cosine and sine values of the oblique angle with the associated longitudinal soil restraint of axial pipe and the transversal soil restraint of the lateral pipe, respectively. The findings also indicate that the scale effects are not significant for the size of the pipes tested herein...|$|R
