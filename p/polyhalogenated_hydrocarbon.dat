40|$|In eight Dutch or Belgian {{common tern}} (Sterna hirundo) colonies, {{breeding}} biology and food choice were determined, and 15 second eggs {{were collected from}} three-egg clutches for artificial incubation, biochemical analysis and analysis of yolk-sac <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (PHAH) levels. Results from these analyses were combined with biological data from the eggs remaining in each clutch. In some breeding colonies severe flooding, rainy and cold weather, and extreme predation caused extensive losses of eggs and chicks. A relationship was found between yolksac mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyl (mo-PCB) levels and main food species (fish or insects) of the adult terns before egg-laying. Colony average breeding data differed only slightly, and were difficult to relate to PHAH-levels. When the colonies were grouped after yolksac PHAH-patterns and main food species, significant differences in average egg laying date, incubation period, egg volume and chick weight {{could be related to}} differences in yolksac PHAH and retinoid levels, and hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity. The data from all colonies also were combined into one data-set and correlated with the biochemical parameters and PHAH levels. In summary higher yolksac PHAH levels or hepatic EROD-activity correlated with and later egg laying, prolonged incubation period and smaller eggs and chicks. Lower yolksac retinoid- and plasma thyroid hormone levels, and a higher ratio of plasma retinol over yolksac retinoids correlated with later egg laying, prolonged incubation periods and smaller chicks and eggs. The dynamic environment of the terns had more obvious detrimental effects on breeding success than PHAHs. However, the more subtle effects observed for PHAHs could still be of importance during specific stress circumstances. To monitor site-specific reproduction effects, tree-nesting birds feeding on relatively big and non-migrating fishes would be most suitable. The use of specific biomarkers for exposure and effect is recommended to establish a causal relationship between a certain class of pollutants and an adverse biological effect...|$|E

Contaminant accumulation levels and patterns of polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated pesticides, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) differed between tissues and seal groups, with the highest levels in liver. Pups showed higher liver contaminant levels, especially for PBDEs, than adults. These high levels might {{be associated with the}} ingestion of large amounts of contaminated milk and subsequent accumulation in the liver. Adult males and females mainly differed in PBDE levels, which were higher in females, possibly due to a sex-specific diet. The association between blubber contaminant burdens and the diagnostic enzymes ALT, GGT, and AP, and serum albumin, was inconclusive. In contrast, several CYP isoenzymes showed a clear positive relationship with the overall blubber contaminant burden, indicating enzyme induction following exposure to <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Therefore, liver CYP isoenzymes may serve as a sensitive biomarker for long-term exposure to <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons...</b>|$|R

40|$|Even {{before the}} first {{vertebrates}} appeared on our planet, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene was present to carry out one or more critical life functions. The vertebrate AHR then evolved to take on functions of detecting and responding to certain classes of environmental toxicants. These environmental pollutants include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e. g., benzo[a]pyrene), <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> dibenzofurans, and the most potent small-molecular-weight toxicant known, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin). After binding of these ligands, the activated AHR translocates rapidly from the cytosol to the nucleus, where it forms a heterodimer with aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator, causing cellular responses that lead to toxicity, carcinogenesis, and teratogenesis. The nuclear form of the activated AHR/aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator complex is responsible for alterations in immune, endocrine, reproductive, developmental, cardiovascular, and central nervous system functions whose mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the second messenger, cAMP (an endogenous mediator of hormones, neurotransmitters, and prostaglandins), activates the AHR, moving the receptor to the nucleus in some ways {{that are similar to}} and in other ways fundamentally different from AHR activation by dioxin. We suggest that this cAMP-mediated activation may reflect the true endogenous function of AHR; disruption of the cAMP-mediated activation by dioxin, binding chronically to the AHR for days, weeks, or months, might be pivotal in the mechanism of dioxin toxicity. Understanding this endogenous activation of the AHR by cAMP may help in developing methods to counteract the toxicity caused by numerous environmental and food-borne toxic chemicals that act via the AHR...|$|R

40|$|Reports {{in humans}} and rodents {{indicate}} that immune development may be altered following perinatal exposure to immunotoxic compounds, including chemotherapeutics, corticosteroids, polycyclic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> and <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Effects from such exposure {{may be more}} dramatic or persistent than following exposure during adult life. For example, prenatal exposure to the insecticide chlordane or to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[(italic) a(/italic) ]pyrene produces {{what appears to be}} lifelong immunosuppression in mice. Whether prenatal immunotoxicant exposure may predispose the organism to postnatal autoimmune disease remains largely unknown. In this regard, the therapeutic immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) crosses the placenta poorly. However, lethally irradiated rodents exposed to CsA postsyngeneic bone marrow transplant (i. e., during re-establishment of the immune system) develop T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease, suggesting this drug may produce a fundamental disruption in development of self-tolerance by T cells. The environmental contaminant 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-(italic) p(/italic) -dioxin (TCDD) crosses the placenta and produces fetal thymic effects (italic) in vivo(/italic) similar to effects of CsA in fetal thymic organ culture, including inhibited thymocyte maturation and reduced expression of thymic major histocompatability complex class II molecules. These observations led to the suggestion that gestational exposure to TCDD may interfere with normal development of self-tolerance. Possibly supporting this hypothesis, when mice predisposed to development of autoimmune disease were treated with TCDD during gestation, postnatal autoimmunity was exacerbated. Similar results have been reported for mice exposed to diethylstilbestrol during development.

In addition, genetic and epigenetic variations in metabolic pathway genes may alter the expression and function of metabolic enzymes which are involved in the metabolism of endogenous thyroid hormones and the detoxification of PBDEs and other PHAHs. Such variation may result in different individual susceptibilities to PBDEs and other PHAHs and the subsequent development of thyroid cancer.

Three additivity model predic-tions (dose addition, effect addition, and integrated addition) were generated based on single chemical data, {{and the results were}} compared. Effect addition overestimated the effect produced by the combination of all 21 chemicals. The results of the dose- and inte-grated-addition models were similar, and both provided better predictions than the effect-addition model. These results support the use of dose- and integrated additivity models in predicting the effects of complex mixtures...|$|R
40|$|The <b>polyhalogenated</b> {{aromatic}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetracliloroclibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an ubiquitously distributed environmental pollutant {{which can}} induce {{a broad spectrum}} of toxic responses in animals, including birds. in this study, we investigated the impact of 0 or 20 ng TCDD injections into the yolk of chicken eggs before start of development, on liver and ovarian protein expression in hatchlings using fluorescent two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2 -D-DIGE) under a pH range of 4 - 7, combined with MS. Despite considerable inter-individual variability, exposure to TCDD {{prior to the start of}} embryonic development resulted in significant changes in expression of a small set of proteins. Expression of fibrinogen gamma chain precursor in the liver and 60 kDa heat shock protein in the ovary were significantly higher as a result of the very early exposure to TCDD. NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (42 kDa subunit) and regucalcin expression was decreased by early TCDD treatment in the liver and ovary, respectively. These proteins could not be directly linked with drug metabolism per se but are involved in blood dotting, oxidative stress, electron transport, and calcium regulation. It remains to be elucidated how these changes in the hatchling might be linked to the observed long-term consequences during posthatch life of the chicken. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Oviduct {{epithelial}} cells {{are important for}} the nourishment and survival of ovulated oocytes and early embryos, and they respond to the steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone. Endocrinedisrupting <b>polyhalogenated</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PHAH) are environmental toxins that act in part through the ligand-activated transcription factor arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR; dioxin receptor), and exposure to PHAH {{has been shown to}} decrease fertility. To investigate effects of PHAHs on the oviduct epithelium as a potential target tissue of dioxin-type endocrine disruptors, we have established a novel telomerase-immortalized oviduct porcine epithelial cell line (TERT-OPEC). TERT-OPEC exhibited active telomerase and the immunoreactive epithelial marker cytokeratin but lacked the stromal marker vimentin. TERT-OPEC contained functional estrogen receptor (ER) -alpha and AhR, as determined by the detection of ER-alpha- and AhR-specific target molecules. Treatment of TERT-OPEC with the AhR ligand 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} production of the cytochrome P- 450 microsomal enzyme CYP 1 A 1. Activated AhR caused a downregulation of ER nuclear protein fraction and significantly decreased ER-signaling in TERT-OPEC as determined by ERE-luciferase transient transfection assays. In summary, the TCDD-induced and AhR-mediated anti-estrogenic responses by TERT-OPEC suggest that PHAH affect the predominantly estrogen-dependent differentiation of the oviduct epithelium within the fallopian tube. This action then alters the local endocrine milieu, potentially resulting in a largely unexplored cause of impaired embryonic development and female infertility...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} we {{investigated}} the ecotoxicological effects of endocrine disrupters in a four-year {{survey of the}} Mediterranean population of swordfish (Xiphias gladius). In the Mediterranean environment, top predators, such as swordfish, accumulate high concentrations of <b>polyhalogenated</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PHAHs) and toxic metals, potentially incurring high toxicological risk. The effects of organochlorines and trace elements (Hg, Cd and Pb) in 192 swordfish specimens, caught in the Strait of Messina, Sicily, Italy, were investigated using vitellogenin (Vtg), zona radiata proteins (Zrp) and CYP 1 A (BPMO, EROD) activities. Vtg and Zrp {{were found to be}} dramatically induced in some adult male specimens, suggesting that this species is highly exposed to estrogens in the Mediterranean Sea. A role of organochlorines in this induction phenomenon is suggested by the statistically significant correlations between Zrp in plasma and PCB concentrations in muscle (p< 0. 032) and Vtg in plasma and PCB concentrations in liver (p< 0. 034) of male specimens. Levels of trace elements in liver were in the following ranges: Hg 1 – 22, Cd 1 – 28 and Pb 0 – 1. 6 ppm d. w. These data indicate potential reproductive alterations in large pelagic fish and suggest the need for continuous monitoring to avoid reductions in the population of this fish species of high commercial and ecological interes...|$|R
40|$|Some {{ubiquitous}} pollutants of {{the aquatic}} environment, such as PCBs or other <b>polyhalogenated</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> may disrupt the thyroid hormone system. In a partial life cycle assay with zebrafish (Danio rerio), we studied {{the effects of}} the reference compound propylthiouracil (PTU) on reproduction, growth and development, histopathology of some target tissues, and plasma thyroid hormone levels. PTU induced a concentration-dependent increase of egg production with a concomitant decrease of mature oocyte size but had no effect on fertilization rate or hatching. In F 1, serious dysmorphogenesis was found in 4 dph larvae at the highest PTU level tested (100 mg/L), and there was a dose-dependent decrease in body length and weight at 42 dph (significant at 100 mg/L PTU). At this time, there was also a decreased scale thickness, suggesting inhibited metamorphosis, detectable at 1 mg/L PTU and higher. PTU also induced activation of the thyroid follicles in a concentration-dependent way, in juveniles associated with hyperemia in the thyroid area, and depletion of liver glycogen. Effects in adults were associated with decreased circulating levels of the thyroid hormones T 3 and T 4. These observations indicate that disruption of the thyroid hormone system may affect the fitness of these aquatic organisms. The zebrafish model may contribute to the identification of thyroid hormone disrupting activity in water samples and also in the interpretation of histological observations in free-ranging fish species...|$|R
40|$|Exogenous {{chemical}} carcinogenesis {{is an extremely}} complex mul-tifactorial process during which gene–environment interactions involving chronic exposure to exogenous chemical carcinogens (ECCs) and polymorphisms of cancer susceptibility genes add further complexity. We describe the properties and molecular mechanisms of ECCs that contribute to induce and generate can-cer. A basic and specific property of many lipophilic organic ECCs including polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> and <b>polyhalogenated</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> is their ability to bioaccumulate in the adipose tissue from where they may be released in the blood circulation and target peripheral tissues for carcinogenesis. Many organic ECCs are procarcinogens and consequently need to be activated by the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) system and/or other enzymes before they can adduct DNA and proteins. Because they contribute {{not only to the}} cocarcinogenic and promoting effects of many aromatic pollutants but also to their mutagenic effects, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-activating and the inducible CYP sys-tems are central to exogenous {{chemical carcinogenesis}}. Another basic property of ECCs is their ability to induce stable and bulky DNA adducts that cannot be simply repaired by the different re-pair systems. In addition, following ECC exposure, mutagenesis may also be caused indirectly by free-radical production and by epigenetic alterations. As a result of complex molecular inter-plays, direct and/or indirect mutagenesis may especially account for the carcinogenic effects of many exogenous metals and metal-loids. Because of these molecular properties and action mecha-nisms, we conclude that ECCs could be major contributors to human cancer, with obviously great public health consequences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mouse and rat {{models are}} mainstays in pharmacology, {{toxicology}} and drug development – but differences between strains and between species complicate data {{interpretation and application}} to human health. Dioxin-like <b>polyhalogenated</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> represent a major class of environmentally and economically relevant toxicants. In mammals dioxin exposure leads to {{a broad spectrum of}} adverse affects, including hepatotoxicity of varying severity. Several studies have shown that dioxins extensively alter hepatic mRNA levels. Surprisingly, though, analysis of a limited portion of the transcriptome revealed that rat and mouse responses diverge greatly (Boverhof et al. Toxicol Sci 94 : 398 – 416, 2006). Results We employed oligonucleotide arrays to compare the response of 8, 125 rat and mouse orthologs. We confirmed that there is limited inter-species overlap in dioxin-responsive genes. Rat-specific and mouse-specific genes are enriched for specific functional groups which differ between species, conceivably accounting for species-specificities in liver histopathology. While no evidence for the involvement of copy-number variation was found, extensive inter-species variation in the transcriptional-regulatory network was identified; Nr 2 f 1 and Fos emerged as candidates to explain species-specific and species-independent responses, respectively. Conclusion Our results suggest that a small core of genes is responsible for mediating the similar features of dioxin hepatotoxicity in rats and mice but non-overlapping pathways are simultaneously at play to result in distinctive histopathological outcomes. The extreme divergence between mouse and rat transcriptomic responses appears to reflect divergent transcriptional-regulatory networks. Taken together, these data suggest that both rat and mouse models should be used to screen the acute hepatotoxic effects of drugs and toxic compounds. </p...|$|R
