40|$|AbstractThe {{incorporation}} of the DNA <b>packaging</b> <b>connector</b> complex during lambdoid phage assembly in vivo is strictly controlled—one and {{only one of the}} twelve identical icosahedral vertices is differentiated by the inclusion of a portal or connector dodecamer. Proposed control mechanisms include obligate nucleation from a connector containing complex, addition of the connector as the final step during assembly, and a connector-mediated increase in the growth rate. The inability to recapitulate connector incorporation in vitro has made it difficult to obtain direct biochemical evidence in support of one model over another. Here we report the development an in vitro assembly system for the well characterized dsDNA phage Phi 29 which results in the co-assembly of connector with capsid and scaffolding proteins to form procapsid-like particles (PLPs). Immuno-electron microscopy demonstrates the specific {{incorporation of}} connector vertex in PLPs. The connector protein increases both the yield and the rate of capsid assembly suggesting that the {{incorporation of the}} connector in Phi 29 likely promotes nucleation of assembly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} a new algorithm for the au-tomatic synthesis of SPICE-ready equivalent circuits of complex multiport lumped interconnect structures. The method is named Time-Domain Vector Fitting (TD-VF) {{due to its}} analogy to the well-known Vector Fitting algorithm, which operates in frequency domain. The TD-VF computes a rational approximation of the transfer matrix for the structure under modeling using as raw data its transient port responses to suitable excitations. These include, e. g., the case of transient port scattering responses as typically obtained by full-wave electromagnetic solvers based on the Finite-Differences Time-Domain (FDTD) or Finite In-tegration (FIT) methods. The TD-VF algorithm works entirely in the time domain, without requiring any knowledge of the frequency-domain responses. This allows direct processing of possibly truncated transient responses, therefore allowing for short full-wave simulations. This paper shows that the accuracy level achiavable by TD-VF is excellent. Hence, passivity can be enforced a posteriori using the spectral properties of associated Hamiltonian matrices. Several examples of <b>package,</b> <b>connectors,</b> and discontinuities are provided as illustration. I...|$|R

The microfluidic interconnects use standard HPLC PEEK tubing, {{with the tip}} machined to accept either an o-ring or custom molded ring which serves the dual function of forming the seal and providing mechanical retention strength.

50|$|The SCSI ID of {{a device}} in a drive {{enclosure}} {{that has a}} back plane is set either by jumpers or by the slot in the enclosure the device is installed into, depending {{on the model of}} the enclosure. In the latter case, each slot on the enclosure's back plane delivers control signals to the drive to select a unique SCSI ID. A SCSI enclosure without a back plane often has a switch for each drive to choose the drive's SCSI ID. The enclosure is <b>packaged</b> with <b>connectors</b> that must be plugged into the drive where the jumpers are typically located; the switch emulates the necessary jumpers. While there is no standard that makes this work, drive designers typically set up their jumper headers in a consistent format that matches the way that these switches implement.|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} is an electronically commutated {{brushless motor}} controller that incorporates Hall-array sensing in a small, 42 -gram package that provides 4096 absolute counts per motor revolution position sensing. The unit {{is the size}} of a miniature hockey puck, and is a 44 -pin male connector that provides many I/O channels, including CANbus, RS- 232 communications, general-purpose analog and digital I/O (GPIO), analog and digital Hall inputs, DC power input (18 - 90 VDC, 0 -l 0 A), three-phase motor outputs, and a strain gauge amplifier. This controller replaces air cooling with conduction cooling via a high-thermal-conductivity epoxy casting. A secondary advantage of the relatively good heat conductivity that comes with ultra-small size is that temperature differences within the controller become smaller, so that it is easier to measure the hottest temperature in the controller with fewer temperature sensors, or even one temperature sensor. Another size-sensitive design feature is in the approach to electrical noise immunity. At a very small size, where conduction paths are much shorter than in conventional designs, the ground becomes essentially isopotential, and so certain (space-consuming) electrical noise control components become unnecessary, which helps make small size possible. One winding-current sensor, applied to all of the windings in fast sequence, is smaller and wastes less power than the two or more sensors conventionally used to sense and control winding currents. An unexpected benefit of using only one current sensor is that it actually improves the precision of current control by using the "same" sensors to read each of the three phases. Folding the encoder directly into the controller electronics eliminates a great deal of redundant electronics, <b>packaging,</b> <b>connectors,</b> and hook-up wiring. The reduction of wires and connectors subtracts substantial bulk and eliminates their role in behaving as EMI (electro-magnetic interference) antennas. A shared knowledge by each motor controller of the state of all the motors in the system at 500 Hz also allows parallel processing of higher-level kinematic matrix calculations...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at the {{extraction}} of lumped equivalent circuits for complex interconnect structures like <b>packages</b> and <b>connectors</b> that are used for high data-rate applications. Such structures are character-ized by a high geometrical complexity and by {{a large number of}} ports. These features, combined with the requirement of a wideband characterization, pose serious challenges for the extraction of lumped macro-models that are able to reproduce in an accurate and efficient way the input-output port behavior of the interconnect. The macromodeling procedure that we propose in this paper is based on time-domain char-acterization. The macromodel is constructed through the following steps. First, a CAD-level geometrical description of the structure is imported into a full-wave electromagnetic solver. We use here a solver based on the Finite Integration method [2]. The structure is discretized using a suitable mesh and solved in time-domain. The employed solver allows to excite separately the ports using bandlimited pulses, producing a complete set of transient scattering responses. The iteration of this procedure leads to a full matrix of port responses excited by a single source placed on one port at the time. These responses provide the raw input to the core of the macromodeling algorithm. The macromodel extraction is performed by...|$|R
40|$|Putting new {{findings}} into {{the context of}} available literature knowledge is one approach {{to deal with the}} surge of high-throughput data results. Furthermore, prior knowledge can increase the performance and stability of bioinformatic algorithms, for example, methods for network reconstruction. In this review, we examine software packages for the statistical computing framework R, which enable the integration of pathway data for further bioinformatic analyses. Different approaches to integrate and visualize pathway data are identified and packages are stratified concerning their features according to a number of different aspects: data import strategies, the extent of available data, dependencies on external tools, integration with further analysis steps and visualization options are considered. A total of 12 packages integrating pathway data are reviewed in this manuscript. These are supplemented by five R-specific packages for visualization and six <b>connector</b> <b>packages,</b> which provide access to external tools...|$|R

40|$|Complex {{double-stranded}} (ds) DNA viruses such as bacteriophages {{and certain}} animal viruses (e. g. adenoviruses and herpesviruses) exhibit a complex maturation process that involves various steps. A {{first step is}} the assembly of a viral prohead, which {{is followed by the}} packaging of the DNA genome. During the entire process of genome packaging and after this key step, the prohead under-goes several transitions that end up in a final mature virion. One shared feature in viral maturation is the connector, a homo-dodecameric protein that {{plays a key role in}} the first steps of the prohead assembly and in DNA <b>packaging</b> [1]. The <b>connector</b> is found in a unique vertex of the prohead and is associated with other viral components of the packaging machinery building the portal vertex. Viral ATPases, called terminases, form part of this portal complex and their activity is required for DNA translocation. Approximately one molecule of ATP is hydrolysed to package 2 bp of DNA. The complex machinery that translocates the DNA inside the viral prohead is quite effective, as it does so at a speed of around 100 bp per second, generating forces up to 57 pN [3]. In order to derive structural information for T 7 portal protein by X-ray small angle scattering we collected data at the EMBL X 33 beamline, using a MarIP 345 detector in 2300 × 2300 345 mm @ 0. 15 scan mode and measurement cells of 75 µl.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore {{technology}} : subsea technologyEmergency disconnect {{from the}} stack-up with large rig offset during well intervention is {{considered as a}} critical operation. Failure of disconnection from the well {{can lead to a}} major accident. Unofficial figures suggest that the connector fails to release 15 – 20 times globally each year. The industry has little detailed knowledge of the kinematics and trajectories of an emergency disconnect. GE Oil & Gas has shown interest of gaining more information regarding this matter. To comply with ISO 13628 - 7 the industry has developed High Angle Release (HAR) connectors for the Emergency Disconnect <b>Package</b> (EDP). The <b>connector</b> shall be able to safely release with a minimum offset angle of 10 °. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze the motions and the associated forces occurring immediately after disconnecting from the stack-up. To analyze the dynamics of the EDP after emergency disconnect Orcaflex was used. The established model in Orcaflex is verified by manual calculations and reasonable considerations. For better understanding of the dynamics involved, the Emergency Quick Disconnect (EQD) is analyzed with three different water depths and 15 Te overpull at the High Angle Release (HAR) connector. The rig offset of 10 ° caused a bending moment of approximately 1000 kNm at the connector with the given riser configuration. The results showed that a large rotational motion dominated immediately after release. The EDP rotated with 12. 6 ° within the first second after initiated EQD. Also an initial horizontal acceleration was found to occur simultaneously. The maximum initial horizontal acceleration was found to be approximately 4. 7 m/s 2. This led to a horizontal displacement of approximately 210 mm and a maximum velocity of 0. 25 m/s. Several simulations with different EQD timing in waves were performed. This resulted in a minimum acceleration of approximately 6 m/s 2 and a maximum acceleration of approximately 8 m/s 2 in vertical direction depending on vessels position in the wave...|$|R

40|$|Power {{distribution}} networks (PDNs) {{are conducting}} structures employed in semiconductor systems {{with the aim}} of providing circuits with reliable and constant operating voltage. This network has non-neglible electrical parasitics. Consequently, when digital circuits inside the chip switch, the supply voltage delivered to them does not remain ideal and exhibits spatial and temporal voltage fluctuations. These fluctuations in the supply voltage, known as the power-supply noise (PSN), can affect the functionality and the performance of modern microprocessors. The design of this PDN in the chip is an important part in ensuring power integrity. Modeling and simulation of the PSN in on-chip PDNs is important to reduce the cost of processors. These PDNs have irregular geometries, which affect the PSN. As a result, they have to be modeled. The problem sizes encountered in this simulation are usually large (on the order of millions), necessitating computationally efficient simulation approaches. Existing approaches for this simulation do not guarantee {{at least one of the}} following three required properties: computationally efficiency, accuracy, and numerically robustness. Therefore, there is a need to develop accurate, numerically robust, and efficient algorithms for this simulation. For many interconnects (e. g., transmission lines, board <b>connectors,</b> <b>package</b> PDNs), only their frequency responses and SPICE circuits (e. g., nonlinear switching drivers, equivalent circuits of interconnects) terminating them are known. These frequency responses are usually available only up to a certain maximum frequency. Simulating the electrical behavior of these systems is important for the reliable design of microprocessors and for their faster time-to-market. Because terminations can be nonlinear, a transient simulation is required. There is a need for a transient simulation of band-limited frequency-domain data characterizing a multiport passive system with SPICE circuits. The number of ports can be large (greater than or equal to 100 ports). In this simulation, unlike in traditional circuit simulators, normal properties like stability and causality of transient results are not automatically met and have to be ensured. Existing techniques for this simulation do not guarantee at least one of the following three required properties: computationally efficiency for a large number of ports, causality, and accuracy. Therefore, there is a need to develop accurate and efficient time-domain techniques for this simulation that also ensure causality. The objectives of this Ph. D. research are twofold: 1) To develop accurate, numerically robust, and computationally efficient time-domain algorithms to compute PSN in on-chip PDNs with irregular geometries. 2) To develop accurate and computationally efficient time-domain algorithms for the causal cosimulation of band-limited frequency-domain data with SPICE circuits.
