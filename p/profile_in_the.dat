To maximise the SS's <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, GM also replaced in NASCAR the Chevrolet Impala with the SS, which races in Nascar's premier series through 2017..|$|E
5|$|A notable {{aspect of}} the flow is that shear stress is {{constant}} throughout the flow domain. In particular, the first derivative of the velocity, , is constant.

He was reclusive, and his physical health declined, as he suffered from stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|After Harrison led Indiana's Republican {{delegation}} at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he {{was considered}} the state's presumptive candidate for the U.S. Senate. He gave speeches in favor of Garfield in Indiana and New York, further raising his <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> party. However, when the Republicans retook {{the majority in the}} state legislature, Harrison's election to a six-year term in the U.S. Senate was threatened by Judge Walter Q. Gresham, his intra-party rival, but Harrison was ultimately chosen. After Garfield's election as president in 1880, his administration offered Harrison a cabinet position, but Harrison declined in favor of continuing his service in the US. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of the House Republicans, he adopted a much lower <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media than {{conventional}} wisdom would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for DeLay. In 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign-finance violations. DeLay stepped down as majority leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned from Congress the following year.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, other doctors were also experimenting with gland transplantation, {{including}} Serge Voronoff, {{who had become}} known for grafting monkey testicles into men. In 1920, Voronoff demonstrated his technique before several other doctors {{at a hospital in}} Chicago, at which Brinkley showed up uninvited. Though Brinkley was barred at the door, his appearance elevated his <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press, which eventually resulted in his own demonstration at a hospital in Chicago. Brinkley transplanted goat testicles into 34 patients, including a judge, an alderman, a society matron and the chancellor of the now-defunct Chicago Law School (not {{to be confused with the}} University of Chicago Law School), all while the press looked on. His public profile grew, and his gland business in Milford continued at a brisk pace.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder. In one case, he used a form of the insanity defense that saved the accused from the gallows; the woman was instead confined to a mental institution. Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were accused under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newly formed Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, Ferdinand VII {{refused to}} renew the Spanish Constitution of 1812, {{returning}} the Empire to an absolutist method of government. Consequently, Ramírez contacted some of his allies in Philadelphia and commissioned the production of banknotes in denominations of 3 and 5 reales. The issues were printed by Murray, Draper, Fairman & Company and featured the signatures of treasurer José Bacener and Ramírez. The designs featured the Spanish Crown and Ferdinand VII's <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two varieties and were numbered manually. No official documentation, letter or decree from the Spanish Crown related {{to the creation of}} these notes have surfaced. These issues were collected and destroyed with extreme efficacy in 1866, leaving only a few dozen intact.|$|E

5|$|NSAIDs are {{the usual}} {{first-line}} treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly {{more or less}} effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been {{the most commonly used}} NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.|$|E
5|$|Resuming {{his legal}} studies at Otago, Barrowclough {{graduated}} with a law degree in 1921 and set up practice in Dunedin. He later lectured part-time in law. He rejoined the Territorial Force and from 1924 to 1929 commanded the 1st Battalion, Otago Infantry Regiment. In 1930, {{he was promoted to}} colonel and given command of the 3rd New Zealand Infantry Brigade. He resigned from the Territorial Force in 1931 when he accepted an offer of a partnership in the Auckland law firm Russell, McVeagh, Bagnall and Macky.

Despite his retirement as a diplomat in 1974, Thornton maintained a relatively high <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public sector. Until 1983, he served as {{the chair of the}} Alcoholic Liquor Advisory Council and often commented on defence issues, particularly on New Zealand's anti-nuclear stance as well as the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty. At one stage, he was criticised by the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, David Lange, for his views. He also presented several documentaries on various aspects of New Zealand's military history. He died on 10 June 1999 at the age of 82.|$|E
5|$|While {{assigned}} to the nuclear delivery role, the Victor was finished in an all-over anti-flash white colour scheme, {{designed to protect the}} aircraft against the damaging effects of a nuclear detonation. The white colour scheme was intended to reflect heat away from the aircraft; paler variations of RAF's roundels were also applied for this same reason. When the V-bombers were {{assigned to}} the low-level approach <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, the Victors were soon repainted in green/grey tactical camouflage to reduce visibility to ground observation; the same scheme was applied to subsequently converted tanker aircraft.|$|E
5|$|At the 1860 convention, Payne {{denounced the}} right of secession, and during the Civil War that began the next year, he was a staunch {{supporter}} of the Union. Although {{he was not an}} abolitionist, he opposed the further extension of slavery. During the war, Payne used some of his wealth to help equip Ohio regiments. He was 50 years old when the war began, too old to volunteer himself, but two of his sons served in the Union Army with his blessing. After the war, Payne continued his political activity, leading the Ohio delegation to the 1872 Democratic National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Horace Greeley. He campaigned on Greeley's behalf, raising his own political <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. In 1874, Payne ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from Ohio's 20th district, and was elected with a 2500-vote majority over the incumbent Republican, Richard C. Parsons.|$|E

5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for {{his insistence}} on not letting the O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials {{on the subject}} and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, {{and he was the}} only anchor to broadcast from Canada {{on the eve of the}} referendum.|$|E
5|$|The large {{service sector}} {{is evident in}} the number of local and foreign banks and {{insurance}} companies operating in the city. Kuala Lumpur is poised to become the global Islamic Financing hub with an increasing number of financial institutions providing Islamic Financing and the strong presence of Gulf's financial institutions such as the world's largest Islamic bank, Al-Rajhi Bank and Kuwait Finance House. Apart from that, the Dow Jones & Company is keen to work with Bursa Malaysia to set up Islamic Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs), which would help raise Malaysia's <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf. The city has a large number of foreign corporations and is also host to many multi national companies' regional offices or support centres, particularly for finance and accounting, and information technology functions.

5|$|The nation {{initially}} did {{not know}} what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Harding administration; many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.|$|E
