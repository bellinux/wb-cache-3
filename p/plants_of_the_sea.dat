Packed earthen floors, wooden benches for sitting and {{sleeping}}, glowing hearths, and {{sheep and goats}} sleeping under the roof with their owners during severe frosts - Slavard dwellings can hardly be called places of comfort. Their houses are heated with chimneyless stoves, to make matters worse. Slavards prefer to sleep outside whenever the weather permits. The braces of their doubly-sloped roofs are usually decorated with depictions of animal heads. The shutters on their windows are also covered with stylized carvings depicting waves or <b>plants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> A Slavard's yard is generally enclosed by a fence or palisade wall. Human skulls are often seen hanging over the gates, the skulls of the ancestors of those who now live here, elevated to protect the inhabitants from misfortune, frost, and evildoers.|$|E

Beyond the shelf, waters plunge to 4000 m and more. Despite the clarity of the water column a broad diversity of tiny organisms are found in the pelagic environment. Plankton are the ocean's 'wanderers' (from the Greek 'planktos') and are tiny organisms that drift or have limited powers of locomotion. The <b>plants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> (phytoplankton, Fig. 14. 1) are autotrophic and generate energy, in the form of sugars, by photosynthesis. All other planktonic organisms (bacteria, zooplankton etc., Fig. 14. 2) are heterotrophs. Some plankton are 'mesotrophic' that is, both autotrophic and heterotrophic (e. g. protists, derived from the Greek 'first of all'). Phytoplankton are the basis of pelagic and benthic food chains that are now known to be complex, and involve many trophic transformations within microbial food webs.

Whereby various analyses the different valley types within the reservoir, drainagepatterns, longitudinal and crosscut profiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watercourse, <b>the</b> lengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main river and branches are displayed. Therefore, it was designated that Sorgun Stream has a main river length of 79 km’s between it’s spring at 2350 meters altitude andit’s river mouth and has a total length of 966 km’s with all it’s branches. Effects of topography and geological structure in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> running water system and distribution of water resourcesare displayed.

The watercourse settleditself on the structure formed different drainage systems. It has been determined that the difference in the drainage systems is dueto <b>the</b> change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area towards south-west direction with epeirogenesis, which was towards South directionbefore Tertiary. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> faults and lengths of drifting areas, characteristics of litolojik structure, footprint of mountainous, plateau, hillygrounds areas which were effective in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reservoir are also determined. <b>The</b> properties <b>of</b> butte, crest, amphitheatre formation, plain area, cliff, meander, shore topography, carstic area, doline, cave,travertine area, ground and plant characteristics, field, length, amount and assortments are determined. At the same time, theeffects of heights, slope, aspect properties, topography, geologic structure, hydrographical structure and climate are identified. The 8 km long straight coastline extends at <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reservoir in the north-east to south-west direction. The Plato seenat - 20 meters depth in <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> starts at a distance of 200 meters from <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> river-mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sorgun Stream and Erdemli lowland. It has been observed that, with 326 sq km wide area the tertiary terrain puts forward <b>the</b> general character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reservoirwhich is followed by 154 sq km wide Mesozoic terrain and 19. 3 sq km wide Quaternary terrain. Reservoir also contains 4 explicitfault and 3 drifting areas.

It has been observed that <b>the</b> characteristic <b>plants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sorgun Stream reservoir are red pine (Pinus brutia), black pine (Pinusnigra), oak (Quercus), juniper (Juniperus sp.) and cedar (Cedrus libani). During this research study the inconsistencies between various data collected by the several Governmental institutions wasnoticed.
