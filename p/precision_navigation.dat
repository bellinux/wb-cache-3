40|$|Abstract. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{interoperability}} {{could make}} use of the information from different navigation satellite systems. To estimate GNSS interoperability at the system level, an innovative assessment algorithm was presented in this paper. First of all, three assessment parameters, namely, Dilution Of <b>Precision</b> (DOP), <b>Navigation</b> Satellite System <b>Precision</b> (NSSP) and <b>Navigation</b> Satellite System Integrity (NSSI) were introduced. Secondly, availability and continuity of the assessment parameters were adopted to quantify the GNSS performance. A further step was then taken to focus on the assessment rule for GNSS performance by employing the weighted sum of availability and continuity. Simulation results demonstrate that GNSS performance could be improved significantly by interoperability. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNavigation without {{vision is}} {{a skill that}} is often {{employed}} in our daily lives, such as walking in the dark at night. Navigating without vision to a remembered target has previously been studied. However, {{little is known about}} the impact of age or obstacles on the attentional demands of a blind navigation task. This study examined the impacts of age and obstacles on reaction time (RT) and <b>navigation</b> <b>precision</b> during blind <b>navigation</b> in dual-task conditions. The aims were to determine the effects of age, obstacles, and auditory stimulus location on RT and <b>navigation</b> <b>precision</b> in a blind navigation task. Ten healthy young adults (24. 5 ± 2. 5 years) and ten healthy older adults (69. 5 ± 2. 9 years) participated in the study. Participants were asked to walk to a target located 8 m ahead. In half the trials, the path was obstructed with hanging obstacles. Participants performed this task in the absence of vision, while executing a discrete RT task. Results demonstrated that older adults presented increased RT, linear distance travelled (LDT), and obstacle contact; that obstacle presence significantly increased RT compared to trials with no obstacles; and that an auditory stimulus emitted early versus late in the path increased LDT. Results suggest that the attentional demands of blind navigation are higher in older than young adults, as well as when obstacles are present. Furthermore, <b>navigation</b> <b>precision</b> is affected by age and when participants are distracted by the secondary task early in navigation, presumably because the secondary task interferes with path estimation...|$|R
