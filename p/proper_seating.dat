50|$|<b>Proper</b> <b>seating</b> is {{essential}} to prevent spinal curvatures. Severe scoliosis is common in DMD and can interfere with sitting, sleeping, and breathing. A wheelchair that is fitted appropriately accounts for frame size, type of seat, lumbar support and cushioning to avoid pressure ulcers. It should be equipped with other mechanical devices, such as tilt ability, {{in order to provide}} comfort and to protect the skin. Power wheelchairs are indicated for most clients who can no longer ambulate, as they do not have enough upper extremity strength to propel a manual wheelchair independently. DMD affects many people in their adolescence, so it is crucial for rehab therapists to be conscious that significant development may occur during this time. Without <b>proper</b> <b>seating</b> and postural support throughout development, deformation may occur. This could then result in dysfunctional positioning. It is important for rehab therapists to re-evaluate the fit of an individual’s wheelchair as often as every year during adolescence.|$|E
50|$|The Riverside was {{originally}} terracing that backed onto the Thames. It also featured large advertising hoardings above the fans. By 1973, a <b>proper</b> <b>seated</b> stand {{had been built}} called the Eric Miller Stand (one of the directors at the time). The stand was opened in a prestigious friendly against S.L. Benfica, who included Eusébio in the team. The name of the stand became called simply The Riverside after the discovery of Eric Miller's suicide, who had been under investigation for fraud and embezzlement.|$|R

50|$|One {{variant of}} the Halligan has a heavy sliding collar on the shaft. Once the prying end of the tool is wedged into position, the sliding 'hammer' is used to force the wedge, {{allowing}} for <b>proper</b> <b>seating</b> before prying. The adze end is also assisted by using the sliding hammer to generate forced traction on a hooked cylinder. Another variant has an end that resembles a lever-type can opener, used for making large holes for access or ventilation in sheet metal.|$|E
50|$|The T60/4 was {{produced}} from October 1960 and are mechanically and outwardly {{similar to the}} late T60. It was the same length and width as the standard T60, but differed in having extra room in the back for two seats, the additional space being created by a revised rear body moulding, thus creating <b>proper</b> <b>seats</b> in the back for two children. The rear bench seat was fastened {{to the car and}} the centre backrest had a bulge in it because of the revised rear wheel arch. The Car was available in both soft-top and hardtop forms. These cars used the revised front and rear suspension layouts used on the very late T60s.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: During {{pregnancy}} a woman’s body {{undergoes a}} considerable change {{in size and}} shape, and this can impact upon her safety during car travel. The two main issues are <b>proper</b> <b>seat</b> belt use and positioning, and steering wheel clearance. A comprehensive analysis of the questionnaire responses by pregnant women and anthropometric measurements demonstrates that the difficulties experienced {{can be explained by}} the physical changes and interactions throughout the body during gestation. Analysis of the anthropometry of pregnant women highlights that many pregnant users could easily be excluded from designs inadvertently if the design is based on males or non-pregnant females. Thus incorporation of pregnant women’s anthropometry into automotive design could reduce the exclusion rates and alleviate problems. This paper presents guidelines for the automotive industry generated from experiences and anthropometry of pregnant women, with the aim of improving safety for pregnant car occupants...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{press-in}} studs {{are designed}} and recommended {{to be installed}} with a mechanical or hydraulic press to ensure <b>proper</b> <b>seating</b> without damage. It is possible, though not advised, to install a press-in by using a washer and nut to [...] "draw" [...] it into the hub. In doing so, the installer must ensure that the stud is fully seated and that no damage is done to the threaded portion of the stud. While a common installation method by many garage mechanics, this method puts excessive strain on the stud, and can cause it to stretch and fatigue, {{which could lead to}} premature failure.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} few years KADS set about {{transforming}} their new theatre. A trap door was built {{to take advantage of the}} first floor and in 1950 a surplus pavilion from Mobberly Cricket Club was transported to Queen Street to form dressing rooms and a workshop. During the 1960s indoor toilets, <b>proper</b> <b>seating</b> and central heating was installed. The society continue to invest in the property and the auditorium and bar are now fitted to a very high standard. Photographs of productions and poster designs can be viewed on the theatre website and The National Archives hold a programme from the 1971 - 72 season.|$|E

The aircraft was an Ilyushin Il-76 registered as UR-UCB and was operated by Ukrainian Cargo Airways, an Ukrainian state-owned charter airline company based in Kiev. The flight was a 2 hour flight. The flight was chartered by the military to transport military soldiers and their families to their home in Lubumbashi, which was located on the south of the country in Haut-Katanga Province. Lubumbashi is a home to a large military base in Congo. At the time, the cargo compartment was full of people; many were sleeping in the middle section and near the cargo door.

50|$|The {{installation}} of Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) on older tractors that lack these protective devices {{has been identified}} as a viable solution for reducing overturn fatality rates among U.S. farmers. When worn with a seat belt, these engineering controls are 99% effective in preventing operator death if an overturn occurs. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (USA) estimates that fatality rates from tractor overturns in the U.S. could be reduced by a minimum of 71% if all tractors were equipped with ROPS. When paired with <b>proper</b> <b>seat</b> belt use on tractors, NIOSH estimates that ROPS could eliminate nearly all fatalities caused by tractor and lawn mower overturns. Without a seat belt, the ROPS is still 70% effective in preventing operator death, though {{there is a possibility that}} the rider may be thrown from the tractor during the overturn, and thus left unprotected by the ROPS.|$|R
60|$|Rollo was, in fact, quite {{concerned}} {{for a few}} minutes lest the conductor should have been left behind. He knew where this official's <b>proper</b> <b>seat</b> was; namely, at the left end of the banquette--that is, at the right hand, as seen in the engraving; and as he was not there, and as he knew that all the other seats were full, he presumed, of course, that he had been left behind. He was relieved of these fears, however, very soon; for, to his great astonishment, he suddenly perceived the head of the conductor coming {{up the side of the}} coach, followed gradually by the rest of his body as he climbed up to his place. Rollo wondered how he could manage to get on and climb up, especially as the coach was at this time thundering along a descending portion of the street with a speed and uproar that was terrific.|$|R

5000|$|The longest running {{point of}} {{contention}} is the refusal by the Opera House Trust to allow the orchestra to drill small holes into the concert hall stage to allow <b>proper</b> <b>seating</b> of the endpins (spikes on the bottom) of their cellos and double basses, which is believed to give a better resonance to these instruments. The orchestra seats their endpins in planks of wood placed on the stage, as the Opera House Trust maintains that the entire building is heritage-listed under Australian law and that such work would therefore be illegal. Edo de Waart was particularly critical of this during his tenure as Chief Conductor in the 1990s, arguing in the press that the building had been specifically constructed for the orchestra {{and that it was}} a scandal that the orchestra was being forced to accept a reduced sound quality. However, the Opera House Trust has refused to bend and as of 2012 the orchestra was still using the planks of wood.|$|E
50|$|The clubhouse {{and pitch}} {{were ready for}} the opening game of the 1957-58 season against Wingate. A year later the main stand was built by the groundsman Albert Prior, his son Maurice and {{chairman}} Frank Davis in their spare time. It held 400 spectators on bench seats and had a door in the centre to the changing rooms. Floodlights came in 1964, the current function hall three years later and then, in 1968, up went the covered terrace {{on the east side}} of the ground. It cost £2,000 and then held 400-500 standing spectators under its concrete cantilever roof. In 1977 the current changing rooms were built, enabling the conversion of the old changing rooms to the clubhouse. In 1982 <b>proper</b> <b>seating</b> was installed for the first time, with the oak seats in the directors box were taken from White Hart Lane's old west stand (which was being demolished) and the plywood seating to the north end of the stand was taken from the relatively new north-west corner of White Hart Lane. The ground currently has a capacity of 3,500, of which 424 is seated and 600 is covered.|$|E
