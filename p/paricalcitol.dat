40|$|Introduction: Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} {{is highly}} prevalent in kidney transplant recipients, and commonly results in hypercalcaemia; an association to osteopenia and bone fractures {{has also been}} observed. <b>Paricalcitol</b> has proved effective to control secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease in both dialysed and non-dialysed patients, with a low hypercalcaemia incidence. Currently available experience on <b>paricalcitol</b> use in kidney transplant recipients is scarce. Our main aim was to show the effect of <b>paricalcitol</b> on mineral bone metabolism in kidney transplant recipients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Material and methods: A retrospective multicentre study in kidney transplant recipients aged > 18 years with a 12 -month or longer post-transplantation course, stable renal function, having received <b>paricalcitol</b> for more than 12 months, with available clinical follow-up for a 24 -month period. Results: A total of 69 patients with a 120  ±  92 -month post-transplantation course were included. Baseline creatinine was 2. 2  ±  0. 9  mg/dL and GFR-MDRD was 36  ±  20  mL/min/ 1. 73  m 2. <b>Paricalcitol</b> doses were gradually increased during the study: baseline 3. 8  ±  1. 9  μg/week, 12 months 5. 2  ±  2. 4  μg/week; 24 months 6. 0  ±  2. 9  μg/week (P  10  mg/dL showed gradually decreasing levels. Fifteen (21. 7 %) patients had received prior calcitriol therapy. When shifted to <b>paricalcitol,</b> such patients required <b>paricalcitol</b> doses significantly larger than those not having received calcitriol. <b>Paricalcitol</b> was used concomitantly to cinacalcet in 11 patients with significant PTH reductions being achieved; clinical course was similar to other patients and <b>paricalcitol</b> doses were also similar. Conclusions: <b>Paricalcitol</b> is an effective therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism in kidney transplant recipients. Overall, no significant changes were observed in calcium and phosphorus levels or urinary excretion. Patients having previously received calcitriol required higher <b>paricalcitol</b> doses.

Because vitamin D analogs can inhibit β-catenin {{in other}} tissues, we tested whether the vitamin D analog <b>paricalcitol</b> could ameliorate podocyte injury, proteinuria, and renal fibrosis in adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy. Compared with vehicle-treated controls, <b>paricalcitol</b> preserved expression of nephrin, podocin, and WT 1; prevented proteinuria; and reduced glomerulosclerotic lesions induced by ADR. <b>Paricalcitol</b> also inhibited expression of proinflammatory cytokines, reduced renal infiltration of monocytes/macrophages, hampered activation of renal myofibroblasts, and suppressed {{expression of the}} fibrogenic TGF-β 1, CTGF, fibronectin, and types I and III collagen. Selective suppression of renal Wnt 4, Wnt 7 a, Wnt 7 b, and Wnt 10 a expression after ADR accompanied these renoprotective effects of <b>paricalcitol.</b> Significant upregulation of β-catenin, predominantly in podocytes and tubular epithelial cells, accompanied renal injury; <b>paricalcitol</b> largely abolished this induction of renal β-catenin and inhibited renal expression of Snail, a downstream effector of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

40|$|Background: Vitamin D is {{considered}} to exert a protective effect on various renal diseases but its underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether <b>paricalcitol</b> attenuates inflammation and apoptosis during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced renal proximal tubular cell injury through the prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) receptor EP 4. Methods: Human renal tubular epithelial (HK- 2) cells were pretreated with <b>paricalcitol</b> (2 ng/mL) for 1 hour and exposed to LPS (1 μg/mL). The effects of <b>paricalcitol</b> pretreatment in relation to an EP 4 blockade using AH- 23848 or EP 4 small interfering RNA (siRNA) were investigated. Results: The expression of cyclooxygenase- 2, PGE₂, and EP 4 were significantly increased in LPS-exposed HK- 2 cells treated with <b>paricalcitol</b> compared with cells exposed to LPS only. <b>Paricalcitol</b> prevented cell death induced by LPS exposure, and the cotreatment of AH- 23848 or EP 4 siRNA offset these cell-protective effects.

In obstructed kidneys of UUO mice, monotherapy with aliskiren or <b>paricalcitol</b> significantly attenuated interstitial fibrosis, collagen IV accumulation, and α-smooth muscle actin- and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotin nick end-labeling-positive cells. The combination treatment showed additive efficacy in inhibition of these parameters. Renal NADPH oxidase (Nox) 1 and Nox 2 were significantly decreased by aliskiren or <b>paricalcitol</b> alone or in combination, while renal Nox 4 expression was significantly reduced by <b>paricalcitol</b> mono- or combination treatment. Increased levels of p-Erk and p-p 38 MAPK, and NF-κB in UUO kidneys were also significantly reduced by either aliskiren or <b>paricalcitol</b> treatment alone or in combination. Aliskiren or <b>paricalcitol</b> monotherapy significantly reduced the expression of (pro) renin receptor in UUO kidneys. In addition, aliskiren tended to augment renin expression in UUO kidneys, but <b>paricalcitol</b> reduced its expression level. The combination treatment effectively blocked both (pro) renin receptor and renin expression induced by aliskiren, and resulted in a further reduction of the renal expression of angiotensin II AT 1 receptor.

While active vitamin D and its analogs have been shown to have renal protective effects in animals, these hormones have not been shown to reduce proteinuria in CKD patients. MethodsIn three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral <b>paricalcitol,</b> 220 CKD stage 3 and 4 patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) were randomized to oral <b>paricalcitol</b> (N = 107, mean dose 9. 5 μg/week) or placebo (N = 113) and followed for up to 24 weeks. In conjunction with other safety measures, proteinuria was measured by dipstick and read by an automated reader {{at the beginning and end}} of trial. We subsequently analyzed the dipstick data to evaluate the effect of <b>paricalcitol</b> on proteinuria. ResultsAt baseline, proteinuria was present in 57 patients randomized to oral <b>paricalcitol</b> and 61 patients randomized to placebo (NS). At the final visit, 29 / 57 (51 %) of the <b>paricalcitol</b> patients compared to 15 / 61 (25 %) placebo patients had reduction in proteinuria, P = 0. 004 (odds for reduction in proteinuria 3. 2 times greater for <b>paricalcitol</b> patients, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 6. 9). For the patients who had both proteinuria at baseline and parathyroid hormone (PTH) suppression (end point defined as 2 consecutive ≥ 30 % decreases in iPTH from baseline), 27 / 51 (53 %) patients had a reduction in the proteinuria in the <b>paricalcitol</b> group and 0 / 7 (0 %) had a reduction in proteinuria in the placebo group. Reduction of proteinuria favored patients on <b>paricalcitol,</b> regardless of age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or use of therapies to block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

40|$|Inflammation is a {{pathologic}} {{feature of}} a variety of chronic kidney diseases. Several lines of evidence suggest a potential anti-inflammatory role for vitamin D in chronic kidney disease, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, the effect of the synthetic vitamin D analogue <b>paricalcitol</b> on renal inflammation was investigated in a mouse model of obstructive nephropathy. <b>Paricalcitol</b> reduced infiltration of T cells and macrophages in the obstructed kidney. This inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration was accompanied by a decreased expression of RANTES and TNF-α. Induction of RANTES was localized primarily to the tubular epithelium, underscoring a role for tubular cells in renal inflammation. In a human proximal tubular cell line (HKC- 8), <b>paricalcitol</b> inhibited RANTES mRNA and protein expression and abolished the ability of tubular cells to recruit lymphocytes and monocytes after TNF-α stimulation. Although RANTES induction depended on NF-κB signaling, <b>paricalcitol</b> affected neither TNF-α–mediated IκBα phosphorylation and degradation nor p 65 NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation. Instead, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that <b>paricalcitol</b> abolished the binding of p 65 to its cognate cis-acting element in the RANTES promoter.

40|$|Background: Activation of {{the vitamin}} D-vitamin D {{receptor}} (VDR) axis {{has been shown}} to reduce blood pressure and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Besides cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis is a key element of adverse cardiac remodeling. We hypothesized that activation of the VDR by <b>paricalcitol</b> would prevent fibrosis and LV diastolic dysfunction in an established murine model of cardiac remodeling. Methods: Mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Mice were treated with <b>paricalcitol,</b> losartan, or a combination of both for a period of four consecutive weeks. Results: The fixed aortic constriction caused similar increase in blood pressure, both in untreated and paricalcitol- or losartan-treated mice. TAC significantly increased LV weight compared to sham operated animals (10. 2 +/- 0. 7 vs. 6. 9 +/- 0. 3 mg/mm, p < 0. 05). Administration of either <b>paricalcitol</b> (10. 5 +/- 0. 7), losartan (10. 8 +/- 0. 4), or a combination of both (9. 2 +/- 0. 6) did not reduce LV weight. Fibrosis was significantly increased in mice undergoing TAC (5. 9 +/- 1. 0 vs. sham 2. 4 +/- 0. 8 %, p < 0. 05). Treatment with losartan and <b>paricalcitol</b> reduced fibrosis (<b>paricalcitol</b> 1. 6 +/- 0. 3 % and losartan 2. 9 +/- 0. 6 %, both p < 0. 05 vs. TAC). This reduction in fibrosis in <b>paricalcitol</b> treated mice was associated with improved indices of LV contraction and relaxation, e. g. dPdtmax and dPdtmin and lower LV end diastolic pressure, and relaxation constant Tau. Also, treatment with <b>paricalcitol</b> and losartan reduced mRNA expression of ANP, fibronectin, collagen III and TIMP- 1. Discussion: Treatment with the selective VDR activator <b>paricalcitol</b> reduces myocardial fibrosis and preserves diastolic LV function due to pressure overload in a mouse model. This is associated with a reduced percentage of fibrosis and a decreased expression of ANP and several other tissue markers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the safety and efficacy of using <b>Paricalcitol</b> {{for the treatment of}} secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients on dialysis. The aim of the current meta-analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of <b>Paricalcitol</b> for the management of SHPT in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet on dialysis. A secondary aim was to determine if sufficient data was available to assess the effect of <b>Paricalcitol</b> for the management of proteinuria. Methods. A meta-analysis was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration’s RevMan 4. 2 software. Results. <b>Paricalcitol</b> is effective in lowering PTH in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis and is also effective in lowering proteinuria in diabetic CKD patients. However, we uncovered a safety signal identifying an elevated calcium phosphate product and a trend towards the development of hypercalcemia. A phosphate elevation was not demonstrated because the target used in the clinical studies was a [*]mg/dl, a value appropriate for dialysis patients and not CKD patients. Conclusion. Although <b>Paricalcitol</b> is effective in lowering PTH, we advise caution in the use of any active Vitamin D analogues in patients with CKD because of the potential risk of exacerbating vascular calcification...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} are {{more prevalent in}} patients with chronic kidney disease than {{in the general population}} and they are considered {{the leading cause of death}} in patients with end-stage renal disease. The discovery that vitamin D 3 plays a considerable role in cardiovascular protection has led, in recent years, to an increase in the administration of therapies based on the use of this molecule; nevertheless, several studies warned that an excess of vitamin D 3 may increase the risk of hypercalcemia and vascular calcifications. In this study we evaluated the effects of vitamin D 3, and of its selective analog <b>paricalcitol,</b> on immature cardiomyocytes. Results show that vitamin D 3 induces cAMP-mediated cell proliferation and significant intracellular calcification. <b>Paricalcitol,</b> however, induces cell differentiation, morphological modifications in cell shape and size, and no intracellular calcification. Furthermore, vitamin D 3 and <b>paricalcitol</b> differently affect cardiomyoblasts responses to acetylcholine treatment. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the effects of vitamin D 3 and <b>paricalcitol</b> on cardiomyoblasts are different and, if these in vitro observations could be extrapolated in vivo, they suggest that <b>paricalcitol</b> has the potential for cardiovascular protection without the risk of inducing intracellular calcification...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patients with {{diabetic}} nephropathy {{are at high}} risk for further progressive renal function loss. Treatments that decrease albuminuria have been linked with renal and cardiovascular protection. However, even when taking optimal treatment, residual renal and cardiovascular risk remains high which correlates with the magnitude of residual albuminuria. Use of vitamin D receptor activators, such as calcitriol and <b>paricalcitol,</b> is associated with improved survival. A small study with <b>paricalcitol</b> showed reductions in albuminuria. The VITAL study tests the hypothesis whether <b>paricalcitol</b> persistently reduces albuminuria in diabetic subjects already receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. Methods: Randomization in this double-blind trial is equal allocation to <b>paricalcitol</b> 1 mu/day, 2 mu g/day, or placebo. Inclusion criteria include: a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) between 100 3, 000 mg/g, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 15 - 90 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2), serum calciu...|$|E
40|$|Background: Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} {{is common}} amongst dialysis patients and {{is associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D analogues are effective treatments, but the adverse effects of traditional vitamin D preparations, especially hypercalcemia, are often dose-limiting. Purpose: We studied the efficacy and safety of <b>paricalcitol</b> {{for the treatment of}} secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients. Methods: We reviewed 13 adult hemodialysis patients treated with oral <b>paricalcitol.</b> The dosage of <b>paricalcitol</b> was adjusted according to the clinical response. Results: Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level decreased by 47. 3  ±  34. 3 % at 3 months and 74. 7  ±  36. 8 % by 3 years. Eight patients (62 %) responded and had reduction in PTH levels by at least 30 %; seven of them (87. 5 %) responded within the first 3 months. Responders had a significantly lower baseline PTH level than the nonresponders (64. 3  ±  32. 2 vs. 138. 5  ±  64. 0  pmol/L, p =  0. 02). None of the patients developed hypercalcemia, but hyperphosphatemia was present in all patients. Conclusion: There is a substantial improvement in PTH levels by <b>paricalcitol</b> treatment in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, and <b>paricalcitol</b> is generally well tolerated.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) {{is associated with}} structural and functional alterations of the peritoneal membrane, consisting of fibrosis, angiogenesis, and loss of ultrafiltration capacity. Vitamin D receptor activation (VDRA) {{plays an important role}} in mineral metabolism and inflammation, but also antiangiogenic and antifibrotic properties have been reported. Therefore, the effects of active vitamin D treatment on peritoneal function and remodeling were investigated. Rats were either kept näıve to PDF exposure or daily exposed to 10 mL PDF and were treated for five or seven weeks with oral <b>paricalcitol</b> or vehicle control. Non-PDF-exposed rats showed no peritoneal changes upon <b>paricalcitol</b> treatment. <b>Paricalcitol</b> reduced endogenous calcitriol but did not affectmineral homeostasis.

No effect of <b>paricalcitol</b> treatment on total amount of peritoneal cells, peritoneal leukocyte composition, and epithelial tomesenchymal transition (EMT) was observed.

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests that active vitamin D slows the progression of chronic kidney diseases. Here we compared the individual renal protective efficacy of <b>paricalcitol</b> and trandolapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) in obstructive nephropathy, and examined any potential additive effects of their combination on attenuating renal fibrosis and inflammation. Mice underwent unilateral ureteral obstruction and were treated individually with <b>paricalcitol</b> or trandolapril or their combination. Compared to vehicle-treated controls, monotherapy with <b>paricalcitol</b> or trandolapril inhibited the expression and accumulation of fibronectin and type I and type III collagen, suppressed α-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and Snail 1 expression, and reduced total collagen content in the obstructed kidney. Combination therapy led to a more profound inhibition of all parameters. Monotherapy also suppressed renal RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α expression and inhibited renal infiltration of T cells and macrophages, whereas the combination had additive effects. Renin expression was induced in the fibrotic kidney and was augmented by trandolapril. <b>Paricalcitol</b> blocked renin induction in the absence or presence of trandolapril.

40|$|Vitamin D {{receptor}} agonists (VDRAs) directly suppress {{parathyroid hormone}} (PTH) mRNA expression. Different VDRAs {{are known to}} have differential effects on serum calcium (Ca), which may also affect serum PTH levels since serum Ca regulates PTH secretion mediated by the Ca-sensing receptor (CaSR). In this study, we compared the effects of <b>paricalcitol</b> and doxercalciferol on regulating serum Ca and PTH, and also the expression of PTH, VDR, and CaSR mRNA. The 5 / 6 nephrectomized (NX) Sprague-Dawley rats on a normal or hyperphosphatemia-inducing diet were treated with vehicle, <b>paricalcitol,</b> or doxercalciferol for two weeks. Both drugs at the tested doses (0. 042 – 0. 33 [*]g/kg) suppressed PTH mRNA expression and serum PTH effectively in the 5 / 6 NX rats, but <b>paricalcitol</b> was less potent in raising serum Ca than doxercalciferol. In pig parathyroid cells, <b>paricalcitol</b> and the active form of doxercalciferol induced VDR translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, suppressed PTH mRNA expression and inhibited cell proliferation in a similar manner, although <b>paricalcitol</b> induced the expression of CaSR mRNA more effectively.

40|$|Vascular {{calcification}} {{is associated}} with cardiovascular disease, {{the most common cause}} of death in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with CKD are treated with vitamin D receptor activators (VDRAs); therefore, we determined if this treatment affects vascular calcification. Uremic rats were given vehicle, calcitriol, <b>paricalcitol,</b> or doxercalciferol three times a week for 1 month. Calcitriol significantly increased the serum calcium–phosphate product and aortic calcium content. <b>Paricalcitol</b> had no effect but the same dose of doxercalciferol significantly increased the calcium–phosphate product and the aortic calcium content, the latter being confirmed by von Kossa staining. To see if the increased aortic calcium was due to an increased serum calcium–phosphate product or to a differential effect of the two VDRAs, we lowered the dose of doxercalciferol and increased the dose of <b>paricalcitol.</b> A lower doxercalciferol did not increase the calcium–phosphate product but increased the aortic calcium content. A higher dose of <b>paricalcitol</b> still had no effect. Doxercalciferol treatment increased the mRNA and protein expression of the bone-related markers Runx 2 and osteocalcin in the aorta, whereas <b>paricalcitol</b> did not.

40|$|IntroductionChronic {{kidney disease}} is a major public health problem. In the last decade, {{it has been shown}} that the early stages of chronic kidney disease are {{associated}} with an inflammatory condition involving an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and long-term mortality. In patients with chronic kidney disease and more specifically those on hemodialysis, cardiovascular events are the most common cause of death. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and may be an independent risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional analysis to identify factors that were associated with ADMA such as certain medications related to cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients. ResultsPatients who were treated with <b>paricalcitol</b> had significantly lower levels of ADMA (0. 21 ± 0. 19 μmol/l) compared with those not treated with <b>paricalcitol</b> (0. 42 ± 0. 35 μmol/l) (P = 0. 00027). Dividing ADMA levels by quartiles, patients treated with <b>paricalcitol</b> were less likely to have very high level ADMA (P =  0. 014), whereas there were no significant differences with other medications. Higher dose of <b>paricalcitol</b> was also related to lower levels of ADMA noting an inverse correlation (r = – 0. 36, P = 0. 013). DiscussionHemodialysis patients treated with <b>paricalcitol</b> presented significantly decreased ADMA levels compared with those who did not receive this treatment. Possible beneficial effects in terms of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by <b>paricalcitol</b> and its association with ADMA and nitric oxide synthesis are unknown.
