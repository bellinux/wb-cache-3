5000|$|The {{leading wheel}} or leading axle or <b>pilot</b> <b>wheel</b> of a steam {{locomotive}} is an unpowered wheel or axle located {{in front of}} the driving wheels. The axle or axles of the leading wheels are normally located on a leading truck. Leading wheels are used to help the locomotive negotiate curves and to support the front portion of the boiler.|$|E
5000|$|The Mississippi River style {{steamboat}} Belle of Louisville, (originally Idlewild and oldest in her class), is {{fitted with}} a steering engine. Original equipment when the boat was launched at Pittsburgh in 1915, the engine consists of a single double-acting steam cylinder mounted aft of and above the engines, coupled to the rudders, with the motion of travel abeam. The steam valves of the engine are controlled by mechanical linkages which extend up to levers mounted {{either side of the}} engine order telegraph, just aft of the <b>pilot</b> <b>wheel</b> in the pilot house above. The steering engine is open to public view. A functional description is given in the 1965 book Str. Belle of Louisville, by Alan L. Bates, the marine architect who supervised the restoration of the boat, who comments that when in use, the steering engine causes the <b>pilot</b> <b>wheel</b> to whirl [...] "as fast as an electric fan." [...] The same source also describes the functional need for steering hard-to in vessels of its type, whose combination of shallow draft and high above-water profile require rapid changes in rudder under shifting wind conditions, a need which is addressed by the steering engine.|$|E

50|$|With the Federal Highway Act of 1954, Congress {{responded to}} the {{recommendations}} of BPR by appropriating planning funds. BPR was authorized to work {{with each of the}} states to develop specific criteria for the parkway and to determine one specific route within each state for the Mississippi River Parkway. By the late 1950s, the familiar green-and-white <b>pilot's</b> <b>wheel</b> marker began to spring up on various sections of the designated route. Planning continued through the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Railroad maintenance. Railroad {{equipment}} is very heavy, {{and the track}} needs maintenance it's whole length, no matter how remote. The WorkStar's chassis can be ordered to mount road-rail <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels,</b> which let the truck run directly on the tracks. Racks can be mounted outside and above the cab so the truck can self-load and unload sections of rail onto them. The crew-cab is often used, and the truck also carries {{a large amount of}} tools and equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} likely used for both freight and {{passenger}} service for the Western and Atlantic. The Yonah {{was an example of}} an early 4-4-0 design, featuring a Haycock firebox design and having its <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels</b> closely spaced with the cylinder placed above at an angle. Thus, the engine was likely relegated to yard service as early as the late 1850s, as the railroad had acquired larger, more powerful locomotives such as the General and the Texas.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for the analysis}} of separate surface automatic flight control systems. The feasibility of such systems is demonstrated by the analysis of an example system, a separate surface wing-leveler for a Cessna 172. This example system employs a separate surface aileron with 15 % of the basic airplane roll control power. A 90 % reduction in bank-angle gust response can be obtained when compared with the basic airplane. The system does not feed back to the <b>pilot's</b> <b>wheel.</b> When failed (even hardover) the pilot retains more than adequate control of the airplane...|$|R
50|$|The popular {{interpretation}} of the piece is that it depicts a steam locomotive, an interpretation that {{is supported by the}} title of the piece. Honegger, however, insisted that he wrote it as an exercise in building momentum while the tempo of the piece slows. He originally titled it Mouvement Symphonique, only giving it the name Pacific 231, a class of steam locomotive designated in Whyte notation as a 4-6-2, with four <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels,</b> six driving wheels, and two trailing wheels (the French, who count axles rather than wheels when describing locomotives, call this arrangement 2-3-1) after it was finished.|$|R
5000|$|B&SR used early {{profits to}} replace wooden {{trestles}} with earthen fills. A 14 ft granite masonry arch was constructed over Hancock Brook in 1895. [...] Track {{was extended to}} Harrison with 35# steel rails in 1898. Trestles on the Harrison extension {{had been replaced by}} earthen fills and plate girder bridges by 1906. [...] Original Hinkley locomotives #1-2 were replaced by #5-6 of an improved design with <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels.</b> B&SR then replaced the original 30# steel rails from Bridgton Junction to Bridgton with 48# and 50# steel rails from 1907 to 1910 before Maine Central Railroad secured control of the B&SR in 1912.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the fair}} (also called The Chicago World's Fair), he became acquainted with No. 638, a big new freight engine IC had on display {{as the latest}} and {{greatest}} technological advancement in trains. It had eight drive <b>wheels</b> and two <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels,</b> a 2-8-0 [...] "Consolidation" [...] type. At {{the closing of the}} fair, No. 638 was due to be sent to Water Valley for service in the Jackson District. Jones asked for permission to drive the engine back to Water Valley. His request was approved, and No. 638 ran its first [...] with Jones at the throttle to Water Valley. Jones liked No. 638 and liked working in the Jackson District because his family was there. They had once moved to Water Valley, but returned to Jackson, which they felt was home.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of some large {{aircraft}} the servo tab is the only control that {{is connected to the}} <b>pilot's</b> stick or <b>wheel,</b> as in the Bristol Britannia and its Canadian derivatives. The <b>pilot</b> moves the <b>wheel</b> which moves the servo tab and then the servo tab, using its mechanical advantage, moves the elevator or aileron, which is otherwise free-floating. With a servo-tab variant named [...] "geared spring tab", a pilot is able [...] "to maneuver a vehicle weighing as much as 300,000 pounds flying at an airspeed of 300 miles per hour or more".|$|R

50|$|Mr. Trash Wheel {{was invented}} by John Kellett, who {{developed}} the idea when observing trash in the harbor while passing Pier 6 on his walk to work. A <b>pilot</b> trash <b>wheel</b> was built and launched in the harbor by Kellett in 2008, and after this, Kellett built a larger machine that was launched in May 2014, which was {{able to pick up}} larger matter and held two dumpsters onboard. The use of two dumpsters allows the vessel to operate longer, without having to go back to shore to empty the single dumpster that was used on the initial pilot vessel.|$|R
50|$|With {{less than}} 3000 ft of runway remaining, the <b>pilots</b> used <b>wheel</b> brakes and reverse thrust {{to attempt to}} stop the 707. They braked so hard they {{destroyed}} the main landing gear tires and wheels, but the aircraft ran {{off the end of}} the runway. They plowed into the town of Villeneuve Le Roi. The left undercarriage failed and a fire broke out from fuselage. Three flight attendants initially survived the disaster. Two attendants seated {{in the back of the}} cabin survived, but the third died in the hospital. At the time, it was the world's worst air disaster involving one aircraft.|$|R
50|$|A similar carnival-style wheel {{was used}} in the {{original}} 1973 <b>Wheel</b> <b>pilot</b> (Shopper's Bazaar), although that wheel was operated by a motor. A further (and far more explicit) connection arrived in 1981, when Grundy debuted his adaptation of Griffin's Wheel which (like its American counterpart) also had a very long and successful run on the Seven Network until 2006.|$|R
25|$|California {{inventor}} Jack McCornack {{took the}} Fledge IIB wing and designed a tubular assembly that replaced the Fledge's hang glider seat with a reclined <b>pilot</b> seat, <b>wheeled</b> landing gear and engine mount for a pusher powerplant. The aircraft used a mouth-controlled throttle, as both hands were {{used on the}} tip rudder twist grips which were retained from the Fledge. The aircraft had no canard or tail and was a true flying wing. Power was supplied by a two-stroke Xenoah engine of 16 horsepower driving a 36-inch propeller. This new design, named the Pterodactyl Fledgling, was first flown in 1977. It is also referred to variously as the Pterodactyl Fledge and Pfledge.|$|R
50|$|November 16, 1935: A Central Airlines Stinson Model A (NO-15107), {{forced to}} land after {{taking off from}} Allegheny County Airport when all three engines failed at an {{altitude}} of about 50 feet. The <b>pilot</b> made a <b>wheels</b> up landing straight ahead on an unfinished portion of the runway. There were no injuries but the airplane suffered major damage. The cause was fuel contamination.|$|R
60|$|From {{out of the}} fog {{came the}} mournful tolling of a bell, and I could see the <b>pilot</b> turning the <b>wheel</b> with great rapidity.

60|$|The <b>pilot</b> {{took the}} <b>wheel</b> while Grahame stood beside him. There were broad, light patches {{where the water}} dazzled Grahame's eyes, and then belts of gloom in which the {{mangroves}} faded to a formless blur. Still, they did not touch bottom; miry points round which the tide swirled, rotting logs on mud-banks, and misty trees crept astern, and at last they heard the rumble of the swell on beaten sand.|$|R
50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{supplied by}} Timken or SKF were {{used on the}} four <b>wheel</b> <b>pilot</b> and trailing trucks {{as well as the}} six wheel tender trucks. The first 20 examples, (2100-2119) used friction bearings on the eight driving wheels, while the final 10 (2120-2129), intended for both freight and passenger service, had roller bearings throughout. The driving wheels themselves used the Boxpok design with a diameter of 70 in.|$|R
50|$|The 2-10-0's main {{advantage}} {{was that}} {{five out of}} six of its axles were powered, meaning almost all the weight was available for traction rather than being distributed over <b>pilot</b> and trailing <b>wheels.</b> The long rigid wheelbase caused problems on tightly curved track, so blind drivers were the norm, either on the central axle, and/or on the second and/or fourth axles. Often lateral motion devices were attached to the leading drive axle.|$|R
5000|$|Number 119 is {{the less}} {{powerful}} of the zoo's two locomotives and regularly hauls a train of five open-air coaches. This engine {{is known for}} its colorful paint scheme, polished brass, and sweet-sounding Nathan six chime whistle. No. 119 was the original locomotive on the Omaha Zoo Railroad and was custom built for the zoo in 1968. It was built by Crown Metal Products of Wyano, Pennsylvania, a company that built replica steam trains for amusement parks and zoos all over the country. In honor of zoo railroad benefactor Union Pacific, the engine was decorated to resemble the Union Pacific's ceremonial engine used at the 1869 completion of the first transcontinental railroad. It is a 4-4-0 type locomotive, meaning that it has four <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels</b> to help guide it through curves, 4 large driving wheels, and no trailing wheels. This type of locomotive was prevalent on American railroads from 1850 to about 1880, thus earning it the nickname [...] "American standard". During the 119's first years at the zoo, it was underpowered and had difficulty pulling the train up the steep hills. Subsequent modifications by the Union Pacific and the zoo railroad's own shop have improved it greatly, and after a major rebuild in 1996-1999, it was deemed to be in better-than-new condition. During the rebuild, the engine also received a cosmetic makeover. Originally painted black, white, and red, it emerged resplendent in a beautiful and historically accurate scheme of crimson, maroon, and olive green with a boiler jacket of simulated Russia iron. A new stained wood cab replicating the one on the original UP locomotive was also fitted. This engine returned to service in May 2013 after an overhaul.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{the sophistication}} of the control unit (e.g. tiller <b>pilot,</b> {{steering}} <b>wheel</b> attached Chartplotter, ...), electronic self-steering gear can be programmed to hold a certain compass course, to maintain a certain angle to the wind (so that sailing boats need not change their sail trim), to steer towards a certain position, or any other function which can reasonably be defined. However, the amount of power required by electrical actuators, especially if constantly in action because of sea and weather conditions, is a serious consideration. Long-distance cruisers, which have no external source of electricity and often do not run their engines for propulsion, typically have relatively strict power budgets and do not use electrical steering {{for any length of}} time. As the electronic autopilot systems require electricity to operate, many vessels also make use of PV solar panels or small wind turbines on the boat. This eliminates extra pollution and cuts costs.|$|R
50|$|Terranova {{retired from}} his first two {{attempts}} at the Dakar Rally in 2005 and 2007, both times aboard a KTM, and when the event resumed in 2009 in South America following the cancellation of the 2008 event, he opted to switch to four <b>wheels.</b> <b>Piloting</b> a X-Raid prepared BMW X3 alongside co-driver Alain Guehennec, Terranova once again failed to finish, although he did win that year's Tunisian Rally. He completed the Dakar {{for the first time}} the following year, this time alongside Pascal Maimon, finishing ninth overall in a Mitsubishi Racing Lancer.|$|R
5000|$|During 1834-1840, Robinson {{served as}} chief {{engineer}} {{of the new}} Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and directed construction of the line including a spectacular stone bridge and a tunnel 1,932 feet long, considered his crowning achievements. The 93-mile railroad built from the major anthracite coal fields of Pottsville to Reading {{and then to the}} port at Philadelphia was the first double track mainline in the United States (after the British model), included three of the nine first railroad tunnels in the United States, and was reportedly the first to use crushed stone ballast. (In 1828-9, Robinson had designed his first railroads—the Allegheny Portage and the Danville & Pottsville railroads—as double track lines, but these included inclines that worked better with two tracks; the Reading was the first main line designed at the outset with double tracks in mind, though with only a 22' wide grade that required widening later). Because of the extensive coal fields it tapped, the Reading would {{become one of the most}} profitable railroads in the U. S. It was also considered Moncure Robinson’s first mountain railroad without inclines—a statement about the transition from the Canal Era of feeder coal roads to water transport/canals. The Reading paralleled the Schuylkill River navigation canal, and by the 1840s proved the superiority of the railroad over the turnpikes and canals as the inland transportation system of the nineteenth century.Horses and mules, gravity and stationary steam engines on inclines, were the first motive power on Moncure Robinson’s railroads. Though he held patents on incline systems, from the beginning, he recommended British built locomotives for railroads, especially the recently perfected 0-4-0s with Bury fire box. By the mid-1830s, American mechanics had perfected the 4-2-0, with its lead swivel truck or <b>pilot</b> <b>wheels</b> - designed by John B Jervis for the Mohawk & Hudson - and Robinson recommended these for steeper grade railroads during the late 1830s, in Virginia and Pennsylvania. For the Reading, he ordered British and American made locomotives. For more power, however, he is credited with helping design in 1839 one of the earliest 4-4-0 locomotives, the [...] "Gowan & Marx," [...] named after his London banker. This, the most powerful locomotive up to that time, was built by Eastwick & Harrison of Philadelphia, and proved ideal for the coal fields tapped by the Reading (John White, American Locomotives, correctly credits others for the 4-4-0 design patent; and this is true for the mechanics of the machine, but the concept of replacing the then dominant 4-2-0s with the better tractive 4-4-0s, which would become the major locomotive type for the next thirty years or more, has been shared with Robinson).|$|R
50|$|On 7 December, four shells {{fired from}} Shipping Point passed over her deck between her <b>pilot</b> house and <b>wheels.</b> On the 22d, {{the sound of}} {{artillery}} from Boyd's Hole drew the ship downstream to investigate. She found a Union merchant schooner which had been disabled by the cannonade and, while assisting the damaged ship, came under fire herself. Two shells hit Satellite's wheel house without causing casualties or serious damage, and Satellite replied in kind, silencing her adversaries. Similar action enlivened her service in the following months. Her log records three engagements in January 1862, one in February, and eight in March. On 15 February, after a shell exploded in 's paddle box, disabling her as she passed Shipping Point, Satellite assisted the damaged revenue cutter.|$|R
