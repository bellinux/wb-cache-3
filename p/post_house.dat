The Angel was rebuilt during 1819 and 1820 to become a <b>post</b> <b>house</b> and meeting place for various London businesses. The redevelopment was directed by Charles Smith, and subsequently let to James Smith. The size of the inn was reduced and adjacent plots were sold off, allowing development of houses and shops, though the inn's grounds remained substantial. It was now advertised as the [...] "Angel Inn Tavern and Hotel for Gentlemen and Families", and the front of the tavern faced the New Road.|$|E

500|$|On 9 December, in the night, the Austrians {{attacked}} the French advanced posts at {{the ruins of}} the old <b>post</b> <b>house</b> and church of the old village of Kehl. The fighting was bitter and short, but the Austrians finally took the post, to be driven out the next morning. [...] In this subsequent attack, at which Archduke Charles was present, the Austrians lost about three hundred men and an officer. [...] They attacked again on the 10 and 11 December, but could not take the posts. The Austrians also launched fire ships to destroy the pontoon bridge, but these were repulsed and destroyed. The Austrians took the Ehrlinrhin, a large island on which several of the French reserve units had been positioned. General Lecourbe removed one of the flying bridges to cut off all hope of a (French) retreat, grabbed a standard and rallied a battalion to advance against the Austrians, repulsing them as far as their trenches. Lecourbe's quick thinking preserved half of the island for the French.|$|E

[...] The lines of contravallation, formed of several redoubts, were joined by entrenchments that entirely encircled Kehl and access to the bridges. [...] These began at a dyke near Auenheim, traversed the route to Rastadt and Offenburg, the course of the Kintzig and the Schutter rivers, encircled the village of Sundheim, and finished at the Bonnet de Prétre. [...] The Austrian troops on the island could cover the left flank and the entire besieging army was covered by considerable entrenchments on the Islands in the Kinzig. By the end of the week, the Austrian and Imperial defenses were connected in a grand parallel and a series of batteries in a semicircle around the village. [...] The Austrians took the ruins of the church and the <b>post</b> <b>house</b> by bringing up artillery and bombarding the positions; this allowed them to complete the lines of contravallation.|$|E

But although the country was mountainous, the ascent was not steep, for the road was carried up by means of long windings and zigzags, in such a manner that the rise was very regular and gradual all the way. The consequence was, that the six horses took the diligence on almost as fast up the mountains as the four had done on the level ground.|$|E

60|$|The scenery {{was very}} much varied, too; and the changes were on so grand a scale that they made the views which were {{presented}} on every side appear extremely imposing. Sometimes the road lay across a wide plain, many miles in extent, but extremely fertile and luxuriant, and bounded in the distance by blue and beautiful mountains. After travelling upon one of these plains for many hours, the road would gradually approach the mountains, and then at length would enter among them, and begin to wind, by zigzags, up a broad slope, or into a dark ravine. At such places Vittorio would stop, usually at a <b>post</b> <b>house</b> {{at the foot of}} the ascent, and take an additional horse, or pair of horses, and sometimes a yoke of oxen, to help his team draw the carriage up the hill. Many of these ascents were four or live miles long, and as the road turned upon itself in continual zigzags, there was presented to Mr. George and Rollo, and also to Mrs. Gray's party within the carriage, as they ascended, a perpetual succession of widely-extended views over the vast plain below, with the road which they had traversed stretching across it in a straight line for ten or fifteen miles, like a white ribbon.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Despite {{the role}} of <b>post</b> {{conflict}} <b>housing</b> reconstruction in establishing the development of peace in conflict affected countries, there are many issues which hinder its success. While the inconsideration of <b>housing</b> needs in <b>post</b> conflict <b>housing</b> reconstruction has directly or indirectly given rise {{for most of the}} issues, the countries emerging from conflicts face many challenges in addressing such housing needs. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to explore the management of <b>housing</b> needs in <b>post</b> conflict <b>housing</b> reconstruction. This paper aims to focus on identifying the challenges in addressing housing needs within the context of <b>post</b> conflict <b>housing</b> reconstruction in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach – The study used the grounded theory approach to collect and analyse the data collected through 37 in-depth interviews, conducted with policy makers, practitioners, academics and housing beneficiaries in Sri Lanka. Primary data were verified through a documents review. Findings – The paper reveals that addressing <b>housing</b> needs in <b>post</b> conflict <b>housing</b> reconstruction in Sri Lanka is challenging, due to several factors. These include the socio economic profile of conflict affected people, conflict sensitive issues, donor requirements, limited availability of finance, weakened government administration, extent of housing and infrastructure damage, attitudes of affected people, land-related issues and shortage of labour and material. Originality/value – A number of studies have identified the challenges of post conflict reconstruction. This study particularly identifies the challenges of addressing <b>housing</b> needs in <b>post</b> conflict <b>housing</b> reconstruction. These findings are useful for policy makers to develop strategies in addressing <b>housing</b> needs in <b>post</b> conflict <b>housing</b> reconstruction...|$|R
