500|$|Tuberculosis is {{classified}} {{as one of the}} granulomatous inflammatory diseases. Macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts [...] aggregate to form granulomas, with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may <b>prevent</b> <b>dissemination</b> of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system. [...] However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host's immune system. [...] Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the immune response is suppressed. Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death (necrosis) in the center of tubercles. [...] To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, white cheese and is termed caseous necrosis.|$|E

40|$|Prompt {{detection}} of metallo-&# 946;-lactamase (MBL) producing isolates {{is necessary to}} <b>prevent</b> their <b>dissemination.</b> Frequency of MBLs producing strains among multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was evaluated in critical care patients using imipenem-EDTA disk method.

MBL was produced by 96. 6 &#x 0025; of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter isolates, whereas 100 &#x 0025; imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeroginosa isolates were MBL producers.

5000|$|Although {{physicians}} {{had already}} interpreted pus within a bodily compartment as a systemic threat, pus from infected tooth roots often drained {{into the mouth}} and thereby was viewed as systemically inconsequential. [...] Amid focal infection theory, {{it was concluded that}} that was often the case—while immune response <b>prevented</b> <b>dissemination</b> from the focus—but that immunity could fail to contain the infection, that dissemination from the focus could ensue, and that systemic disease, often neurological, could result. [...] By 1930, excision of focal infections was considered a [...] "rational form of therapy" [...] undoubtedly resolving many cases of chronic diseases. [...] Its inconsistent effectiveness was attributed to unrecognized foci—perhaps inside internal organs—that the clinicians had missed.|$|R
50|$|During the November 2012 {{municipal}} elections, {{a popular}} Web site that allowed voters to register complaints or allegations of election fraud was apparently hacked {{on several occasions}} and forced to shut for significant portions of the day.

During 2012 there were several reported cases of threats and violence against the press. On December 11, the spokesman of the Supreme Court of Justice publicly accused the online newsweekly Confidential of being financed by narcotics trafficking organizations, an allegation rights groups said was politically motivated.|$|E
5000|$|One {{day after}} Google took action, Facebook decided to block fake sites from {{advertising}} there. Facebook {{said they would}} ban ads from sites with deceptive content, including fake news, and review publishers for compliance. These steps by both Google and Facebook intended to deny ad revenue to fraudulent news sites; neither company took actions to <b>prevent</b> <b>dissemination</b> of false stories in search engine results pages or web feeds. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the notion that fraudulent news impacted the 2016 election a [...] "crazy idea" [...] and denied that his platform influenced the election. He stated that 99% of Facebook's content was neither fake news nor a hoax. Zuckerberg said that Facebook is not a media company. Zuckerberg advised users to check the fact-checking website Snopes.com whenever they encounter fake news on Facebook.|$|E

50|$|Recovery from an {{anaerobic}} infection {{depends on}} adequate and rapid management.

40|$|Local immune {{responses}} {{serve to}} contain infections by pathogens to the gut while <b>preventing</b> pathogen <b>dissemination</b> to systemic sites. Several subsets of T {{cells in the}} gut (T-helper 17 cells, γδ T cells, natural killer (NK), and NK-T cells) contribute to the mucosal response to pathogens by secreting a subset of cytokines including interleukin (IL) - 17 A, IL- 17 F, IL- 22, and IL- 26. These cytokines induce the secretion of chemokines and antimicrobial proteins, thereby orchestrating the mucosal barrier against gastrointestinal pathogens. While the mucosal barrier <b>prevents</b> bacterial <b>dissemination</b> from the gut, it also promotes colonization by pathogens that are resistant {{to some of the}} inducible antimicrobial responses. In this review, we describe the contribution of Th 17 cytokines to the gut mucosal barrier during bacterial infections...|$|R
50|$|Finger millet is {{generally}} seen as not very prone to diseases and pests. Nonetheless, finger millet blast, {{caused by the}} fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea (anamorph Pyricularia grisea), can locally cause severe damages, especially when untreated. In Uganda, yield losses up to 80% were reported in bad years. The pathogen leads to drying out of leaves, neck rots and ear rots. These symptoms can drastically impair photosynthesis, translocation of photosynthetic assimilates and grain filling and therefore reduce yield and grain quality. Finger millet blast can also infest finger millet weeds such as the closely related Eleusine indica, Eleusine africana or Digitaria spp., Setaria spp. and Doctylocterium spp. Finger millet blast can be controlled with cultural measures, chemical treatments {{and the use of}} resistant varieties. Cultural measures to control finger millet blast suggested by ICRISAT for Eastern Africa include crop rotations with non-host crops like legumes, deep ploughing under of finger millet straw on infected fields, washing of field tools after use to <b>prevent</b> <b>dissemination</b> of the pathogen to non-infected fields, weed control to reduce infections by weed hosts and avoiding of too high plant densities to impede the pathogen dispersal from plant to plant. Chemical measures can be direct spraying of systemic fungicides, such as the active ingredients pyroquilon or tricyclazone or seed dressings with fungicides like trycyclozole.|$|E

40|$|Wild {{plants and}} their {{associated}} pathogens {{are involved in}} ongoing interactions over millennia that have been modified by coevolutionary processes to limit the spatial extent and temporal duration of disease epidemics. These interactions are disrupted by modern agricultural practices and social activities, such as intensified monoculture using superior varieties and international trading of agricultural commodities. These activities, when supplementedwith high resource inputs and the broad application of agrochemicals, create conditions uniquely conducive to widespread plant disease epidemics and rapid pathogen evolution. To be effective and durable, sustainable dis-ease management requires a significant shift in emphasis to overtly include ecoevolutionary principles {{in the design of}} adaptive management programs aimed at minimizing the evolutionary potential of plant pathogens by reducing their genetic variation, stabilizing their evolutionary dynamics, and <b>preventing</b> <b>dissemination</b> of pathogen variants carrying new infectivity or resistance to agrochemicals...|$|R
