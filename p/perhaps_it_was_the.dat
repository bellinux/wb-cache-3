Their anatomy was half-human, half-animal, and they were confined in a low-ceilinged, windowless and oddly proportioned space.

[...] While I normally have no problems about Family Guys shocking or offensive themes, I felt bit disconcerted about the direction of this Christmas episode." [...] She went on to say, [...] "Perhaps it was the way that the series stomped on something as innocent as Santa and his elves and twisted them all around. Or <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cannibalistic reindeer. [...] Whatever the specific reason, the irreverent nature of Family Guy seemed just a little too graphic for me this time around." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number twelve on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "Christmas comedy gold", praising the 'Christmastime is Killing Us' song and Boreanaz's cameo.|$|E

[...] Anthony Peronto of Christian Music Zine rated it at three-point-seventy-five out of five, summarizing that while metal pioneer comebacks are not entirely new, this one did not entirely click with him.

[...] However, Élie Faure said that he was reminded of the painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and praised [...] "these landscapes of water, trees, little houses on peaceful banks and boats slowly threading their way ahead of a silver wake: the same impeccable composition, the same power invisibly present because so much a master of itself, the same balance of all the elements of a visual drama in the tender embrace of complete acceptance, the same pearly, golden veil translucently masking the sharpness of composition and the firmness of line.

2500|$|It {{seems clear}} that only shortly after Abu-Salih, {{something}} disastrous must have happened in Alodia: At Soba, basically no pottery or glassware, neither native nor imported, dating beyond the 13th century could be identified. Two churches were apparently destroyed during the 13th century, albeit later resurrected. It had been suggested that Alodia was under attack of a people called Damadim, an African people that originated from the region that was once said to be occupied by the Bukna (A people {{that used to be}} allied with Alodia), so in the border region of modern Sudan and South Sudan. Soba might have been conquered at this time, suffering occupation and destruction. According to al-Maghrebi, the attack of the Damadim on Nubia (and Abyssinia) occurred in 1220, which is why they are also called the [...] "Tartars of the Black", referring to the Mongols who swept over Persia at the same time. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> destruction of Soba by the Damadim that forced the Alodian kings to relocate their capital, as in the later 13th century it is recorded by Al-Harrani that the capital was not Soba, but a [...] "very large town" [...] called Waylula. Shortly after al-Harrani, the geographer al-Dimashqi claims that the capital of Alodia was named Kusa, which Crawford identifies with a place in central Kordofan. In the late 13th century occurred an other invasion by some unspecified people from the south.|$|E
2500|$|During his Anfield career Hodgson missed {{very few}} games in league or cup and scored prolifically throughout; therefore, {{it was a}} shame that his career coincided with a barren period for the club because his {{contribution}} to the Liverpool cause was massive. [...] The 36 league goals Hodgson scored during the 1930–31 season beat Sam Raybould’s total of 31 scored in 1902–03 and set a new club record that would last for more than thirty years, until it was beaten by Roger Hunt in 1961–62. [...] Hodgson scored three hat-tricks that season at Anfield but <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> four goals he scored in an away match at Hillsborough that gave him the most satisfaction of all. [...] He was top scorer in seven out of the nine full seasons he played for Liverpool. [...] On completion of his ten years service he was honoured by the club with a benefit sum of £650. His popularity prompted an ingenious biscuit seller to name the home-made ginger nuts, that he sold in a quantity of five for a penny on matchdays at Anfield, in his honour: [...] "Hodgson’s Choice! Hodgson’s Choice!" [...] he would call. [...] The 1935–36 season proved to be Hodgson's last at Anfield; his 9 goals in 17 league appearances was yet again a decent return, but on 8 January 1936 he was allowed to move to Aston Villa [...] for £4,000. [...] In total Hodgson scored 241 goals in 377 appearances for Liverpool in all competitions, earning him a place in the Liverpool FC Hall of Fame and leaving him third in the all-time list of leading goalscorers for the Anfield club with only Ian Rush (346) and Roger Hunt (285) having scored more.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{long after}} the {{conclusion}} of The Reader, a former editor, Norman Lockyer, decided {{to create a new}} scientific journal titled Nature, taking its name from a line by William Wordsworth: [...] "To the solid ground of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye". First owned and published by Alexander Macmillan, Nature was similar to its predecessors in its attempt to [...] "provide cultivated readers with an accessible forum for reading about advances in scientific knowledge." [...] Janet Browne has proposed that [...] "far more than any other science journal of the period, Nature was conceived, born, and raised to serve polemic purpose." [...] Many of the early editions of Nature consisted of articles written by members of a group that called itself the X Club, a group of scientists known for having liberal, progressive, and somewhat controversial scientific beliefs relative to the time period. Initiated by Thomas Henry Huxley, the group consisted of such important scientists as Joseph Dalton Hooker, Herbert Spencer, and John Tyndall, along with another five scientists and mathematicians; these scientists were all avid supporters of Darwin's theory of evolution as common descent, a theory which, during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, received a great deal of criticism among more conservative groups of scientists. Perhaps it was in part its scientific liberality that made Nature a longer-lasting success than its predecessors. John Maddox, editor of Nature from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995, suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal's centennial edition that <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> journalistic qualities of Nature that drew readers in; [...] "journalism" [...] Maddox states, [...] "is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other. This is what Lockyer's journal did from the start." [...] In addition, Maddox mentions that the financial backing of the journal in its first years by the Macmillan family also allowed the journal to flourish and develop more freely than scientific journals before it.|$|E
