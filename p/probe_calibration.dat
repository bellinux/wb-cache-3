40|$|Graduation date: 2009 In Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) or high {{frequency}} digital ICs, {{there is a}} demand to probe the internal nodes for testing. The ultra low capacitance RFIC probe presented in his work is a flexible tool for these applications. The probe utilizes the coupling between a tungsten needle and the inner conductor of a coaxial cable, forming a capacitor. The ultra low capacitance of the probe enables low probe loading on the circuit under test. With capacitive coupling, the probe output is the derivative of the input signal. Through the use of <b>probe</b> <b>calibration</b> and Fourier transforms, the probed signal can be recovered. <b>Probe</b> <b>calibration</b> develops a transfer function enabling recovery of time domain signals.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} has been considered for the formal process of calibrating multiple hole pressure probes for use in wind tunnels. Rather than determining the attitude angles of a probe and subsequently flow angularity for a fixed probe, either by linear interpolation between sample points or {{through the use of}} piecewise functional fits, the outputs from the probe are mapped as continuous functions across the angular test space, using a set of sample points derived from Optimal Design of Experiments. This offers the potential of more accurate <b>probe</b> <b>calibrations</b> across a wider range of flow onset angles, with fewer sample points than currently used for the same purpose. Proof-of-concept tests using a five-hole probe have indicated that the approach is viable, while examination of fits to legacy data from prior tests indicates that the approach is easily extendable to probes with an arbitrary number of holes, and to multiple hot-wire installations...|$|R

40|$|In a {{freehand}} 3 D ultrasound system, a <b>probe</b> <b>calibration</b> {{is required}} to find the rigid body transformation {{from the corner of}} the B-scan to the electrical centre of the position sensor. The most intuitive way to perform such a calibration is by locating fiducial points in the scan plane directly with a stylus. The main problem of using this approach is the difficulty in aligning the tip of the stylus with the scan plane. The thick beam width makes the tip of the stylus visible in the B-scan even if the tip is not exactly in the elevational centre of the scan plane. In this paper, we present two novel phantoms that simplify the alignment process for more accurate <b>probe</b> <b>calibration.</b> We also compare our calibration techniques with a range of styli and show that our phantom outperforms other approaches in both accuracy and simplicity. ...|$|E
40|$|The three hole, {{wedge-type}} {{pneumatic pressure}} probe represents a robust traverse probe design which {{is widely used}} for total and static pressure and yaw angle measurements in turbomachinery. However, unsteady flows are incorrectly averaged due to pneumatic meaning errors in the pressure pipes. Wedge probes also fail to measure the correct static pressure when operating {{in close proximity to}} a wall through which the probe is inserted. Thirdly, the aerodynamic calibration obtained for a wedge-type probe in a closed wind tunnel differs appreciably from that obtained in an open jet. If not corrected, these errors will corrupt any calculation of turbomachinery blade row performance. In this investigation, the second and third effects described above have been addressed. A factorial experiment was completed in which the influence of seven variables on the wall proximity effect was quantified. Flow visualisation studies were performed to understand the responsible flow mechanisms. Two regions of re-circulating flow were identified in the probe wake, the structure of which depended on the probe immersion. Similar re-circulatory flows were resolved from three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations of the flow over a wedge probe. A link between the probe wake re-circulations and flow over the wedge faces was established. Based on this understanding of the flow structures, a model was developed from which the wall proximity effect could be predicted for a given set of conditions. Wedge <b>probe</b> <b>calibrations</b> were completed in a closed wind tunnel and in two open jets. Discrepancies in the static pressure coefficient and yaw angle sensitivity results were found. These were partially explained in terms of modifications to the probe wake structure which occurred when the probes were calibrated in the open jet facilities. Procedures for correcting the wall proximity effect and for avoiding the facility dependence of wedge <b>probe</b> <b>calibrations</b> were developed from this understanding of the flow mechanisms involved. Based on the findings of this investigation, a novel wedge probe was designed to minimise the wall proximity effect. This probe demonstrated a reduction in the wall proximity effect, from 20 % dynamic head with current designs, to 3 % dynamic head at flows typical of high speed turbomachinery...|$|R

Robust data-processing techniques have also been devel-oped for extracting the unknown permittivity of the tissue under test from the reflection coefficient measured with the precision probe and a vector network analyzer. The first technique, {{referred to as a}} reflection-coefficient deembedding method, converts the reflection coefficient measured at the <b>probeâ€™s</b> <b>calibration</b> plane to the desired aperture-plane reflection coefficient.

40|$|The use of hot surface {{films for}} {{measuring}} skin friction is examined. It is shown that all existing theories, which neglect heat conduction within the substrate, are inadequate {{in predicting the}} variation of heat loss from the film with skin friction. A more physically realistic theory is presented which accounts for the conductive and convective heat transfer into the flow and also heat conduction within the substrate. This leads to a more general relationship between skin friction and heat loss from the film. Experiments conducted in flat plate laminar and turbulent boundary layer flow show that this relationship is more accurate than previous forms. The time and temperature dependence of the heat loss from the hot film are also explored theoretically and experi- mentally. The effect of surface misalignment {{of the film is}} shown to alter significantly the convective heat transfer. This effect is more pronounced in laminar flow than in turbulent flow.
