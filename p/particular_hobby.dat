60|$|As {{the voyage}} went on Mr. Atherton's liking for Mrs. Renshaw, {{her son and}} daughter, {{increased}} greatly, while his contempt for Mr. Renshaw became modified as he came to know him better. He {{found that he was}} really a capable man in his own <b>particular</b> <b>hobby,</b> and that although weak and indecisive he was very kind and affectionate with his wife and children, and reposed an almost childlike confidence in his wife's good sense.|$|E
60|$|Bowen and I roomed {{together}} at college, and I {{learned a lot}} from him outside my regular course. He was a pretty good scholar despite his love of fun, and his <b>particular</b> <b>hobby</b> was paleontology. He used to tell me about the various forms of animal and vegetable life which had covered the globe during former eras, and so I was pretty well acquainted with the fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals of paleolithic times. I knew that the thing that had attacked me was some sort of pterodactyl which should have been extinct millions of years ago. It was all that I needed to realize that Bowen had exaggerated nothing in his manuscript.|$|E
60|$|A melancholy {{group they}} were, sallow-faced, long-visaged and dolorous, partly {{from the effects}} of a long course of study and partly from their present trepidation. It was painful to observe their {{attempts}} to appear confident and unconcerned as they glanced round the heavens, as if to observe the state of the weather, or examined with well-feigned archaeological fervour the inscriptions upon the old University walls. Most painful of all was it, when some one, plucking up courage, would venture upon a tiny joke, at which the whole company would gibber in an ostentatious way, as though to show that even in this dire pass the appreciation of humour still remained with them. At times, when any of their number alluded to the examination or detailed the questions which had been propounded to Brown or Baker the day before, the mask of unconcern would be dropped, and the whole assembly would glare eagerly and silently at the speaker. Generally on such occasions matters are made infinitely worse by some Job's comforter, who creeps about suggesting abstruse questions, and hinting that they represent some examiner's <b>particular</b> <b>hobby.</b> Such a one came to Dimsdale's elbow, and quenched the last ray of hope which lingered in the young man's bosom.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} other student groups exist out of formal venues. The most {{recognizable}} are the “Studentenverbindungen,” traditional student associations dating from the 19th century that organize social events, share common uniforms, and often focus on <b>particular</b> <b>hobbies,</b> such as swordfighting. Such associations include the Akademische Turnerschaft Alemannia zu Basel, AKW Raurica, Helvetia Basel, Jurassia Basiliensis, Schwizerhüsli, A.V. Froburger, and Zofingia. Membership in many is restricted to men, though A.V. Froburger also accepts women.|$|R
50|$|Hanza Media's {{consumer}} {{magazines are}} aimed at the public and range from general-interest titles such as Cosmopolitan and Playboy, which appeal to {{a broad spectrum of}} readers, to highly specialist titles covering <b>particular</b> <b>hobbies,</b> leisure pursuits or other interest. EPH's book publishing division sold more than 20 million books in the last few years. Hanza Media also has strong national and international operations and is involved in printed media distribution, media production and tourism.|$|R
60|$|I nodded, {{and stood}} by the door. My first feeling of fear had passed away, and I thrilled now with a keener zest than I had ever enjoyed when we were the {{defenders}} of the law instead of its defiers. The high object of our mission, the consciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous, the villainous character of our opponent, all added to the sporting interest of the adventure. Far from feeling guilty, I rejoiced and exulted in our dangers. With a glow of admiration I watched Holmes unrolling his case of instruments and choosing his tool with the calm, scientific accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation. I knew that the opening of safes was a <b>particular</b> <b>hobby</b> with him, and I understood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green and gold monster, the dragon which held in its maw the reputations of many fair ladies. Turning up the cuffs of his dress-coat--he had placed his overcoat on a chair--Holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and several skeleton keys. I stood at the centre door with my eyes glancing {{at each of the}} others, ready for any emergency, though, indeed, my plans were somewhat vague as to what I should do if we were interrupted. For half an hour, Holmes worked with concentrated energy, laying down one tool, picking up another, handling each with the strength and delicacy of the trained mechanic. Finally I heard a click, the broad green door swung open, and inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper packets, each tied, sealed, and inscribed. Holmes picked one out, but it was as hard to read by the flickering fire, and he drew out his little dark lantern, for it was too dangerous, with Milverton in the next room, to switch on the electric light. Suddenly I saw him halt, listen intently, and then in an instant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked up his coat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and darted behind the window curtain, motioning me to do the same.|$|E
50|$|A hobby is {{a regular}} {{activity}} that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a <b>particular</b> <b>hobby,</b> one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since {{the late nineteenth century}} as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities. As some hobbies have become less popular, like stamp collecting, others have been created following technological advances, like video games.|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} role of {{entrepreneurial}} passion and creativity as antecedents of entrepreneurial intentions, applying social cognitive theory as an underpinning framework. Specifically, this research focuses on American homebrewing, seen as a potential incubator for entrepreneurs. Results demonstrate entrepreneurial passion having a strong positive relationship with entrepreneurial intentions, even when entrepreneurial self-efficacy is introduced as a mediator. Conversely, the relationship between creativity and entrepreneurial intentions is mediated by entrepreneurial self-efficacy, confirming that individuals also need to feel self-efficacious enough to pursue entrepreneurial career. The findings advance the understanding of nascent entrepreneurship phenomenon within a <b>particular</b> <b>hobby</b> context...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{his life}} he pursued two <b>particular</b> <b>hobbies</b> with excitement: music and mountain-climbing. An {{accomplished}} player of the violin and the viola, Whitney played with the Princeton Musical Amateurs. He would run outside, 6 to 12 miles every other day. As an undergraduate, with his cousin Bradley Gilman, Whitney made the first ascent of the Whitney-Gilman ridge on Cannon Mountain, New Hampshire in 1929. It was the hardest and most famous rock climb in the East. He {{was a member of}} the Swiss Alpine Society and the Yale Mountaineering Society (the precursor to the Yale Outdoors Club) and climbed most of the mountain peaks in Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} into a very poor family. He was raised only by his mother to whom he was very {{attached}} and has two sisters. In 1997 his mother died in a tragic house fire. He has no <b>particular</b> other <b>hobbies</b> in his life except ski jumping which is his whole life. On 30 January 2016 his wife gave birth to their daughter named Rino.|$|R
50|$|As a {{comprehensive}} community college, EICC’s programs stretch beyond traditional college classes. The college delivers {{a wide range}} of worker training and re-training programs. These classes are delivered on both a credit and non-credit basis. In addition, area residents have the opportunity to take advantage of Continuing Education classes that allow them to pursue a <b>particular</b> interest or <b>hobby.</b> More than 40,000 students will complete Business and Industry Center and Continuing Education classes each year.|$|R
30|$|A hobby is {{a regular}} {{activity}} that is done for enjoyment, typically during one’s leisure time. By continually participating in a <b>particular</b> <b>hobby,</b> one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. A previous study in Japan found the association between smoking behaviors and hobbies (Hu et al. 2007), and another case–control study in Spain found that leisure time activities {{were associated with the}} risk of having lung cancer (Ruano-Ravina et al. 2014). In addition, a qualitative analysis found that hobbies were associated with tobacco using and its treatment among young people (Prochaska et al. 2013). Hobbies among students mainly included reading, painting, music; sports, tourism and online games, and different kinds of hobbies might bring different health effects. Computer games have a relationship with teenagers physical health, such as overweight and obesity (Martinovic et al. 2015; Ustinavičienė et al. 2016), but the association with tobacco use still lacks of investigation.|$|E
40|$|Voluntary and {{community}} organisations (VCOs) have health benefits {{for those who}} attend and are viewed as having the potential to support long-term condition management. However, existing community-level understandings of participation do not explain the involvement with VCOs at an individual level, or the nature of support, which may elicit health benefits. Framing active participation as ‘doing and experiencing’, {{the aim of this}} qualitative study was to explore why people with long-term vascular conditions join VCOs, maintain their membership and what prevents participation. Twenty participants, self-diagnosed as having diabetes, chronic heart disease or chronic kidney disease, were purposefully sampled and recruited from a range of VCOs in the North West of England identified from a mapping of local organisations. In semi-structured interviews, we explored the nature of their participation. Analysis was thematic and iterative involving a continual reflection on the data. People gave various reasons for joining groups. These included health and well-being, the need for social contact and pursuing a <b>particular</b> <b>hobby.</b> Barriers to participation included temporal and spatial barriers and those associated with group dynamics. Members maintained their membership on the basis of an identity and sense of belonging to the group, developing close relationships within it and the availability of support and trust. Participants joined community groups often in response to a health-related event. Our findings demonstrate {{the ways in which the}} social contact associated with continued participation in VCOs is seen as helping with long-term condition management. Interventions designed at improving chronic illness management might usefully consider the role of VCOs...|$|E
40|$|The {{appearance}} of new conceptual approaches and trends in modern historiography, changing the contents {{and the source}} base {{on the history of}} the Great Patriotic War created new opportunities for the study of the history of everyday life, the “human dimension” of the war. As part of the article the war daily life is considered through the prism of one of the stories of the children’s and teenagers’ life in militarized space – the reality of consolidated pastime. Daily practice of this social category is the least studied in the historical literature. Leisure activities occupied a significant place in the structure of everyday life of children and teenagers during the war. Its organization both for military and peacetime was formally regulated along with informal and personal time. Changes in the structure and filling the free time of students in a militarized space appeared in the content and the intensity of certain forms of leisure time, destructive tendencies, limited material and time resources. The greatest amount of free time of the younger generation was in the informal, unregulated practice of leisure, the solution of domestic problems and housework. Due to objective circumstances of the wartime the role of the family, educational, cultural and entertainment establishments in the life of children and adolescents significantly fell. Thus, during the war a street became the center of their “leisure routine,” including asocial orientation. Free time proceeded among coevals; there was a formation of personality and values. Partly the formal structures responsible for leisure activities of students, in <b>particular,</b> <b>hobby</b> clubs, is a tool for their inclusion in the process of providing possible assistance for front and rear and give them the skills necessary in combat. At the same time unauthorized, individual leisure had a relaxing effect contributed to the displacement of negative emotions, lifting the state of anxiety and fear caused by military reality...|$|E
50|$|He {{was married}} to the former Diana Poteat Stallings until her death on July 4, 2014, and {{is the father of}} Laura Poteat Hobby Beckworth, Paul William Hobby, Andrew Purefoy Hobby, and Katherine Pettus Hobby Gibson. Diana Hobby was {{associate}} editor of Studies in English Literature as well as was book editor of The Houston Post. As a couple, they were strong supporters of the arts and literature, libraries in <b>particular.</b> Democrat Paul <b>Hobby</b> attempted to extend the family's public service into a fourth generation; however, he narrowly lost the race for Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts in 1998 to the Republican nominee, Carole Keeton Strayhorn.|$|R
500|$|In Britain and Australia, local {{community}} leaders {{were expected to}} organise local committees to create war memorials. Britain had a strong tradition of local government, and mayors, council chairmen or similar leaders would usually step forward to establish a memorial committee. These committees might then bring in a wider cross-section of {{local community}} leaders, including Christian clergy, Jewish leaders, voluntary organisations, rifle clubs and volunteer police, although sometimes committees were more tightly controlled by local government officials. Former servicemen occasionally felt that their opinions {{were excluded from the}} formal processes, while in other cases complaints were made that the wealthier members of the community were given a disproportionate role in decision-making. In both Britain and Australia, local memorials were also supplemented by other memorials that reflected wider groups in society, such as military units or <b>particular</b> sports, <b>hobbies</b> or even animals. North America largely followed a similar process. In Canada, the early memorials to the war were typically organised by groups of former soldiers, the Canadian Legion or local authorities. There was considerable discussion in the US during 1919 about the need to construct a suitably grand, national monument to commemorate the war dead, but the discussions failed to produce a consensus and no project was undertaken; monuments such as the Liberty Memorial in Kansas were built by local citizens.|$|R
40|$|Anderson {{created a}} series of four 5 -minute films {{exploring}} abstract journeys {{as part of a}} more substantial branded window display. The installed films varied in content and function. The first film was of a man using an industrial guillotine to cut up piles of training shoes. Anderson reinvents the brand as a postmodernist homage to the product’s history. This theme carries through to other product developments including the design of plastic and sticker coded bags to house the sliced shoes which were then displayed on a large-scale as part of the Puma Covent Garden store launch. This approach led to a second film which instructed the onlooker how, by putting together the codes to form words such as ter-rain, spr-int gra-vel can-ter combined with numbers 1 - 14 (1 being the toe of the shoe 14 the heel), one could build and invent new shoes and new styles. Both informational and instructional structure breaks with conventional film narratives. The other two films are based around the theme of an abstract journey - one in particular was projected onto the floor creating an optical illusion of a moving terrain changing floor with a 500 -metre drop in the middle. The films formed part of the window installation made out of a wall of trainers - selected colour placements were designed to make an anti-nationalist statement. This referenced positively the way in which people form non-geographical nations, grouped around <b>particular</b> interests, <b>hobbies</b> or fashions. The result was a large flag that filled the entire window space, creating a ‘Puma sports nation’. The shoes were later cut up and recycled into new artwork for the Puma concept store launch...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} a {{beekeeping}} hobby group as a leisure-time activity which not only develops and deepens interest in a specific area, but also focuses {{on the development of}} social and personal skills and competencies which are needed not only for future work in beekeeping, but also for solving difficult situations in the working life and in the personal life of children and the youth. The theoretical part describes key terms needed for understanding the following part of the thesis. It also characterizes beekeeping hobby groups in general. The source of information in this part are two questionnaires. The first one was sent out by the leader of a beekeeping hobby group, Mr Oldřich Suchohradský, in 2011, the second one was sent out by the present author a year later. The last chapter of the theoretical part, which is also the last chapter of this bachelor thesis, describes the structure of a number of selected meetings of a <b>particular</b> beekeeping <b>hobby</b> group ? they are described in greater detail in the appendices. In the practical part (in the individual appendices), the present author attempts to present a methodical instrument for leaders of beekeeping hobby groups. Its main concern are the basic skills and competencies belonging to personal and social education. This methodological section has two parts. The first part briefly describes the skills and competencies which were the focus of the selected meetings. The latter part deals with the place of the particular skills and competencies in the programme of a hobby group. It presents model meetings of a beekeeping hobby group which are structured so as to facilitate both the the transfer of beekeeping skills and competencies and the development of personal and social competencies. The main goal of using these model meetings is to enable a beekeeping hobby group to facilitate, supplement and deepen the development of the individual components of a child?s personality...|$|R
500|$|In modern Japanese slang, {{the term}} otaku is mostly {{equivalent}} to [...] "geek" [...] or [...] "nerd", {{but in a}} more derogatory manner than used in the West. However, it can relate to any fan of any <b>particular</b> theme, topic, <b>hobby</b> or form of entertainment. [...] "When these people {{are referred to as}} otaku, they are judged for their behaviors - and people suddenly see an “otaku” as a person unable to relate to reality". [...] The word entered English as a loanword from the Japanese language. It is typically used to refer to a fan of anime/manga but can also refer to Japanese video games or Japanese culture in general. The American magazine Otaku USA popularizes and covers these aspects. The usage of the word is a source of contention among some fans, owing to its negative connotations and stereotyping of the fandom. Widespread English exposure to the term came in 1988 with the release of Gunbuster, which referred to anime fans as otaku. Gunbuster was released officially in English in March 1990. The term's usage spread throughout rec.arts.anime with discussions about Otaku no Video's portrayal of otaku before its 1994 English release. Positive and negative aspects, including the pejorative usage, were intermixed. The term was also popularized by William Gibson's 1996 novel Idoru, which references otaku.|$|R
