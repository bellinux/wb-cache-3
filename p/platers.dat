25|$|A {{disagreement}} in 1999 led the <b>Platers</b> {{to cancel}} the arrangement and affiliate instead with the OPJHL's ill-fated Durham Huskies. Although that ended after one season and the <b>Platers</b> again latched on to the Greys, there was enough animosity between the Greys and Huskies to fuel two heated exhibition games one week apart prior to the 2000-01 season. Owen Sound won 5-1 {{in the first game}} and 5-0 in the second game, which was marred by a line brawl toward the end.|$|E
25|$|Since the Ontario Hockey League {{moved into}} Owen Sound in 1989, the Greys have enjoyed an almost {{continuous}} {{affiliation with the}} big club (originally the Owen Sound <b>Platers,</b> {{now known as the}} Owen Sound Attack).|$|E

25|$|The club {{spent the}} next two years in the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League, but they were disappointing seasons. Owen Sound {{finished}} fifth and out of the playoffs in 1975-76, then placed fourth and last in 1976-77. All four teams advanced to the post-season that year but the Greys didn't last long, brushed aside in four straight games by the Guelph <b>Platers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Detroit {{lost its}} first seven games before posting its first victory, 7-3 over the Owen Sound <b>Platers</b> at Cobo Arena October 4, 1990. After a 3-game win streak, the Ambassadors would drop 11 {{straight}} games. Despite the losing, {{there were some}} bright lights. First overall draft pick Pat Peake with 39 goals & 51 assists was the team's offensive leader, figuring in over 40 percent of the team's goals.|$|E
25|$|After the Super Series ended, {{the regular}} playoffs started. Sault Ste. Marie earned {{the first round}} bye, then {{defeated}} the Owen Sound <b>Platers</b> and the Junior Red Wings to reach the finals against the Petes. This time, the Petes prevailed 4 games to 1, spoiling the Greyhounds chances of a third consecutive J. Ross Robertson Cup. Joing the Greyhounds and Petes in the Memorial Cup would be the WHL champion Swift Current Broncos and the QMJHL champion Laval Titan.|$|E

They also won the Frank L. Buckland Trophy as playoff champions in 1986-87, their first title since 1974-75, and advanced to the all-Ontario championship against the Nickel Centre Power Trains of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{built upon}} {{their first year}} success in the {{following}} season. In his second year behind the Colts bench, Bert Templeton led the Barrie franchise to a 33–23–10 record {{for a total of}} 76 points; two points back of the Kitchener Rangers for first place in the central division. Jan Bulis, newly appointed captain Daniel Tkaczuk, and Alexandre Volchkov once again led the team in scoring with 103, 93, and 82 points respectively. Aside from these three players, the Colts struggled with secondary scoring. Tough-guy Luch Nasato finished the year fourth in team scoring with 45 points and a team-leading 219 penalty minutes. Once again the Colts made it to the OHL playoffs. This time they were able to beat the Owen Sound <b>Platers</b> four games to nothing before losing the next round to the Ottawa 67's four games to one.|$|E
500|$|Returned by the Flames to Ottawa for {{his third}} junior season in 1984–85, Roberts served as the team's captain. He {{recorded}} 106 points, including 44 goals, and {{was named to the}} OHL's second All-Star Team. Entering a rebuilding phase, the 67's were quickly eliminated from the playoffs, after which the Flames assigned Roberts to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Moncton Golden Flames. [...] In his first professional stint, Roberts scored four goals and added two assists in seven games. Roberts returned to Ottawa for a final junior season in 1985–86, a season in which he played with the Canadian junior team at the 1986 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. [...] Roberts finished second on the team with six goals for the silver medal-winning Canadians. In the OHL, he split the season between the last place 67's and, following a trade, the Guelph <b>Platers.</b> Roberts finished with 84 points combined between the two teams, and helped the <b>Platers</b> record a [...] record in the playoffs and lead Guelph past the Belleville Bulls to win the OHL championship. He scored four goals in four games at the 1986 Memorial Cup, and the <b>Platers</b> defeated the Hull Olympiques, 6–2 in the final. Roberts ended his junior career as a two-time Memorial Cup champion.|$|E

50|$|<b>Plater's</b> {{description}} of Dupuytren's disease in 1614 is explained {{with regard to}} {{his understanding of the}} anatomy. The current view that <b>Plater</b> believed the disease to be caused by dislocation and shortening of the flexor tendons is based upon misinterpretation of the original Latin text. With the help of his anatomical studies, <b>Plater</b> had proven that subcutaneous ligamentous extensions of the palmar aponeurosis and not the flexor tendons were responsible for Dupuytren's disease. Felix <b>Plater</b> realised more than one hundred and fifty years before Henry Cline, Astley Cooper, and Dupuytren, the palmar aponeurosis was the anatomical substrate of the disease.|$|R

When I came here, as an apprentice, there was six ships being built, right where I'm standing. It was {{an extraordinary}} place. A hive of activity. Welders, caulkers, <b>platers,</b> burners, joiners, engineers, electricians. I learned how men talked to one another, and how merciless Glasgow humour can be. It has made an indelible mark on me." [...] His foreman was Sammy Boyd, but the two biggest influences on him were Jimmy Lucas and Bobby Dalgleish.|$|E
