5|$|The extinctions of Macroolithus {{and other}} eggs from Southern China {{have also had}} a history of {{different}} interpretations. In the 1990s, Chinese paleontologists, including the prominent egg specialist Zhao Zikui, observed a gradual reduction in dinosaur egg diversity during the final 200,000 to 300,000 years of the Cretaceous, with only Macroolithus ranging up to the boundary. They postulated, contrary to the impact hypothesis, that the extinction {{was the result of a}} prolonged drought that increased the concentration of trace heavy metals, which adversely affected eggshell and embryo development of the dinosaurs causing the population to gradually decline and collapse. Zhao et al. revised this hypothesis in 2002, <b>postulating</b> a gradual extinction of Macroolithus caused by the volcanism of the Deccan Traps. In 2004, Buck et al. disputed this interpretation, arguing that the apparent gradual extinction was an illusion caused by reworking of sediments. Zhao et al. (2009) maintained that the extinction event was gradual.|$|E
5|$|Clement's {{position}} as Bishop of Dunblane provided {{the opportunity to}} participate on the larger national and international stage. In 1241, the Cistercian general chapter began <b>postulating</b> the Pope about the saintliness of Edmund of Abingdon, formerly Archbishop of Canterbury. In the following year, various clerics wrote pieces and compiled evidence supporting this Edmund's claim to sainthood. Clement was one of these clerics. Edmund's saintliness was endorsed by Pope Innocent IV in 1246. Clement took part in a similar campaign in 1249. He was part of the movement to canonise Queen Margaret, one of the ancestors of the contemporary Scottish kings. Clement was appointed to investigate her saintliness, and in the following year Margaret too was canonised. Meanwhile, in 1247, Pope Innocent IV gave Clement the more onerous and demanding appointment of papal tax collector. Clement was charged with collecting one twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues within the Kingdom of the Scots. The purpose was to finance a new crusade, and Clement's appointment was part of a money-raising initiative carried out throughout Western Christendom.|$|E
