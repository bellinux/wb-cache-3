The Washington Posts Sean Fennessey criticized its pop-oriented tracks, stating [...] "Usher works best in {{emotional}} hailstorms, not candy rain", and viewed that it [...] "finds him in Peter <b>Pan</b> <b>mode,</b> digging for remnants of a younger self that never existed". Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave it two out of five stars and said that it [...] "mostly resembles a batch of leftovers from his weakest album, even though it functioned as a momentum maintainer". Kellman dismissed its productions as [...] "innocuous Euro-pop" [...] and [...] "merely passable contemporary R". In a one-star review, Slant Magazine's Erich Henderson panned Versus as a [...] "wretched collection of failed club-sex jams".|$|E
50|$|Image {{stabilizer}} mode switch: This switch {{is found}} on many EF lenses that feature an image stabilizer, {{particularly those of}} longer focal lengths. The switch has two settings on most lenses: Mode 1 and Mode 2. The newest IS Mark II versions of certain EF super telephoto lenses (the 300mm f/2.8L, 400mm f/2.8L, 500mm f/4L, and 600mm f/4L), plus the 200-400mm f/4L IS and 100-400mm f/4-5.6L IS II, have a third setting, Mode 3. Mode 1 is normal mode, used for typical photography, where the subject does not move. Mode 2 is used for panning; this is useful for sports or wildlife photography, where the subject moves constantly and one will need to <b>pan.</b> <b>Mode</b> 3, intended to track action, is similar to Mode 2 in that it ignores panning; however, it only applies stabilization when the shutter is released—the viewfinder image is not stabilized. One should not use Mode 1 for panning as this will typically cause blurred photographs; the image stabilizer will attempt to correct for all motion, including the panning motion, but cannot do so due to the limited range of motion of the IS mechanism. Older lenses that have an image stabilizer, but do not feature this switch, are permanently in Mode 1. Some newer lenses, such as the Canon EF-S 18-200mm lens, are able to detect if they are being panned in either axis and will automatically disable the stabilization for the axis parallel to movement and therefore do not require this switch.|$|E

40|$|New {{series of}} very high spatial {{resolution}} (VHR) satellites Ikonos and Quickbird have enabled mapping and updating of GIS databases of urban areas that is presently carried out using field surveys and aerial images. Satellites provide higher spatial resolution in panchromatic (<b>PAN)</b> <b>mode</b> compared to that in multispectral (MS) mode. High spatial and high spectral resolution are desirable for urban mapping as high spatial resolution provides better geometric quality while high spectral resolution provides better object identification. Image fusion techniques aim at increasing the spatial resolution of MS images using information from PAN image. However, fusion methods alter the spectral content of the original images. This is not desirable in applications requiring spectral information such as visual interpretation or classification procedures that depend on the spectral information of MS images. In this study, fused images obtained for Ikonos PAN and MS and Quickbird PAN and MS images by the standard methods namely IHS (Intensity-Hue-Saturation) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and simple wavelet methods namely, IHS with wavelet (IHS+W), PCA with wavelet (PCA+W), Wavele...|$|E
40|$|Every year {{diseases}} cause lower {{sugar beet}} qualities {{compared to the}} average. For that reason, high resolution multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data {{has been used to}} detect and analyse a fungal sugar beet disease in a study area of Southern Germany. A QuickBird high resolution satellite image was chosen to produce the results for the multispectral part of the study. The very high spatial resolution of 0. 7 m in <b>PAN</b> <b>mode</b> and 2. 5 m in multispectral mode let the sensor become very interesting for remote sensing analysis. Especially the red (630 to 690 nm) and near infrared portions of the spectra (760 to 900 nm) are important for agricultural applications. For the hyperspectral part, airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data has been provided by an “Airborne Visible/Near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer ” (AVIS), which is operated by the Ground Truth Center Oberbayern (gtco). To indicate the difference between healthy and unhealthy plants, image classifications were produced and evaluated with hyperspectral field data.

40|$|The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory {{is being}} used as a {{temporary}} storage facility for transuranic waste generated by the US Nuclear Weapons program at the Rocky Flats Plant (RFP) in Golden, Colorado. Currently, there is a large effort in progress to prepare to ship this waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico. In order to meet the TRU Waste Characterization Quality Assurance Program Plan nondestructive assay compliance requirements and quality assurance objectives, it is necessary to determine the total uncertainty of the radioassay results produced by the Stored Waste Examination Pilot Plant (SWEPP) Passive Active Neutron (PAN) radioassay system. This paper is {{one of a series of}} reports quantifying the results of the uncertainty analysis of the PAN system measurements for specific waste types and measurement modes. In particular this report covers active mode measurements of weapons grade plutonium-contaminated aqueous sludge waste contained in 208 liter drums (item description codes 1, 2, 7, 800, 803, and 807). Results of the uncertainty analysis for <b>PAN</b> active <b>mode</b> measurements of aqueous sludge indicate that a bias correction multiplier of 1. 55 should be applied to the PAN aqueous sludge measurements.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is {{comparison}} of the potential of the Landsat 7 ETM+ data and SPOT 5 -HRG image for forest area mapping at the scale of 1 : 25000 in northern of Iran. A Landsat 7 -ETM+ image and SPOT 5 -HRG in <b>Pan</b> and XS <b>modes,</b> with the spatial resolution of 5 and 10 meters, were analyzed. The images were almost simultaneous. The investigation on the image quality showed that there was a non-systematic misregistration between SPOT 5 -Pan and SPOT 5 -XS. There were no other noticeable radiometric and geometric distortions. Orthorectifications of the both satellite data were implemented using ephemeris data and a digital elevation model. The geocoded images were checked for reliability in comparison with the digital topographic map. Diverse suitable spectral transformation such as rationing, PCA, and Tasseled Cap transformation were performed on the images. To generate effective multispectral bands with better spatial resolution, the green, red and near infrared bands, which lie in the spectral range of panchromatic band, were fused with Pan using DIRS method as a radiometric approach. In order to estimate the potential of the satellite data precisely, a ground truth was prepared using aerial photographs. In this relation, 38 black and white aerial photographs at the scale of 1 : 7000 were taken especially for this project. These airphotos were orthorectified and interpreted. Image classifications were performed using supervised and a new hybrid approach (digital and visual). At first, the images were classified using maximum likelihood classifier without any knowledge of a-priori possibilities. The bes...|$|R
30|$|Bharanitharan et al. [2] {{proposed}} a classified region algorithm {{to reduce the}} inter mode candidates. The analyses of spatial/temporal homogeneity and edge direction were used to choose the inter modes needed for the rate distortion optimization (RDO) calculation. Choi et al. [3] considered those macroblocks (MBs) with the same motion vectors in the same object. Therefore, they utilized the characteristics of each 4 [*]×[*] 4 block after utilizing a Haar wavelet transform to test the homogeneity in an MB in order to select the candidate <b>modes.</b> <b>Pan</b> et al. [4] reordered the modes according to their probabilities and utilized the mean value and the standard deviation of rate distortion costs (RD costs) to be the early termination criterion of RDO. Lee and Lin [5] utilized the probabilities of several modes to calculate the average computation time in each mode. Yeh et al. [6] predicted the best mode based on Bayesian theory, and refined the prediction with the Markov process. The computational complexity was efficiently reduced. The SKIP mode condition was presented to make {{a consideration of the}} neighborhood and co-located information to achieve the reduction in the coding time in [7]. The relation between depth value and mode distribution was analyzed, and the mode candidates were chosen according to different levels of depth in an MB in [8]. Statistics were gathered for both of the RD cost and occurrence probability of each mode in [9]. The normal distribution of RD cost was adopted to calculate the thresholds for early termination. A 2 D map was generated according to the neighboring motion vectors in [10]. Inter modes were reordered or removed via this 2 D map. Ri et al. [11] defined a spatial-temporal mode prediction. The calculated RD cost and the co-located mode were utilized to produce the threshold for mode selection. Visual characteristics of tunnel surveillance videos were considered to analyze the structure of neighborhood inter/intra blocks for adapting the characteristics of static and fixed backgrounds in the observation systems in [12]. Codes in compliance with a coding order of previously neighboring blocks were assigned to increase the opportunity for an early termination in [13]. The relations between the discrete cosine transform (DCT), the sum of absolute difference, and the sum of square difference were established as the conditions for an early termination in [14]. Not only DCT but also the magnitude order of RD cost was discussed in [15]. The connection between the quantization parameter (QP) and the RD cost was experimented with to act as the threshold in [16]. The activity was calculated by utilizing the motion vectors of the neighboring and co-located blocks of the current block.|$|R
