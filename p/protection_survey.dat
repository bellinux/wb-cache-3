High-resolution remote sensing images are better alternatives to field visits for locating unlawful buildings. However, these buildings are usually hidden by vast wildness around the cultural relics, {{which makes the}} use of high-resolution imagery costly and inefficient. The main purpose {{of this research is}} to develop an approach to subpixel building identification from moderate resolution images, such as Landsat 8 OLI with reasonable accuracy based on the mixture-tuned match filtering (MTMF) partial unmixing method.

40|$|Deer (Odocoileus spp.) {{cause an}} {{estimated}} loss of $ 100 million in United States agricultural production each year (Conover 1997). In 1984 the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer <b>Protection</b> <b>surveyed</b> {{producers in the}} state and estimated that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) damage to all agricultural products exceeded $ 36 million annually (Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection 1984). Nationwide, for stored crops alone, wildlife reportedly caused $ 26 million in losses in 1989 (Wywialowski 1994). Despite sometimes biased producer estimates of the value of wildlife-caused losses (Wywialowski 1994), many landowners are willing to accept a certain level of damage for the aesthetics and recreation deer provide. Thus, although agricultural producers’ tolerance of deer is influenced strongly by crop-damage concerns (Brown et al. 1978), they are typically willing to accept damage of ≤ 10 % of the crop’s value (Craven et al. 1992). Sociological and ecological factors, however, complicate crop-damage management decisions (Campa et al. 1997) ...|$|R

40|$|Chile {{went through}} a major pension system reform in 1981, replac-ing the state managed {{pay-as-you-go}} system by a privately-managed fully funded scheme.

We investigate {{the extent to which}} households substitute this increase by decreasing accumulation of other wealth. As the decision to either stay in the old system or opt-out to the new one was not random, we follow an instrumental variable approach that allow us to overcome the unobserved heterogeneity problem. Using data from the Social <b>Protection</b> <b>Survey</b> we nd an elasticity of substitution between expected pension wealth and non-pension wealth in the range of 40 % and 65 %.

In response, the Bachelet government in 2008 implemented reforms to rectify this shortcoming. Here we offer the first systematic effort to directly evaluate the reform’s impacts, focusing on the new Basic Solidarity Pension for poor households with at least one person age 65 +. Using the Social <b>Protection</b> <b>Survey,</b> we show that targeted poor households received about 2. 4 percent more household annual income, with little evidence of crowding-out of private transfers. We also suggest that recipient household welfare probably increased due to slightly higher expenditures on basic consumption including healthcare, more leisure hours, and improved self-reported health.

The authors use data from the Social <b>Protection</b> <b>Survey,</b> EPS, allowing them to construct a panel of workers with information from 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2009. The results suggest that having a temporary contract in Chile reduces {{the probability of}} receiving employer-paid training. The survey also finds that this deficit is not compensated by other types of training. This finding is important for two reasons. First, the proportion of temporary workers that obtain an open-ended contract is low. Second, the productivity growth in Chile after 1997 is practically zero and human capital accumulation {{is one of the}} factors that might help to recover the path of productivity growth.
