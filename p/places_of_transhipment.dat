A traditional road/rail combined transport contains a pick up service with a short road haulage at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> dispatch, <b>transhipment</b> to a rail wagon, long dis¬tance rail haulage, another transhipment and a delivery road haulage. On July 1, 1992, the business unit for CT of Swedish State Railways (SJ), SJ Kombi, was changed into a limited company. The new company, Rail Combi AB, is principal of all Swedish CT terminals and has also a monopoly of selling domestic CT services to hauliers and forwarders. Approximately 1 000 wagons for combined transport are handled daily at the Swedish terminals. About 20 % refer to international transport. Rail Combi takes a central point in this paper. The purpose of the paper is to describe the Swedish production system for domestic combined transport. The current situation as well as development plans are de¬scribed.

The future opening of Myanmar route further gives some relief to India.

30|$|The {{first and}} most {{conspicuous}} step consists in constructing a revised version of the LSBCI. The underlying raw data is obtained from Lloyds List Intelligence (formally Containerisation International On-line) (“Lloyd’s List Intelligence - Containers,” n.d.). The dataset gives all the existing direct country pair connections and includes inter alia the number of ships sailing in this route, the TEU capacity of the largest vessel per direct route, the number of operators per route (both those who operate their own vessels {{and those who do}} not). The information is obtained annually, in the month of May. The data covers the reported deployment of all containerships at a given point in time. This methodology allows for comparisons over time, as the “sample” is always complete. UNCTAD started the systematic annual gathering of data in 2004 on the country level and in 2006 on the pair-of-country level. In addition to the LSBCI itself and its components which are defined and discussed in detail in next section, two novel variables are retrieved from this data: a variable indicating the number <b>of</b> <b>transhipments</b> necessary to connect any pair of countries and, the effective maritime distance to be covered between any pair of countries. Note that only {{in the case of a}} direct maritime connection, the effective (computed) maritime distance coincides with sea distance. Note also that information on the number <b>of</b> <b>transhipments</b> necessary to connect any pair of countries is symmetric: if two transhipments are necessary to move containers from country C to country D, then the same number <b>of</b> <b>transhipments</b> is necessary to move containers in the opposite direction from D to C.|$|R

30|$|These {{exceptional}} prospects {{have resulted}} in the growth of competition between ports in the region. There are two facts which mainly contribute to competitive conditions: the continuous increase of the total cargo transferred and the spread <b>of</b> <b>transhipment</b> container flows. Many port authorities have realized the opportunities arisen from container transport operations, because of the resulting high added value, and they have gradually carried out investment plans to facilitate container transfers. These investments increased the volume of container flows in many ports and brought about remarkable changes in the hierarchical position of ports, in terms of the volume of containers handled [40].|$|R
