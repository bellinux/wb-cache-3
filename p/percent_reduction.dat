However, and issue arose in September 2011 when the state of Washington department of health warned Burger King of issues with the Duke units.

5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios.

The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five <b>percent</b> <b>reduction</b> in these species’ populations. While this may not seem like a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness.

IWBU is expected to cost roughly $313 million. The 1760 IWBU will allow the B-52 to carry the AGM-158B JASSM-ER cruise missile and the ADM-160C MALD-J decoy missile. All 1760 IWBUs should be operational by October 2017. Two bombers will {{have the ability to}} carry 40 weapons in place of the 36 that three B-52s can carry. The 1760 IWBU allows precision-guided missiles or bombs to be deployed from inside the weapons bay; previous aircraft carried these munitions externally on wing hardpoints. This increases the number of guided weapons a B-52 can carry and reduces the need for guided bombs to be carried on the wings. The first phase will allow a B-52 to carry twenty-four 500-pound guided JDAM bombs or twenty 2,000-pound JDAMs, with later phases accommodating the JASSM and MALD family of missiles. In addition to carrying more smart bombs, moving them internally from the wings reduces drag and achieves a 15 <b>percent</b> <b>reduction</b> in fuel consumption.|$|E

Whether percent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction or attained LDL-C levels add incremental prognostic value to statin dose is not known. Patients in the Treating to New Targets (TNT), Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL), and Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trials (patient-level data) randomized to a statin arm (atorvastatin 80 mg/ 10 mg or simvastatin 20 mg) were chosen. Patients were divided into groups based on attained LDL-C levels (≤ 70 vs > 70 mg/dL) and <b>percent</b> LDL-C <b>reduction</b> (≥ 50 % vs < 50 %). Primary outcome was major cardiovascular event defined as death due to coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2011 The {{synthesis}} of transition metal compounds has been performed to create reactive additives {{that can be}} incorporated into commercial grade paints for the purpose of developing a continuous self-decontaminating coating. The coatings were designed to allow for the decontamination of persistent chemical warfare agents: sulfur mustard and organophosphate nerve agents. Since the persistence of these chemicals on surfaces due to their low volatility and long hydrolysis half lives could possibly lead to involuntary exposures, a continuous self-decontaminating coating would provide an alternative approach to eliminate residual chemical warfare agents without further treatment to the painted surface. The synthesized additives include metal oxide nanoparticles,polyoxometallates,andmetalfunctionalizedcyclodextrins. Coatings were formulated with 1 % w/w synthesized additives, and tested for their ability to decontaminate chemical warfare agent simulants of sulfur mustard and organophosphate nerve agents.
