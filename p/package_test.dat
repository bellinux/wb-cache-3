40|$|In today's semiconductor-based {{computer}} and communication technology, system performance is determined primarily by two factors, namely on-chip and off-chip operating frequency. In this dissertation, time-domain measurement-based methods that enable gigabit data transmission {{in both the}} IC and package have been proposed using Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) equipment. For {{the evaluation of the}} time-domain measurement-based method, a wafer level <b>package</b> <b>test</b> vehicle was designed, fabricated and characterized using the proposed measurement-based methods. Electrical issues associated with gigabit data transmission using the wafer-level <b>package</b> <b>test</b> vehicle were investigated. The test vehicle consisted of two board transmission lines, one silicon transmission line, and solder bumps with 50 um diameter and 100 um pitch. In this dissertation, 1) the frequency-dependent characteristic impedance and propagation constant of the transmission lines were extracted from TDR measurements. 2) Non-physical RLGC models for transmission lines were developed from the transient behavior for the simulation of the extracted characteristic impedance and propagation constant. 3) the solder bumps with 50 um diameter and 100 um pitch were analytically modeled. Then, the effect of the assembled wafer-level package, silicon substrate and board material, and material interfaces on gigabit data transmission were discussed using the wafer-level <b>package</b> <b>test</b> vehicle. Finally, design recommendations for the wafer-level package on integrated board were proposed for gigabit data transmission in both the IC and package. Ph. D.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} Test Application Time (TAT) reduction under power constraints for core- based 3 D Stacked ICs (SICs) {{connected by}} Through Silicon Vias (TSVs). Unlike non-stacked chips, where the test flow is well defined {{by applying the}} same test schedule both at wafer sort and at <b>package</b> <b>test,</b> the test flow for 3 D TSV-SICs is yet undefined. In this paper we present a cost model to find the optimal test flow. For the optimal test flow, we propose test scheduling algorithms that take the particulars of 3 D TSV-SICs into account. A key challenge in testing 3 D TSV-SICs {{is to reduce the}} T AT by co-optimizing the wafer sort and the <b>package</b> <b>test</b> while meeting power constraints. We consider a system of chips with cores that are accessed through an on-chip JTAG infrastruc- ture and propose a test scheduling approach to reduce T AT while considering resource conflicts and meeting the power constraints. Depending on the test schedule, the JTAG interconnect lines that are required can be shared to test several cores. This is taken into account in experiments with an implementation of the proposed scheduling approach. The results show significant sav- ings in T AT...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a scheme for test {{planning}} and test access mechanism (TAM) design for stacked integrated circuits (SICs) that are designed in a core-based manner.

The test cost is evalu-ated for a test flow that consists of a wafer sort test of each indi-vidual chip and a <b>package</b> <b>test</b> of the complete stack of chips. We use an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to find the op-timal test cost. The ILP model is implemented on several designs constructed from ITC’ 02 benchmarks.
