40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{development}} work associated with the design of vacuum components for the Thermonuclear Project, a program was initiated for the testing of high vacuum bakeable flange and gasket designs for leak-tight sealing requirements. The flange and gasket components, chosen for the initial study because of the simplicity in design and low yield point of the gasket material, consisted of the fully annealed, type 1100, aluminum alloy compressed between <b>plane</b> <b>flange</b> surfaces which had a 32 mu in. -rms finish. Leak-tight sealing of the 99 % aluminum, 10 -inch wire was found to be dependent on the yield point and creep properties of the alloy. It was demonstrated, (1) that sealing was accomplished when the bolt loaded flange exceeded the yield point of the strain hardened gasket, and (2) the life of the gasket was dependent on the rate of deformation during thermal cycling between room temperature and 250 deg C. It was possible to maintain a satisfactory vacuum seal STA< 10 /sup - 9 / torr liter-sec/sup - 1 /-(gasket in.) /sup - 1 /! for more than 18 thermal cycles with four hours per bake at the elevated temperature. Initial sealing of this 0. 088 -in. diameter gasket was achieved with approximately 0. 028 -in. gasket deformation and a force of 1500 lbs (linear in.) /sup - 1 / or (71 / 2 tons-in. /sup - 2 /) The maximum loading force required to achieve a seal (i. e., to cause plastic flow) was approximately 81 / 2 tons. in. /sup - 2 /, or 3000 lbs (linear in.) /sup - 1 / of gasket.

5000|$|The MFT system {{standard}} specifies {{the lens}} mount flange to image sensor <b>plane</b> distance (<b>flange</b> focal distance) as 20mm, {{which is less}} than half that of typical DSLRs. [...] The effect is that the GH1 body is smaller in every critical dimension, especially depth, and is also lighter weight when compared to a typical DSLR. This 20mm flange to image sensor distance prohibits the practical implementation of the traditional mirror box and pentaprism optical viewfinder of the typical DSLR. The Panasonic electronic viewfinder is the solution to that packaging issue.|$|R
40|$|In {{practice}} the actual maximum stress {{is greater than}} the stress determined by the simple girder theory, which overestimates the bearing or supporting capacity of the flange. The fact is that the assumptions of the simple girder theory no longer hold true, since normal transverse and shearing stresses are engendered in the <b>plane</b> of the <b>flange...</b>|$|R

Therefore, the magnitude of the displacement can be regarded as the magnitude of the vector that is orthographically projected into the <b>flange</b> <b>plane</b> of the P-Gear. In the following, this magnitude {{is referred to as the}} distance |r [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{analysis}} of the electromagnetic field behaviour from the open end of the parallel-plate waveguide with infinite impedance flanges is theoretically investigated. The case with the absence of impedance flanges is also considered. Furthermore, we take into account particular features of the waveguide edges. The effects of the impedance flanges and the edge features on the electromagnetic field and the radiation patterns of a <b>plane</b> waveguide with <b>flanges</b> are demonstrated. The method of moments (MoM) technique which was used to solve the integral equations is presented along with the numerical results...|$|R
5000|$|The Leica Standard was {{introduced}} {{as a basic}} model by Ernst Leitz, Wetzlar in October 1932. The camera was in production {{at the same time}} as the Leica II and Leica III models that have coupled rangefinders; the latter also has the faster speed of 1/1000 sec. It has a standardised lens mount with distance from film <b>plane</b> to lens <b>flange</b> fixed to 28.8 mm, a Leitz standard. This feature was first seen on late Leica I model C cameras in 1931, and all Leica II, Model D from 1932, identified by a [...] "0" [...] (zero) stamped on the lens mount flange at the top, to indicate the implementation of the standard, a practice that was continued for some time. It is found on early Leica Standards as well. On the back of these models there is a hole covered by a black plug, presumably for back focus calibration. The original lens for the Leica Standard when introduced was the Leitz Elmar 1:3,5 F=50mm in a collapsible nickel-plated focusing mount with infinity catch.|$|R
