50|$|Silver Cross is {{well known}} for the {{manufacture}} of traditional coach-built prams, characterised by a hard body, C-spring suspension, spoked wheels and folding hood. This method of pram building was pioneered by William Wilson, an engineer and inventor from Leeds, England. Wilson went on to establish Silver Cross in 1877, marketing this type of coach-built baby carriage, and registering numerous patents for perambulator design in order to protect his unique invention. Despite refinements in techniques and manufacturing processes, the method of pram building today remains very similar to early pram building, with body panels being pressed from aluminium, riveted together and then painted to a high gloss finish. The body is then hand upholstered with a pram bed, and also decorated with fine line detail (in kind with fine lines applied to the coachwork of horse-drawn carriages - hence the term coach-built pram). The fine lines are hand painted and require considerable skill to apply. The steel suspension of the pram is hand bent around a specially shaped form in order to create the C-shaped suspension members, which are then attached to the body using leather straps. It is the C-spring suspension and leather straps that create the unique coach-built pram 'bounce'. The spoked wheels (traditionally chromed) are then attached to the suspension to complete the rolling chassis. Traditional pram wheels are large in diameter to further enhance the smooth ride. A folding fabric hood, <b>pushing</b> <b>handle</b> and covering fabric apron are then attached to the pram to complete the build. Silver Cross also manufactures a collection of coach-built dolls prams, which are scaled-down replicas of the full size prams. The dolls prams are made {{in exactly the same way}} as the real prams with the same coachwork, spoked wheels and folding hood. Silver Cross currently manufactures two models of full-size coach-built pram in the UK, the Balmoral and the Kensington, as well as two models of dolls pram, the Oberon and the Chatsworth. Silver Cross is the only pram manufacturer still producing coach-built prams in the UK.|$|E
40|$|Unexpected sudden (un) {{loading of}} the trunk may induce {{inadequate}} responses of trunk muscles and uncontrolled trunk motion. These unexpected perturbations may occur in pushing tasks, when the cart suddenly starts moving (unloading) or is blocked by an obstacle (loading). In <b>pushing,</b> <b>handle</b> height affects the user's working posture, which may influence trunk muscle activity and trunk movement {{in response to the}} perturbation. Eleven healthy male subjects pushed a 200 kg cart with handles at shoulder and hip height in a start condition (sudden release of brakes) and a stop condition (bumping into an obstacle). Before the perturbation, the baseline {{of the trunk}} inclination, internal moment and trunk extensor muscle activity were significantly higher when pushing at hip height than at shoulder height. After the perturbation, the changes in trunk inclination and internal moment were significantly larger when pushing at shoulder height than at hip height in both conditions. The opposite directions of changes in trunk inclination and internal moment suggest that the unexpected perturbations caused uncontrolled trunk motion. Pushing at shoulder height may impose a high risk of low-back injury due to the low trunk stiffness and large involuntary trunk motion occurring after carts suddenly move or stop. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} a technique of pushing a wheelchair at the level of the handle bars as a method for measuring rolling resistance of wheelchair-user systems under different field conditions. Under standardized conditions on a motor driven treadmill, rolling resistance was determined using a 2 D strain gauge-based push technique at the level of the handle bars and a commonly used 1 D strain gauge-based wheelchair drag test using an adapted push wheelchair and ISO dummy at several velocities and using different push handle heights. After verification of the method, rolling resistance of six different floor surfaces was measured with the experimental push wheelchair in a centre for rehabilitation. Using an analysis of variance for repeated measures, small but significant differences in rolling resistance were found between the drag and push tests on a motor driven treadmill. Belt velocity and push handle height significantly affected rolling resistance. In the field study in the rehabilitation centre, tiles and tarpaulin had the lowest rolling resistance, while high piled carpet had the highest values. It is concluded that the wheelchair pushing method described in this study is usable for the determination of (relative) differences in rolling resistance of different floor materials if performed under standardized conditions and procedures, such as a stable velocity (within a small range of variation), using an ISO-dummy and a constant <b>pushing</b> <b>handle</b> bar height...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to analyze the external forces and biomechanical loading on the musculoskeletal system during wheelchair pushing, in relation to different <b>push</b> <b>handle</b> heights. In addition, recommendations for wheelchair pushing in accordance with <b>push</b> <b>handle</b> height are made. Eight young, female subjects carried out three different wheelchair transport tasks at five different <b>push</b> <b>handle</b> heights in a standardized laboratory setting. Five pushing heights were selected {{as a percentage of the}} subjects shoulder height (61, 69. 5, 78, 86. 5 and 95 %). All three wheelchair transport tasks investigated required higher <b>pushing</b> <b>handles</b> in order to minimise net shoulder moments and external vertical forces on the hands. When pushing a wheelchair on to a pavement, net moments around wrists, elbows, shoulders compression and shear forces at L 5 -S 1 and external vertical forces were lower using higher pushing heights. When low <b>pushing</b> <b>handles</b> are used, elderly female attendants are at risk of L 5 -S 1 low back pain when lifting and pushing the wheelchair on to a pavement. A recommendation is made to reconsider height and position of the <b>pushing</b> <b>handles</b> of attendant propelled wheelchairs. For the investigated tasks, a pushing height of 86. 5 % (1. 191 +/- 0. 034 m) was most favourable...|$|R

50|$|A {{self-propelled}} manual wheelchair {{incorporates a}} frame, seat, {{one or two}} footplates (footrests) and four wheels: usually two caster wheels at the front and two large wheels at the back. There will generally also be a separate seat cushion. The larger rear wheels usually have push-rims of slightly smaller diameter projecting just beyond the tyre; these allow the user to manouevre the chair by pushing on them without requiring them to grasp the tyres. Manual wheelchairs generally have brakes that bear on the tyres of the rear wheels, however these are solely a parking brake and in-motion braking {{is provided by the}} user's palms bearing directly on the push-rims. As this causes friction and heat build-up, particularly on long downslopes, many wheelchair users will choose to wear padded wheelchair gloves. Manual wheelchairs often have two <b>push</b> <b>handles</b> at the upper rear of the frame to allow for manual propulsion by a second person, however many active wheelchair users will remove these to prevent unwanted pushing from people who believe they are being helpful.|$|R

40|$|Study design: Case report. Objective: To {{describe}} {{a case of}} radial nerve compression neuropathy caused by a common wheelchair technique (hooking manoeuvre) used by a tetraplegic person to maintain truncal stability on a wheelchair. Setting: Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Method and results: A 45 -year-old man with American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale A C 6 for the last 32 years developed progressive weakness of the right upper limb that was associated with pain in the shoulder and arm. Serial physical examinations demonstrated motor and sensory deterioration. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord showed no evidence of syringomyelia. Electrodiagnostic study showed motor and sensory neuropathy of the right radial nerve in the axillary region. Conclusion: The act of hooking the arm behind the wheelchair <b>push</b> <b>handle</b> causes trauma leading to radial nerve compression neuropathy. Because this technique is used frequently by wheelchair users, future studies should examine the prevalence of radial neuropathy in this population and develop alternative methods to maintain balance on the wheelchair.

40|$|A {{series of}} commercially {{available}} titanium ultralight wheelchairs were tested using ANSI/RESNA testing procedures, and their durability was compared with previously tested aluminum ultralight wheelchairs and light-weight wheelchairs. Three {{of each of}} the following titanium wheelchairs were tested: Invacare-TopEnd, Invacare-A 4, Quickie-Ti, and TiLite-ZRA. The Quickie-Ti wheelchairs had the most forward and rearward center of gravity adjustability. All of the titanium wheelchairs passed the forward braking effectiveness test, but two chairs of each model tipped backward before the platform inclining to 7 degree in the rearward braking effectiveness test. All titanium wheelchairs passed the impact strength tests, but two failed in the static strength tests: two Invacare-TopEnd wheelchairs and one Invacare-A 4 wheelchair failed due to deformation of the armrest mounting plates, and the handgrips of the TiLite-ZRA wheelchairs slid off the <b>push</b> <b>handles.</b> Two Invacare-A 4 and one Invacare-TopEnd successfully completed the double drum and curb drop tests, but the remaining 9 wheelchairs failed prematurely. No significant differences were found in the number of the equivalent cycles or the value among the four models. The titanium ultralight wheelchairs had less equivalent cycles and value than the aluminum ultralight wheelchairs that were tested in a previous study. The failure modes in the static strength tests and the fatigue tests were consistent within the model, and revealed important design issues for each model. Our results suggest that manufacturers need to perform more careful analyses before commercializing new products...|$|R

50|$|The {{workers who}} {{specialize}} in removing the cork are known as extractors. An extractor uses a very sharp axe to make two types of cuts on the tree: one horizontal cut around the plant, called a crown or necklace, at a height of about 2-3 times the circumference of the tree, and several vertical cuts called rulers or openings. This is the most delicate phase of the work because, even though cutting the cork requires significant force, the extractor must not damage the underlying phellogen or the tree will be harmed. To free the cork from the tree, the extractor <b>pushes</b> the <b>handle</b> of the axe into the rulers. A good extractor needs to use a firm but precise touch in order to free {{a large amount of}} cork without damaging the product or tree.|$|R
