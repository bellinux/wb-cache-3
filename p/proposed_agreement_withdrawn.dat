40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "On May 13, 2008, the President submitted to Congress a <b>proposed</b> <b>Agreement</b> Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation for Cooperation in the Field of Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (henceforth {{referred to as the}} U. S. -Russia 123 agreement) in accordance with the review requirements established under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), as amended. The United States has agreements for peaceful nuclear cooperation governing nuclear exports to nearly 50 countries, Taiwan, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Such agreements provide the framework and authorization for civilian nuclear cooperation, but do not guarantee that cooperation will take place or that nuclear material or technology transfers will occur. The <b>proposed</b> <b>agreement</b> with Russia would, among other things, establish the legal basis for the Department of Energy (DOE) to work with Russia on large-scale development of nuclear energy. However, owing to Russia's status as a nuclear weapons state, the size of its nuclear complex, and past proliferation concerns, including weaknesses in the Russian export control system, an agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the United States and Russia raised a number of concerns among Members of Congress. Section 123 of the AEA (Section 123) identifies the key U. S. government agencies and sets forth the procedures for negotiating, proposing, and entering into peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements with foreign nations. Consistent with Section 123, the Department of State (State) is responsible for negotiating any <b>proposed</b> <b>agreement,</b> with the technical assistance and concurrence of DOE. After consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), State and DOE jointly submit the <b>proposed</b> <b>agreement</b> to the President, accompanied by the views and recommendations of State, DOE, and NRC. Section 123 also provides that State supply the President with an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) for each <b>proposed</b> <b>agreement,</b> accompanied by a classified annex, prepared in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence that summarizes relevant classified information. The NPAS serves as an analysis of the <b>proposed</b> <b>agreement</b> to ensure compliance with provisions of the AEA as well as the adequacy of safeguards and other control mechanisms to ensure assistance furnished under the agreement is not used to further any military or nuclear explosive purpose. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} a trade agreement that puts at centre stage the com-peting interests between firms within a sector: Larger firms tend to be pro-trade liber-alization whereas smaller firms favor protection. This set-up contrasts with the prior literature in economics that has tended to focus on competing interests between sectors, and further {{develops a}} literature in political science. The paper determines the set of circumstances under which a trade agreement will be reached, and the extent of trade liberalization, in an environment where firms can lobby the government for or against a <b>proposed</b> <b>agreement.</b> Lobbying is modelled as an all-pay auction, incorporating the feature that binding contracts over contributions for policies cannot be written. This approach gives rise to the possibility that a trade agreement may not go ahead even if it would increase efficiency. In this set-up, if a <b>proposed</b> <b>agreement</b> is over non-tariff barriers and if it goes ahead then it always entails free trade. On the other hand, if a <b>proposed</b> <b>agreement</b> is over tariffs and if it goes ahead then it either entails free trade or the tariff revenue maximizing tariff...|$|R
50|$|On 15 January 2009, {{pursuant}} to Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan first signed a <b>proposed</b> bilateral <b>agreement</b> on peaceful nuclear cooperation {{at the close}} of the George W.

On 21 May 2009, Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg and UAE Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al Otaiba signed a new version of the agreement. On the same day, the Obama administration submitted the <b>proposed</b> <b>agreement</b> to U.S. Congress, which had the opportunity to review the <b>proposed</b> <b>agreement</b> until 17 October 2009, a period of 90 days of continuous session. On 26 October 2009, the UAE cabinet approved the agreement. The agreement entered into force on 17 December 2009 when the governments exchanged diplomatic notes.|$|R
