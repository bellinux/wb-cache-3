They were later analyzed using Gas chromatography (GC). The Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (r) {{was used to determine}} the interactions of the PAHs detected while the One-way ANOVA was used to determine spatial variance equality in means of the PAHs components at P (971. 1318) > Fcrit(3. 85563) ]. A further structure detection revealed that the inequalities were contributed by all the <b>PAH</b> <b>components,</b> especially between BH 3 and BH 1, BH 4 and BH 2 and 5, as well as between BH 6 and BH 10. Very strong associations were observed between the <b>PAH</b> <b>components</b> at P < 0. 01. BH 8 recorded the highest contamination level of the various PAHs due basically to its proximity to the refinery’s effluent discharge point (Ekerekana Creek) and channel. Hence the source of these pollutants could best be fingerprinted to the nearby Port Harcourt Refinery Company’s effluent discharges. These PAHs are not only ingested by drinking contaminated waters, but are further consumed when this water is used to prepare foods.

40|$|I Norge er det utarbeidet klassegrenser for til sammen 16 PAH-forbindelser i {{sediment}} og vann. Grenseverdiene baserer seg på kunnskap om toksisitet av de ulike stoffene og hva som er akseptabel eksponering for miljøet. I tillegg til grenseverdiene for enkeltkomponentene av PAH opererer norske miljømyndigheter med klassegrenser for PAH-grupperingen SUM PAH- 16 i sediment. Disse klassegrensene bygger på overkonsentrasjoner i forhold til bakgrunnsnivå, og ikke økotoksikologiske data. Risikovurderinger av PAH-forurenset sediment gjøres for alle PAH-komponentene. SUM PAH- 16 benyttes imidlertid til å vurdere behov for tiltak i PAH-forurenset sjøbunn. Det foreslås her en ny tilnærming som tillater bruk av de 16 PAH-forbindelsene.

The limit values are based on knowledge of the toxicity of individual compounds, and acceptable exposure in the environment. In addition to the limit values for individual compounds, Norwegian environmental authorities operate with limit values for SUM PAH- 16 in sediment.

Sterile amber coloured bottles were used to collect 10 replicate borehole water samples from the mainland and fixed with concentrated H 2 SO 4. Samples were transferred to the laboratory in iced coolers and analyzed using Gas chromatography coupled with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). The interactions of the <b>PAH</b> <b>components</b> detected was determined using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (r) while spatial variance equality in means of concentrations was explored with the One-way ANOVA. Structure detection of observed inequalities was made with means plots. Concentrations of the PAHs were high and exceeded the WHO maximum permissible limit of 0. 002 mg/l in drinking water. Benzo(b) fluoranthene, with the highest mean concentration varied between 0. 00037 - 0. 51266 (0. 08117 ± 0. 03330159) mg/l, fluoranthene varied between 0. 00060 - 0. 32890 (0. 0473946 ± 0. 01769877) mg/l, while benzo(k) fluoranthene with the least mean concentration varied between 0. 00017 - 0. 08478 (0. 0237385 ± 0. 00610045) mg/l.

30|$|Ratios of {{selected}} <b>PAH</b> <b>components</b> {{have been widely}} used to identify specific sources and although results may be ambiguous, they provide indicative values (Countway et al. 2003; Feng et al. 2014; Pedersen et al. 2015 a; Soclo et al. 2000; Yunker et al. 2002). In cases of PAH pollution from several sources, the ratios may be used for evaluating predominant sources. The ratio of anthracene/(anthracene and phenanthrene) has previously been used for determining petrogenic (< 0.1) and pyrogenic (> 0.1) sources (Soclo et al. 2000). In this study the ratio was 0.1 and hence in the borderline of petrogenic and pyrogenic sources. The PAH ratios fluoranthene/(fluoranthene and pyrene) and indeno(123 -cd)pyrene/(indeno(1, 2, 3 -cd)pyrene and benzo(ghi)perylene) have been used to indicate whether pyrogenic sources originate from liquid fossil fuel combustion (0.4 – 0.5 / 0.2 – 0.5) or coal/biomass combustion (> 0.5 /> 0.5) (Feng et al. 2014). In this study these ratios were 0.1 and 0.3, respectively, indicating that the source to be combustion of liquid fossil fuel.

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contaminants of concern under the Arctic Environmental Monitoring Programme (AMAP) {{due to their}} carcinogenic potential. The concentration of the different <b>PAH</b> <b>components</b> may {{be connected to the}} geochemical background of the sediments, including leakage and erosion of fossil carbon, as well as epigenetic processes such as decaying peat. In other cases there is a human influence connected to petroleum spills or combustion of fossil fuel or other human activities. The overall goal {{of this study was to}} identify and analyze existing comparable datasets on PAHs from Norwegian and Russian arctic shelves, and use the concentration and composition of <b>PAH</b> <b>components</b> in the selected datasets to assess baseline concentration of PAH, geographical anomalies and sources and routes of transport, as well as the human impact. PAHs in 330 samples of surface sediment from the Barents and Kara Sea shelves, collected during the period 1991 - 1998, have been selected for the study. In the Southwest Barents Sea the nature of PAHs is formed by a complex sedimentation regime made up of inflowing Atlantic and North Sea water, coastal discharges, coastal abrasion and atmospheric transport. The PAHs basically correspond to background compositions with a low but notable anthropogenic influence. In the Northern Barents Sea both concentration and composition of PAHs are genetically (genesis, conditions and level of transformation) connected with eroded sediment material from the Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land archipelagos. The relative high PAH levels observed off Spitsbergen thus generally may have a non- anthropogenic explanation. In the central part of the Barents Sea the PAH levels in the deep-water bottom sediments are generally low, non-anthropogenic in origin, and determined by endogenous processes. Erosion and re-deposition of Novaya Zemlya strata do not have a significant influence on PAH composition in this part of the Barents Sea. In the Southeast Barents Sea (Pechora Sea) the PAH composition corresponds, in general, well with the PAH allocation in the Barents Sea. However, the terrigenous influence is stronger. The PAH composition exhibits both epigenetic processes (such as the high level of perylene which most probably is derived from decaying peat) and the presence of petrogenic PAH. The latter findings may be due to the influx of rivers draining oil-rich onshore territories. In estuaries and offshore the Kara Sea the PAH composition of bottom sediments reflects the significant influence of river run-off (with the same patterns as in the Pechora Sea), but also atmospheric transport of combustion derived PAHs, most probably from the smelters in Norilsk...|$|E

This community exhibited an ability to utilize fluoranthene as the sole carbon source for growth, as demonstrated by increases in protein concentration and changes in absorption spectra when grown on fluoranthene in liquid culture. Biotransformation of other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was verified by demonstrating their disappearance from an artificial PAH mixture by capillary gas chromatography. When grown on fluoranthene as the sole carbon source and subsequently exposed to fluoranthene plus 16 additional PAHs typical of those found in creosote, this community transformed all PAHs present in this defined mixture. After 3 days of incubation, 13 of the original 17 <b>PAH</b> <b>components</b> were degraded to levels below the limit of detection (10 ng/liter).

However, most of the Hansen solubility parameters (dispersion contributions, (delta) (d); polarity contributions, (delta) (p); hydrogen bonding contributions, (delta) (hb)) of coal tar components (e. g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) were inadequate. This study estimated the Hansen solubility parameters of naphthalene, acenaphthene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, and fluoranthene from coal tar by applying a new approach regulated by turbidimetric titration and a calculating program based on the method of exhaustion. The extended Hansen approach was used to verify the new approach and evaluate the solubility of the six <b>PAH</b> <b>components</b> in different solvents. The results show that the new method can clearly identify the differences in Hansen solubility parameters caused by various combinations of benzene rings among some isomers (e. g., anthracene and phenanthrene). Among the six PAH compounds, high relativity between their Hansen solubility parameters and solubility data was revealed, indicating an excellent reliability of the new method. An extended Hansen approach is appropriate for the estimation of solubility for the six PAHs with acceptable deviations. Moreover, the relationship between the Hansen solubility sphere and the extended Hansen approach was successfully presented by regression analysis...|$|E

Analysis by capillary gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography showed that at least 22 PAHs, including all of the most abundant <b>PAH</b> <b>components</b> present in anthracene oil, underwent 70 to 100 % disappearance during 27 days of incubation with nutrient nitrogen-limited cultures of this fungus. Because phenanthrene is the most abundant PAH present in anthracene oil, this PAH was selected for further study. In experiments in which [14 C]phenanthrene was incubated with cultures of P. chrysosporium containing anthracene oil for 27 days, it was shown that 7. 7 % of the recovered radiolabeled carbon originally present in [14 C]phenanthrene was metabolized to 14 CO 2 and 25. 2 % was recovered from the aqueous fraction, while 56. 1 and 11. 0 % were recovered from the methylene chloride and particulate fractions, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography of the 14 C-labeled material present in the methylene chloride fraction revealed that most (91. 9 %) of this material was composed of polar metabolites of [14 C]phenanthrene.

The selective SFE results parallel the sorption/desorption leaching behavior and mechanisms determined by Professor Rixey's investigations (under separate funding) using water desorption of soil columns previously aged with BTEX and PAHs. These results justify more intensive investigations {{of the use of}} selective SFE to mimic soil/water sorption and desorption of organic pollutants related to fossil fuels which will be performed under separate funding. The second {{goal of the}} study was to determine if selective SFE extraction behavior parallels the remediation behavior displayed by PAHs currently undergoing in-situ bioremediation at a manufactured gas plant (MGP) site. Based on soil analyses of several individual PAHs (as well as total PAHs) before remediation began, and after 147 days of remediation, selective SFE successfully mimicked remediation behavior. These results strongly support the use of selective SFE to predict remediation behavior of soils contaminated with PAHs, and are expected to provide a powerful and rapid analytical tool which will be useful for determining the remediation endpoints which are necessary for environmental protection. Based on the initial success found in the present study, additional investigations into the use of SFE for predicting and monitoring the remediation behavior of PAH-contaminated soils will be performed under separate funding...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} in the mid-IR {{the spatial}} {{properties of the}} PAHs emission in the disk of HD 179218. We obtained mid-IR images in the PAH 1, PAH 2 and Si 6 filters at 8. 6, 11. 3 and 12. 5 mu, and N band low-resolution spectra using CanariCam on the GTC. We compared the PSFs measured in the PAH filters to the PSF derived in the Si 6 filter, where the thermal continuum dominates. We performed radiative transfer modelling of the spectral energy distribution and produced synthetic images in the three filters to investigate different spatial scenarios. Our data show that the disk emission is spatially resolved in the PAHs filters, while unresolved in the Si 6 filter. An average FHWM of 0. 232 ", 0. 280 " and 0. 293 " is measured in the three filters. Gaussian disk fitting and quadratic subtraction of the science and calibrator suggest a lower-limit characteristic angular diameter of the emission of circa 100 mas (circa 40 au). The photometric and spectroscopic results are compatible with previous findings. Our radiative transfer (RT) modelling of the continuum suggests that the resolved emission results from PAH molecules on the disk atmosphere being UV-excited by the central star. Geometrical models of the <b>PAH</b> <b>component</b> compared to the underlying continuum point at a PAH emission uniformly extended out to the physical limits of the disk's model. Also, our RT best model of the continuum requires a negative exponent of the surface density power-law, in contrast to earlier modelling pointing at a positive exponent. Based on spatial and spectroscopic considerations {{as well as on}} qualitative comparison with IRS 48 and HD 97048, we favor a scenario in which PAHs extend out to large radii across the flared disk surface and are at the same time predominantly in an ionized charge state due to the strong UV radiation field of the 180 L_sun central star.

40|$|We report {{infrared}} (IR) imaging, IR photometry, IR spectroscopy, optical/IR photopolarimetry, and Very Large Array (VLA) radio {{observations of}} the peculiar binary star RY Scuti. These observations provide an unprecedented view of the detailed spatial structure of the equatorial mass-loss wind of a massive, luminous, 'overcontact' binary system. The binary star (0. 43 AU separation) {{is surrounded by a}} flattened equatorial disk with an outer radius of approximately = 3 x 10 (exp 16) cm (2000 AU) that emits strongly in the IR and radio. The inside of the disk is ionized and emits free-free radiation from hydrogen and 12. 8 micrometers forbidden-line emission from (Ne II); the outside of the disk emits thermal radiation from silicate dust. Radio continuum emission is also produced in a compact H II region surrounding the binary. The dust may have a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (<b>PAH)</b> <b>component.</b> We use a rudimentary geometric model in which the thermal IR and radio emission from the disk are assumed to arise in a pair of concentric toroidal rings to estimate the physical properties of the disk. The mean radius of the ionized gas toroid is approximately = 1. 3 x 10 (exp 16) cm (870 AU), and the mean radius of the dust toroid is approximately = 2. 2 x 10 (exp 16) cm (1470 AU). RY Scuti has a small intrinsic polarization, with the electric vector perpendicular to the equatorial disk, that is probably caused by electron scattering from hot gas close to the central binary. We conclude that neon in the nebula is overabundant with respect to hydrogen and helium by a factor of between 1. 6 and 10. Our IR/radio image data suggest that the circumstellar disk is part of an extensive radiation driven mass-loss outflow that is strongly confined to the equatorial plane of the binary system. The sharp spatial separation of the outer dust torous from the inner ionized gas torus confirms earlier suggestions that dust formation in the circumstellar ejecta of very hot stars must occur in regions that are shielded from the hard radiation field...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was performed in}} August 2000 {{in order to provide}} updated information on the environmental condition of the marine area surrounding Norske Shell's oil refinery at Sola. The refinery ceased normal operation April 1 st 2000. The report comprise results from analysis of metals and hydrocarbons (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAH) in sediments, mussels and semipermeable membranes (SPMDs). Analysis of metals in sediments and mussels did not indicate appreciable leakage from the refinery area to the sea. Municipal discharge of sewage may have caused increased concentrations of benzo(a) pyrene and mercury at one station in Risavika. The concentrations of PAH in the sediment were generally low (insignificantly to moderately polluted). Sediments from one station, near the refinery, contained some heavy oil. The transplanted mussels were generally moderately polluted with PAH. The highest concentrations of PAH in mussels were found near a deep water jetty on the refinery area. The concentration of individual <b>PAH</b> <b>components</b> and SPAH in SPMDs indicates more water accommodated PAH inside Risavika than on the western side of the refinery. A similar conclusion could also be drawn from the analysis of PAH in mussels. The highest concentrations of PAH in SPMD`s were found at the reference site nearer Tananger harbour and not at the stations near the refinery. The results from the studies of soft bottom macrofauna showed a low species diversity in the Tananger harbour. A considerably higher diversity were found at the two stations in Risavika...|$|E
40|$|A {{separation}} method using cyclodextrin-modified {{capillary electrophoresis}} {{has been developed}} for analysis of the 16 U. S. EPA priority pollutant PAHs in contaminated soils. In this procedure, a mixture of negatively charged sulfobutyl ether- 3 ̆b 2 -cyclodextrin (SB 3 ̆b 2 CD) and neutral methyl- 3 ̆b 2 -cyclodextrin (M 3 ̆b 2 CD) {{was added to the}} running buffer, and separation was effected on the basis of differential distribution (partitioning) of the <b>PAH</b> <b>components</b> between the two CD types. Satisfactory separation of all 16 PAHs was achieved in under 20 min with 35 mM SB 3 ̆b 2 CD and 15 mM M 3 ̆b 2 CD, with efficiencies for all components greater than 105 theoretical plates, as expected for CE methods. Injection and electrophoresis methods were identified such that samples provided in dichloromethane were diluted 102 ̆ 21250 -fold in methanol and injected directly. Laser-induced fluorescence detection provided sensitive detection of 11 of the 16 components, with detection limits measured typically in the low microgram per liter (ppb) range. Contaminated soil was extracted using CO 2 supercritical fluid, and the extract was provided in dichloromethane, methanol, and a 50 / 50 mixture. The diluted extract was analyzed using fluorescence detection, and 10 of the 11 compounds were detected above the detection limit. HPLC was used to verify the concentration of six of these components, giving fairly good agreement, though with a possible systematic underestimation of the concentration by the CE method.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Miners inhaling respirable {{coal dust}} (CD) {{frequently}} develop coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, a dust-associated pneumoconiosis characterized by lung inflammation and variable fibrosis. Many coal miners are also exposed to {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (<b>PAH)</b> <b>components</b> of diesel engine exhaust and cigarette smoke, which may contribute to lung disease in these workers. Recently, apoptosis was reported to {{play a critical role}} in the development of another pneumoconiosis of miners, silicosis. In addition, CD was reported to suppress cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 (CYP 1 A 1) induction by PAHs. METHODS: We investigated the hypothesis that apoptosis plays a critical role in lung injury and down-regulation of CYP 1 A 1 induction in mixed exposures to CD and PAHs. We exposed rats intratracheally to 0. 0, 2. 5, 10. 0, 20. 0, or 40. 0 mg/rat CD and, 11 days later, to intraperitoneal β-naphthoflavone (BNF), a PAH. In another group of rats exposed to CD and BNF, caspase activity was inhibited by injection of the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH [quinoline-Val-Asp (OMe) -CH 2 -OPH]. RESULTS: In rats exposed to BNF, CD exposure increased alveolar expression of the proapoptotic mediator Bax but decreased CYP 1 A 1 induction relative to BNF exposure alone. Pan-caspase inhibition decreased CD-associated Bax expression and apoptosis but did not restore CYP 1 A 1 activity. Further, CD-induced lung inflammation and alveolar epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia were not suppressed by caspase inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Combined BNF and CD exposure increased Bax expression and apoptosis in the lung, but Bax and apoptosis were not the major determinants of early lung injury in this model...|$|E
40|$|The source-receptor {{relationship}} of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) in the industrial city has been generally investigated using active air samplers (AAS), but they only provide low spatial resolution data. In this study, the spatial resolution of PAHs was improved {{by the use of}} polyurethane foam based passive air samplers (PUF-PAS). We deployed 40 passive air samplers in duplicate at 20 sites in the largest industrial city of Ulsan, South Korea during winter (January 7 -February 25, 2011). Among the 16 US-EPA priority PAHs, 13 compounds excluding naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and acenaphthene were selected for the calculation of air concentrations. The level of gaseous Sigma(13) PAHs in Ulsan (mean: 43 ng/m(3)) was not as high as we expected due to prevailing winds which transported large amounts of PAHs to the East Sea. The spatial distribution of <b>PAHs,</b> principal <b>component</b> analysis, and diagnostic ratios suggested the influence of PAH emissions from industrial complexes to the surrounding areas. This study demonstrated that the source-receptor {{relationship of}} PAHs in the industrial area can be more clearly understood using passive air samplers. close 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{products}} of the pyrolysis of four sesquiterpenes, β-caryophyllene, α-cedrene, longifolene and valencene, have been examined. Pyrolysis was carried out at 300, 400 and 500 °C, the products determined by GC–MS and then examined for similarities and differences using multivariate data analysis. Analysis showed that longifolene was most resistant and caryophyllene least resistant to pyrolysis with cedrene and valencene occupying intermediate positions. While the compounds were largely unchanged at 300 °C, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (<b>PAHs)</b> were major <b>components</b> of the pyrolysates at 400 and 500 °C.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of organic pollutants in water requires that samples be collected, transported to a laboratory, extracted (usually with {{large volumes of}} hazardous chlorinated solvents), and analyzed using chromatographic techniques. Such limitations make rapid determinations in the field (e. g., for emergency response and/or for survey investigations) very expensive, and with analytical turnaround times requiring several days.
