40|$|In this work, two {{procedures}} for fabrication of polymeric microneedles based on direct photolithography, without any etching or molding process, are reported. Polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight 250 Da), casted into a silicone vessel and exposed to ultraviolet light (365 nm) through a mask, cross-links when added by a commercial <b>photocatalyzer.</b> By changing {{the position of}} the microneedles support with respect to the vessel, different shapes and lengths can be achieved. Microneedles from a hundred microns up to two millimeters have been obtained just tuning the radiation dose, by changing the exposure time (5 – 15 s) and/or the power density (9 – 18 mW/cm 2) during photolithography. Different microneedle shapes, such as cylindrical, conic or lancet-like, for specific applications such as micro-indentation or drug delivery, are demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} a nano anatase TiO 2 {{production}} from the hydrolysis of TiCl, was presented. In the nano TiO 2 suspending medium, the photocatalytic behaviors for some organochlorine pesticides including alpha, beta, gamma, delta-BHC, DDT, dieldrin, dicofol and agroceres were compared and studied under UV irradiation in the air. Owing to structural difference of C-CI in the molecule, the degradation efficiencies for the organochlorine pesticides presented an obvious difference with {{the order of}} dicofol > dieldrin > DDT > agroceres and alpha-BHC >gamma-BHC >delta-BHC >beta-BHC. Accordingly, the nano TiO 2 material was applied as a <b>photocatalyzer,</b> which catalyzed transformation of organochlorine pesticide to chlorine ion. Nanoparticle of silver chloride with a maximal absorbance at the wavelength of 260 nm were prepared in the surfactant polyvinyl alcohol solution. Organochlorine pesticides could be determined according to the concentration of silver chloride...|$|E
40|$|Photocatalytic {{materials}} are considered an effective solution to improve air quality {{in urban areas}} and have been extensively studied in the past decade. The use of nanoparticles as <b>photocatalyzers</b> proved very effective however, the operational conditions can determine how successful the solution will be. For mortars containing nanoparticle of titanium dioxide, the photocatalytic degradation of air pollutants can be compromised by surface contamination, the pollutant’s concentration, and the deactivation time. In this work, the influence of these operational parameters has been studied alongside with a method to improve the photocatalytic activity by using Fe 3 + ion doping...|$|R
30|$|In summary, we have {{developed}} a versatile chemical conversion synthesis of Cu 2 S nanotubes at a low temperature of 90 °C. The conversion mechanism of the Cu 2 S nanotubes from ZnS nanotubes {{is due to the}} large difference in solubility between ZnS and Cu 2 S. The morphological, structural, and optical characteristics of the yielded Cu 2 S nanotubes were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, and Raman spectra in detail. Furthermore, the prepared Cu 2 S nanostructures have been successfully used as the counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells. Compared to all those Cu 2 S nanotubes produced at different reaction times, the photovoltaic efficiency was enhanced significantly as the reaction time increases from 10  min to 1  h, and also a photovoltaic conversion efficiency up to 2.88 % was obtained. We attribute the improved performance to the increased surface area and the good electrocatalytical activity of Cu 2 S. An optimized process to prepare the Cu 2 S DSSCs is expected to further promote the overall efficiency. Although the current work focuses on the synthesis and application of Cu 2 S nanotubes in dye-sensitized solar cells, this kind of nanostructures is also expected to be used in other nanodevices such as gas sensors, <b>photocatalyzers,</b> quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, and so on, in which a high surface area is preferred. The present strategy is a very convenient and efficient method to control and manipulate effectively the chemical composition and structure of nanomaterials. This simple chemical method opens up possibilities to the synthesis of various nanostructures with high surface area for extensive study of the physical and chemical properties of the obtained nanostructures, broadening their potential nanodevice applications.|$|R

Then, &#x 03 B 1;-Fe 2 O 3 shell {{was produced in}} situ {{on the surface of}} the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticle by surface oxidation in molten salts, forming &#x 03 B 1;-Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 core-shell nanostructure. It was showed that the magnetic properties transformed from ferromagnetism to superparamagnetism after the primary Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were oxidized.

40|$|Degradation of the {{bacterium}} E. coli was studied using a rotatory disk photoreactor manufactured in stainless steel to ascertain this photoreaction system’s behaviour in different operating conditions. The photoreactor {{was equipped with}} 6 black light bulbs (BLB) used {{as a source of}} UV light and fitted with 7 removable disks made of common frosted glass impregnated with TiO 2 <b>photocatalyzer</b> which were coupled to a rotation system. TiO 2 was impregnated on the disks using the sol-gel method varying molar precursor gel ratios. Abrasion resistance, disk adhesion and surface uniformity tests were carried out for selecting the film presenting the best characteristics. Bacterial photodegradation studies were carried out using the following variable parameters: the disks’ rotation speed, radiation intensity and the number of discs which were directly related to the concentration of photo-catalyzer in the system. Up to 64. 3 % degradation was achieved in 4 hours using 7 disks, low intensity and low rotation speed...|$|E
