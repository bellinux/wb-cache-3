It mainly includes two parts: One {{is to build}} a <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> for the lien source (road is expressed as the line); The other one {{is to build a}} pollutant GIS software based on the model, which is used to analyze and forecast the environmental status related to the vehicle emission in Guangzhou city. There are six chapters in the paper: chapter 1 is the foreword and chapter 6 is the conclusion. Chapter 2 to 3 are about the <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model.</b> Based on the solution to the dispersion equation of continuous point source in aerodynamics, a common expression of the line-source <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> is gained by applying the linear system theory. Furthermore, a beeline-source model in the arbitrary wind and a circle line-source model are educed, which are the applications of the common expression. Some analysis of Guangzhou City's status of traffic and climate based on measuring data are given in chapter 4. in chapter 5, by the combination of the line-source dispersion model and GIS technique, a pollutant GIS software is developed {{on the basis of the}} electronic map of Guangzhou City, which could display the distribution of pollutant concentration arisen from the vehicles emission based on the real-time data of traffic and climate. The comparison of the simulative values with the observed data shows a favorable result. 本文研究有关城市道路上汽车尾气排放所造成的污染问题。主要分为两个部分：一是建立了一个城市道路线源污染扩散模型；二是在此基础上结合广州市的实际状况建立了一个污染地理信息系统软件，用以对广州市的效能环境状况进行分析和预测。全文共有六章，第一章是前言，第六章是结论第二、三章是对污染扩散过程进行分析并建立模型。从流体力学中的扩散方程入手，在梯度输送理论的假设下，以有风情况下的连续点源解为基础，应用线性系统原理得到了道路线源污染模型公式（模式）的一般表达式。进一步，作为该表达式的应用，导出了任意风向时直线源模式和圆环线源模式。在第四章中对广州市的一些效能气候数据状况进行了分析。在此基础上，在第五章中将线源扩散模式与GIS技术相结合，以广州市电子地图为平台建立起了一个根据城市效能、地形和气象实际状况即时反映汽车尾气污染排放在城市中各点浓度分布的污染地理信息系统。对该系统软件的计算结果与实际数据进行了分析比较，结论显示该软件的模拟效果良好...|$|E

40|$|Different {{configurations}} for energetic production (only {{electric and}} cogenerative) assume a different significance {{in connection with}} the different considered criteria. From an economic point of view, in many instances (in particular {{in the case of the}} use of a renewable source as fuel), only the electric configuration results are more convenient. From an environmental point of view, a more convenient situation can be obtained with cogenerative configuration. In this paper, the significance of the two different configurations for energetic production has been examined. The production of electric energy only and the combined production of electric and thermal energy have been evaluated from an environmental point of view. In order to verify the environmental compatibility of the producing plant, three different tools can be used: the environmental balance, the implementation of the <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> and the tool of the externalities evaluation. More in detail, with the tool of the environmental balance it is possible to perform an evaluation of the flux modification at the stack. Anyway, the results of the environmental balance are not a real index of the effective air quality modification: in order to have an idea of this aspect the implementation of a <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> is required. Finally, the evaluation of externalities is a useful tool in order to have an idea of the social weight of the producing plant.

A finite-element method {{is used to}} solve the governing equations because of its versatility in handling variable-resolution meshes and complex geometries. The one-dimensional version of this model is used to simulate a 24 -h diurnal cycle for a horizontally homogeneous atmospheric boundary layer in neutral, stable, and unstable stratifications. The simulated turbulence fields under a convective boundary layer act as the background turbulence for simulating cases of three-dimensional pollutant dispersion from elevated point sources. The simulated turbulence and pollutant distribution compared well with experimental observations and with other numerical models, ensuring {{the validity of the}} adopted mathematical formulation as well as the developed model. The computed results provide an overview of turbulence structures in different atmospheric stabilities and are helpful to enhance understanding of the characteristics of air pollutant dispersion, such as plume rise and descent in a convective boundary layer.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the health impacts resulting from exposure to PM and NOx emitted by train operations in the Alameda corridor, a crucial rail link that serves the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, also known as the San Pedro Bay Ports (SPBP).

After analyzing year 2005 as our baseline, we consider two scenarios that correspond to switching to Tier 2 and Tier 3 locomotives. We find that mortality from PM exposure accounts for the largest health impacts, with health costs in excess of $ 40 million annually. A shift to Tier 2 locomotives would save approximately half of the annual health costs but the benefits of shifting from Tier 2 to Tier 3 locomotives would be much smaller. This assessment is only partial, however, because of gaps in available health data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of BenMAP to conduct a health assessment at the county level.

40|$|The San Pedro Bay Port (SPBP) of Los Angeles and Long Beach is {{the largest}} {{container}} port in the U. S. Although the benefits of handling and hauling freight are enjoyed by {{the nation as a}} whole, the traffic congestion and air pollution created by the port falls mostly on the people who live and work nearby and along connecting freight corridors. These corridors include two busy freeways, the I- 710 and the I- 110, and an active rail link, the Alameda corridor.   This research studied the environmental and health impacts of freight operations between the SPBP and downtown Los Angeles, some 22 miles to the north. In our analysis of health impacts, we focused on nitrogen oxide (NOX), a contributor to the formation of photo-chemical smog, and fine-grain particulates (PM 10), which can lodge in peoples’ lungs with repeated exposure. We combined estimates of air pollutants from the I- 710 and I- 110 freeways, line-haul rail lines, and rail yards and looked at them for summer and winter.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} from transportation {{results from the}} interaction of numerous factors related to economic growth, urban development and population dynamics. The problem is also affected by the topographical and meteorological characteristics of the area of concern. It {{is a major problem}} that threatens the well-being of inhabitants of large cities around the world. Because of the complex nature of the problem, it is difficult for policy planners and decision makers to foresee the consequences of the interactions and the resultant state of the urban air environment. At present, air quality models of various forms are used by responsible organisations to forecast and manage urban air quality. However, the models are so highly technical that it needs experts in the field to operate them. The outputs of these models are also intricate and difficult to comprehend at first sight. Most of all, air quality models do not explicitly handle the inter-relationship of the effects of changes in population and transportation. patterns on the urban air environment. This means that the planners and decision-makers do not have adequate and suitable tools for managing the problem of urban air {{pollution from}} transportation in cities. Thus, a decision support system that integrates population dynamics, transportation modelling and air quality modelling, and is able to portray their interrelationships is needed. Recently Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that provide the capabilities of database management system (DBMS), map manipulation and geographic display have been developed. In principle, the use of GIS should permit air quality in urban airsheds to be better modelled and visualised. The aim of this study was, therefore, to integrate the relevant models of population dynamics, transport modelling, air pollutant dispersion modelling and GIS into a system {{that could be used to}} assist decision making, policy planning and management of the urban air environment. A suitable integrated system was constructed and evaluated. Operation of this system showed that: It is potentially a powerful decision-support tool. It gives the user a holistic view of the effects of variations in transportation patterns and meteorological conditions on air pollutant concentration patterns. It also transforms the complex and highly technical process of data input, data preparation, and data manipulation needed for the calculation of air pollution concentration levels of an area of interest into a few user-friendly steps. It can also convey the comprehensive results of air pollutant dispersion through a simple but effective visual display; The integrated system can simulate the effects of different scenarios of future development projects and give good visual illustrations of the results. This means that planners will have clear pictures of what will happen if the projects are implemented, and can therefore prepare for the right course of action to deal with the anticipated effects. The project may then be modified, a better alternative may be selected, or protective measures can be implemented to alleviate the effects. The integrated system is a very powerful tool for planning and management of urban air environment because it provides both standard query and graphic query facilities for the system user. Additional databases of features necessary for the planning and management of the urban environment can also be established in the. system for processing and querying purposes if required. The problems remaining to be solved before the integrated system realises its full potential are the capabilities of the chosen air <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> and GIS package. It is recommended that any air <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> to be incorporated into the integrated system should be able to deal with chemical reactions as well as be able to follow movements of the air pollutant with the winds in the study area. It is also desirable that the GIS package have the capability of displaying movements of air pollutant in the study area. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E

To begin with, documents were developed describing the desired specifications for odour measurement, dispersion modelling and information technologies. In parallel, the needs and expectations of all stakeholders, including citizens, regulatory authorities and industrial bodies, were taken into consideration. Citizens' feedback on odour acceptability levels were gathered through smartphones and using the living lab approach. They were further combined with measurements from e-nose and odour dispersion models. Project members developed an Odour Information System that produces validated monitoring statistics and impact levels for local authorities to support environment-related decision-making and for citizens to give them feedback on their complaints. A mobile application is also available, used by citizens to perform odour related observations. Over 5000 observations were sent until now. Besides, two in-situ e-nose sensors and a meteorological station were installed and calibrated in the industrial site in Belgium, serving as pilot. Further 18 industrial parameters are collected in real time and 15 odour field surveys have been performed to understand odour sources and characteristics. The e-nose technology was optimised through tests and improvements to better understand relevant odour parameters at the second pilot site, a pig farm in Austria. Researchers adapted the GRAL-System <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> to develop a fast odour dispersion modelling system using harmonised real-time meteorological data and industrial emission measurements. It was validated with the odour emission rates, olfactometry campaigns and citizens observations. Most of the GRAL-solver components were implemented in Cuda with a speed improved by a factor superior of 100. Project activities were disseminated via project website and factsheets, 3 scientific papers, 13 international conferences and 3 user workshops involving selected citizens, technicians and authorities. Local environmental governance was enhanced through citizen empowerment via monthly meetings and specific methodologies. Better and timely feedback on undesirable odours arising from certain emissions will help in setting evidence-based acceptable odour limits.

The effects of the found differences on the model are evaluated by comparing maps of net radiation calculated with the equation used in the SPRAY <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> used at ISPESL...|$|R
50|$|Atmospheric <b>dispersion</b> <b>modeling</b> is the {{mathematical}} simulation of how air pollutants disperse in the ambient atmosphere. It is performed with computer programs that solve {{the mathematical}} equations and algorithms which simulate the <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The <b>dispersion</b> <b>models</b> {{are used to}} estimate the downwind ambient concentration of air pollutants or toxins emitted from sources such as industrial plants, vehicular traffic or accidental chemical releases. They {{can also be used}} to predict future concentrations under specific scenarios (i.e. changes in emission sources). Therefore, they are the dominant type of model used in air quality policy making. They are most useful for pollutants that are dispersed over large distances and that may react in the atmosphere. For pollutants that have a very high spatio-temporal variability (i.e. have very steep distance to source decay such as black carbon) and for epidemiological studies statistical land-use regression models are also used.|$|R

40|$|The {{discharge}} of produced water {{accounts for the}} largest volume of waste associated with offshore {{oil and gas production}} operations. With the development and expansion of Canada's offshore oil and gas reserves, there is concern over the potential long-term impacts of produced water discharges in the ocean. Furthermore, recent evidence from other offshore oil fields in the world has suggested that production water discharges may impact the biota at greater distances from operational platforms than originally envisaged. To deal with this emerging issue, the present study focused on the development of tool for the assessment of environmental risks associated with produced water discharges based on the integration of ocean hydrodynamic and <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>models.</b> Specifically, a numerical approach, POM-RW, is developed based on an integration of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) and a Random Walk (RW) simulation for pollutant transport. The POM is employed to simulate the ambient oceanographic conditions. It provides three-dimensional (3 D) hydrodynamic input to a Random Walk model focused on the dispersion of toxic components within the produced water effluent stream at a regional spatial scale. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo approach, with the use of water quality standards, has been incorporated into the POM-RW to reflect uncertainties and to quantify the environmental risks associated with produced water discharges. Development and field validation of the predicted current field and pollutant concentrations were conducted in conjunction with a water quality and ecological monitoring program for an offshore facility located on the Grand Banks of Canada. Results demonstrated the utility of this model to support the effective management of produced water discharges in the futur...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Surface {{information}} {{extracted from}} satellite remote sensing {{has been used}} as input to a <b>pollutants</b> atmospheric <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> (PATM); effects in terms of turbulence parameters values and dispersion were evaluated. PATMs need 2 D distributions of a set of surface biophysical parameters to model turbulence. Usually these parameters are set starting form a Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) map using predefined parameterization schemes, linking LULC categories to parameters values. Satellite remote sensing information could improve the accuracy of both LULC maps and surface parameters values, but operational methodologies are needed to routinely feed models with this information. As a contribute to this subject, we used ASTER images to update/integrate the CORINE Land Cover map and to directly calculate surface albedo, feeding the models of the Aria Industry atmospheric dispersion package with the new dataset. SPRAY has been used to simulate the dispersion of an inert generic pollutant emitted fro...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{process from}} the {{vehicular}} exhaust plume {{has a direct}} impact on human health, particularly on vehicle drivers and passengers, bicyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians and people working nearby. A three-dimensional vehicular <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> numerical <b>model</b> was developed based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a k-ε turbulence model to simulate the initial <b>pollutant</b> <b>dispersion</b> process of carbon monoxide, CO, from a vehicular exhaust plume in the real atmospheric environment. Since the ambient wind direction and velocity are stochastic and uncontrollable in the real atmospheric environment, a wind-direction-frequency- weighted (WDFW) approach was used to obtain the real <b>pollutant</b> concentration <b>dispersion</b> along with the development of the vehicular exhaust plume. Within the specified sampling period, the ambient windflow conditions are transformed into the corresponding frequencies of wind directions and averaged magnitudes of wind velocities from directions N, E, S or W. Good agreement between the calculated and measured data for two diesel-fuelled vehicles indicates that with the WDFW approach the initial <b>dispersion</b> of <b>pollutant</b> concentration from a vehicular exhaust plume in the real atmospheric environment can be truly reflected. The present study shows that the dispersion process in the near region for the relative concentration of CO, from RC= 0. 1 (or 10 %) to 1 (or 100 %), is less influenced by the ambient wind velocity than by the vehicular exhaust velocity, but it is vice versa in the far region from RC= 0 (or 0 %) to 0. 1 (or 10 %). It implies that the effect of vehicular exhaust exit velocity on the dispersion process is more pronounced than that of ambient wind velocity at the vicinity of the exhaust tailpipe exit, while the effect of ambient wind velocity gradually shows a significant role for the dispersion process along with the development of a vehicular exhaust plume.
