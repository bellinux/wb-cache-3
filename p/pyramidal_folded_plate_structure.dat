40|$|General {{strategy}} for developing finite elements of general geometric shape explained on quadrilateral <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>structure</b> element ensuring invariance properties {{is presented in}} this paper. The basic idea of this strategy consists in using the natural coordinate system only for defining the element geometry and performing the element integration in a mapped biunit square. For defining the approximation functions a suitable local Cartesian coordinate system defined from the directions of the covariant base vectors and the perpendicular contravariant base vectors is used. The origin of the local coordinate system {{is located at the}} element centroid (centre of gravity). Hybrid and boundary finite elements of reduced Trefftz type for analysing the <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>structures</b> are also presented. The <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>structure</b> element is a combination of a plate bending element and a plane stress element. ...|$|R
40|$|Inverse {{problems}} such as force identification, impact location, and damage detection have applications in ballistics, foreign object impact of air- and spacecraft, structural health monitoring, damage assessment, and smart structures among other fields. In the particular case of large <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>structures,</b> available inverse solution techniques have analytical and computational limitations which hinder their use. In this work we formulate the inverse problems in the frequency domain to gain the benefits of spectral analysis and its inherent parallelism. A spectral element approach is taken to reformulate the dynamics of a general class of stiffened and <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>structures.</b> The resulting spectral plate elements allow large regions to be modeled exactly using nodes only at the folds. At the same time, the frequency-domain nature of the spectral solution allows efficient solution on massively parallel computers and considerably simplifies deconvolution [...] the essence of our inverse solutions. The three-dimensional spectral element program developed for this work is implemented on MasPar MP- 1 and MP- 2 computers with 16, 384 processors each. Speed-up is shown to be virtually linear {{with the number of}} processors. The combined power of the spectral element method and the massively parallel computers makes practical the solution of inverse problems on <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>structures</b> using experimentally measured acceleration data. Solutions to the inverse problems of force reconstruction and impact location are given for flat plates and a thin-walled box beam. ...|$|R

The objective of the design process is to find the structural layout which minimizes the structural volume and/or the total prestressing force according to the mentioned side and behavioral constraints. The solution of the corresponding non-linear optimization problem is achieved by using a numerical procedure based on the complex method.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{challenging}} space structures frequently {{relies on the}} theory of <b>folded</b> <b>plates.</b> The models are composed of plane facets of which the bending and membrane stiffness are coupled along the folds. In conventional finite element analysis of faceted structures {{the continuity of the}} displacement field is enforced exclusively at the nodes. Since approximate solutions for transverse and for in-plane displacements are not members of the same function space, separation occurs in between the common nodes of adjacent elements. It is shown that the kinematic assumptions of Bernoulli are accounted for this incompatibility along the edges in facet models. A general answer to this problem involves substantial modification of plate and membrane theory, but a straight forward formulation can be derived for simply <b>folded</b> <b>plates,</b> <b>structures,</b> whose <b>folds</b> do not intersect. A broad class of faceted structures, including models of various curved shells, belong to this category and can be calculated consistently. The additional requirements to assure continuity concern the mapping of displacement derivatives on the edges. An appropriate finite facet element provides node and edge-oriented degrees of freedom, whose transformation to system degrees of freedom, depends on the geometric configuration at each node. The concept is implemented using conform triangular elements. To evaluate the new approach, the energy norm of representative structures for refined meshes is calculated.

While it is possible to model full geometric details of the core for a few selected problems, this is unnecessary and unrealistic for larger complex structures under general loadings. In this paper, a continuum constitutive model is proposed as an alternative means of modelling the core. The constitutive model falls within the framework of a compressible rate-independent, anisotropic elastic– plastic solid. The general form of the model is presented, along with algorithmic aspects of its implementation in a finite element code, and selected problems are solved which benchmark the code against existing codes for limiting cases and which illustrate features specific to compress-ible cores.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of theoretical investigations of the large deflection elastic analyses of plates and multiplate systems arid elasto-plastic analysis of plates. The finite strip method has been extended to the geometrically nonlinear analyses of plates (with initial imperfections),and <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>structures</b> including box-girders. Also included are the finite strip solutions ot material and combined material and geometrically nonlinear plate problems. The loading considered includes uniformly distributed, patch type and concentrated loads acting transversely. The formulations of the geometric and combined nonlintar problems are based on the theory of minimum total potential energy. For the sake of convenience independent formulations have been made to deal with individual nonlinearities(i. e. geometric and/or material). in the large deflection elastic analysis of <b>plate</b> and <b>plated</b> <b>structures,</b> both incremental and combined incremental and iterative solution procedures have been adopted. The iterative procedure has been implemented in some special cases. The salient feature of this analysis is characterised by the use of Marguerre 2 ̆ 7 s shallow shell theory in order to analyse plates with or without initial imperfections. Thus, a plate can be simulated by a number of shallow shell strips and the adopted procedure, unlike others, does not require displacement transformations between the local and global axes, which would otherwise be necessary for large deformations or possible initial imperfections. The large deflection elastoplastic analysis is based on von Mise 2 ̆ 7 s yield criterion and the solution procedure employs a piece-wise linear incremental approach. A number of examples related to <b>plates</b> and <b>plated</b> <b>structures</b> have been solved in order to prove the validity of the proposed finite strip method in the area of geometric nonlinearity while its applicability to combined nonlinear problems has been tested by solving some plate bending problems. The variation of deflections and stresses have been plotted against load and compared with existing solutions where available. Elasto-plastic analysis has been carried out on a number of simply supported and fixed plates and the progressive yielding of the structures, over the volume has been traced and the collapse load has been predicted.

40|$|A {{study on}} ‘The Behaviour Of Profiled Steel Sheet <b>Folded</b> <b>Plate</b> <b>Structure</b> With Door Opening’ {{was carried out}} in the Civil Engineering Laboratory. The {{selected}} profiled steel sheets for the testing are namely called ‘Bondek II’ (corrugated steel sheet) and the specimen models was made by BHP Steel Building Products (M) Sdn. Bhd. Shah Alam. The Bondek II steel sheeting is roll-formed from hotdipped, zinc coated, and chromate passivated high-strength grade BHP Zinc Hi- Ten steel strip. Bondek II (corrugated sheet) has sheet thickness t = 1 mm, depth of fold /* = 54 mm, sheet width a = 600 mm and length of models is / = 1000 mm. A compressive test was carried on the Bondek II specimen models. The experimental investigation was on four full-scale models of profiled sheet subjected to in-plane axial compressive loading, P. The model tested included two models without door opening. The size of door opening is 180 mm width and 700 mm height which has been converted from the standard door size of 900 mm width x 2100 mm (3 ft x 7 ft). The results of specimens without opening obtained from the experimental work are used as guide to the specimens with door opening. The parameters measured and determined are lateral deflection, buckling and ultimate load capacity. From the experimental test, the load displacement curve and stress-strain pattern was plotted and identified. From this study, the ultimate load capacity of compressed profiled steel with door opening was identified to be smaller than that without opening. This may be because the opening reduced the carrying capacity of the models. The openings also tend to increase the deflection of the models. The specimen with opening is noticed to buckle much faster than without opening. It was also found that the buckling shape occurred at different location for each specimen. The average ultimate load capacity for the specimens without opening determined from the experimental test carried out is 159. 95 kN and the ultimate load capacity for the specimens with door opening is 109. 15 kN. The average percentage different of ultimate load between specimens without opening and with opening is approximately 32 percent...|$|R
