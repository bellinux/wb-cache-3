50|$|<b>Pipofezine</b> {{has been}} shown to act as a potent {{inhibitor}} of the reuptake of serotonin. In addition to its antidepressant action, <b>pipofezine</b> has sedative effects as well, suggesting antihistamine activity. Other properties such as anticholinergic or antiadrenergic actions are less clear but are likely.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pipofezine</b> (brand name Azafen or Azaphen) is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA) approved in Russia {{for the treatment}} of depression. It was introduced in the late 1960s and is still used today.|$|E
50|$|Pyridazines {{are rare}} in nature, {{possibly}} reflecting {{the scarcity of}} naturally occurring hydrazines, common building blocks for the synthesis of these heterocycles. The pyridazine structure is a popular pharmacophore which is found within a number of herbicides such as credazine, pyridafol and pyridate. It is also found within the structure of several drugs such as cefozopran, cadralazine, minaprine, <b>pipofezine,</b> and hydralazine.|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} <b>pipofezine,</b> tianeptine and chlorprothixene on blood pressure (BP) level and neuropsychological performance in patients with {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and arterial hypertension (HT). Material and methods. Young males with ADHD and HT (n= 58) were included into the study. Patients were split into three treatment groups: group 1 (n= 19) received <b>pipofezine</b> 50 mg/day, group 2 (n= 20) — tianeptine 25 mg/day, group 3 (n= 19) — chlorprothixene 50 mg/day. Clinicopsychopathologic and neurophysiological findings were evaluated at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. BP self-monitoring, analysis of psychiatric disorders severity with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, electroencephalography (EEG) were performed. Results. The positive dynamics of disregulatory-motor hyperactivity, subjective-cognitive and emotional-vegetative components of ADHD was observed. The positive dynamics of neurophysiological parameters (increase in EEG frequencies index) in groups 1 and 2 (from 0. 37 ± 0. 05 to 0. 54 ± 0. 07 and 0. 38 ± 0. 06 to 0. 50 ± 0. 05, respectively, p 0. 05). Conclusion. Four-week usage of the study drugs in adolescents with ADHD and HT had no significant effect on BP levels. <b>Pipofezine</b> and tianeptine showed more pronounced improvement of clinicopsychiatric and neuropsychological performance in comparison with chlorprothixene in patients with ADHD...|$|E
40|$|Aims. Comparative {{efficiency}} and safety analysis of antidepressant agents from different pharmacological classes (<b>pipofezine</b> and venlafaxine) {{in combination with}} carbamazepine for treatment of neuropathic pain (NP) in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy (DP). Materials and methods. We examined 21 male and 27 female patients with painful DP (mean age 54. 3 ± 14. 2 years; mean duration of diabetes mellitus (DM) 8. 9 ± 5. 1 years; mean duration of DP - 3. 8 ± 2. 1 years). DP was diagnosed clinically and by electromyography method. Pain syndrome was assessed with DN 4 questionnaire, visual analogue scale (VAS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire. Psycho- vegetative status was evaluated by Spielberger test with reactive and personal anxiety (RA and PA) assessment and Beck depression inventory. All patients received symptomatic pharmacotherapy with anticonvulsant and antidepressant agent. First group (DP- 1) included 23 patients on carbamazepin and <b>pipofezine.</b> Second group (DP- 2) included 25 patients on carbamazepin and venlafaxine. Results. Following treatment, pain syndrome was completely compensated in 8. 7 % of patients from DP- 1 group and 12. 5 % from DP- 2. Decrease in pain intensity ≥ 50 % from initial level was achieved in 73. 9 % (DP- 1) and 75 % (DP- 2) of cases. Mean pain intensity according to VAS reduced from 5. 2 ± 2. 1 points to 2. 3 ± 1. 4 points (DP- 1) and from 5. 8 ± 2. 3 points (DP- 2) with equal statistical significance (p< 0. 001). Moreover, both groups were characterized by significant decrease in all indexes of McGill Pain Questionnaire. Patients from both groups showed improvement in autonomic disorders, depression, RA and PA. DP- 1 reported lower rate of side effects from the treatment. Predictors of positive treatment outcome (complete compensation or pain intensity reduction ≥ 50 %) {{were found to be}} experience of DM < 9. 1 years, DP < 3. 8 years, depression score < 25 points and pain intensity (VAS) < 5. 6 points. Conclusion. Our study suggests that complex treatment with venlafaxine or <b>pipofezine</b> may be a highly effective therapy for chronic NP and concomitant psychovegetative disorders (autonomous dysfunction, anxiety-depressive disorder), though <b>pipofezine</b> has a more favourable safety profile. Optimal regime for complex treatment is <b>pipofezine</b> 75 mg/day (in three doses) or venlafaxine 800 mg/day in four doses...|$|E
