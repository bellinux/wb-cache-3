5|$|Vertical {{broaching}} machines {{can be designed}} for push broaching, <b>pull-down</b> broaching, pull-up broaching, or surface broaching. Push {{broaching machines}} are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram <b>pull-down</b> machine {{is the most common}} type of broaching machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface broaching is done on a vertical machine.|$|E
5|$|A USB device pulls one of {{the data}} lines high with a 1.5kΩ resistor. This overpowers {{one of the}} <b>pull-down</b> {{resistors}} in the host and leaves the data lines in an idle state called J.|$|E
5|$|The host {{includes}} 15kΩ <b>pull-down</b> resistors on each data line. When no {{device is}} connected, this pulls both data lines low into the so-called single-ended zero state (SE0 in the USB documentation), and indicates a reset or disconnected connection.|$|E
50|$|Chiyotairyū {{has been}} criticized by even his stablemaster for an overuse of slap-downs and <b>pull-downs</b> at the initial charge, which is {{considered}} unfair sumo technique by most. This was especially apparent in his jūryō championship run, where six out of his first eight consecutive wins were won by slap-downs or <b>pull-downs.</b>|$|R
50|$|With other harpsichord/clavichord type instruments, {{there are}} two normal ways of adding pedals; either with pedal <b>pull-downs</b> (usually only in the bass), or with a {{separate}} instrument, with a separate soundboard, below the main keyboard. In the latter case the pedal-instruments allowed for a much greater compass than with <b>pull-downs.</b>|$|R

25|$|Chris Benoit, {{according}} to District Attorney Ballard {{and the city}} sheriff, committed suicide by hanging. Benoit used a weight machine cord to hang himself by creating a noose {{from the end of}} the cord on a <b>pull-down</b> machine from which the bar had been removed. When Benoit released the weights, the move caused his strangulation. Ballard said Benoit was found hanging from the pulley cable.|$|E
25|$|Due to a neck injury, Kokkai {{was forced}} to change his sumo style. He began to fight more on the mawashi, {{gripping}} his opponent's belt, switching from the pushing and thrusting techniques he used earlier in his career. His profile at the Japan Sumo Association still lists tsuki/oshi as his favoured techniques, and his most common winning kimarite was oshi-dashi, or push-out, followed by yori-kiri, or force-out. He was also fond of using the slap-down (hataki-komi) and the <b>pull-down</b> (hiki-otoshi).|$|E
25|$|A Macintosh {{version of}} Temple of Apshai Trilogy was also advertised a month later. In the {{following}} year, it appeared on Amiga and Atari ST. The Amiga, Atari ST and Macintosh versions were ported by Westwood Studios. Company co-founder Louis Castle stated {{in an interview}} with Computer & Video Games that his studio wanted to change the gameplay to real-time, but this was rejected by the publisher. The 16-bit versions introduced a new mouse-controlled interface where commands are selected from <b>pull-down</b> menus, but could also be controlled with the keyboard. The room descriptions are contained in the program here, and can also be accessed through a menu.|$|E
40|$|Summary: hand {{orientation}} (supinated, neutral, pronated) and grip width {{are commonly}} varied during pull-ups and lat <b>pull-downs</b> {{in an attempt}} to focus the training on specific muscle groups or to ensure that the movement is specific to the sporting action. the aim of this article was to identify if varying grip width and hand orientation effects muscle activity during pull-ups and lat <b>pull-downs.</b> it has been demonstrated that using rotating handles during pull-ups or using a pronated grip during lat <b>pull-downs</b> tends to result in the greatest activation of the latissimus dorsi, with no difference in latissimus dorsi activity between grip widths...|$|R

25|$|In January 1981, Steve Jobs {{completely}} {{took over}} the Macintosh project. Jobs {{and a number of}} Apple engineers visited Xerox PARC in December 1979, three months after the Lisa and Macintosh projects had begun. After hearing about the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC from former Xerox employees like Raskin, Jobs negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The final Lisa and Macintosh operating systems use concepts from the Xerox Alto, but many elements of the graphical user interface were created by Apple including the menu bar, <b>pull-down</b> menus, and the concepts of drag and drop and direct manipulation.|$|E
25|$|When Tokitenkū {{began his}} sumo career he weighed around , but he gained weight {{steadily}} and reached about , {{average for the}} top division. He favoured a migi-yotsu grip on the mawashi, {{with his left hand}} outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms. His most common winning technique was yori-kiri, or force out, although he also relied on <b>pull-down</b> techniques such as hataki-komi and hiki-otoshi. He was fond of throwing moves (nage). He was very adept at using tripping techniques which he had gained from his experience in judo, winning 17 career bouts by uchigake (inside leg trip). He also used the extremely rare trip nimaigeri (ankle kicking twist down) on eleven occasions, although he was not credited with the technique in the top division until May 2011 in a win over Shōtenrō. He also appeared to employ it to defeat ōzeki Kotoōshū in March 2007, but the kimarite was given as shitatenage (underarm throw) instead.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk <b>pull-down</b> handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E

50|$|The term {{pop-up book}} is often applied to any {{three-dimensional}} or movable book, although properly the umbrella term movable book covers pop-ups, transformations, tunnel books, volvelles, flaps, pull-tabs, pop-outs, <b>pull-downs,</b> and more, {{each of which}} performs in a different manner. Also included, because they employ the same techniques, are three-dimensional greeting cards.|$|R
500|$|While complimenting its {{performance}} and other unique features, The Verge believed that LG was {{trying too hard}} {{to compete with the}} Samsung Galaxy S4 by closely imitating its design, specifications, and emphasis on features instead of differentiating itself through further innovations. TechRadar also praised {{its performance}} and display quality, but considered the design of the G2 itself to be [...] "dull", and believed that while offering many options for advanced users, LG's skinned version of Android 4.2 was too complex for [...] "casual" [...] users (especially noting its notification <b>pull-down,</b> where roughly half the screen is taken up by options).|$|E
500|$|Parisian Restaurant (set number 10243) is {{the ninth}} {{set in the}} Modular Building line and was {{released}} in January 2014. [...] This set contains 2469 pieces and has a fully stocked, blue and white tiled kitchen with tableware {{as well as an}} apartment with <b>pull-down</b> bed, kitchenette and fireplace. On the top floor is the artist’s studio that includes a cast iron heater, easel, paintbrush and two works of art. Outside, on the second floor, stairs lead down to the roof terrace lined with hanging lanterns and flowers above a patio for diners. This set also includes hard-to-find white croissants and bricks in olive green, dark blue and dark red. Advanced exterior details include facade with croissant detailing, sidewalk, bench, scooter and even a dumpster and trash can at the back.|$|E
500|$|Nexus {{devices are}} {{considered}} the [...] "flagship" [...] Android devices and {{are the first to}} receive updates to the operating system. As such, the Nexus7 was the first device to have been shipped with Android version 4.1 ("Jelly Bean"). Jelly Bean was an incremental upgrade from version 4.0 ("Ice Cream Sandwich"), incorporating software improvements to the <b>pull-down</b> notifications bar and camera, and changes to the homescreen. With Jelly Bean, Google significantly reduced latency (lag), one negative aspect of Android compared to Apple's iOS operating system. It does so by employing [...] "vsync timing" [...] and triple buffering, improving touch responsiveness, and programming the display to run at 60 frames per second; this initiative was called [...] "Project Butter". The Nexus 7 was the first device to incorporate Google Chrome for Android as the standard web browser; all previous iterations of the Android OS used an unnamed application simply called Browser.|$|E
5000|$|The {{running rigging}} {{for the modern}} junk rig {{can be divided into}} two groups—the [...] "pull ups" [...] and the [...] "pull downs." [...] This is {{important}} because the action of hauling one line in a group will be resisted by the opposite group. For example, when raising the sail via the halyard, the <b>pull-downs</b> must be uncleated and free to run.|$|R
40|$|Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation guides many molecular interactions for cellular functions. SCIMP is a transmembrane adaptor protein (TRAP) family member that mediates selective proinflammatory cytokine responses generated by pathogen-activated Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways in macrophages. TLR activation triggers SCIMP phosphorylation and selective phosphorylation of distinct tyrosine residues on this adaptor {{offers the potential}} for regulating or biasing inflammatory responses. To analyze site-specific phosphorylation events, we developed three probes based on the SH 2 domains of known SCIMP effectors, and used them for <b>pull-downs</b> from macrophage extracts. CRISPR-mediated SCIMP-deficient RAW 264. 7 macrophage-like cells were reconstituted with various phosphorylation-deficient (Y 58 F, Y 96 F, Y 120 F) SCIMPs, and used to demonstrate the specificity of LPS/TLR 4 -induced, site-specific phosphorylation of SCIMP for the temporal recruitment of the effectors Grb 2, Csk and SLP 65. Our findings reveal potential for differential SCIMP phosphorylation and specific effectors to influence TLR signaling and inflammatory programs. Furthermore, the use of Csk-SH 2 <b>pull-downs</b> to identify additional known and new Csk targets in LPS-activated macrophages reveals the wider utility of our SH 2 probes...|$|R
50|$|Hokutōriki relied almost {{exclusively}} on pushing and slapping techniques, with {{over a third of}} his wins coming by oshidashi, or push-out. He was usually defeated if his opponents managed to grab hold of his mawashi or belt. He often used henka, or sidestepping, to wrong-foot his opponents, and was adept at <b>pull-downs</b> and slap-downs. However, in the January 2008 tournament he was himself a victim of the henka tactic on three consecutive days, slipping from a score of 6-5 to 6-8.|$|R

40|$|Systematic {{analysis}} of the RNA-protein interactome requires robust and scalable methods. We here show the combination of two completely orthogonal, generic techniques to identify RNA-protein interactions: PAR-CLIP reveals a collection of RNAs bound to a protein whereas SILAC-based RNA <b>pull-downs</b> identify a group of proteins bound to an RNA. We investigated binding sites for five different proteins (IGF 2 BP 1 - 3, QKI and PUM 2) exhibiting different binding patterns. We report near perfect agreement between the two approaches. Nevertheless, they are non-redundant, and ideally complement each other to map the RNA-protein interaction network...|$|R

50|$|Roho was a yotsu-sumo specialist, who {{preferred}} a migi-yotsu, or left hand outside, right hand inside {{grip on his}} opponent's mawashi. His favourite techniques were yorikiri (force out) and uwatenage (overarm throw), although he also relied heavily on henka (side stepping) and <b>pull-downs.</b> Hataki-komi, the slap-down, was his second most commonly used technique after yorikiri. Henka in particular is looked down upon by sumo purists, and Roho believed that his failure to receive a special prize from the Sumo Association in the March 2005 tournament, despite winning eleven bouts, was due to use of henka in his victory over Kotomitsuki.|$|R

2500|$|Polyhistidine-tagging {{can be used}} {{to detect}} protein-protein {{interactions}} {{in the same way as}} a <b>pull-down</b> assay. [...] However, this technique is generally considered to be less sensitive, and also restricted by some of the more finicky aspects of this technique. [...] For example, reducing conditions cannot be used, EDTA and many types of detergents cannot be used. Recent advances in dual polarisation interferometry is amenable to EDTA and a wider use of reagents, and the use of such site-specific tags greatly simplifies the direct measurement of associated conformational change.|$|E
2500|$|The four cars {{built in}} 1991–92 by Gomaco {{have the same}} red-and-cream colors as the {{original}} 1904 cars and include most of the latter's features, such as padded rattan seats with reversible backrests, carved oak interiors, brass handrails, <b>pull-down</b> window shades and doors {{which can only be}} manually opened and closed, by the motorman (operator) or conductor. [...] They were given fleet numbers 511–514 as a continuation of the earlier cars' number series, and in tribute to them. [...] On the front of the replica Vintage Trolleys is painted a slogan that once adorned the ends of their antecedents, See Portland from Council Crest, a reference to the views of the city available from the route's upper terminus, atop Council Crest. [...] The old trolleys had all-wood bodies, whereas the replicas have steel frames, concealed by wood, for better safety and durability. [...] Because they would be sharing the same tracks as MAX, they also were equipped with a more modern style of current collector to draw power from the overhead wires, a cross between a pantograph (the type of collector used by MAX) and a bow collector, instead of the trolley poles which the city's original trolley cars used.|$|E
5000|$|Repeating the {{experiment}} by targeting different {{members of the}} protein complex allows the researcher to double-check the result. Each round of <b>pull-downs</b> should result in the recovery of both the original known protein {{as well as other}} previously identified members of the complex (and even new additional members). By repeating the immunoprecipitation in this way, the researcher verifies that each identified member of the protein complex was a valid identification. If a particular protein can only be recovered by targeting one of the known members but not by targeting other of the known members then that protein's status {{as a member of the}} complex may be subject to question.|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleFunctional roles for both coding and non-coding RNA molecules have been increasingly appreciated in a variety of biologic processes, including gene regulation, molecular trafficking, and protein translation [1 - 4].

Strategies to identify multiple RNAs binding an individual protein of interest have advanced further than those designed to identify multiple proteins binding a given RNA. Examples of the former include immunopre-cipitation followed by microarray hybridization (RIP-Chip) or sequencing (RIP-Seq) [8, 14, 15].

40|$|The post-translational {{modification}} of histones regulates many cellular processes, including transcription, replication and DNA repair. A {{large number of}} combinations of {{post-translational modification}}s are possible. This cipher {{is referred to as}} the histone code. Many of the enzymes that lay down this code have been identified. However, so far, few code-reading proteins have been identified. Here, we describe a protein-array approach for identifying methyl-specific interacting proteins. We found that not only chromo domains but also tudor and MBT domains bind to methylated peptides from the amino-terminal tails of histones H 3 and H 4. Binding specificity observed on the protein-domain microarray was corroborated using peptide <b>pull-downs,</b> surface plasma resonance and far western blotting. Thus, our studies expose tudor and MBT domains as new classes of methyl-lysine-binding protein modules, and also demonstrates that protein-domain microarrays are powerful tools for the identification of new domain types that recognize histone modifications...|$|R
