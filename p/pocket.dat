5|$|Patterns {{of genetic}} {{variation}} in the camas <b>pocket</b> gopher have been studied. Although there are no subspecies, there is substantial genetic diversity within the species. Its genetic patterns are consistent with limited inbreeding within specific populations. This is similar to patterns described in Botta's <b>pocket</b> gopher and the southern <b>pocket</b> gopher, {{both of which are}} members of the same genus. However, it contrasts with patterns noted in Baird's <b>pocket</b> gopher and the plains <b>pocket</b> gopher, members of a separate genus, Geomys, which showed a higher degree of inbreeding.|$|E

For example, if one player <b>pockets</b> the 1 ball, and another <b>pockets</b> the 5 ball, they become teammates, competing against players three and four, who are also now teammates. If a single player <b>pockets</b> the 1 and 5 balls, this player is partnered with the player who <b>pockets</b> the 8 ball.

40|$|In iron {{selenide}} superconductors only electron-like Fermi <b>pockets</b> survive, {{challenging the}} S^± pairing {{based on the}} quasi-nesting between the electron and hole Fermi <b>pockets</b> (as in iron arsenides). By functional renormalization group study we show that an in-phase S-wave pairing on the electron <b>pockets</b> (S^++_ee) is realized. The pairing mechanism involves two competing driving forces: The strong C-type spin fluctuations cause attractive pair scattering between and within electron <b>pockets</b> via Cooperon excitations on the virtual hole <b>pockets,</b> while the G-type spin fluctuations cause repulsive pair scattering. The latter effect is however weakened by the hybridization splitting of the electron <b>pockets.</b> The resulting S^++_ee-wave pairing symmetry is consistent with experiments. We further propose that the quasiparticle interference pattern in scanning tunneling microscopy and the Andreev reflection in out-of-plane contact tunneling are efficient probes of in-phase versus anti-phase S-wave pairing on the electron <b>pockets.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
