These equations represent the total lateral earth pressure. The first term represents the non-cohesive contribution and the second term the cohesive contribution.

25|$|In 1948, Albert Caquot (1881–1976) and Jean Kerisel (1908–2005) {{developed}} an advanced theory that modified Muller-Breslau's equations {{to account for}} a non-planar rupture surface. They used a logarithmic spiral to represent the rupture surface instead. This modification is extremely important for passive earth pressure where there is soil-wall friction. Mayniel and Muller-Breslau's equations are unconservative in this situation and are dangerous to apply. For the active <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the logarithmic spiral rupture surface provides a negligible difference compared to Muller-Breslau. These equations are too complex to use, so tables or computers are used instead.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{the design}} of wall {{cladding}} and components are based on provisions provided in building codes, such as ASCE 7 for the United States. These codes provide <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> based on the tributary area, position on {{the building and the}} building category. For ASCE 7, low-rise and high-rise buildings are separated by an artificial boundary at 60 ft. (18. 2 m). The reasoning for this artificial boundary is unclear. This work investigates the wall <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> for various buildings, based on aspect ratios, motivated by the large differences in design <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> for low-rise and high-rise buildings. For this study, a systematic wind tunnel study was performed examining a square plan building with different aspect (i. e., height-to-width ratio) ratios. The wind profile and turbulence intensities were examined to determine the model-scale appropriate for the multiple building heights. Once the model-scale was selected, height configurations of low-rise (H/WH/W 3 ̆e 1) buildings were tested. A statistical analysis was performed on these <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> and these values were converted to GCp (gust factored <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients)</b> values, as a function of (full-scale) area. The <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> were compared to studies found in the literature to ensure the reliability of the data. Pressure patterns were observed and the impact of the wind directions was analyzed. Cladding element position and <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> were compared for the different buildings. The <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> were compared to ASCE 7. This study concluded that the aspect ratio affected the length of the wall separation bubble, with smaller aspect ratios having more compressed separation bubbles. For positive <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients,</b> low-rise buildings have different zones of pressure while high-rise buildings are more uniform. For negative pressure (i. e., suction) coefficients, the patterns continually vary with the different aspect ratios. The study showed that there were some aspects of ASCE 7 that were not in good agreement with the data...|$|R

2500|$|The {{coefficient}} of lateral earth pressure, K, {{is defined as}} the ratio of the horizontal effective stress, σ’h, to the vertical effective stress, σ’v. The effective stress is the intergranular stress calculated by subtracting the pore pressure from the total stress as described in soil mechanics.

The minimum stable value of K is called the active earth <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Ka; the active earth pressure is obtained, for example,when a retaining wall moves away from the soil.

Data analysis schemes are discussed to obtain <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> at constant shear rate and at constant shear stress. It is shown that the constant shear stress <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> have the advantage of being shear stress independent for the three polymers. The constant shear rate <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients,</b> on the other hand, turn out to depend on shear rate, which makes them less suitable for use, e. g., in process simulations. In addition to the commonly used superposition method, a direct calculation method for the <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> is tested. Values obtained from both methods are equivalent. However, the latter requires less experimental and calculational efforts.

40|$|Wind {{is one of}} the {{significant}} forces of nature that must be considered in the design of buildings. The actual behavior of wind is influenced not only by the surface (or boundary-layer) conditions, but also by the geometry of the building. All sorts of turbulent effects occur, especially at building corners, edges, roof eaves. Some of these effects are accounted for by the wind <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Wind <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> are determined experimentally by testing scale model buildings in atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels. In this study, a series of wind tunnel tests with scaled building models were conducted to determine the wind <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> that are applicable to monosloped and sawtooth roofs.

The experimental results {{have been used to}} evaluate various thermophysical properties such as thermal <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> up to 150 MPa with the use of density and temperature data at various pressures. New parameters of the linear isotherm regularity, the so-called LIR equation of state, are used to calculate of thermal <b>pressure</b> <b>coefficients</b> of n-Pentadecane (C 15), n-Heptadecane (C 17), n-octadecane (C 18) and n-nonadecane (C 19) dense fluids.

Extrapolation of the linearized subsonic theory into the mixed subsonic-supersonic flow region fails to predict a rearward movement of the negative pressure-coefficient peak which occurs after the critical stream Mach number has been attained.
