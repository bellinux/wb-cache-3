500|$|During {{the guerrilla}} war, Ian Smith {{referred}} to Mugabe as [...] "the apostle of Satan". George Shire expressed {{the view that}} there was [...] "a strong racist animus" [...] against Mugabe within Zimbabwe, and that this had typically been overlooked by Western media representations of the country. Mugabe has himself been accused of racism; John Sentamu, the Uganda-born Archbishop of York in the United Kingdom, called Mugabe [...] "the worst kind of racist dictator," [...] for having [...] "targeted the whites for their apparent riches". They have been denounced as racist against Zimbabwe's white minority. Tutu stated that Mugabe became [...] "increasingly insecure, he's hitting out. One just wants to weep. It's very sad." [...] South African President Nelson Mandela was also critical of Mugabe, referring {{to him as a}} politician who [...] "despise the very <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>put</b> [...] in power and think it's a privilege to be there for eternity".|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{is a slow}} tempo {{song that}} blends pop and R beats. Additionally, it {{incorporates}} its sound from several instruments including the violin, piano and organ. The ballad {{is set in the}} signature of common time, with a slowly tempo of 52 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major, with Carey's vocals spanning almost three octaves, from the low note of A2 to the high note of F#5. Although the song was written by Carey and Diane Warren, the latter does not usually share songwriting credit. Although there were no conflicts during the recording process, the pair had minor disagreements during the songwriting stages: Carey said that Warren liked to repeat lyrical phrases often. The second song that Carey and Warren wrote together was [...] "There for Me" [...] which was released as a B-side to the [...] "Never Too Far/Hero Medley" [...] charity single Carey recorded in late 2001. The song's protagonist details the struggles of dealing with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>put</b> you down, and how to overcome these struggles through faith, courage, and the power of God. Carey explains in the song's lyrics how although people can try to make her feel down and depressed, no matter what happens, she can't let them win: [...] "There's a light in me that shines brightly. They can try but they can't take that away from me." ...|$|E

The MDC alleged that, out of 20 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>put</b> up posters, three had been killed and five were missing, while four had been arrested and the remainder had gone into hiding. Meanwhile, in the Sunday Mail, Chinamasa emphasised the critical nature of the second round for ZANU-PF, saying that [...] "we are fighting with our backs to the wall".

2500|$|The Irish electorate's {{rejection}} of the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon on 12 June 2008 was viewed by some media and political observers as a protest against Cowen and his government. [...] The Irish Independent called the failed referendum's aftermath the government's [...] "biggest political crisis in decades." [...] Columnist Brendan O'Connor called the outcome [...] "a humiliating failure for Cowen and the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>put</b> him there." [...] The Taoiseach himself arguably dealt a damaging blow to his own side when, on 12 May 2008, he admitted in a radio interview {{that he had not}} read the Treaty of Lisbon in its entirety. The treaty was eventually approved by Irish voters when the successful Twenty-eighth Amendment of the constitution was approved in the second Lisbon referendum, held in October 2009.|$|E
2500|$|A devoted fan {{of heavy}} metal, Cox {{considers}} himself {{more of a}} comedian than a disc jockey. [...] The show itself rapidly covers a range of topics in a comedic format, from major current events to obscure pop culture; regular segments like [...] "Sperm News", [...] "Why Florida Sucks", and [...] "Are You Smarter Than a Dumbass?" [...] typify the show's irreverent style. [...] Cox also frequently takes calls from listeners, and often interviews guests in studio and over the phone. [...] During a June 19, 2012 interview with Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, the show broke news of the delayed release for Music from Another Dimension!, the band's first studio album in eight years. [...] On February 9, 2010, the show aired [...] "Parma State of Mind", both a parody of the Jay-Z/Alicia Keys hit [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] {{and a way of}} continuing the Northeast Ohio tradition of poking fun at the Cleveland suburb. [...] Dean DePiero, then mayor of Parma, criticized the song and its accompanying YouTube video: [...] "It's pretty sick. ... The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>put</b> it together aren't even smart enough to know where our city boundaries are." [...] The show also drew national attention after holding a book burning party for Fifty Shades of Grey on July 8, 2012.|$|E

6000|$|But {{let us not}} forestall. The {{elephant}} and rhinoceros {{were the}} only {{members of the community}} that had perished on the voyage. At first the elephant had been dreaded by many, but by degrees it won the confidence and affection of all. Houses innumerable had been built for it on deck, but the sagacious animal had a rooted antipathy to restraint. No sort of den, however strongly formed, could hold him long. The first structures were so ridiculously disproportioned to his strength as to be demolished at once. On being put into the first [...] "house that Jack built," [...] he looked at it demurely for at least five minutes, as if he were meditating on the probable intentions of the silly <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>put</b> him there, but neither by look nor otherwise did he reveal the conclusions to which he came. His intentions, however, were not long of being made known. He placed his great side against the den; there was a slow but steady rending of timbers, as if the good ship herself were breaking up, a burst of laughter from the men followed, and [...] "Sambo" [...] was free. When the succeeding houses were built so strong that his side availed not, he brought his wonderful patience and his remarkable trunk to bear on them, and picked them to pieces bit by bit. Then ropes were tried, but he snapped weak ropes and untied strong ones.|$|E

6000|$|To {{return from}} this digression. When I {{asserted}} that the Yahoos were the only governing animals in my country, which my master said was altogether past his conception, he desired to know, “whether we had Houyhnhnms among us, and what was their employment?” I told him, “we had great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in winter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where Yahoo servants were employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet, serve them with food, and make their beds.” “I understand you well,” said my master: “it is now very plain, from all you have spoken, that whatever share of reason the Yahoos pretend to, the Houyhnhnms are your masters; I heartily wish our Yahoos would be so tractable.” I begged “his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further, because I was very certain that the account he expected from me would be highly displeasing.” But he insisted in commanding me {{to let him know}} the best and the worst. I told him “he should be obeyed.” I owned “that the Houyhnhnms among us, whom we called horses, were the most generous and comely animals we had; that they excelled in strength and swiftness; and when they belonged to persons of quality, were employed in travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were treated with much kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or became foundered in the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all kind of drudgery till they died; after which their skins were stripped, and sold for what they were worth, and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey. But the common race of horses had not so good fortune, being kept by farmers and carriers, and other mean <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>put</b> them to greater labour, and fed them worse.” I described, as well as I could, our way of riding; the shape and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of harness and wheels. I added, “that we fastened plates of a certain hard substance, called iron, at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their hoofs from being broken by the stony ways, on which we often travelled.” ...|$|E
60|$|I found {{afterward}} that Mount Vernon was accessible, and I rode thither {{with some}} {{officers of the}} staff of General Heintzelman, whose outside pickets were stationed beyond the old place. I certainly {{should not have been}} well pleased had I been forced to leave the country without seeing the house in which Washington had lived and died. Till lately this place was owned and inhabited by one of the family, a Washington, descended from a brother of the general's; but it has now become the property of the country, under the auspices of Mr. Everett, by whose exertions was raised the money with which it was purchased. It is a long house, of two stories, built, I think, chiefly of wood, with a veranda, or rather long portico, attached to the front, which looks upon the river. There are two wings, or sets of outhouses, containing the kitchen and servants' rooms, which were joined by open wooden verandas to the main building; but one of these verandas has gone, under the influence of years. By these a semicircular sweep is formed before the front door, which opens away from the river, and toward the old prim gardens, in which, we were told, General Washington used to take much delight. There is nothing very special about the house. Indeed, as a house, it would now be found comfortless and inconvenient. But the ground falls well down to the river, and the timber, if not fine, is plentiful and picturesque. The chief interest of the place, however, is in the tomb of Washington and his wife. It must be understood that it was a common practice throughout the States to make a family burying-ground in any secluded spot on the family property. I have not unfrequently come across these in my rambles, and in Virginia I have encountered small, unpretending gravestones under a shady elm, dated as lately as eight or ten years back. At Mount Vernon there is now a cemetery of the Washington family; and there, in an open vault--a vault open, but guarded by iron grating--is the great man's tomb, and by his side the tomb of Martha his wife. As I stood there alone, with no one by to irritate me by assertions of the man's absolute supremacy, I acknowledged that I had come to the final resting-place of a great and good man,--of a man whose patriotism was, I believe, an honest feeling, untinged by any personal ambition of a selfish nature. That he was pre-eminently a successful man may have been due chiefly to the excellence of his cause, and the blood and character of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>put</b> him forward as their right arm in their contest; but that he did not mar that success by arrogance, or destroy the brightness of his own name by personal aggrandizement, is due to a noble nature and to the calm individual excellence of the man.|$|E
