Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use <b>phoresis</b> to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the primary}} ways niche-sharing species can coexist is the competition-colonization trade-off. In other words, species that are better {{competitors}} will be specialists, whereas species that are better colonizers {{are more likely to}} be generalists. Host-parasite models are effective ways of examining this relationship, using host transfer events. There seem to be two places where the ability to colonize differs in ecologically closely related species. In feather lice, Bush and Clayton provided some verification of this by showing two closely related genera of lice are nearly equal in their ability to colonize new host pigeons once transferred. Harbison [...] continued this line of thought by investigating whether the two genera differed in their ability to transfer. This research focused primarily on determining how colonization occurs and why wing lice are better colonizers than body lice. Vertical transfer is the most common occurrence, between parent and offspring, and is much-studied and well understood. Horizontal transfer is difficult to measure, but in lice seems to occur via <b>phoresis</b> or the [...] "hitchhiking" [...] of one species on another. Harbison found that body lice are less adept at <b>phoresis</b> and excel competitively, whereas wing lice excel in colonization.|$|E

50|$|In biology, an opportunist {{organism}} {{is generally}} {{defined as a}} species that can live and thrive in variable environmental conditions, and sustain itself {{from a number of}} different food sources, or can rapidly take advantage of favorable conditions when they arise, because the species is behaviorally sufficiently flexible. Such species can for example postpone reproduction, or stay dormant, until conditions make growth and reproduction possible.

40|$|The {{dispersal}} of plant-feeding mites can occur involuntarily, through transportation of infested plant parts, or voluntarily, by walking to new plant parts or to suitable spots where biotic (<b>phoresis)</b> or abiotic (wind, agricultural tools, etc.) factors carry them over long distances.

We monitored the main options of dispersal that occurred in scale insects: wandering of first-instar nymphs (crawlers), active dispersal by ant workers, <b>phoresis</b> on colony-founding queen ants, and passive dispersal by wind. Results showed that A. tenella workers are actively involved in the transport and dissemination of scale crawlers. When ants were excluded, crawlers could move by themselves for a short distance to find the host plant. In the presence of ants, crawlers were transported by ant workers for longer distance across the bridge and established on scale-free plants. Scales transport increased with the duration of the experiment and ant density. Neither a case of <b>phoresis</b> nor dispersal by wind was recorded, suggesting that passive dispersal is rare.

40|$|<b>Phoresis,</b> {{the drift}} of {{particles}} induced by scalar gradients in a flow, can result in an effective compressibility, bringing together or repelling particles from each other. Here, we ask whether this effect can affect the transport of particles in a turbulent flow.

Phenomenological considerations lead to simple predictions for the mean separation between particles, which are consistent with results of direct numerical simulations.

Tracking {{the origin of the}} iflavirus suggested the association of this virus with the occlusion bodies of the baculovirus. Here we investigated the effect of this association on the stability and infectivity of both viruses. A reduction in baculovirus pathogenicity, without affecting its infectivity and productivity, was observed when associated with the iflavirus. In contrast, viral association increased the infectivity of the iflavirus and its resistance to ultraviolet radiation and high temperature, two of the main factors affecting virus stability in the field. In addition, electron microscopy analysis revealed the presence of particles resembling iflavirus virions inside the occlusion bodies of the baculovirus, suggesting the possible co-occlusion of both viruses.

The goal of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of a method that proposes to increase cutaneous permeation of diclofenac sodium by using CLP technique. The influence on permeation was evaluated ex vivo, using Franz cell and human skin obtained from cosmetic surgery. The results were evaluated using statistical methods and data exploratory analysis: clusters, k-means and Principal Component Analysis. The results showed a larger increase in the concentration of diclofenac sodium in the dermis with the use of laser. In all samples (with or without laser application) it was observed that skin surface showed an amount of diclofenac sodium {{and that there was no}} active passage to the receptor liquid, suggesting that diclofenac sodium was not absorbed.
