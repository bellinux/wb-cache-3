40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{examines}} the effect of mean stress on the fatigue behaviour of very hard (Rockwell C 60) steels (AISI 8822, 8620, 9310, and cold-worked <b>pre-stressing</b> <b>wire).</b> In the mean stress tests, the minimum stress in the fatigue cycle was varied from test to test over a range from - 1200 MPa to a value approaching the true fracture stress of each material. The results are not adequately explained by current theories for the effect of mean stress on fatigue behaviour {{in the region of}} compressive mean stresses. All current theories suggest that the maximum stress at the fatigue limit decreases with decreasing minimum stress. The results of this study shows that instead of continuing to decrease with decreasing minimum stress the maximum stress at the fatigue limit remains constant indicating an insensitivity to the minimum stress in the fatigue cycle for minimum stresses below the value in a fully reversed fatigue test. The theory proposed by the author corrects this error by maintaining the maximum stress at the fatigue limit constant with decreasing minimum stress in the region of negative mean stresses. The results are of interest to designers of components in which high negative residual stresses are introduced into materials hardened by, for example, carburizing, nitriding, or induction hardening to improve the fatigue strength of components. The present work allows considerably higher design stresses for operating stresses in the negative mean stress region than previous theories permit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{the fire}} {{resistance}} performance of high-strength concrete columns was evaluated {{to see the}} influence of lateral confinement reinforcement with wire ropes for improving ductility, fire resistance reinforcement with fiber cocktail and load ratio. For this, loaded fire test was conducted under ISO 834 standard fire condition. The axial ductility of the 60 MPa high-strength concrete column reinforced with <b>pre-stressed</b> <b>wire</b> ropes was improved and its fire resistance performance was also improved by 23 % compared with its counterpart without wire ropes. The appropriate load for the 60 MPa concrete column reinforced with wire ropes {{was found to be}} 70 % of design load. The fire resistance performance of the 100 MPa high-strength concrete column reinforced with <b>pre-stressed</b> <b>wire</b> ropes and fiber-cocktail was improved as much as 4 times compared with that reinforced with tie bars only. The appropriate load for the 100 MPa columns was found to be less than 70 % of design load in order for the columns to secure required fire resistance performance...|$|R

The general purpose finite element package, ANSYS 10, is employed for the numerical analyses.

50|$|In the United States, {{pre-stressed}} concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP) {{account for a}} vast majority of water transmission mains. Due to their large diameters, failures of PCCP are usually catastrophic and affect large populations. Approximately 19000 mi of PCCP have been installed between 1940 and 2006. Corrosion in the form of hydrogen embrittlement has been blamed for the gradual deterioration of the <b>pre-stressing</b> <b>wires</b> in many PCCP lines. Over the past decade, CFRPs have been utilized to internally line PCCP, resulting in a fully structural strengthening system. Inside a PCCP line, the CFRP liner acts as a barrier that controls the level of strain experienced by the steel cylinder in the host pipe. The composite liner enables the steel cylinder to perform within its elastic range, to ensure the pipeline's long-term performance is maintained. CFRP liner designs are based on strain compatibility between the liner and host pipe.|$|R

The {{mechanical}} behavior of four carbon nanotube (CNT) wires, comprised of 1 -yarn, 30 -yarn, 60 -yarn, and 100 -yarn, was investigated under constant tension at two loading rates of 0. 02 mm/sec and 2 mm/sec. Tests were conducted with both asfabricated and <b>pre-stressed</b> <b>wires.</b> The ultimate tenacity or apparent ultimate tensile strength of all four wires {{was found to be}} independent of loading rate, with those for the single-yarn wire about twice those of the multiple-yarn wires. Strain at a given stress level and failure strain of the multiple-yarn <b>wires</b> before <b>pre-stressing</b> were almost an order of magnitude larger than those for the single-yarn wire, and this difference was reduced considerably after pre-stressing. The failure mechanisms of 1 -yarn wire or twisted individual yarns in multiple-strand wires involved ductile (necking) deformation and fibrillar breakage. Inner yarns in multiple-yarn wires initially failed at the same location, followed by outer yarns failing at different locations. Additionally, sliding occurred between individual yarns, and twisting of the yarns accompanied by surface wear took place in the multiple-yarn wires, which contributed to their failure at a lower load compared to the single-yarn wire.

40|$|Abstract. The {{resisting}} shear strengthening {{technology of}} existing reinforced concrete bridges {{as an important}} research topic {{in the field of}} old bridges, play an important significance to improve the mechanical properties of old bridges and reduce security incidents. Based on comparative test analysis on two basic beams and twelve reinforced concrete beams strengthened with external <b>pre-stressed</b> <b>wire</b> rope, the influence of the shear strengthening effect was studied systematically caused by the original beam design parameters and the spacing of wire rope, in the meantime the strengthening mechanism was analyzed. Research results showed that the shear capacity of the strengthened beams was improved, because the development of cracks was not only effectively limited, but also stirrup strain was reduced, and yield load was put off. Along with the increasing of the ratio of original beams longitudinal reinforcement and the ratio of stirrup,and the concrete grade, as well as the decreasing of spacing of external wire rope, the stirrups strain were decreasing and the shear capacity of strengthened beams increased. With the spacing of external wire rope decreasing, the diagonal crack resistance of the strengthened beams increased. The research results can provide reference for the design and research on shear strengthening of bridges...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPre-stressing of masonry {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} building/facility reconstruction methods. In the Czech Republic it is very successful, especially in the Moravian-Silesian Region, which is subject to a considerable amount of disturbances of buildings/facilities due to undermining. Pre-stressing in masonry can be achieved by means of steel wire ropes or rods. These steel elements are inserted into the pre-milled grooves, which may be in the external or internal wall face. The ends of the steel elements are clamped into steel angles or special anchors. In these reconstruction methods it is necessary to follow the pre- stressing procedures and technologies. It is important to properly select the pre-stressing anchoring system, appropriate layout and arrangement of <b>pre-stressing</b> <b>wires,</b> <b>pre-stressing</b> procedure and dimension of pre-stressing forces in the individual wires. This contribution deals with experimental measurements of deformations in the place exposed to local load caused by additional pre-stressing. The measurements are taken on a masonry corner built in the laboratory equipment. This laboratory equipment was designed at the Faculty of Civil Engineering VSB – TU Ostrava for measurement of the tri-axial stress-strain conditions in masonry. Two pre-stressing bars are placed in this masonry corner. These bars are at different heights and are anchored to the anchor plates, which transfer pre-stressing forces to the masonry. The specimen for laboratory testing is performed at the actual proportion of 1 : 1. Mathematical modeling of the brick corner is based on the finite element method using ANSYS software and then the results are compared with results of the laboratory tests. On the basis of these results it should be possible to improve the models and come closer to achieving an accurate and at the same time, simple procedure for the design of pre-stressed masonry...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} and numerical {{investigations of the}} static and impact behaviours of railway prestressed concrete sleepers under static and dynamic loads. A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model of a prestressed concrete sleeper was developed using the general purpose finite element package, ANSYS 10. The model was initially validated against static test results. Using SOLID 65 solid element, the compressive crushing of concrete is facilitated using plasticity algorithm while the concrete cracking in tension zone is accommodated by the nonlinear material model. Since the cross section of concrete sleeper is fully pre-stressed, the smeared crack analogy is impracticable. Discrete reinforcement modelling with truss elements, LINK 8, is then more suitable to utilize. The pre-tensioning was modelled using an initial strain in the tendon elements. Perfect bonding between concrete and <b>pre-stressing</b> <b>wires</b> was assumed. Comparison with experimental static load-deflection response is presented for the prestressed concrete sleeper. Through the linkage between ANSYS and LS-Dyna, the finite element model was subsequently extended to account for ballast support and in-situ conditions {{for use in the}} impact analysis. The calibration of the extended model was successfully achieved by using vibration data. Drop-weight impact tests were carried out in the identical setup for verifications of the impact model. Validations were conducted where possible. Very good agreements were found between drop impact experiments and numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the modeling, {{numerical}} simulation and experimental {{validation of the}} deformation of a composite cantilever beam actuated by shape memory alloy (SMA) wires are presented and discussed. The structural model incorporates a number of non-classical features such as laminated construction and anisotropy of constituent material layers, transverse shear deformability, distortion of the normals, and fulfillment of interfacial shear traction continuity requirement. Suitable for use in standard finite element codes, a numerical procedure is developed for solving the geometric non-linearity of the host structure and the hysteretic non-linearity of SMA wires, which {{is based upon the}} updated Lagrangian formulation. The application concerns an elastomeric beam with embedded and <b>pre-stressed</b> SMA <b>wires</b> at an offset from the neutral axis, which act as large bending actuators resulting from the thermally induced reversible transformation strains.

40|$|Background Finite element (FE) {{models have}} become a {{standard}} pre-clinical tool to study biomechanics of spine and are used to simulate and evaluate different strategies in scoliosis treatment: examine their efficacy {{as well as the}} effect of different implant design parameters. The goal {{of this study is to}} investigate, in a system of rods and laminar wires, the effect of the number of <b>wires</b> and their <b>pre-stress</b> on whole spine stiffness. Methods A generic FE model was developed to represent a full human spine, including vertebrae, intervertebral discs, ligaments, facet and costovertebral joints, and ribcage. Intervertebral discs were modeled with 3 D rebar elements with linear elastic material properties. Vertebrae, ribs, sternum, facet joints, cartilage and endplates were modeled with brick elements, and costal muscles with shell elements with linear elastic properties. Furthermore, ligaments were modeled with truss elements with nonlinear hypo-elastic properties. The spine model was instrumented from T 7 to T 12 with rods and wires modeled as titanium. Nonlinear contact properties were defined for rib neck-vertebra, transverse processes-rib and facet joint sets. The FE model was loaded in flexion and the whole spine instantaneous stiffness was calculated for different <b>wire</b> <b>pre-stressing</b> levels (0. 1 to 2 MPa). Similar analyses were performed with changed numbers of wires and whole spine stiffness was calculated. Results The results show that with increasing the pre-stress level the whole spine instantaneous stiffness increases by up to 6 %. Reducing the number of wires decreases the whole spine stiffness almost linearly by 5 %. These changes also alter center of rotation of the spine. The results suggest that pre-stressing and number of wires have an effect on whole spine stiffness. Conclusions In summary, the develop FE model can be used to simulate different treatment strategies and to improve implant designs used in surgical treatment of scoliosis.
