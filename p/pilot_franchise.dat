Team equipment is shipped to Milwaukee County Stadium, where the Pilots insignia is ripped off of the uniforms, since there is no time for new uniforms to be made.|$|R

50|$|Two teams, the Columbia Inferno and the Myrtle Beach Thunderboltz, voluntarily {{suspended}} {{operations for}} the season with plans on returning in the 2009-10 season. The Myrtle Beach franchise was originally planning to return to operations, but their arena had not been completed {{in time for the}} Board of Governors Meeting during the All-Star Break. The league announced that they were immediately terminating the Pensacola Ice <b>Pilots</b> <b>franchise,</b> because the team's owners did not intend on fielding a team for the 2008-09 season or any season after that.

Forgione announced plans to keep a team in Pensacola, but one in an unnamed, lower-level league. The ECHL then stated that it would revoke the franchise if need be, and the ECHL made it official on Monday, June 23, 2008. On April 4, 2009, the SPHL announced discussions between potential investors, key government officials, local fans and business leaders in Pensacola, Florida relative to the award of a franchise for the 2009-10 SPHL season. However, the press release stopped short of explicitly stating that this expansion team would not be the Ice <b>Pilots</b> <b>franchise</b> owned by Mario Forgione.

50|$|Those {{hopes were}} dashed when National League franchises were awarded to San Diego (the Padres) and Montreal (the Expos), and American League franchises were awarded to Kansas City (the Royals) and Seattle (the <b>Pilots).</b> That last <b>franchise,</b> however, would figure very {{prominently}} in Selig's future.|$|R

5000|$|When Soriano won the <b>Pilots</b> {{expansion}} <b>franchise</b> in late 1967, he didn't {{have enough}} money to pay the franchise fee. In what proved to be a [...] of things to come, he had to ask for help from former Cleveland Indians owner Bill Daley — who, ironically, had nearly moved the Indians to Seattle earlier in the 1960s. In return, Soriano sold Daley a 47 percent stake in the team, making him the largest shareholder. Soriano, however, retained the team presidency. Largely due to being badly undercapitalized, Soriano was nearly out of money {{by the end of the}} 1969 season.|$|R
