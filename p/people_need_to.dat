Usability <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> take marketing, branding, and aesthetic needs into account when designing websites. User experience provided a platform to cover the interests of all stakeholders: making web sites easy to use, valuable, and effective for visitors. This is why several early user experience publications focus on website user experience.|$|R
25|$|Problematic point(s): <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know if {{a phrase}} is officially {{the name of that}} place or just a designation, e.g. Erzsébet híd is a name (‘Elisabeth Bridge’) but Duna-híd merely refers to a bridge on the Danube, so a hyphen should be used.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> wear special clothes such as {{business}} suits or uniforms {{in their daily}} work. In some cases {{the nature of the}} cycling infrastructure and the prevailing weather conditions may make it very hard to both cycle and maintain the work clothes in a presentable condition. It is argued that such workers can be encouraged to cycle by providing lockers, changing rooms and shower facilities where they can change before starting work.|$|E

They are popular in Turkish as Ilmihal (from the Arabic Ilm ul-Hal, Situation Science). The first chapter is the book of cleanliness and first to be taught are subjects such as: which are clean, what is clean and what is not clean, what <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be cleansed from, how they should clean, and which water should they use to clean.|$|E
25|$|Even when {{statistical}} {{techniques are}} correctly applied, {{the results can}} be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The statistical significance of a trend in the data—which measures {{the extent to which a}} trend could be caused by random variation in the sample—may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy.|$|E
25|$|To {{provide the}} kind of {{information}} and support <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> invest money, time and effort in energy conservation, {{it is important to understand}} and link to people's topical concerns. For instance, some retailers argue that bright lighting stimulates purchasing. However, health studies have demonstrated that headache, stress, blood pressure, fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common over-illumination present in many workplace and retail settings. It has been shown that natural daylighting increases productivity levels of workers, while reducing energy consumption.|$|E

25|$|But a {{continuing}} emphasis to the well-rounded graduate {{can be seen}} in the University's approach to education degrees. As a solely graduate-level program, this is based on the principle that <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> learn primary subject matter well before they can learn how to teach it to others. Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five-year program earning both a bachelor's degree in a specialized field and a master's degree in Education. This latter degree, along with the Business College's M.B.A., are among the most popular graduate programs in the University.|$|E
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{be educated}} on {{interpreting}} their results {{and what they}} should be rationally taking from the experience. It is not only the average person who needs to be educated in the dimensions of their own genomic sequence but also professionals, including physicians and science journalists, who must be provided with the knowledge required to inform and educate their patients and the public. Examples of such efforts include the Personal Genetics Education Project (pgEd), the Smithsonian collaboration with NHGRI, and the MedSeq, BabySeq and MilSeq projects of Genomes to People, an initiative of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.|$|E

Our purpose for the sundance is for the survival of the future generations to come, first and foremost. If the non-Natives truly understand this purpose, they will also understand this decision and know that by their departure from this Ho-c'o-ka (our sacred altar) is their sincere contribution to the survival of our future generations.|$|E

In Switzerland, Spain and France it publishes 20 minutes, the name indicating the time <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> read it. Schibsted also had some disappointments. A German version {{had to be taken}} from the market after a bitter newspaper war with local publishers in Cologne, while an Italian edition never saw the streets because of legal matters (non-EU companies could not control Italian media firms, but this did not prevent the Italian market from becoming flooded with free newspapers). The Schibsted editions have a total circulation of 1.7 million.|$|E
25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure {{of what we call}} civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E
25|$|People {{with only}} a casual concern for Internet privacy need not achieve total anonymity. Internet users may protect their privacy through {{controlled}} disclosure of personal information. The revelation of IP addresses, non-personally-identifiable profiling, and similar information might become acceptable trade-offs for the convenience that users could otherwise lose using the workarounds needed to suppress such details rigorously. On the other hand, some people desire much stronger privacy. In that case, they may try to achieve Internet anonymity to ensure privacy — use of the Internet without giving any third parties the ability to link the Internet activities to personally-identifiable information of the Internet user. In order to keep their information private, <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be careful with what they submit to and look at online. When filling out forms and buying merchandise, that becomes tracked and because the information was not private, some companies are now sending Internet users spam and advertising on similar products.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{there are}} Dhakis like Dhaki Gokul Chandra Das,of Maslondopur and Ashutosh Colony Habra, North 24 parganas,believs that the Dhak {{is similar to}} any other {{percussion}} instrument played in a concert or a stage performance, such as the Tabla,Pakhwaj,or Mridangam. If a Tabalchi can show case his talent on stage {{in front of a}} large audience, so can a Dhaki....He believes that the dhak can be played in accompaniment to any kind of music,including songs (Rabindra Sangeet), similar to the Tabla,and not just for the Durga Puja or any other puja; and he has proved it. He now participates in stage performances with Pandit Tanmoy Bose and his group of talented musicians. Recently he also performed in a reality TV show,(Sa re Ga Ma Pa,) on Z Bangla, in accompaniment to songs.So it is hard time the Dhakis learnt to use their inheritant music in other ways, to make a living {{and at the same time}} to keep the art of playing the Dhak alive and enchant the world with their magical rhythms at times other than the Durga Puja. <b>People</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> recognise the Dhak as a percussion instrument no different than any other percussion instrument that can be seen on stage.|$|E
25|$|Many {{publications}} list tooth wear as {{a consequence}} of bruxism, but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and bruxism. Tooth wear caused by tooth-to-tooth contact is termed attrition. This is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in bruxism, and affects the occlusal surface (the biting surface) of the teeth. The exact location and pattern of attrition depends on how the bruxism occurs, e.g., when the canines and incisors of the opposing arches are moved against each other laterally, by the action of the medial pterygoid muscles, this can lead to the wearing down of the incisal edges of the teeth. To grind the front teeth, most <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> posture their mandible forwards, unless there is an existing edge to edge, class III incisal relationship. People with bruxism may also grind their posterior teeth (back teeth), which wears down the cusps of the occlusal surface. Once tooth wear progresses through the enamel layer, the exposed dentin layer is softer and more vulnerable to wear and tooth decay. If enough of the tooth is worn away or decayed, the tooth will effectively be weakened, and may fracture under the increased forces that occur in bruxism.|$|E
