5000|$|Karyorrhexis (from Greek κάρυον karyon, [...] "kernel, seed or nucleus", and ῥῆξις rhexis, [...] "bursting") is the {{destructive}} {{fragmentation of the}} nucleus of a dying cell whereby its chromatin is distributed irregularly throughout the cytoplasm. It is usually preceded by <b>pyknosis</b> and can occur {{as a result of}} either programmed cell death (apoptosis), senescence, or necrosis.|$|E
50|$|Total {{destruction}} of the host cell monolayer is the most severe type of CPE. To observe this process, cells are seeded on a glass surface and a confluent monolayer of host cell is formed. Then, the viral infection is introduced. All cells in the monolayer shrink rapidly, become dense in {{a process known as}} <b>pyknosis,</b> and detach from the glass within three days. This form of CPE is typically seen with enteroviruses.|$|E
50|$|Necrosis is an {{unprogrammed}} {{death of}} cells, which involves early plasma membrane changes leading to loss of calcium and sodium imbalance. This causes acidosis, osmotic shock, clumping of chromatin and nuclear <b>pyknosis.</b> These changes {{are accompanied by}} a loss of oxidative phosphorylation, a drop in ATP production, {{and a loss of}} homeostatic capability. There are also mitochondrial changes which include calcium overload and activation of phospholipases leading to membrane diffusion signals, a stage of irreversible damage. The secondary stage involves swelling of the lysosome, dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum, a leakage of enzymes and proteins and a loss of compartmentalization.|$|E
5000|$|A lochos {{comprised}} an inconsistent {{number of}} men that could range from 8 to 16 men. Asclepiodotus offers three alternative names, namely stichos (...) , synomotia (...) and dekania (...) [...] The file leader was called a lochagos and the file closer an ouragos. The men in the uneven rows were called protostates, among which the lochagos, and {{the men in the}} even rows epistates. Should the line perform a <b>pyknosis</b> (that is, close its ranks by placement of half the lochos in the interval between the original lochoi), then the epistates of the lochagos would become the promachos protostates of the newly employed file.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pyknosis,</b> or karyopyknosis, is the {{irreversible}} condensation of chromatin in {{the nucleus}} of a cell undergoing necrosis or apoptosis. It is followed by karyorrhexis, or fragmentation of the nucleus.Pyknosis (from Greek pyknono meaning [...] "to thicken up, to close or to condense") is also observed in the maturation of erythrocytes (a red blood cell) and the neutrophil (a type of white blood cell). The maturing metarubricyte (a stage in RBC maturation) will condense its nucleus before expelling it to become a reticulocyte. The maturing neutrophil will condense its nucleus into several connected lobes that stay in the cell {{until the end of}} its cell life.|$|E
5000|$|Replication of PPV {{in vitro}} is cytocidal and {{characterized}} by [...] "rounding up," [...] <b>pyknosis,</b> and lysis of cells (Fig. 1A). Many {{of the cell}} fragments often remain attached, eventually giving the affected culture a ragged appearance. Intranuclear inclusions develop but they are often sparsely distributed. Infected cultures may hemadsorb slightly (Fig. 1B). Cytopathic changes are extensive when cell culture-adapted virus is propagated under appropriate conditions. However, on initial isolation several serial passages of the virus or, better, the infected culture may be necessary before the effects are recognized. The use of immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy greatly {{increases the likelihood of}} detecting minimally infected cultures.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "Red Neuron" [...] (acidophilic or [...] "eosinophilic" [...] neuron) is a {{pathological}} finding in neurons, generally {{of the central}} nervous system, indicative of acute neuronal injury and subsequent apoptosis or necrosis. Acidophilic neurons are often found in the first 12-24 hours after an ischemic injury such as a stroke. Since neurons are permanent cells, they are most susceptible to hypoxic injury. The red coloration is due to <b>pyknosis</b> or degradation of the nucleus and loss of Nissl bodies which are normally stained blue (basophilic) on hematoxylin & eosin staining (H&E stain). This leaves only the degraded proteins which stains red (eosinophilic). Acidophilic neurons also can be stained with acidic dyes other than eosin (e.g. acid fuchsin and light green yellowish).|$|E
50|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{cell death}} {{in some cases}} a vital dye is used to detect when cellular function is disrupted. This procedure uses living tissue that is immersed in diluted 1:0000 solution of Nile Blue Sulphate in Saline. The measurement of cell death by using this dye is observing a change of color or the formation of fluorescence. When the cell died the nucleus went through destruction stages, one of them <b>pyknosis</b> which lead {{to the release of}} a basic histone group and this happened when the irreversible condensation of chromatins occurred. The phagocytosis process took place in secondary lysosmes and the autophagy and heterophagy controlled the dead cell by acid hydrolysis activity.The techniques used to explained this is by the detection of (6-3H)-thymidine and acid phosphates’ activity in cryostat.|$|E
5000|$|Oncosis and {{apoptosis}} {{are distinct}} processes of cellular death. Oncosis {{is characterized by}} cellular swelling caused by a failure in ion pump function. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death involves a series of cell shrinking processes, beginning with cell size reduction and <b>pyknosis,</b> followed by cell budding and karyorrhexis, and phagocytosis by macrophages or neighboring cells due to size decrease [...] The phagocytic disposal of apoptotic cells prevents the release of cellular debris that could induce an inflammatory response in neighboring cells [...] In opposition, the leakage of cellular content associated with membrane disruption in oncosis often incites an inflammatory response in neighboring tissue, causing further cellular injury [...] Additionally, apoptosis and the degradation of intracellular organelles is mediated by caspase activation, particularly caspase-3 [...] Oligonuclosomal DNA fragmentation is initiated by caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease following caspase-3 mediated cleavage of the enzyme’s inhibitor, ICAD [...] In contrast, the oncotic pathway {{has been shown to}} be caspase-3 independent.|$|E
50|$|After {{the initial}} {{infection}}, the acute phase develops. Clinical signs can occur {{as early as}} 7 hours after infection in some individuals and last for about 4-7 days. Infected shrimp display anorexia, lethargy and erratic swimming behavior. They also present opacification of the tail musculature, soft cuticle and, in naturally occurring infection, a red tail due {{to the expansion of}} the red chromatophores. Mortality during this phase can be as high as 95%. The acute phase is characterized histologically by multifocal areas of nuclear pyknosis/karyorrhexis and numerous cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the cuticular epithelium and the subcutis of the general body surface, all appendages, gills, hindgut, esophagus and stomach. The <b>pyknosis</b> and karyorrhexis give a “buckshot” appearance to the tissue and are considered pathognomonic for the disease. In severe infections the antennal gland tubule epithelium, the hematopoietic tissues and the testis are also affected. This occurs mainly in severe infection following injection of viral particles and has not been reported from naturally infected P. vannamei. Shrimp that survive the acute stage enter a transitional stage.|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{continues}} to be a devastating disease, largely caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection. We investigated the effects of opioid and cannabinoid receptor antagonists on the growth of intraerythrocytic P. falciparum. The delta opioid receptor antagonist 7 -benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX) and the cannabinoid receptor antagonists rimonaband and SR 144528 caused growth arrest of the parasite. Notably BNTX and the established antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin induced prominent <b>pyknosis</b> in parasite cells after a short period of incubation. We compared genome-wide transcriptome profiles in P. falciparum with different degrees of <b>pyknosis</b> in response to drug treatment, and identified 11 transcripts potentially associated with the evoking of <b>pyknosis,</b> of which three, including glutathione reductase (PfGR), triose phosphate transporter (PfoTPT), and a conserved Plasmodium membrane protein, showed markedly different gene expression levels in accordance with the degree of <b>pyknosis.</b> Furthermore, the use of specific inhibitors confirmed PfGR but not PfoTPT as a possible factor contributing to the development of <b>pyknosis.</b> A reduction in total glutathione levels was also detected in association with increased <b>pyknosis.</b> These results further our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for P. falciparum development and the antimalarial activity of dihydroartemisinin, and provide useful information for the development of novel antimalarial agents...|$|E
40|$|Most {{observations}} {{of the process of}} <b>pyknosis,</b> generally considered to be a reflection of nuclear degeneration, have been confined to morphological changes and little is known of the chemical alterations involved. A microspectrophotometric technique, with which quantitative measurements of cell constituents can be made, {{has been found to be}} applicable to a cytochemical study of <b>pyknosis</b> [...] in this case, the physiological <b>pyknosis</b> of erythropoiesis in which the primitive erythroblast nucleus shrinks, loses its delicate reticular structure, and becomes through successive stages the densely staining, clumped nucleus of the normoblast. Leuchtenberger (1), using a similar technique, followed the nucleoprotein changes attending nuclear pyknotic degeneration in mouse sarcoma 180. Thorell (2) studied the red cell maturation process cytochemically, but concerned himself primarily with cytoplasmic alterations. The present study had a threefold purpose: (1) to learn whether blood smears are measurable microspectrophotometrically; (2) to compare erythropoietic <b>pyknosis</b> with that accompanying necrosis; (3) to determine the fate of the red cell nucleus during maturation. Material and Methods Human bone marrow was obtained by sternal puncture, without anticoagulant. 1 The marrow was spread in as uniform a manner as possible on ordinary glass slides. These were then air-dried, fixed in absolute methyl alcohol for 3 to 5 minutes, and dried again. The slides were stained with Unna-Pappenheim's phenol-methyl green mixture for 45 minutes at 56 °C. They were then rinsed in ice water, blotted dry, and differentiated overnight in tertiary butyl alcohol at room temperature. * This investigation was carried out during tenure of a postdoctoral Research Fellowshi...|$|E
40|$|The neurosecretory {{phenomenon}} of rat was studied morphologically under some experimental conditions {{of high and}} low steroid hormone milieu. 1. Estradiol, progesterone, testosterone and MAD exert direct excitatory action on neurosecretion without any mediation of hypophysis. These four hormones prevent the neurosecretory cell from retrograde degeneration following hypophysectomy. 2. Cortisone affects extensively thalamic and hypothalamic area while DOCA loads neurosecretion heavily until some of cell undergoes degeneration due to exhaustion. 3. Effect of ACTH and synahorin on neurosecretion can be interpreted as that of hormones of corresponding target organs. 4. Castration result in nuclear <b>pyknosis</b> of some supraoptic cells. Slight increase in Gomori substance and in nuclear size were present in most of neurosecretory cells while adrenalectomy results in unclear <b>pyknosis</b> of some supraoptic cells and in loss of neurosecretory material. 5. Nuclear <b>pyknosis</b> in some cells and disappearance of Gomori substance are induced by such stress as formalin and needle pricks on tail. These results obtained suggest that presumed neurohumoral mechanism through which hypothalamus exerts its control over hypophysis may be neurosecretion itself. The results of the experiments may offer morphological foundition in favor of accepted supposition that neurosecretion provokes the potuitary adrenocortcial response to stress...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Busulfan is an antineoplastic bifunctional alkylating agent. We {{previously}} reported the busulfan-induced systemic histo-pathological changes in fetal rats and {{the sequence of}} brain lesions in fetal and infant rats. In the present study, in order to clarify the nature and sequence of busulfan-induced systemic histopathological changes in infant rats, 6 -day-old male infant rats were subcutane-ously administered 20 mg/kg of busulfan and histopathologically examined at 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 days after treatment (DAT). As a result, histopathological changes characterized by <b>pyknosis</b> of component cells were observed in the heart, lungs, stomach, intestines, liver, kidneys, testes, epididymides, hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, dorsal skin and femur {{as well as in}} the brain and eyes (data not shown in this paper). Such <b>pyknosis</b> transiently appeared until 7 DAT with prominence at 2 and/or 4 DAT in each tissue, except for the thymus, in which <b>pyknosis</b> peaked at 1 DAT. Most of the pyknotic nuclei were immunohistochemically positive for cleaved caspase- 3, indicating that pyknotic cells were apoptotic. Different from the reports of fetal and adult rats, apoptosis was also found in cardiomyo-cytes and osteoblasts in infant rats.

40|$|Objectives: {{the aim of}} {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} DNA damage (micronucleus) and cellular death (<b>pyknosis,</b> karyolysis and karyorrhexis) in exfoliated buccal mucosa cells from adults following cone beam CT exposure. Methods: A total of 19 healthy adults (10 men and 9 women) submitted to cone beam CT were included. Results: No significant statistically differences (P > 0. 05) in micronucleus frequency were seen before and after cone beam CT exposure. in contrast, the tomography was able to increase other nuclear alterations closely related to cytotoxicity such as karyorrhexis, <b>pyknosis</b> and karyolysis (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Pyknotic nuclei, {{observed}} in the thymus of steroid-treated rats, are dense, homogeneous, intensely basophilic and Feulgen positive. Under the electron microscope, the image {{is that of a}} complete segregation of the chromatin from the nuclear sap producing a margin or crescent of condensed chromatin. Approximately 30 % of all small thymocytes appeared to undergo this type of degeneration within 3 – 4 hr after administration of the synthetic corticosteroid, dexamethasone. At this time, pyknotic thymocytes were {{observed in}} clusters, probably {{as a result of the}} activity of dense reticular cells and macrophages. Topographical and experimental data suggest the existence of a select population of steroid-sensitive thymic cells. Furthermore, on the basis of thymidine- 3 H incorporation studies, it appears that the steroid-sensitive population of thymocytes does not correspond to "aged" cells. In addition, many plasma cells became pyknotic after the same steroid treatment, indicating an unexpected similarity between their nuclei and those of lymphocytes. Finally, steroid failed to induce <b>pyknosis</b> of thymocytes in a variety of in vitro experiments, suggesting that the in vivo effect of steroid is of an indirect nature. The results are discussed in terms of (a) the nature of the nuclear changes characterizing <b>pyknosis,</b> (b) the hypothetical mechanism whereby steroids trigger such changes, and (c) the population of cells susceptible to steroid-induced <b>pyknosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives: {{the aim of}} {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} DNA damage (micronucleus) and cellular death (<b>pyknosis,</b> karyolysis and karyorrhexis) in exfoliated buccal mucosa cells from individuals following radiography. Methods: Lateral and frontal cephalometric X-ray and panoramic dental X-rays were taken of a total of 18 healthy patients (6 male and 12 female) referred for orthodontic therapy. Exfoliated oral mucosa cells were collected immediately before X-ray exposure and after 10 days. Results: the results revealed no statistically significant difference (P > 0. 05) in the frequency micronucleated oral mucosa cells after X-ray exposure. However, X-ray was able to increase other nuclear alterations closely related to cytotoxicity, such as karyorrhexis, <b>pyknosis</b> and karyolysis.

Clarias batrachus to ZnSO 4 (Prasanna Subhas Joshi 2011), Cyprinus carpio to lethal concentrations of Cr (Parvathi et al. 2011), Tilapia zilli to Al (Hadi and Alwan 2012), Clarias gariepinus to sewage/ domestic wastewater containing Cu, Fe, Pb, Cd, Mn and Zn (Authman et al. 2013). It has been noticed that only toxicant exposed liver show vacuolation and <b>pyknosis</b> (Karyomegaly). Degeneration of liver tissue and necrosis could be due to the infiltration of leucocytes and according to Hughes et al. (1979) necrosis is the direct toxic effect of the pollutant.

Demographic data and personal history of all subjects were recorded in a proforma before the examination. Gingival epithelial cells were obtained by gentle scraping with a modified cytobrush immediately before X-ray exposure and 10 ± 2 days later. Cytological preparations were stained according to the Feulgen/fast green method and analyzed under a light microscope. Micronuclei and degenerative nuclear alterations (<b>pyknosis,</b> karyolysis, karyorrhexis and condensed chromatin) were scored. Results: The frequency of formation of micronuclei was not significant with regard to age, gender and after exposure to digital panoramic radiography (P = 0. 276).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis have complex genetic traits, but in both autoimmune diseases, dysfunctional apoptosis appears {{to play a}} part in disease pathology. This study examined the levels of in vitro apoptosis in lymphocytes from healthy, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and SLE individuals and related observed differences to their lymphocyte apoptosis gene profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymphocytes were assessed for cell death by nuclear <b>pyknosis</b> and DNA fragmentation. Control, SLE and RA apoptosis gene profiles were obtained by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The mean levels of <b>pyknosis</b> in RA and SLE freshly isolated lymphocytes were significantly higher than in control lymphocytes. Ninety-three apoptosis genes were analysed by QRT-PCR of mRNA from RA, SLE and healthy lymphocytes. We identified significant differences (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) in the expression of the same 11 of 93 and two of 93 apoptotic genes in individual SLE and RA patients tested as compared with controls. CONCLUSION: We propose that similarly altered expression of specific apoptotic regulatory genes (e. g., the death effector domain-containing DNA-binding protein and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) occurs in the lymphocytes of individual patients with SLE or RA that may influence the extent and rate of spontaneous apoptosis in these autoimmune conditions...|$|E
