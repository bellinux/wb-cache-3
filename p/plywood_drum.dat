5000|$|A {{wonderful}} occasional table {{designed in}} 1934 by Gerald Summers and made by 'Makers of Simple Furniture', a small British company producing furniture mainly to order. A simple drum style table made of birch plywood. A rare and very collectible piece of British modernism.Birch <b>plywood</b> <b>drum</b> and top, in good refinished condition. The table had been stained dark at some stage, on close inspection {{there are some}} remnants of the stain in the grain {{around the edge of}} the table ...|$|E

40|$|Prefabricated timber raft is {{water-based}} {{recreational vehicle}} for drifting on rivers without rapids. It is a floating deck measuring 4. 5 m (length) X 3. 2 m (width) with a carrying capacity of 800 to 900 kg; appropriate for eight adults. It {{is made up}} of three major components: (1) float made from eight polyethylene drums, (2) frame made from timber boards (50 X 50 mm), and (3) deck made from three pieces of 4 mm thick waterproof <b>plywoods.</b> The <b>drums</b> and timber boards can be made from used materials whereas new plywoods are required for safety and durability. Minor components such as oars, masts, canvas and a stowage compartment are installed to facilitate the rafting crew in their expedition. The fundamental scheme of this raft is that it can be assembled or dismantled by eight adults within 25 minutes, costing RM 650 - 800 and can be utilized for more than five times. It is a cheap recreational and eco-friendly mode to spend leisure activities without causing pollution to the river. The minimum drift duration is four days with average drifting speed of 4. 2 km/h covering a distance of 30 to 35 km per day...|$|R
40|$|The Ames Laboratory Chemical Disposal Site {{is located}} in northwestern Ames, Iowa west of Squaw Creek. From 1957 to 1966, Ames Laboratory {{conducted}} research to develop processes to separate uranium and thorium from nuclear power fuel and to separate yttrium from neutron shielding sources. The wastes from these processes, which contained both hazardous and radiological components, were placed into nine burial pits. Metal <b>drums,</b> <b>plywood</b> boxes, and steel pails were used to store the wastes. Uranium was also burned on the ground surface of the site. Monitoring wells were placed around the waste burial pits. Groundwater testing in 1993 revealed elevated levels of Uranium 234, Uranium 238, beta and alpha radiation. The {{north side of the}} burial pit had elevated levels of volatile organic compounds. Samples in the East Ravine showed no volatile organics; however, they did contain elevated levels of radionuclides. These analytical results seem to indicate that the groundwater from the burial pit is flowing down hill and causing contamination in the East Ravine. Although there are many avenues for the contamination to spread, the focus of this project is to understand the hydrogeology of the East Ravine and to determine the path of groundwater flow down the East Ravine. The groundwater flow data along with other existing information will be used to assess the threat of chemical migration down the East Ravine and eventually off-site. The primary objectives of the project were as follows: define the geology of the East Ravine; conduct slug tests to determine the hydraulic conductivity of both oxidized and unoxidized till; develop a three-dimensional mathematical model using ModIME and MODFLOW to simulate groundwater flow in the East Ravine...|$|R
