Thus a fertilizer automated <b>proportioning</b> <b>equipment</b> is developed to Proportion the three fertilizers: Nitrogen fertilizer, Phosphorus fertilizer and Kalium fertilizer. The fertilizer will take greater effect after mixing sufficiently, so this paper mainly researched the mixing mechanism. The simulation and analysis of the velocity field and flow field of the fertilizer for the two paddles worked, the spiral-type paddle and multiple- fan-type paddle, are conducted respectively using Pro/E (Pro/Engineer) and CFD(Computational Fluid Dynamics) fluid dynamics analysis software. During simulation, the paddle models are meshed using the Gambit software. Then the multiple- fan-type paddle is determined to be the more suitable one through the FLUENT software...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe current {{approach}} to hydraulic fracturing requires {{large amounts of}} industrial hardware to be transported, installed and operated in temporary locations. A significant <b>proportion</b> of this <b>equipment</b> is comprised of the fleet of pumps required to provide the high pressures and flows necessary for well stimulation. Studies have shown that over 90 % of the emissions of CO 2 and other pollutants that occur during a hydraulic fracturing operation are associated with these pumps. Pollution and transport concerns are of paramount importance for the emerging hydraulic fracturing industry in Europe, {{and so it is}} timely to consider these factors when assessing the design of high pressure pumps for the European resources. This paper gives an overview of the industrial plant required to carry out a hydraulic fracturing operation. This is followed by an analysis of the pump's design space that could result in improved pump efficiency. We find that reducing the plunger diameter and running the pump at higher speeds can increase the overall pump efficiency by up to 4. 6 %. Such changes to the pump's parameters would results in several environmental benefits beyond the obvious economic gains of lower fuel consumption. The paper concludes with a case study that quantifies these benefits...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{changes in}} plant {{equipment}} have been becoming more frequent {{because of the}} short lifetime of the products, and constructing 3 D shape models of existing plants (as-built models) from large-scale laser scanned data {{is expected to make}} their rebuilding processes more efficient.

Piping systems especially, account for the greatest <b>proportion</b> of plant <b>equipment.</b> Therefore, the purpose of this research was to propose an algorithm which can automatically recognize a piping system from terrestrial laser scan data of the plant equipment. The straight portion of pipes, connecting parts and connection relationship of the piping system can be recognized in this algorithm. Eigenvalue analysis of the point clouds and of the normal vectors allows for the recognition. Using only point clouds, the recognition algorithm can be applied to registered point clouds and can be performed in a fully automatic way.

This study sought to: (i) investigate the perception of growers and service dealership about PA technologies; (ii) identify constraints to PA adoption; (iii) obtain information that might be useful to motivate producers and agronomists to use PA technologies in the crop production systems. A web-based survey approach method was used to collect data from farmers and services dealership involved with PA in several crop production regions of Brazil. We found that the growth of PA was linked to the agronomic and economic gains observed in the field; however, in some situations, the producers still can not measure the real PA impact in producer system. Economic aspects coupled with the difficulty to use of software and <b>equipment</b> <b>proportioned</b> by the lack of technical training of field teams, may be the main factors limiting the PA expansion in many producing regions of Brazil.

Many producers already have PA equipment loaded on their machines, but little explored, also restricting to fertilizers and lime application.

In order to detect low-level contamination in samples, this study made use of a preliminary incubation technique (24 h at 37 °C), which boosted bacterial counts for the identification of sources of contamination. Numbers of bacteria were quantified by standard pour- and spread-plate techniques and various selective media. Raw materials were negligible in contributing to the bacterial contamination of commercial yeast, {{with the exception of}} soda ash, used to control the pH of fermentations, which contained 2 log CFU/ ml Enterococcus and aerobic bacteria. It was found that the scale up of seed yeast biomass was the primary site for contamination with Enterococcus, which progressively increased in number as the product passed down the production line. Coliforms were present at low levels, with significant increases (P 10 °C), whilst vacuum-packaged dry yeast remained bacteriologically stable. During shelf-life studies, isolates from spoiled cream and compressed yeast samples were predominantly Lactobacillus (up to 78 %), while populations of Enterococcaceae predominated in vacuum-packaged dry yeast samples (up to 68 %).

A sample of seventy-three farmers, further divided in four groups based on a combination of farm size and profit levels, was used in the analyses. Means comparisons using t-tests to identify success factors, a multiple regression estimating the effects of main success factors identified through t-tests and a logistic regression estimating the contribution of profitability and other factors on farmers 2 ̆ 7 success perception were based on data from Farm Business Association (1991 - 1996 period) and from survey. Results indicate that farms 2 ̆ 7 profitability is affected negatively by farmer 2 ̆ 7 s age but positively by farmer 2 ̆ 7 s education, crop yields, machinery and labor efficiency, percent of rented acres and percent of revenue from livestock.;Farm size appeared to positively affect net farm income. Small successful farmers are young farmers with high education levels who rent most of the land they use and probably also rent high <b>proportions</b> of their <b>equipment</b> and machinery, given their high proportion of rent expenses and low proportion of depreciation and interest expenses.

H 577 M BRE 2015 Fanxii, 152 pages :color illustrationsConstruction {{equipment}} {{plays an}} important role in civil engineering works, particularly in infrastructure projects such as railways and bridge construction. Unexpected failures of equipment can cause serious consequences such as increased cost, project period extension, or even safety issues in some cases. Even though different maintenance and reliability prediction methods have been applied by contractors on site, a significant <b>proportion</b> of <b>equipment</b> repairs still follow unexpected failures. To bridge the gap between failure and preventive maintenance, it is important to discover scientific and precise methods for analyzing and predicting the failures before they happen. Traditionally, there are a number of standard distribution functions which can be used for reliability analysis. However, a number of books and papers have stressed that the usual non-repairable reliability methodologies, such as the Weibull distribution, are not appropriate for repairable system reliability analyses and have suggested the use of Non-homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) models. Most construction equipment and their components are considered to be in the category of repairable system. Apart from the traditional distributions introduced above, researchers have applied more sophisticated data mining methods to equipment reliability analysis. Time series modeling is one of the more advanced techniques which this research is focused on. Time series analysis can be used to describe and model the historical data, and forecast the future values of the series based on the past values. Construction equipment failure follows the time series pattern, and thus it can be adopted. The aim of this research is to study the possible methods which can be used to analyze reliability and predict the failures of construction equipment in order to bridge the gap between preventive maintenance and repairs and help to make managerial decisions on equipment allocation and maintenance. The objectives are: a) To increase the understanding of the nature of failure patterns of the selected construction equipment; b) To estimate the reliability characteristics of construction equipment in precise quantitative terms by using power law models and time series models; c) Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional power law models with those of time series models in construction equipment reliability analysis; d) To give recommendations on construction equipment management and maintenance based on the research findings. The major works for this research comprise of literature review, data collection, data preparation, quantitative analysis, time series prediction and case studies. A comprehensive literature review on the fields of reliability and construction equipment has been conducted. Quantitative analysis is used in this study including data collection, modelling and validation with the aid of computer software packages. Time series is the main method adopted for reliability analysis and failure prediction while traditional power law models are used as baseline for comparison. Case studies are employed to study the reliability of construction equipment with real maintenance data collected from construction site. The major findings of the research include: the investigation and analysis of the importance of reliability and failure prediction for construction equipment from the aspects of cost, time and safety; testing the traditional power law model and time series model on failure prediction for construction equipment based on real industry data; studying the construction equipment reliability and failure from both the systems and subsystems levels; taking related factors into consideration and evaluating the importance of these factors (e. g. impact from Time to Repair) in the modelling process of failure prediction; comparing the advantages and disadvantages of power law model and time series model. Based on the results and findings of the data modelling and analysis in this research, advice is given for managerial decisions on construction equipment maintenance to promote the practice of repair before failures.

40|$|Introduction Candida bezoar (CB) {{is a rare}} {{finding in}} {{neonates}} and infants with candiduria, presenting as necrotic debris with proliferating mycelia in the collecting system of the kidney. If initial antifungal medical treatment does not result in clearance of candiduria and disappearance of CB on ultrasound in dilated kidneys, invasive interventions like insertion of nephrostomy tubes (NT) or surgical interventions to drain the kidney are sometimes advocated [...] However, NT placement can be a technical challenge, especially in pre- and dysmature neonates, and NT displacement or obstruction by the CB can lead to suboptimal treatment. Identification of those children who will benefit from invasive renal drainage is important. Objective This study evaluates the management of patients with CB in three tertiary referral hospitals to determine criteria for intervention. Materials and methods A retrospective multicenter chart analysis was conducted of children with candiduria and ultrasonographic demonstration of CB (diagnosed between March 1995 and August 2012). The indication for invasive renal drainage (if performed) and subsequent clinical outcome, serum creatinine levels and ultrasound findings were assessed. Results A total of 12 children were included, two of which were premature neonates. Eight children had congenital urogenital anomalies. One older child with acute myeloid leukemia had CB during chemotherapy and one ex-premature developed CB following cerebral candidiasis. All children received systemic antifungal medication; in seven children invasive treatment was added. Indications for invasive treatment were clinical deterioration, progressive renal dilation, pyonephrosis, rising creatinine levels and persistence of CB. Two underwent a Ycutaneous ureterostomy and nephrostomy tubes were inserted in five children. Percutaneous renal drainage by nephrostomy led to complications in 3 of 6 procedures. In all patients, irrespective of therapeutic modality, follow-up ultrasound demonstrated no de novo changes. No additional parenchymal defects or deterioration of split renal function were seen on DMSA or MAG- 3 scan. Discussion In the literature renal drainage is suggested in case of complete obstruction. However dilatation is a frequent finding in children {{as part of the}} congenital renal anomaly and {{does not necessarily mean that}} there is obstruction of the urinary tract. Even in children without candida infections the diagnosis of obstruction is not straightforward, while the results of a MAG 3 scan can be obscured by compromised kidney function, parenchymal bacterial infiltration and neonatal immaturity of the kidney. If candiduria and CB persist despite intensive medical treatment, intensive consultation is required before renal drainage, because NT insertion might be a surgical challenge. Complications such as displacement of the NT, urinoma development, or NT obstruction can occur and was seen in three of six procedures. Premature neonates seem to be more prone to complications due to their small anatomical <b>proportions,</b> requiring medical <b>equipment</b> with small diameters prone to displacement and obstruction. Some studies describe successful pharmaceutical management in the majority of patients with CB. Other studies describe unilateral surgical intervention in children with bilateral CB where unilateral drainage did not influence overall renal outcome. This is in line with our results. A limitation of the present study is its retrospective design. In this population, the motivation for invasive renal drainage or conservative management was not well documented in all cases, and was mainly based on clinical and diagnostic parameters like creatinine levels and radiographic findings. Conclusion Renal drainage should be considered in selected cases after failure of systemic antifungal treatment.
