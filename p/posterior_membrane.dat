40|$|PURPOSE: To {{present a}} new {{low-cost}} high fidelity bench model of cryopreserved trachea {{that can be}} used to learn surgical skills from medical students to cardiothoracic surgery fellows. METHODS: Ten tracheas were harvested from ten non-trachea related research dogs at the moment of euthanasia. Each trachea was trimmed in six or seven rings segments. They were cryopreserved and stored during 60 days. The day programmed for surgical skills practice, they were thawed to room temperature. RESULTS: Forty segments have been used. After defrosting, all the segments kept their normal anatomic shape and structural integrity. Two incisions were made on every tracheal segment and sutured with running or separate stitches with 5 - 0 polypropilene. There were no complications such as cartilage ruptures, neither tears on the mucosae, the cartilages nor the membranous <b>posterior</b> <b>membrane.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The cryopreserved trachea is a high fidelity, practical, reproducible, portable, low-cost bench model.

METHODS: Anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>membrane</b> curvilinear capsulorhexis combined with dry anterior vitrectomy disciplined in phacoemulsification procedures was performed in 18 congenital cataract cases on 32 eyes. Foldable intraocular lens were implanted into capsular bag in 10 cases(16 eyes). The reaction of cornea, anterior chamber inflammation and transparency of were observed, post-op lasting for 6 - 24 mo(mean 15 mo). RESULTS: Transparent cornea and slightly inflammation of anterior chamber were observed in all eyes, while round pupils and transparency of optical axis were remained in most post-op cases. Meanwhile, slightly opacity of optical axis in 3 eyes, mildly pupil displacement in 4 eyes and posterior synechia of iris in 3 eyes were arisen post-operationally as well.

40|$|SummaryEngrailed {{transcription}} factors {{regulate the}} expression of guidance cues that pattern retinal axon terminals in the dorsal midbrain. They also act directly to guide axon growth in vitro. We show here that an extracellular En gradient exists in the tectum along the anterior-posterior axis. Neutralizing extracellular Engrailed in vivo with antibodies expressed in the tectum causes temporal axons to map aberrantly to the posterior tectum in chick and Xenopus. Furthermore, <b>posterior</b> <b>membranes</b> from wild-type tecta incubated with anti-Engrailed antibodies or <b>posterior</b> <b>membranes</b> from Engrailed- 1 knockout mice exhibit diminished repulsive activity for temporal axons. Since EphrinAs {{play a major role}} in anterior-posterior mapping, we tested whether Engrailed cooperates with EphrinA 5 in vitro.

40|$|Membrane carpets {{consisting}} of alternating mem-brane stripes were prepared from plasma membranes of anterior and posterior chick optic tectum. Axons from retinal explants extend neurites on these carpets. Axons {{of the nasal}} retina do not distinguish between the stripes. Axons of the temporal retina prefer to extend neurites on anterior tectal membranes. Treatment of the membrane fragments with high temperature interferes with the pattern of neurite outgrowth from temporal axons. When growing on carpets {{consisting of}} treated anterior and <b>posterior</b> tectal <b>membranes,</b> temporal retinal axons no longer distinguish between the stripes. Treatment of pos-terior membranes alone is sufficient to abolish the preference of temporal axons to extend neurites on anterior tectal membranes. Treatment of the anterior membranes alone has no effect. This result is best explained by a repulsive com-ponent in the <b>posterior</b> tectal <b>membranes.</b> Temporal, but not nasal, axons specifically recognize and avoid that component, {{with the result that}} they do not extend neurites on <b>posterior</b> tectal <b>membrane</b> stripes.

40|$|Developmental {{cell fusion}} {{is found in}} germlines, muscles, bones, placentae, and stem cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans 300 somatic cells fuse during development. Although there is {{extensive}} information on the early intermediates of viral-induced and intracellular membrane fusion, {{little is known about}} late stages in membrane fusion. To dissect the pathway of cell fusion in C. elegans embryos, we use genetic and kinetic analyses using live-confocal and electron microscopy.

The stages of cell fusion are differentially blocked or retarded in eff- 1 and idf- 1 mutants. We generate kinetic cell fusion maps for embryos grown at different temperatures. Different sides of the same cell differ in their fusogenicity: the left and right membrane domains are fusion-incompetent, whereas the anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>membrane</b> domains fuse with autonomous kinetics in embryos.

40|$|Methods of {{engineering}} mechanics {{were applied to}} further the theoretical understanding of the elastic deformation of some specific components of the tracheobronchial tree when subject to a transmural pressure difference. The contribution of the epithelial basement membrane to airway collapse was analysed. The well-known approach based on the physics of a shell was extended to investigate {{the influence of a}} non-homogeneous stiffness of the basement membrane on airway collapse. Results were obtained for the fundamental "two-lobe" collapse. These indicate that the critical pressure at which collapse starts depends on the location of the region of maximal stiffness. A method was presented for analysing asymmetric stress-strain behaviour when the Young modulus of a material is different in compression than in tension. Results indicated that, if the basement membrane were stiffer in compression than in tension, the resulting collapsed structure would be slightly stiffer than in the case of no stiffness difference and thus the airway would be less narrowed and less compliant. The deformation of the trachea was analysed by using the same theory as used {{in the study of the}} folding of the epithelial membrane. Computations were made to investigate (i) a semi-circular "base-shape" as well as more complex, non-circular shapes, (ii) the effect of shortening of the <b>posterior</b> <b>membrane,</b> (iii) localised weakening of the cartilage ring. Good agreement between model predictions and published MRI microscopy data from rabbit tracheas was obtained. The concepts of fluid mechanics in elastic tubes were used to analyse the effects of airway remodelling on forced expiratory airflow and resistance to airflow. The tracheobronchial tree was modeled as a system of branching, elastic tubes. Flow behaviour through that system of tubes was analysed which allowed the simulation of pulmonary function tests, in particular forced expiration and response to a muscle agonist. Effects of thickening of the airway wall components (adventita, smooth muscle and the submucosa) on exiratory flow and airways resistance, were investigated. Results showed that thickening of the smooth muscle had the strongest effect on expiratory airflow and airway resistance, followed by thickening of the submucosal area.

40|$|Among {{many of the}} regulators, Rho family GTPases (Rac, Cdc 42 and RhoA), PTEN and Myosin 1 f {{have been}} shown or implicated in the {{regulation}} of neutrophil chemotaxis. Yet, the regulatory mechanisms and their functional roles in vivo remain unclear. We propose three specific projects as follows to investigate the functional roles of P-Rex 1, PTEN and Myosin 1 f in neutrophil chemotaxis. ^ P-Rex 1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), was revealed to regulate Rac 1 activity. We found that P-Rex 1 deficiency caused a decrease of Rac 2 activation, but not Rac 1 by fMLP. This preference for Rac 2 probably resulted from the higher affinity of P-Rex 1 for Rac 2 than for Rac 1. In addition, P-Rex 1 deficiency caused a reduction of actin polymerization, a defect in cell motility and a decrease of superoxide formation induced by fMLP. The results suggest that P-Rex 1 is a primary Rac 2 GEF and regulates Rac 2 related neutrophil functions. PTEN has been found repelled from the cell leading edge by active Cdc 42 and colocalized at the cell posterior together with active RhoA in activated neutrophils. We found that PTEN <b>posterior</b> <b>membrane</b> localization was impaired, in which chemoattractant-induced RhoA-Rock activation or Pixα,-Cdc 42 activation was abrogated in neutrophils. We identified four phosphorylation sites in PTEN, which were shown {{to be involved in}} RhoA-Rock mediated PTEN membrane translocation and chemotaxis. In addition, RhoA-Rock regulated PTEN activity and affected PtdIns (3, 4, 5) level. Cdc 42 seemed to regulate PTEN localization through its regulation of RhoA localization. We conclude that RhoA regulates PTEN localization and activity, and Cdc 42 regulates PTEN localization probably through RhoA. ^ Myosin 1 f, one of actin filament associated molecules, was identified exclusively expressed in mouse neutrophils and its deficiency caused more β 2 integrin on the cell surface than that in wild type induced by fibronectin. We found that Myosin 1 f deficiency caused a significant reduction of cell chemotaxis on the surface coated with fibronectin, but not with poly-lysine. In addition, Myosin 1 f was colocalized with cortical actin, but not with integrin containing granules. We conclude that Myosin 1 f may function as a barrier with cortical actin and affect chemotaxis through the regulation of integrin-containing granules release. ^ Keywords. chemotaxis, neutrophils, RhoGTPases, PTEN, Myosin 1 f. ...|$|E

30|$|Although {{believed}} to play very little part in {{stability of the}} atlantooccipital articulation, the <b>posterior</b> atlanto-occipital <b>membrane</b> {{is important because it}} is highly visible on MRI assessment and also exhibits some specific anatomical features which may be misinterpreted on imaging as traumatic disruption. This broad ligament attaches the posterior arch of the atlas to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum and is continuous with the <b>posterior</b> atlantoaxial <b>membrane</b> and, subsequently, the ligamentum flavum [14, 19, 25] (Fig.  1). Laterally, it may extend over the capsules of the atlanto-occipital joints. Posteriorly, it is related to the rectus capitis posterior minor muscle and, anteriorly, to the dura mater. Interdigitations with both the dura mater and the related rectus capitis posterior minor muscle parenchyma may be present in this ligament; additionally, a connective tissue bridge (exhibiting increased vascularity) joining the rectus capitis posterior minor muscle to the spinal dura is frequently present, particularly in the midline [14, 26 – 28]. This myoligamentous complex (comprising the <b>posterior</b> atlanto-occipital <b>membrane,</b> interspinous ligament, ligamentum nuchae, rectus posterior major and minor muscles and obliquus capitis supripr and inferior muscles) adds further stability to the craniocervical junction [29].

Methods: We reviewed the clinical records of four consecutive patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy in one eye for the treatment of optic disc pit-associated maculopathy, with an emphasis on the preoperative condition of the <b>posterior</b> hyaloid <b>membrane.</b> Results: Two of four eyes were confirmed to have an attached <b>posterior</b> hyaloid <b>membrane,</b> which was subsequently removed during surgery.

40|$|AbstractBackground The axons of retinal {{ganglion}} neurons form {{a precise}} topographic map in the optic tectum in the midbrain, and {{the guidance of}} retinal axons by directional cues in the tectum is crucial in this process. Several in vitro systems have been developed {{in order to identify}} the molecular basis of these directional cues. Temporal, but not nasal, retinal axons avoid <b>posterior</b> tectal <b>membranes</b> and grow on anterior membranes as a result of repellent guidance activities that are linked by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors to the <b>posterior</b> <b>membranes.</b> A putative GPI-anchored repulsive guidance molecule with a molecular weight of 33 kDa has previously been characterized. Indirect results from experiments in vitro support the hypothesis that this 33 kDa molecule guides temporal retinal axons. Results To assess whether the 33 kDa protein is involved in axon guidance in vitro, we raised monoclonal antibodies against molecules that had been removed from tectal membranes by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which cleaves GPI anchors. A monoclonal immunoglobulin M, F 3 D 4, recognized the 33 kDa molecule. In combination with chromophore-assisted laser inactivation, F 3 D 4 caused a loss of the repellent activity from <b>posterior</b> tectal <b>membranes</b> in vitro. As a result, temporal retinal fibers were no longer repelled by <b>posterior</b> tectal <b>membranes.</b> This demonstrates that the F 3 D 4 antigen, which we name RGM (repulsive guidance molecule) is involved in the guidance of retinal axons in an assay in vitro. In vivo, the expression of RGM increases from the anterior to the posterior pole of the optic tectum. Conclusions These findings not only support the hypothesis that retinal axons are guided by gradients of repulsive guidance molecules but, in combination with earlier studies of receptor kinases and their ligands that act during guidance, argue for the presence of several repellent guidance molecules with similar functions in vitro and expression patterns in vivo...|$|R
