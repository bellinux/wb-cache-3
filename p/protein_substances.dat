While earlier menotropin medications contained FSH and LH at a 1:1 ratio, the recognition that it is FSH that is critical for follicle stimulation has led to development of newer preparations that contain a much higher FSH/LH ratio, Fertinex being an example.|$|E

40|$|Adipose {{tissue is}} {{involved}} in etiopathogenesis of insulin resistance and subsequent metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Mechanisms responsible for this association are investigated vigorously. One of the well accepted mechanisms linking excessive accummulation of adipose tissue with a development of insulin resistance are free fatty acids, which are released into circulation after hydrolysis of triglycerides stored in adipose tissue {{in a process of}} lipolysis. Impairments in a regulation of lipolysis are described in obese patients and lead to increased plasma level of free fatty acids and to impaired mobilisation of energy stores during exercise. In this PhD thesis, regulation of lipolysis in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissuewas investigated using microdialysis technique. In the first paper we have observed that dysregulation in catecholamine-induced lipolysis and impaired insulin action in adipose tissue can be improved by dynamic-strength training in obese men.
