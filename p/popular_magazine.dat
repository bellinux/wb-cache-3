5|$|Horatio William Bottomley (23 March 1860– 26 May 1933) was an English financier, journalist, editor, {{newspaper}} proprietor, swindler, and Member of Parliament. He is {{best known}} for his editorship of the <b>popular</b> <b>magazine</b> John Bull, and for his patriotic oratory during the First World War. His career came to a sudden end when, in 1922, he was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Trollope's {{fortunes}} suffered {{because of}} the mode of the novel's publication. Owing to mismanagement by the publishers, it was not serialised in a <b>popular</b> <b>magazine,</b> as originally intended. Instead, it was issued as monthly numbers, a form of serialisation that had become unpopular with the reading public, and Trollope lost readers as a result.|$|E
5|$|After being blacklisted by the KMT, Hu left China for Europe in 1928. She briefly {{shared an}} {{apartment}} with He Xiangning in Berlin, and through the introduction of He's son Liao Chengzhi and Cheng Fangwu, she joined the Chinese-speaking group of the Communist Party of Germany. He Xiangning also introduced Hu to Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen. When Soong's mother died, Hu accompanied Soong back to China to attend her funeral in July 1931, before returning to Germany. In 1932, her image appeared on the <b>popular</b> <b>magazine</b> Liangyou (The Young Companion).|$|E

5|$|In 1906 Bottomley entered {{parliament}} as Liberal Party {{member for}} Hackney South. In {{the same year}} he founded the <b>popular</b> <b>magazine</b> John Bull, which became a platform for Bottomley's trenchant populist views. Financial extravagance and mismanagement continued to blight his career, and in 1912 he had to resign from parliament after being declared bankrupt. The outbreak of war in 1914 revived his fortunes; as a journalist and orator Bottomley became a leading propagandist for the war effort, addressing well over 300 public meetings. His influence was such that it was widely expected that he would enter the War Cabinet, although he received no such offer.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the most}} {{politically}} charged and detailed weapons effects information was censored during this period. The Hiroshima-based magazine, Chugoku Bunka for example, in its first issue published March 10, 1946, devotes itself to detailing the damage from the bombing. Similarly, there was no censorship of the factually written witness accounts, the book Hiroshima written by Pulitzer Prize winner John Hersey, which was originally published in article form in the <b>popular</b> <b>magazine</b> The New Yorker, on August 31, 1946, {{is reported to have}} reached Tokyo in English by January 1947, and the translated version was released in Japan in 1949. The book narrates the stories of the lives of six bomb survivors from immediately prior to, and months after, the dropping of the Little Boy bomb. Beginning in 1974 a compilation of drawings and artwork made by the survivors of the bombings began to be compiled, with completion in 1977 and under both book and exhibition format, it was titled The Unforgettable Fire.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Kuwait's {{press was}} {{described}} {{as one of the}} freest in the world. Kuwait was the pioneer in the literary renaissance in the Arab region. In 1958, Al Arabi magazine was first published, the magazine {{went on to become the}} most <b>popular</b> <b>magazine</b> in the Arab world. Many Arab writers moved to Kuwait because they enjoyed greater freedom of expression than elsewhere in the Arab world. The Iraqi poet Ahmed Matar left Iraq in the 1970s to take refuge in the more liberal environment of Kuwait.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Gottlieb {{distributor}} Raymond Moloney {{found it}} hard to obtain more Baffle Ball units to sell. In his frustration he founded Lion Manufacturing to produce a game of his own design, Ballyhoo, named after a <b>popular</b> <b>magazine</b> of the day. The game became a smash hit. Its larger playfield and ten pockets made it more challenging than Baffle Ball, selling 50,000 units in 7 months. Moloney eventually changed the name of his company to Bally to reflect the success of this game. These early machines were relatively small, mechanically simple and designed to sit on a counter or bar top.|$|E

25|$|After Oesch was {{released}} from prison in February 1948, he devoted himself to military history, researching and writing extensively on Finnish experiences in World War II. His book on the battles of summer 1944 is still a valuable study on the subject. Oesch {{was also one of the}} founders and chief editor of a <b>popular</b> <b>magazine</b> on World War II Finnish history. He was made a Doctor of Philosophy honoris causa by the University of Turku in 1960. But when Oesch died in Helsinki on 28 March 1978, he was still embittered because he didn't reach the rank of full general even in the post-war years, when a number of retired officers were given honorary promotions in reserve.|$|E
25|$|By 1911, Wyeth {{began to}} move away from Western {{subjects}} and on to illustrating classic literature. He painted a series for an edition of Treasure Island (1911), by Robert Louis Stevenson, thought by many to be his finest group of illustrations. The proceeds from this great success paid for his house and studio. He also illustrated editions of Kidnapped (1913), Robin Hood (1917), The Last of the Mohicans (1919), Robinson Crusoe (1920), Rip Van Winkle (1921), The White Company (1922), and The Yearling (1939). He did work for prominent periodicals, including Century, Harper's Monthly, Ladies' Home Journal, McClure's, Outing, The <b>Popular</b> <b>Magazine,</b> and Scribner's. His early works were sold outright at a handsome price, but only much later did he receive royalties. Wyeth would read a book thoroughly before doing the contracted illustrations, and he specifically created scenes that were thinly described in the book, adding details and mood of his own, as in Old Pew (1911).|$|E
25|$|Pulp covers {{were printed}} in color on higher-quality (slick) paper. They were {{famous for their}} half-dressed damsels in distress, usually {{awaiting}} a rescuing hero. Cover art played a major part in the marketing of pulp magazines. The early pulp magazines could boast covers by some distinguished American artists; The <b>Popular</b> <b>Magazine</b> had covers by N.C. Wyeth, and Edgar Franklin Wittmack contributed cover art to Argosy and Short Stories. Later, many artists specialized in creating covers mainly for the pulps; {{a number of the}} most successful cover artists became as popular as the authors featured on the interior pages. Among the most famous pulp artists were Walter Baumhofer, Earle K. Bergey, Margaret Brundage, Edd Cartier, Virgil Finlay, Frank R. Paul, Norman Saunders, Nick Eggenhofer, (who specialized in Western illustrations), Hugh J. Ward, George Rozen, and Rudolph Belarski. Covers were important enough to sales that sometimes they would be designed first; authors would then be shown the cover art and asked to write a story to match.|$|E

25|$|Shōnen Sekai was {{mentioned}} various times in many English novels. In the novel The New Japanese Women: Modernity, Media, and Women in Interwar Japan mentioned Shōnen Sekai in the notes to chapter 3 {{as one of}} many magazines that Hakubunkan made to relate to different parts of society. Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War also mentioned Shōnen Sekai as a <b>popular</b> <b>magazine</b> of that time, with an additional mention to Shōjo Sekai, its female equivalent. Issei: Japanese Immigrants in Hawaii mentioned Shōnen Sekai as just a publication of Hakubunkan. In the novel No Sword to Bury: Japanese Americans in Hawai'i During World War II had mention of Shimanuki Hyotayu who writes about immigration matters in Shōnen Sekai. Shōnen Sekai was also mentioned in both The Similitude of Blossoms: A Critical Biography of Izumi Kyōka (1873–1939), Japanese Novelist and Playwright and Japan's Modern Myths: Ideology in the Late Meiji Period.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, Dunham {{returned}} from international touring with her {{company for a}} brief stay in the United States, where she suffered a temporary nervous breakdown after the premature death of her beloved brother Albert. He had been a promising philosophy professor at Howard University and a protégé of Alfred North Whitehead. During this time, she developed a warm friendship with the psychologist and philosopher Erich Fromm, whom she had known in Europe. He {{was only one of}} a number of international celebrities who were Dunham's friends. In December 1951, a photo of Dunham dancing with Ismaili Muslim leader Prince Ali Khan at a private party he had hosted for her in Paris appeared in a <b>popular</b> <b>magazine</b> and fueled rumors that the two were romantically linked. Both Dunham and the prince denied the suggestion. The prince was then married to actress Rita Hayworth, and Dunham was now legally married to John Pratt; a quiet ceremony in Las Vegas had taken place earlier in the year. The couple had officially adopted their foster daughter, a 14-month-old girl they had found as an infant in a Roman Catholic convent nursery in Fresnes, France. Named Marie-Christine Dunham Pratt, she was their only child.|$|E
500|$|The European Union and the United States as well {{as other}} western {{countries}} remain critical of the Eurasian Economic Union, with analysts stating that without modernisation and real economic reforms, the union will have little impact. The <b>popular</b> <b>magazine</b> The Economist stated that the advantages of joining the union remain unclear and further remarked [...] "The agreement was vague, with technical details left unresolved, making it a political show rather than an economic one". Outlets have also stated that without Ukraine, the Eurasian Economic Union has lost a key member state necessary {{to the success of the}} union. Bloomberg's business magazine, Businessweek has affirmed that joining Putin's Eurasian Union looks like a bad deal, including for Russia. The union [...] "won't really register on the radar of the global economy," [...] said an analyst at the EU's Institute for Security Studies in Paris.|$|E

500|$|The {{first issue}} {{included}} [...] "Wolf of the Steppes", a werewolf story by Greye La Spina. [...] This had been submitted to The <b>Popular</b> <b>Magazine</b> but purchased by Clancy for The Thrill Book in 1918, when Street & Smith began making {{plans for the}} new magazine. [...] The story was the first by La Spina, whose real name was Fanny Greye Bragg; she {{would go on to}} publish several more stories in The Thrill Book, and later became a regular contributor to Weird Tales. [...] Another first story was [...] "The Thing That Wept", by Charles Fulton Oursler, who later went on to edit Liberty and to write novels under the name Anthony Abbot. [...] Two serials were begun in the first issue: [...] "The Jeweled Ibis" [...] by J.C. Kofoed, and [...] "In the Shadows of Race", by J. Hampton Bishop. [...] Both contained enough fantastic or science-fictional elements to fit the original plans for the magazine: [...] "The Jeweled Ibis" [...] was about worshippers of the ancient Egyptian gods, and Bishop's story was about a lost race in Africa, and included intelligent apes. [...] The cover for the first issue was by Sidney H. Riesenberg; Bleiler describes it as [...] "shabby and second-rate" [...] by comparison to cover art in successful magazines of the day such as Adventure and Detective Story Magazine. [...] The May 1 issue included an early short story by Seabury Quinn, [...] "The Stone Image", which features a character named Dr. Towbridge, who would later appear (renamed Dr. Trowbridge) in Quinn's popular occult detective stories about Jules de Grandin, though Quinn had not yet invented de Grandin. [...] Tod Robbins, a well-regarded writer of fantasy, supplied several short pieces, all [...] "shallow mood sketches" [...] without much substance, in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley. [...] The contributors included Sophie Louise Wenzel, who later published stories in Weird Tales under the name Sophie Wenzel Ellis, but most of the writers from Hersey's editorship, such as George C. Jenks and John R. Coryell—both authors of dime novels—are no longer well-known names.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century popular {{magazines}} typically did not print fiction {{to the exclusion}} of other content; they would include non-fiction articles and poetry as well. [...] In October 1896, the Frank A. Munsey company's Argosy magazine was the first to switch to printing only fiction, and in December of that year it switched to using cheap wood-pulp paper. [...] This is now regarded by magazine historians as having been the start of the pulp magazine era. [...] For twenty years pulp magazines were successful without restricting their fiction content to any specific genre, but in 1915 the influential magazine publisher Street & Smith began to issue titles that focused on a particular niche, such as Detective Story Magazine and Western Story Magazine, thus pioneering the specialized and single-genre pulps. [...] In the midst of these changes, some time in 1918, Street & Smith's circulation manager, Henry Ralston, decided to launch a new magazine to publish [...] "different" [...] stories: [...] "different" [...] meant stories that were unusual or unclassifiable in some way, which in most cases meant that they included either fantasy or science fiction elements. [...] In The Fiction Factory, Quentin Reynolds' history of Street & Smith, Reynolds asserts that the magazine was the brainchild of Ormond G. Smith, one of the publishers, but pulp historian Will Murray regards this as unlikely to be the full story, given that Reynolds' book was written almost forty years later and was an [...] "approved" [...] history. [...] Murray asserts that Ralston was certainly involved in the creation of The Thrill Book. [...] Walter Adolphe Roberts, the editor of Street & Smith's Ainslee's Magazine, told a friend of his, Harold Hersey, that Ralston was looking for an editor for a new magazine. [...] Hersey had sold some writing to the pulps but his editorial experience was limited to no more than a year's work on several little magazines. [...] He met with Ralston in early 1919 and was immediately hired {{on the basis of the}} interview. [...] It is possible that Eugene A. Clancy, the editor of Street & Smith's The <b>Popular</b> <b>Magazine,</b> was originally intended to be the editor of The Thrill Book, but was unable to take on the additional work, though Clancy did assist Hersey on some issues of The Thrill Book. [...] Bringing Hersey on as editor was unfortunate; historians of the field describe Hersey as lacking talent both as a writer and an editor.|$|E
