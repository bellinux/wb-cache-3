25|$|Many {{phones are}} able to decode {{barcodes}} using their built-in camera, as well. Google's mobile Android operating system uses both their own Google Goggles application or third party barcode scanners like Scan. Nokia's Symbian operating system features a barcode scanner, while mbarcode is a QR code reader for the Maemo operating system. In Apple iOS 11, the native camera app can decode QR Codes and can link to URLs, join wireless networks, or perform other operations depending on the QR Code contents. Other paid and free apps are available with scanning capabilities for other symbologies or for earlier iOS versions. With BlackBerry devices, the App World application can natively scan barcodes and load any recognized Web URLs on the device's Web browser. Windows Phone 7.5 is able to scan barcodes through the Bing search app. However, these devices are not designed specifically for the capturing of barcodes. As a result, they do not decode nearly as quickly or accurately as a dedicated barcode scanner or <b>portable</b> <b>data</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E

40|$|The problem {{faced by}} the {{officers}} read electricity meter reading {{is still a lot}} of officers who perform duty of PLN-meter manually. This problem arises because the facility <b>Portable</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Terminal</b> (PDT) is not owned by all officers who have read the meter. Condition they should record the electric meter manually from house to house, and still {{have to go back to}} the office to record meter input data to the server. This problem arises from the idea to make an application as a substitute for <b>Portable</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Terminal.</b> Applications that want to be made, of course applications that make it easier and very possible to be held by all of meter reader?s staff. Application will be made with a mobile base using QR Code technology to replace the existing barcode. Why should the QR Code? Since the QR Code is a sort of 2 Dimensional barcode that contains more data than a barcode, and just using the Mobile camera to scan it. Customer data entered into the Mobile Scan using the QR Code and data entry for data that are dynamic or changeable. Input data is then sent to the server via GPRS Connection HTP, save it into the database. Counting applications on the server takes all the data sent, count them and save the results of a calculation to the database again...|$|E

50|$|Two Humvee-mounted Ground Control Stations (GCS), {{also part}} of the Shadow 200 system, control the {{aircraft}} in flight. Each station has an associated Ground <b>Data</b> <b>Terminal</b> (GDT), which takes commands generated by the GCS and modulates them into radio waves received by the aircraft in flight. The GDT receives video imagery from the payload, as well as telemetry from the aircraft, and sends this information to the GCS. A trailer, towed by the M1165 GCS support vehicle, carries the GDT and houses a 10 kW Tactical Quiet Generator to provide power for its associated GCS. The Shadow 200 system also includes a Portable Ground Control Station (PGCS) and <b>Portable</b> Ground <b>Data</b> <b>Terminal</b> (PGDT), which are stripped-down versions of the GCS and GDT designed as a backup to the two GCSs.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the start}} of the programme, the {{capabilities}} of the UDTs (based on 700 MHz Pentium processors) have evolved, their original 256 MB RAMs and 20 GB drives having been superseded by 512 MB RAMs and 40 GB drives. The contractor for supply of <b>Portable</b> User <b>Data</b> <b>Terminal</b> (PUDTs), based on a 266 MHz Intel StrongARM processor, was L-3 Communications. The PUDT is now obsolete and is not used. Extensive problems with the software running on low powered computers led to the procurement of a number of enhanced computers, the Lightweight Tablet (LTDT) manufactured by Blazepoint and Lightweight Manpack (LMDT) produced by L-3. In addition to processing limitations, the larger UDTs have significant ergonomic issues and were supplemented with a buy of General Dynamics Itronix computers modified in the UK by Blazepoint to support systems managers and communication planners.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry lags behind other industries in adopting new information technologies (ITs). The current construction procedures used to transfer data {{need to be}} updated. The most common data capture technologies are bar code and radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging. Although bar code and RFID systems are quite different, they might accomplish the same tasks.;In fact, so many new data capture technologies now exist that industry managers are often perplexed when they plan a new system. This research develops a decision tool that enables decision makers in the {{construction industry}} to select the most appropriate data capturing technology for their construction applications. This decision tool is a systematic evaluation model based upon the Multi-Attribute Utility theory (MAUT).;This Multi-Attribute Utility Model (MAUM) can be adapted to evaluate other construction-related applications such as construction equipment, building methods, and new projects. MAUM is also a good group decision-making tool that considers all decision makers 2 ̆ 7 concerns and objectives.;MAUM 2 ̆ 7 s feasibility as a decision tool was assessed by both laboratory technicians and information technology professionals (ITPs) at six material testing labs, both private and government. Aggregate utilities were calculated for 10 different bar code and RFID <b>portable</b> <b>data</b> <b>terminals</b> (PDTs). These aggregate utilities simultaneously combine technical-merit, economic-merit, and low-risk merit utilities for the PDTs. Two RFID and one bar code systems achieved the greatest aggregate utilities, indicating that some bar code systems can be better than other RFID systems.;There were not many significant differences between government and private labs, although private labs are profit oriented and thus more cost conscious, making them more selective in systems technical performance. The study showed that ITPs are more concerned about technical specifications of the PDTs, while technicians are more concerned about its environmental reliability. Sensitivity analysis revealed that changes in model interaction relationships, system cost, and the aggregation rules had no major effect on the ranking of top systems...|$|R
