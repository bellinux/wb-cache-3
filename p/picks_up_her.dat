2500|$|MSN Music {{picked the}} album as Album of the Week and praised it with four-out-of-five star review, noting: [...] "It {{may be a}} cliché, but Jones has proven that heartbreak makes good music." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News was also {{positive}} about the album, writing it shows [...] " [...] undeniably darker Norah than we've heard before", {{and gave it a}} four-out-of-five-star review, opining that: [...] "True to its title, Little Broken Hearts amounts to an end-of-the-relationship concept album, told {{from the point of view}} of a woman in full control of her poisonous feelings. Unsurprisingly, Jones went through a break-up right before creating the music. To seal the mood, she came up with a sound as broodingly coherent as the soundtrack to a domestic drama." [...] The Washington Post positive, highlighting the opening track of the record, [...] "Good Morning" [...] and said: [...] "Thematic albums are increasingly rare these days, good ones rarer still. Jones and Burton pull it off." [...] Boston Globe praised the album, saying: [...] "There are enough good musical ideas here to keep the mind from wandering, and it brings her squarely into contemporary pop without sounding contrived." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune gave it a three-out-of-four star review and said: [...] "There are enough good musical ideas here to keep the mind from wandering, and it brings her squarely into contemporary pop without sounding contrived." [...] musicOMH was positive, giving the album four-out-of-five stars and praised the team for the collaboration and remarked: [...] "The team assembled here have done something quite remarkable, and this new-found partnership between Jones and Burton could perhaps lead to some very fine collaborations on future albums." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer Will Hermes said [...] "her [...] fifth album is a brand-rejigging songwriting collab with Brian [...] "Danger Mouse" [...] Burton that both <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> pace and pumps up her palette," [...] awarding it three-and-a-half stars out of five and closed the review with: [...] "even good girls need revenge sometimes." [...] Enio Chiola of PopMatters also gave a positive review of the album, scored it as seven out of ten, praised Jones for her writing skill and said: [...] "Instead of picking apart the tracks that work best, the entire album plays like a cohesive whole, somehow frayed and fragmented if not left intact." [...] Spins review was very positive, scoring it as eight out of ten and writing: [...] "Little Broken Hearts is exciting because it explores the darkest corners of betrayal, bad love, and jealousy with enough vitality to propel Jones out of the bloodless purgatory of brunch music." [...] Andrea Warner of Exclaim! was also very positive, noting: [...] "This Norah Jones is damaged, dangerous and vulnerable, and Burton's mastery of sound helps deepen the relationship between listener and song." ...|$|E
