5|$|The Republic of Ireland is a {{parliamentary}} democracy {{based on the}} British model, with a written constitution and a popularly elected <b>president</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> mostly ceremonial powers. The government is headed by a prime minister, the Taoiseach, who is appointed by the President on the nomination of the lower house of parliament, the Dáil. Members of the government are chosen from both the Dáil and the upper house of parliament, the Seanad. Its capital is Dublin.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Singapore underwent several significant changes. Non-Constituency Members of Parliament {{were introduced in}} 1984 to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as MPs. Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) was introduced in 1988 to create multi-seat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in parliament. Nominated Members of Parliament were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected non-partisan MPs. The Constitution was amended in 1991 to provide for an Elected <b>President</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> veto power {{in the use of}} national reserves and appointments to public office. The opposition parties have complained that the GRC system has made {{it difficult for them to}} gain a foothold in parliamentary elections in Singapore, and the plurality voting system tends to exclude minority parties.|$|E

25|$|In 1943 George Lynn Cross {{took over}} as {{president}} of the university, two years after the U.S. entered World War II. He served until 1968, 25 years later, becoming the longest-serving president in history of the university. Five presidents served in the next 25 years.

25|$|Officially, {{as there}} is no Minister of Defense, the Mexican military's two {{components}} are not under the command of a single, unified forces commander at any level below the <b>President,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a military role under the national constitution: Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces (Comandante Supremo De Las Fuerzas Armadas). According to the Constitution of Mexico the President is the Army's only five-star general. (This is comparable to most other countries with a presidential system of government, such as the United States.) Instead, a Secretary, who is a serving officer—an Army four-star general or a Navy admiral—heads each department and branch (The Secretariats of National Defense and the Navy). Each minister serves in a dual capacity: as a full cabinet member reporting to the President, and as the operational commander of their branch, but because of politics and rank, the Navy is subordinate to the Army.|$|E
25|$|The PAP rule is termed authoritarian by some {{activists and}} {{opposition}} politicians {{who see the}} strict regulation of political and media activities by the government as an infringement on political rights. In response, the government of Singapore underwent several significant changes.

25|$|Despite the variability, all {{but four}} presidents {{have been able}} to appoint at least one justice. William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office, though his {{successor}} (John Tyler) made an appointment during that presidential term. Likewise, Zachary Taylor died 16 months after taking office, but his successor (Millard Fillmore) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Andrew Johnson, who became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction {{in the size of the}} Court. Jimmy Carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice. Somewhat similarly, presidents James Monroe, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and George W. Bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice, but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office. No <b>president</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> served more than one full term has gone without at least one opportunity to make an appointment.|$|E

500|$|He next co-starred with Jennifer Aniston in {{the romantic}} drama Love Happens, {{released}} in September 2009, as a motivational speaker {{coming to terms}} with his own grief. The movie received ambivalent reviews, with a contributor of the Orlando Sentinel reporting that Eckhart plays [...] "broken" [...] for the whole movie. The following year he starred alongside Nicole Kidman in Rabbit Hole (2010), an adaption of David Lindsay-Abaire's 2005 drama of the same name. The feature premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2011, Eckhart starred in Jonathan Liebesman's science fiction film , in which he portrayed a combat veteran Marine platoon sergeant. The film was set in modern-day Los Angeles during a global alien invasion, and followed a platoon of U.S. Marines who are joined by an Air Force special operations sergeant and some Army infantry soldiers in combat operations against the alien enemy. He appeared alongside Johnny Depp, Richard Jenkins, and Amber Heard in Hunter S. Thompson's novel adaptation The Rum Diary, directed by Bruce Robinson. In the film, Eckhart played Sanderson, a wealthy landowner, who believes everything has a price and introduces Paul Kemp (Depp) to a different standard of living. He recently appeared as the U.S. <b>President</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been taken hostage in the 2013 action thriller Olympus Has Fallen.|$|E

500|$|In Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs (1971), the High Court {{affirmed that}} {{with respect to}} the President's {{satisfaction}} that a person is acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore, mala fides or bad faith was [...] "not... a justiciable issue {{in the context of the}} Act and the power conferred by the Act on a body such as the <b>President</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to direct the issue of an order of detention if the President is satisfied with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore etc". Essentially, this means that the President's satisfaction is subjective, and not objective. The effect of this decision is that [...] "the Constitution left it to the executive, and not the judiciary, to decide what national security required". Subsequently, in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal took a different stand, holding that the objective test should apply to the review of the exercise of discretion under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. (Section 10 empowers the Minister to direct that a detention order be suspended [...] "as the Minister sees fit", as well as to revoke such a direction.) The Court said that [...] "the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law" [...] because [...] "all power has legal limits", and therefore the exercise of discretionary power warrants examination by the court.|$|E
2500|$|The Constitution was amended in 1991 {{to provide}} for an Elected <b>President</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> veto power {{in the use of}} {{national}} reserves and appointments to public office. The opposition parties have complained that the GRC system has made {{it difficult for them to}} gain a foothold in parliamentary elections in Singapore, and the plurality voting system in the [...] constituencies of Singapore, especially large group representation constituencies, tends to exclude minority parties. The system has been defended by the PAP because the system encourages representation of the minority races by requiring a minority candidate in group representation constituencies.|$|E

2500|$|This clause {{is known}} as the Presentment Clause. Before a bill becomes law, it must be {{presented}} to the <b>President,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the President signs the bill, it becomes law. If he disapproves of the bill, he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections. This procedure has become known as the veto, although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One. The bill does not then become law unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill becomes law, unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated. In the latter case, the President, by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session, exercises a [...] "pocket veto", which Congress may not override. In the former case, where the President allows a bill to become law unsigned, there is no common name for the practice, but recent scholarship has termed it a [...] "default enactment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2012 op-ed for CNN, Fluke {{described}} {{what she called}} [...] "President Barack Obama and former [...] Mitt Romney's vastly different values and visions", specifically mentioning Obama's support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, increasing the government's investment of Pell Grant scholarships, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Fluke described Obama as [...] "a <b>president</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> consistently shown he will defend [...] rights while working {{to ensure that all}} women and men have all the protections and opportunities they need to pursue economic success". Fluke later introduced President Obama at an August 2012 campaign rally in Denver and spoke in support of the president at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, describing the Republican Party's platform as [...] "an offensive, obsolete relic of our past". The Los Angeles Times described Fluke as [...] "a symbolic presence in a convention that has been dominated by Democrats reaching out for the votes of women". Congressman Joe Walsh of Illinois responded to the speech by saying that Fluke was acting [...] "entitled" [...] and told her to [...] "get a job"; Fluke wrote in response that Walsh [...] "disparage my generation", and questioned why many elected officials' answer to struggling Americans was [...] "cutting their safety net".|$|E
2500|$|However, Cornell law {{professor}} Josh Chafetz {{argued that the}} problem with the pardon was not so much the process (as the president's power on this issue is broad and unqualified), but rather that [...] "Arpaio’s entire claim to national recognition was based on his being a xenophobe, a racist and an officer of the machinery of government who relished wielding that machinery to degrade some of the most powerless members of our society." [...] Cornell {{law professor}} Jens David Ohlin said that he was disturbed by the pardon, as {{it was part of a}} troubling pattern of disrespect towards the role of the judiciary within the constitutional structure. [...] Adam Liptak, attorney and Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times, questioned the wisdom of the pardon but not its legitimacy: [...] "It was the first act of outright defiance against the judiciary by a <b>president</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> not been shy about criticizing federal judges who ruled against his businesses and policies. But while the move may have been unusual, there is nothing in the text of the Constitution’s pardons clause to suggest that he exceeded his authority. The president, the clause says, 'shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.' The pardon power extends only to federal crimes. Otherwise, presidents are free to use it as they see fit. As the Supreme Court put it in an 1866 decision involving a former Confederate senator, Ex Parte Garland, the power 'is unlimited.'" ...|$|E
