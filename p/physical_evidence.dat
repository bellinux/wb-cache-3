40|$|Intangible {{nature of}} {{services}} makes {{it necessary to}} implement different advertising strategies. Academics studying on services marketing have suggested various managerial frameworks about services advertising to tangibilize the services {{in the minds of}} consumers. Presenting <b>physical</b> <b>evidences</b> of services, providing documents, using symbols, showing the customer and personnel interaction are among these suggestions. Various researches about services advertising indicate that advertising strategies in practice, do not match with the suggestions of the theory. In this research services advertising are analyzed by content analysis. 133 services advertisements that appeared in 12 issues of Capital Journal are chosen for analysis. The content of the advertisements are analyzed in terms of price information, quality claim, use of symbols, headline, advertising appeal, availability of web address, personnel, customer, personnel and customer interaction and availability of <b>physical</b> <b>evidences.</b> Services Advertising, Differences Between Theory and Practice, Content Analysis. ...|$|R

5|$|The Mary Rose was {{substantially}} rebuilt in 1536. The 1536 rebuilding {{turned a}} ship of 500 tons {{into one of}} 700 tons, and added an entire extra tier of broadside guns to the old carrack-style structure.

5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published.
