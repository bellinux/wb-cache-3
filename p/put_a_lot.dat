In 1952, he purchased {{a house on}} Markham Street to expand backwards, using original tactics to thwart the area's residential zoning. In 1959, the ward's alderman was displeased by traffic jams near the store, and persuaded City Council to adopt a 1960 report urging the store to build a parking lot.

25|$|Apart {{of these}} active {{interventions}} into Nubian affairs, the Mameluks also <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{pressure on the}} Christians inside their borders. The patriarch of Alexandria was forced to cancel the dispatchment of priests to Alwa, which was problematic, since Alodia, like the other Coptic nations of Africa, was dependent upon Egyptian bishops. The consequential deterioration of Christian faith is attested by Portuguese sources from the early 16th century. A traveller and companion of Francisco Álvares, who visited Nubia in around 1500, states that the Nubians considered themselves Christian, but were so lacking in Christian instruction {{that they had no}} actual knowledge of the faith. In 1520, Nubian ambassadors reached Ethiopia and asked the emperor for priests. They claimed that no more priests could reach Nubia because of wars between Muslims, leading to a decline of Christianity in their land.|$|E
