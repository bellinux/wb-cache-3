50|$|Ferroelectric {{polymers}} {{and other}} materials have been incorporated into many applications, {{but there is still}} cutting edge research that is currently being done. For example, there is research being conducted on novel ferroelectric polymer composites with high dielectric constants. Ferroelectric polymers, such as polyvinylidene fluoride and poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene P(VDF-TrFE), are very attractive for many applications because they exhibit good piezoelectric and pyroelectric responses and low acoustic impedance, which matches water and human skin. More importantly, they can be tailored to meet various requirements. A common approach for enhancing the dielectric constant is to disperse a high-dielectric-constant ceramic powder into the polymers. Popular ceramic powders are lead based complexes such as PbTiO3 and Pb(Zr,Ti)O3. This can be disadvantageous because lead can be potentially harmful and at high <b>particulate</b> <b>loading,</b> the polymers lose their flexibility and a low quality composite is obtained. Current advances use a blending procedure to make composites that are based on the simple combination of PVDF and cheap metal powders. Specifically, Ni powders were used to make up the composites. The dielectric constants were enhanced from values there were less than 10 to approximately 400. This large enhancement is explained by the percolation theory.|$|E

The pre-dominant indoor air pollutant to which two billion of the world's population is exposed is biomass fuel smoke. We tested the hypothesis that reported smoke exposure in men and women is associated with increased alveolar macrophage uptake of biomass smoke particulates. Healthy volunteers attending for research bronchoscopy in Malawi completed a questionnaire assessment of smoke exposure. Particulate matter visible in alveolar macrophages (AM) was quantified using digital image analysis. The geometric mean of the percentage area of the cytoplasm occupied by particulates in 50 cover-slip adherent AM was calculated and termed <b>particulate</b> <b>load.</b> In 57 subjects (40 men and 17 women) {{there was a significant}} difference between the <b>particulate</b> <b>load</b> in groups divided according to pre-dominant lighting form used at home (anovaP = 0. 0009) and type of cooking fuel (P = 0. 0078). <b>Particulate</b> <b>load</b> observed in macrophages is associated with the reported type of biomass fuel exposure.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to study the aerodynamic thermal regeneration of a metallic fibrous particulate filter, which was used to reduce particulate emissions from diesel vehicles. Heated air diluted with nitrogen was used to initiate the regeneration process. Temperatures at 11 locations inside the filter were measured with embedded thermocouples which were equally spaced in the axial direction. Based on the temperature data, the instantaneous heat release of the filter was derived and analyzed. The peak regeneration temperature was found to occur at the region near the filter exit, and fibers in this region could melt when the temperature was sufficiently high. The normal regeneration temperature was around 800 °C to 1000 °C but local temperature {{could be as high}} as 1300 °C. Thermal regeneration of the filter was found to depend on several factors, including, oxygen concentration in the heated air, initial <b>particulate</b> <b>loading,</b> packing density, thickness of the filtering element, and flow rate of the heated air. It was found that for regeneration to occur, the temperature of the heated air should exceed 500 °C, the filtering element should have a minimum thickness of 50 mm and a minimum initial <b>particulate</b> <b>loading</b> of 2 gram. Regeneration, and hence, heat release, was found to start earlier at higher oxygen concentration in the heated air, higher heated air flow rate, lower packing density and higher initial <b>particulate</b> <b>loading.</b> Regeneration temperature was higher at higher oxygen concentration in the heated air, lower heated air flow-rate, higher packing density and higher initial <b>particulate</b> <b>loading.</b> The results had also been compared with those of Kim et al.

Gordon 1, 2 and Kevin Mortimer 1, 2 Background: Air pollution is associated with a high burden or morbidity and mortality, but exposure cannot be quantified rapidly or cheaply. The particulate burden of macrophages from induced sputum may provide a biomarker. We compare the feasibility of two methods for digital quantification of airway macrophage <b>particulate</b> <b>load.</b> Methods: Induced sputum samples were processed and analysed using ImageJ and Image SXM software packages. We compare each package by resources and time required. Results: 13 adequate samples were obtained from 21 patients. Median <b>particulate</b> <b>load</b> was 0. 38 μm 2 (ImageJ) and 4. 0 % of the total cellular area of macrophages (Image SXM), with no correlation between results obtained using the two methods (correlation coefficient = − 0. 42, p = 0. 256). Image SXM took longer than ImageJ (median 26 vs 54 mins per participant, p = 0. 008) and was less accurate based on visual assessment of the output images. ImageJ’s method is subjective and requires well-trained staff. Conclusion: Induced sputum has limited application as a screening tool due to the resources required. Limitations of both methods compared here were found: the heterogeneity of induced sputum appearances makes automated image analysis challenging.

40|$|Background Three {{billion people}} {{are exposed to}} {{household}} air pollution from biomass fuel use. Exposure is associated with higher incidence of pneumonia, and possibly tuberculosis. Understanding mechanisms underlying these defects would improve preventive strategies. Methods We used human alveolar macrophages obtained from healthy Malawian adults exposed naturally to household air pollution, and compared with human monocyte-derived macrophages exposed in vitro to respirable-sized particulates. Cellular inflammatory response was assessed by: IL- 6 and IL- 8 production in response to particulate challenge; phagocytosis of fluorescent-labelled beads and intraphagosomal oxidative burst capacity; ingestion and killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis measured by microscopy and quantitative culture. Particulate ingestion was quantified by digital image analysis. Results We were able to reproduce the carbon loading of naturally exposed alveolar macrophages by in vitro exposure of monocyte derived macrophages. Fine carbon black induced IL- 8 release from monocyte derived and alveolar macrophages (p< 0. 05), with similar magnitude responses (log 10 increases of 0. 93 [SEM 0. 2] vs 0. 74 [SEM 0. 19] respectively). Phagocytosis of pneumococci and mycobacteria was impaired with higher <b>particulate</b> <b>loading.</b> High <b>particulate</b> <b>loading</b> corresponded with a lower oxidative burst capacity (p= 0. 0015). There was no overall effect on killing of M. tuberculosis.

The method is based on the estimation of surface discharge using a simple hydrological model which allows separation of the different flow components of the annual hydrograph. Then the suspended sediment loads can be correlated with the surface discharge. During the study period, the mean annual flow (330 m 3 s− 1) represented only 46 % of the mean long-term flow (1903 – 1984), and the mean yearly <b>particulate</b> <b>load</b> carried by the Senegal River was about 1. 9 million tons. Two approaches are used to estimate the different contributions to the river's suspended sediment transport. The main contribution originates from slope erosion, which supplies 50 – 80 % of the total sediment transport and the second originates from channel erosion. The suspended sediment concentration in the surface runoff, primarily calculated by a global annual method, ranges from 0. 9 to 1. 6 gl− 1 and averages 1. 3 gl− 1.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the mass}} of {{particulate}} matter stored in a diesel particulate filter is imperative for making sound filter regeneration decisions. Currently, the mean-value pressure drop is used to estimate filter <b>particulate</b> <b>load.</b> However, this approach is fraught with accuracy and repeatability problems. In this research, dynamic pressure signal features are examined for this purpose. Specifically, the normalized firing frequency components are extracted from the dynamic pressures upstream, downstream, and across the filter using the complex Fourier Transform for periodic signals. Experimental data show that the firing frequency features appear to have smaller variability and better repeatability than the mean-value pressure drop. In back-to-back filter loading experiments, the mean-value pressure drop varied by around 25 % while variations in the firing frequency features varied by less than about 7 %. The firing frequency features can be used alone or in conjunction with the mean-value pressure drop to improve <b>particulate</b> <b>load</b> estimation. For a loading difference of 0. 25 g/L in the diesel particulate filter, discrimination errors are as high as 3. 4 % using only the mean-value pressure drop, while 0 % error is achieved using the firing frequency features. The discernible <b>particulate</b> <b>load</b> changes can be reduced to less than 0. 25 g/L when the mean-value and firing frequency features are combined. A 1 -D compressible unsteady-flow model was constructed for the flow in the channels of wall-flow diesel particulate filters to study the impact of parameter variations on the firing frequency features. Using this model, the permeability of the porous wall and particulate cake layer demonstrate a nonlinear relationship with the mean-value pressure drop and the firing frequency features. On the other hand, particulate cake layer density has an approximately linear relationship. The simulated firing frequency features were not normalized and showed similar percentage changes with parameter variations. This suggests that the normalization applied to the experimental data is important in suppressing the variations in the firing frequency features. Another important contribution of this research is the construction and validation of a particulate matter measuring system capable of approximately ± 1 g accuracy during steady-state engine operation. ...|$|R
