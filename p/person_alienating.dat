In addition, beliefs can persist because once a person publicly announces a belief, social psychologists have found that he or she is inclined to focus on evidence supporting that belief while conveniently ignoring evidence contradicting it, a logical fallacy known as cherry picking.|$|R

But here began the forming of public joint-stocks, which, together with the East India, African, and Hudson's Bay Companies, before established, begot a new trade, which we call by a new name stock-jobbing, which was at first only the simple occasional transferring of interest and shares from one to another, as <b>persons</b> <b>alienated</b> their estates; but by the industry of the Exchange brokers, who got the business into their hands, it became a trade, and one perhaps managed with the greatest intrigue, artifice, and trick that ever anything that appeared with a face of honesty could be handled with; for while the brokers held the box, they made the whole Exchange the gamesters, and raised and lowered the prices of stocks as they pleased, and always had both buyers and sellers who stood ready innocently to commit their money to the mercy of their mercenary tongues. This upstart of a trade, having tasted the sweetness of success which generally attends a novel proposal, introduces the illegitimate wandering object I speak of, as a proper engine to find work for the brokers. Thus stock-jobbing nursed projecting, and projecting, in return, has very diligently pimped for its foster-parent, till both are arrived to be public grievances, and indeed are now almost grown scandalous.|$|R

After {{reading the}} Richard Van Camp novel, Doron chose {{to write the}} screenplay for the The Lesser Blessed because {{she was interested in}} the idea of a <b>person</b> <b>alienated</b> and living on the margins of society. Doron had begun adapting a screenplay for the book in 2008, and in preparation for the film, she travelled to the Northwest Territories to research the habits and lives of the First Nations people living there. Doron visited Van Camp’s hometown, Fort Smith, and stayed there for a month to write the screenplay. After completing the screenplay, Doron had trouble finding a company to fund the project. In an interview with TED Blog she explains:People would question, ‘Why are you making a story about a First Nations kid?” And I would say, “Why wouldn’t I?” I love the story, I understand the world and I think it’s one of the most original characters in Canadian literature I’ve come across. He happens to be Native. I identify with him because of who he is.The project was eventually funded by Telefilm Canada through the Canada Feature Film Fund in 2012. After receiving funding for the project, Doron returned to Forth Smith for the casting process. Van Camp’s hometown was the last stop on a five-day trip where Doron visited various Native communities in search of the boy who would play Larry Sole, the main character. Doron finally cast Joel Evans in the lead role. She states:On the very last day, as we were leaving and I was considering some kids for call-back, I saw this kid in the hallway cracking jokes and looking exactly the way I had envisioned this character in my head for six years. He didn’t bother coming to the audition because he had a math test and better things to do.The film premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2015, it was announced that Doron would be adapting the screenplay for the 2017 animated feature The Breadwinner.|$|R

5000|$|For some time, {{two kinds}} of {{alienation}} had been occurring. These were [...] "substitution" [...] and [...] "subinfeudation". In substitution, the tenant would alienate his land, and the attendant duties owed to the lord. After alienation, the tenant expected nothing from the new tenant, other than {{the price of the}} alienation. In subinfeudation, the new tenant would become a serf owing feudal duties to the <b>person</b> who <b>alienated.</b> The previous tenant would become the lord to the new tenant. Both these practices had the effect of denying the great lord of the land his rights of feudal estate. The bond of homage was between lord and servant. It was difficult for the medieval mind to think of this in any terms other than as a personal bond. The idea that a feudal bond could be bought or sold was repugnant to the ruling class. All the same, the practice of alienation of rights to the land had been going on in England for some centuries. A tenant who was accepted in homage by the lord could [...] "subinfeudate" [...] to one or more under-tenants. It was difficult or impossible for the overlord to extract any services (such as knight service, rent, homage) from the new tenants. They had no bond to the overlord. Pollock and Maitland give the following example: In the case of subinfeudation, the old tenant was liable for services to the lord. If A enfoeffed to B to hold a knight's service, and then B enfoeffed C to hold as a rent of a pound of pepper per year; B dies leaving an heir within age; A is entitled to a wardship; but it will be worth very little: instead of being entitled to enjoy the land itself until the heir is of age, he will get a few annual pounds of pepper. Instead of enjoying the land by escheat, he will only receive a trifling rent. Quia Emptores in 1290 ended all subinfeudation and made all alienation complete. Once a sale of land was made, the new owner was responsible for all feudal incidents.|$|R

40|$|Introduction While Australia has {{a system}} of {{universal}} franchise, {{in the sense of}} {{a system of}} voting that is broadly inclusionary, there are some notable exceptions – minors and some convicted criminals are excluded, for example. While the political participation of these excluded groups sometimes attracts attention in the media, there is another group that has been even more marginalised, both within society and within debates over the franchise. This group is persons with mental disability or, more precisely, with actual or assumed impaired decision-making capacity resulting from chronic or acute mental illness, dementia, intellectual disability or brain injury. This appears to be changing as individual nations (including Australia) assess their compliance with the United Nations (‘UN’) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (‘CRPD’) on a range of issues and as a greater number of citizens experience dementia in an ageing population. This article seeks to contribute to this reform momentum by comparing the laws relating to this issue across jurisdictions, particularly Japan and Australia, to argue for a political franchise without discrimination against persons with mental disabilities. The article proceeds as follows. Part II provides a broad overview of domestic and international trends in adult guardianship and the political rights of persons with mental disabilities. Part III describes the Japanese legal framework for guardianship, capacity, and voting, and analyses a recent constitutional judgment that resulted in Japan repealing laws that disenfranchised persons with mental disabilities. Part IV describes the Australian position, including the history of provisions that disqualify from voting persons of (in the language of the statute) ‘unsound mind’, to demonstrate that this position is rooted in exclusionary social policies of the late 19 th century and that difficulties in describing the nature of the exclusion have dogged the provision since its inception. Part V draws some comparative lessons to argue that Australia should follow Japan’s lead. Australia should adopt an inclusionary approach to voting that gives vulnerable persons the support and protection necessary to vote rather than an exclusionary approach that <b>alienates</b> <b>persons</b> with mental disabilities from the political community and achieving full citizenship. This Part also argues that a comparative methodology has value in analysing this issue, despite differing institutional frameworks. For example, while constitutional restrictions on the Australian Parliament are arguably weaker with regard to regulating the franchise, the fundamental principles are the same and are normative as well as doctrinal. This point is reinforced by the observation in Part V that that the question of how persons with mental disabilities are integrated into the franchise has deeper significance for the role that electoral law has for constituting a more inclusive citizenry. A comparative approach also provides a model for how international obligations can or should be implemented through domestic law. For these reasons, Part VI concludes by broadly concurring with the recommendations of a recent Australian Law Reform Commission (‘ALRC’) inquiry. In particular, the Australian Parliament should repeal the disqualification from voting and enrolment in section 93 (8) (a) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) (‘Electoral Act’) of persons of ‘unsound mind’ and institute a system of exemptions from compulsory voting for persons established under the National Decision-Making Principles to be incapable of expressing a voting preference even with comprehensive support measures...|$|R
40|$|People are finely {{attuned to}} detect cues of social {{exclusion}} and {{are motivated to}} reestablish social connections when inclusion is threatened. Yet, excluded persons should not be indiscriminate in their choices of affiliation partners. First, the excluded person must decide to either make reparations toward the sources of exclusion or seek inclusion elsewhere. Second, excluded people must be more wary of exploitive social exchanges (e. g., deception) since {{they are no longer}} subject to group norms that entitled them to fair treatment and protection from strangers. Therefore, the excluded person must recalibrate his or her representations of social others to adequately deal with these challenges. The present thesis investigates some of the ways that social exclusion changes social perceptions and preferences. Experiment 1 tested how exclusion affects victims 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of those who exclude them. The experiment used a computerised ball-tossing task with two other ostensibly human players who either included or excluded participants. Participants then rated the dispositions of the ostensible players on five dispositional indices. Sources of exclusion were perceived as more socially powerful compared with sources of inclusion. Moreover, the psychological threat of exclusion was found to mediate perceptions of social power, such that participants who felt more psychological threat perceived the sources as more powerful compared to those who felt less psychological threat. Experiment 2 tested whether excluded people advertise their own social affordances preferentially to more affiliative social interaction partners. The experiment used a writing task to induce feelings of exclusion (or not). Participants then viewed faces of smiling people. Two types of smile were shown: smiles that spontaneously occurred during a pleasant experience (i. e., genuine) and smiles that were posed {{at the request of the}} experimenter (i. e., posed). Facial electromyography recorded participants’ facial muscles during the viewing session. Feelings of exclusion induced participants to selectively smile more to the genuine smiles (but not posed smiles) compared to control participants. This suggests that feelings of exclusion induce people to bias their affiliative gestures toward more affiliative-looking others. Experiments 3 and 4 tested whether exclusion via the computerised ball-tossing task affected victims 2 ̆ 7 preferences for their sources of exclusion. In Experiment 3 participants were first included by one ingroup and one outgroup member and then excluded by a different ingroup and outgroup member. In Experiment 4 participants were first included by either a pair of ingroup (or outgroup) members before being excluded by a ￼ vi different pair of outgroup (or ingroup) members. Results showed that exclusion increased positivity toward sources of exclusion from a more valued ingroup. Sources of exclusion from a valued ingroup were even evaluated more positively than sources of inclusion from the same valued ingroup. Finally, Experiment 5 aimed to replicate and extend the findings of Experiments 3 and 4 by examining whether victims 2 ̆ 7 enhanced evaluations of ingroup excluders predicted a desire to further associate with the excluders. Although participants did report being affected by the exclusion manipulation, the results revealed no evaluative preferences for sources of inclusion or exclusion. Moreover, excluded participants did not express a relative preference in associating with ingroup or outgroup sources of exclusion. Taken together, the findings of this thesis suggest that the effects of social exclusion on person perception adaptively guide excluded persons to preferentially attend to affiliative cues and social affordances in others. Although re-establishing social connections is critical to alleviate the threat caused by exclusion, if affiliation is advertised indiscriminately an excluded <b>person</b> risks further <b>alienating</b> valued relationships or, worse, exploitation by untrustworthy strangers. Restoration of belongingness needs is therefore best served by bestowing the excluded person with a sensitivity (and preference for) social features that will best satiate threats to social connections...|$|R
