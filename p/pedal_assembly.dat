50|$|In {{order to}} create the effect of Herbie driving himself, Disney concocted a {{detailed}} system of sprockets and pulleys connected to a second steering column under the front seat for a rear seat driver. There was also {{a second set of}} <b>pedal</b> <b>assemblies,</b> clutch cables and a shifter extension. In The Love Bug, the rear seat driver sat low enough to see over the windshield but still out of the view of the camera. For Herbie Rides Again and Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, Disney installed a hood-mounted Carello fog light that concealed a small camera which allowed the rear seat driver to view the street and sit lower.|$|R
50|$|An Addressograph {{system of}} the 1960s was {{essentially}} a Graphotype debossing machine for preparing address plates, a cassette-style plate feeder, a heavy-duty, rapidly moving inked ribbon, a platten for hand-feeding the mail piece, and a foot pedal for stamping the address. The individual steel address plates were inserted into card-sized frames which {{had a series of}} slots along the top where colored metal flags could also be inserted for sorting purposes. The plate assemblies were placed in steel cassettes resembling library card catalogue drawers, which were manually inserted into the machine. At the press of the foot <b>pedal</b> the plate <b>assemblies</b> were swapped in sequence in a similar fashion to a slide projector, placing an impression of the raised type onto the mail piece.|$|R
5000|$|Elected not {{to qualify}} after having signed {{for the ride}} between {{practice}} sessions, and having completed only four laps in practice because {{of a change in}} the <b>pedal</b> <b>assembly</b> to fit his size. He was allowed to start the race {{at the back of the}} field.|$|E
50|$|Carried {{over from}} the 207 RC, the {{interior}} received grinium finish decor with front and rear bucket seats as well as RC front and rear mat covers. The steering wheel too, with a granium finish ring and numbered from 1 to 2000. The gearshift lever knob, <b>pedal</b> <b>assembly,</b> foot rest and door sill are in aluminium.|$|E
5000|$|The Brubaker Box was {{assembled}} on {{a complete}} Volkswagen Type I chassis. Due to the extended {{length of the}} body {{compared to that of}} a standard Volkswagen Beetle the foot <b>pedal</b> <b>assembly</b> was relocated forward and up from the standard position. For increased safety the fuel tank was moved from the front {{to the center of the}} vehicle.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) is presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. The independent analysis results corresponding to the Orbiter Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) Subsystem hardware are documented. The function of the GNC hardware is to respond to guidance, navigation, and control software commands to effect vehicle control and to provide sensor and controller data to GNC software. Some of the GNC hardware for which failure modes analysis was performed includes: hand controllers; Rudder <b>Pedal</b> Transducer <b>Assembly</b> (RPTA); Speed Brake Thrust Controller (SBTC); Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU); Star Tracker (ST); Crew Optical Alignment Site (COAS); Air Data Transducer Assembly (ADTA); Rate Gyro Assemblies; Accelerometer Assembly (AA); Aerosurface Servo Amplifier (ASA); and Ascent Thrust Vector Control (ATVC). The IOA analysis process utilized available GNC hardware drawings, workbooks, specifications, schematics, and systems briefs for defining hardware assemblies, components, and circuits. Each hardware item was evaluated and analyzed for possible failure modes and effects. Criticality was assigned based upon {{the severity of the}} effect for each failure mode...|$|R

According to the Toyota recall information, it is this device, which in some instances, has been preventing the accelerator pedal from returning to zero. To quote from the Toyota recallFAQ: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{total number}} of hours {{accumulated}} on all Helicycles flying {{is estimated to be}} well in excess of 3,000 flight hours, with three fatal accidents, the latest occurring on 28 September 2014 in rural Sumner county, Tennessee. There have been several accidents and incidents where Helicycles have lost power in/near hover, resulting in minor damage to the skids and some airframes, but no serious injuries. Most of these were attributed to a radio-frequency interference (RFI) problem with the electronic governor, and the issue was reportedly solved with better shielding in 2005. At least one accident may have been caused by a crack in a fuel line due to lack of mechanical support between a manifold and a fuel injection port. Another accident involved flight into high-voltage power distribution wires, but the aircraft was able to fly again, following repairs, and the pilot was not seriously injured. The NTSB report on the fatal accident indicates extensive damage to the helicopter due to impact with a body of water. An examination of the anti-torque <b>pedal</b> <b>assembly</b> by the NTSB Materials Laboratory revealed that the fracture surface patterns found on it were consistent with a bending overstress separation. It could not be determined whether the overstress condition {{was the result of a}} precrash or postcrash event. According to the probable cause report, N3275Q suffered [...] "inflight collision with terrain/water", and [...] "reason for occurrence undetermined - Pilot In Command".|$|E

40|$|Formula Student {{challenges}} collegiate teams {{around the}} world to compete against one another in global racing competitions. Global Formula Racing (GFR) is a collaboration between Oregon State University and German at Duale Hochshule Baden- Wurttemberg Ravensburg students to build a racecar. The task assigned was to create a <b>pedal</b> <b>assembly</b> for the 2014 car that would better perform than the pervious years design. The primary goal was weight reduction, because the pedals are located {{at the front of the}} car, reducing weight there has a greater affect on the center of gravity and weight transfer. Every component started from scratch and was designed from the ground up. By utilizing data from previous years, a better, lighter concept for each part was designed. Each component was also designed for simplicity of adjustment, using as few different tool sizes as possible. Catia was used as the CAD modeling software. Using the built in finite element analysis (FEA), each part designed to withstand loadings according to driver input forces. Using this method for design allowed for fewer components to be bought, with only bearings being purchased. The brake pedal alone was 214 grams lighter than last years pedal. The assembly has been tested and drove the team to victory at Formula Student Michigan...|$|E
40|$|The VCU FSAE {{team has}} a need for foot {{controls}} for the brakes and throttle on their newest race car. The assembly must meet the rules set forth by the FSAE organization to compete, and must be as light and low as possible to conserve the acceleration and handling characteristics of the car. Furthermore, the project must be completed on a budget of $ 500 allotted to Senior Design teams. The FSAE team has been working on the current car since 2005 and has yet to produce a drivable race car. The Senior Design teams this year cover the major systems needed to make the car run and compete in the national competition in Michigan. In order to conduct the first acceleration test, a foot control for the throttle must be present, and will soon mandate the need for control of the brakes. Goals for the pedal box include: simplicity of manufacture, durability, minimal weight, and low center of gravity. In the initial design phase, the options that would have raised the center of gravity were eliminated. Of the low-mount designs, options that would have required complex machining or non-standard parts were eliminated. Finally, any parts that could be made of lightweight materials were specified as such. The team has concluded on a robust and simple design for production. The final part of the design will be to eliminate weight through optimization, making sure that the materials are as thin as possible within a factor of safety. The results of the analysis may even show that symmetry in the 4 clamps used for repositioning the <b>pedal</b> <b>assembly</b> may be foregone in favor of fewer clamps mounted asymmetrically. Throughout this process, the design must be proven as safe given that there will be someone driving the car and –hopefully- at race-winning speeds. [URL]...|$|E
