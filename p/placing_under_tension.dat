The recurrence was indirect in 300, direct in 241, and various other in 43 operations. The causes of the indirect recurrences appeared to be an unrecognized hernia, incomplete dissection or improper ligation of the sac, failure to narrow the cord, or inadequate reconstruction of the internal ring. No cause for the diffuse direct recurrences was apparent. Of the 241 hernias in Hesselbach's triangle, 144 were small localized defects, usually (112) just lateral to the symphysis.

5000|$|Adopt a {{rotating}} frame at {{the midpoint of}} the string. Suppose the frame rotates at the same angular rate as the balls, so the balls appear stationary in this rotating frame. Because the balls are not moving, observers say they are at rest. If they now apply Newton's law of inertia, they would say no force acts on the balls, so the string should be relaxed. However, they clearly see the string is <b>under</b> <b>tension.</b> (For example, they could split the string and put a spring in its center, which would stretch.) To account for this tension, they propose that in their frame a centrifugal force acts on the two balls, pulling them apart.

40|$|The elbow, {{the middle}} joint {{of the upper}} limb, enables the hand to be placed at various {{distances}} from the body. The articular, muscular and neuromotor complexity of the elbow is such that it is often prone to stiffness, especially if immobilized {{for long periods of}} time. Therefore, mobilization of the posttraumatic elbow must be started early. In the presence of lesions to the ligamentous structures, the joint must be protected to prevent these structures from being <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> during movement. Rehabilitation of the elbow includes the use of braces. Different types of brace are used depending on clinical situation and the objectives to be achieved. They can have fixed protection or locked articulation, allow an adjustable range of movement to restrict flexion-extension and pronation-supination, or allow dynamic and static progressive movement. The latter plays a special role in conservative treatment and following surgical release.

50|$|The {{collagen}} fibre bundles in cattle hide {{are arranged in}} a complex weaving pattern. The fibres are often at angles as much as 90 degrees to the skin surface. Cattle hide also contains sweat glands, erector pili muscles and a distinct gradation in elastin levels, concentrated in {{the upper part of}} the skin. Kangaroo hide on the other hand has been shown to have a highly uniform orientation of fibre bundles in parallel with the skin surface. It does not contain sweat glands or erector pili muscles and elastin is evenly distributed throughout the skin thickness. This structural uniformity explains both the greater tensile strength of the whole leather and the greater retention of strength in splits. Bovine skin is much more complex in cross section. Hence in whole section it has many more weak points from which tears can start when <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension.</b> In addition when sliced into splits the {{collagen fibre}}s running at significant angles to the skin surface will be cut.

[...] Lewis was responsible {{for a number of}} new firearms designs while working for various firearms manufacturers, including the Army's 40mm break-open grenade launcher and the [...]357 caliber Colt Trooper revolver. Lewis had previously invented an interchangeable barrel system for revolvers, and this system was incorporated into the Dan Wesson prototype. While nearly all revolvers are constructed with a barrel screwed tightly to a frame (which must be removed and installed by an experienced gunsmith), Lewis' idea was to house the barrel tube within a separate shroud secured by a nut at the muzzle, which places tension on the barrel and provides support {{at both ends of the}} barrel. By unscrewing the muzzle nut, the shroud and barrel could be removed and replaced with different barrel lengths and shroud configurations. The fact that the DW barrel is supported and <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> at both ends (along with the ability to fine-tune barrel-cylinder gap) resulted in markedly increased accuracy over conventional revolver designs.|$|R

This {{is indicative of}} the action of the cell wall-loosening protein expansin. Wall extension had a pH optimum of around 4. 0 and was abolished by boiling. Acid-induced extension of boiled cell walls could be reconstituted by addition of salt-extracted rice or cucumber cell wall proteins. Cucumber expansin antibody recognized a single protein band of 24. 5 -kD apparent molecular mass on immunoblots of rice cell wall proteins. Expansins were partially purified by concanavalin A affinity chromatography and sulfopropyl (SP) cation-exchange chromatography. The latter yielded two peaks with extension activity (SP 20 and SP 29), and immunoblot analysis showed that both of these active fractions contained expansin of 24. 5 -kD molecular mass. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of SP 20 expansin is identical to that deduced from the rice expansin cDNA Os-EXP 1. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of SP 29 expansin matches that deduced from the rice expansin cDNA Os-EXP 2 in six of eight amino acids. Our results show that two expansins occur in the cell walls of rice internodes and that they may mediate acid-induced wall extension...|$|R

30|$|Limitations of {{this study}} should be pointed out. The model chosen does not use the tendon nor the bone in {{question}} in the human procedure. However, the authors’ preliminary investigation included screening rats and rabbits. These smaller animals have ossified tarsal bones very early in life. Similarly, the majority of tarsal bones in the porcine model were ossified {{at the time of}} birth. However, the calcaneal apophysis was unique as it was unossified at birth, its surgical exposure simple, and in close proximity of the flexor tendon used for transfer. Another potential limitation is the relatively rapid ossification of this apophysis, as ossification began by 3 weeks of age instead of the 3 years it typically takes for the middle cuneiform to ossify in humans. While a potential limitation, this rapid maturation will allow for simple future investigations into the long-term effects of these transfers and the effects of alternative techniques. Also, the tendon transfers in these animals were not <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> and were not immobilized, as is routine when the procedure is performed in children.

40|$|The {{space station}} {{configuration}} currently studied utilizes structures which require struts to be hinged {{in the middle}} in the stowed mode and locked into place in the deployed mode. Since {{there are hundreds of}} hinges involved, it is necessary that they have simple, positive locking features with a minimum of joint looseness or slack. This invention comprises two similar housings hinged together with a spring loaded locking member which assists in making as well as breaking the lock. This invention comprises a bracket hinge and bracket members with a spring biased and movable locking member. The locking or latch member has ear parts received in locking openings where wedging surfaces on the ear parts cooperate with complimentary surfaces on the bracket members for bringing the bracket members into a tight end-to-end alignment when the bracket members are in an extended position. When the locking member is moved to an unlocking position, pivoting of the hinge about a pivot pin automatically places the locking member to retain the locking member in an unlocked position. In pivoting the hinge from an extended position to a folded position, longitudinal spring members are <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> over annular rollers so that the spring tension in a folded position assists in return of the hinge from a folded to an extended position.

40|$|A {{model of}} a {{three-dimensional}} dual-sidestay landing gear mechanism is presented and employed in {{an investigation of the}} sensitivity of the downlocking mechanism to attachment point deflections. A motivation for this study is the desire to understand the underlying nonlinear behaviour, which may prevent a dual-sidestay landing gear from downlocking under certain conditions. The model formulates the mechanism as a set of steady-state constraint equations. Solutions to these equations are then continued numerically in state and parameter space, providing all state parameter dependencies within the model from a single computation. The capability of this analysis approach is demonstrated with an investigation into the effects of the aft sidestay angle on retraction actuator loads. It was found that the retraction loads are not significantly affected by the sidestay plane angle, but the landing gear’s ability to be retracted fully is impeded at certain sidestay plane angles.

Sidestay flexibilities and attachment point deflections are then introduced to enable the downlock loads to be investigated. The investigation into the dual sidestay’s downlock sensitivity to attachment point deflections yields an underlying double hysteresis loop, which is highly sensitive to these deflections. Attachment point deflections of a few millimetres were found to prevent the locklinks from automatically downlocking under their own weight, hence requiring some external force to downlock the landing gear.

40|$|Poly (L-lactic Acid) (PLLA) is a semicryst. and {{biocompatible}} polymer {{that is used}} in bioresorbable vascular scaffolds {{for the treatment of}} Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). To treat CHD, a PLLA scaffold is deployed in the occluded artery to restore blood circulation. Implants made of PLLA undergo hydrolysis to form L-lactic acid that is readily metabolized by the human body, allowing them to harmlessly disappear in two years. The polymer is subjected to tube expansion and laser cutting before it is crimped onto a balloon. When the crimped scaffold is in position in the diseased artery, the balloon is inflated to deploy the scaffold. The resulting semicryst. structure changes over distances of a few microns, requiring X-ray microdiffraction to shed light on the structural changes that occur in PLLA vascular scaffolds which govern their therapeutic function. Crimping places the outer bend (OB) of a U-crest under elongation and the inner bend (IB) under compression. X-ray diffraction patterns indicate highly oriented PLLA crystallites where elongation was imposed (near the OB) and crystallites tilted out of plane where compression was imposed (at the IB). Between the IB and the OB, there is an unperturbed region with an orientation similar to the expanded tube. Deployment profoundly alters the structure created during crimping. The tilting of crystallites at the IB during crimping allows them to gracefully sep. into diamond shaped voids when the IB is <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> during deployment. Consequently, the OB experiences relatively mild compressive stress during deployment and a highly uniform structure is obsd.

40|$|In the West Antarctic {{sector of}} Gondwana, {{early stages of}} {{break-up}} {{are associated with the}} large Antarctic-Karoo-Tasman basalt province. Formation of this within-plate province was synchronous with active margin tectonics and development of both a proto-Pacific margin magmatic suite along the Antarctic Peninsula and the extensive Tobífera volcanic suite associated with the Rocas Verdes marginal basin system of southern South America and South Georgia. Extension, concurrent with subduction and oceanward migration of the magmatic focus, resulted in a broad extensional province in a back-arc and intra-arc-setting. High geothermal gradients and basalt underplating caused crustal melting on the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula and formation of bimodal basalt-rhyolite suites. Large-ion lithophile element enriched initial rifting magmas were succeeded, at least in part of the Rocas Verdes basin, by early drift magmas of transitional chemistry and then by entirely asthenospheric MORB magmas representing lithospheric rupture and sea-floor spreading. A plate interaction model is proposed for the initial stages of Gondwana break-up relating the broad zone of mantle melting to a reduction in subduction-plate boundary forces. The change from Gondwanide compression to lithospheric extension in the Jurassic may be linked to a change from shallow to steeply dipping subduction, and to a slowing of subduction rates caused by a change in plate boundary zone parameters. A possible reduction of compressive boundary stresses may have enabled unconfined, overthickened Permo-Triassic crust to extend because of gravitational instability, thus facilitating break-up. We suggest that break-up was not plume-related, but was due to variations in the regional stress field associated with changing plate-boundary forces. The continental crust was <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> with substantial lithospheric thinning and decompression melting of an enriched mantle source forming the broad linear zone of within-plate magmatism.

40|$|The {{stability}} of 20 m tall trees was investigated by pulling them {{over with a}} winch. The turning moment at the stem base was resolved into two components, one due to the applied force, {{and the other to}} the horizontally displaced weight of the stem and crown. Vertical displacement of the root-soil system was measured and observations made of the progressive failure of the soil around and underneath the root-soil plate. When trees were pulled from the crown region, the soil failed when the crown had deflected c. 4 m horizontally and when the applied force was only about 70 % of that required for uprooting. By the time that the maximum turning moment at the stem base due to the applied force had been reached, many roots had broken, CTown deflection was c. 8 m and the deflected weight of the stem and crown made a substantial contribution to the uprooting forces. By repeatedly pulling trees during a sequence of cutting or breaking the roots and soil, the total resistive turning moment afforded by the anchorage was resolved into the following components: i. soil resistance (the resistance to uprooting afforded by the soil underneath and at the sides of the root system); ii. the resistance of roots <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> on the windward perimeter; iii. the weight of the root-soil plate; and iv. resistance to bending at the hinge on the leeside.

40|$|We {{predict that}} the {{presence}} of extended defects can reduce the mechanical strength of a ceria nanorod by 70 %. Conversely, the pristine material can deform near its theoretical strength limit. Specifically, atomistic models of ceria nanorods have been generated with full microstructure, including: growth direction, morphology, surface roughening (steps, edges, corners), point defects, dislocations and grain-boundaries. The models were then used to calculate the mechanical strength as a function of microstructure. Our simulations reveal that the compressive yield strengths of ceria nanorods, ca. 10 nm in diameter and without extended defects, are 46 and 36 GPa for rods oriented along [211] and [110] respectively, which represents almost 10 % of the bulk elastic modulus and are associated with yield strains of about 0. 09. Tensile yield strengths were calculated to be about 50 % lower with associated yield strains of about 0. 06. For both nanorods, plastic deformation was found to proceed via slip in the { 001 } plane with direction - a primary slip system for crystals with the fluorite structure. Dislocation evolution for the nanorod oriented along [110] was nucleated via a cerium vacancy present at the surface. A nanorod oriented along [321] and comprising twin-grain boundaries with { 111 } interfacial planes was calculated to have a yield strength of about 10 GPa (compression and tension) with the grain boundary providing the vehicle for plastic deformation, which slipped in the plane of the grain boundary, with an associated slip direction. We also predict, using a combination of atomistic simulation and DFT, that rutile-structured ceria is feasible when the crystal is <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension.</b> The mechanical properties of nanochains, comprising individual ceria nanoparticles with oriented attachment and generated using simulated self-assembly, were found to be {{similar to those of the}} nanorod with grain-boundary.

40|$|Kinetochores {{are large}} multiprotein {{structures}} through which chromosomes {{engage with the}} microtubules of the mitotic spindle. All kinetochore pairs must ultimately adopt a bioriented configuration, with their associated sister chromatids linked to opposite spindle poles and poised to segregate equally between two daughter cells. Erroneous, non-bioriented attachments that are left uncorrected lead to chromosome mis-segregation, producing aneuploid daughter cells with unequal numbers of chromosomes. Before anaphase onset, bioriented attachments are selectively stabilized whereas non-bioriented attachments remain unstable and are eliminated. This error correction process relies heavily {{on the extent of}} outer kinetochore phosphorylation by an Aurora B kinase activity centered at the inner centromere, between the two members of a kinetochore pair. Phosphorylation of Aurora B substrates at the outer kinetochore tends to destabilize kinetochore-microtubule attachments by lowering the affinity with which outer kinetochore proteins bind to spindle microtubules. Reduced phosphorylation, and attachment stabilization, are associated with the kinetochore’s capacity to stretch when <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> by the pulling force exerted by microtubule plus end dynamics. Such intrakinetochore stretch in response to mechanical tension generally occurs only at bioriented attachments. This Dissertation examines kinetochore-microtubule attachment stabilization and error correction in Drosophila melanogaster. Experimental deletion of an extendible, structurally disordered segment of the Drosophila kinetochore protein CENP-C is found to be associated with attachment instability and an increased incidence of chromosome misalignment. That association can be explained in terms of reduced intrakinetochore stretch and an inability of the metaphase spindle to pull the outer kinetochore away from inner centromere-based Aurora B. On that view, selective stabilization of bioriented attachments in wild type cells depends on changes in the distance between the inner centromere and the kinetochore-microtubule binding interface. Separately, it is shown that erroneous, syntelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments can be stabilized, and the phosphorylation-based error correction system overridden, by overexpressing the Drosophila chromokinesin motor NOD. NOD overexpression artificially increases the magnitude of the polar ejection force that pushes chromosome arms away from the spindle poles. In turn, the elevated polar ejection force increases the tension experienced by syntelically attached kinetochore pairs, stabilizing what would ordinarily be a highly unstable form of attachment...|$|R

Others use either the firearm's recoil or {{a small portion of}} the propellant gas drawn from the barrel, to operate the firearm's mechanism and ready it for the next shot. Such firearms are sometimes called [...] "self-loading," [...] but are more commonly known as semi-automatic, if they fire one shot for every pull of the trigger, or automatic or [...] "full-auto" [...] if they continue to fire until the trigger is released and the magazine is empty.|$|R

Their characteristics are conserved between plants and humans, and a variety of biological activities have been associated with them. The identification of S/MARs within genomic sequences has proved to be unexpectedly difficult, as they do not appear to have consensus sequences or sequence motifs associated with them. We have shown that S/MARs do share a characteristic structural property, they have a markedly high predicted propensity to undergo strand separation when <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> negative superhelical <b>tension.</b> This result agrees with experimental observations, that S/MARs contain base-unpairing regions (BURs). Here, we perform a quantitative evaluation of the association between the ease of stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) and S/MAR binding activity.

40|$|The {{glenohumeral}} joint is the articulation between the glenoid of the scapula {{and the head}} of the humerus; its high mobility requires a combination of active and passive stabilisers to maintain a functional joint. The aim of this thesis was to establish the mechanical properties of the glenohumeral capsule and model its contribution to stability of the joint. A six degree of freedom cadaveric testing apparatus was constructed and instrumented to facilitate laxity experiments of glenohumeral specimens in any physiological position. A pilot study examining rotational laxity of the specimens in different positions was performed to determine the optimum position for preconditioning, which was found to be 30 ° glenohumeral abduction with a minimum axial rotation moment of 0. 5 Nm. The second stage of cadaveric testing investigated the effect of negative intra-articular pressure on joint laxity and established the envelope of translational laxity for varying levels of abduction, flexion and axial rotation. Venting the joint capsule was found to significantly increase translation in certain positions, whilst the role of the long head of biceps tendon was also studied and found to significantly reduce translations when <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension.</b> Pathology of the superior glenoid labrum was simulated, repaired and tested, and a clinical test for these lesions was also replicated using the testing apparatus. However, little mechanical effect was observed in the pathology simulation experiments. The ultimate strength of the lesion repairs was also tested and found that the primary cause of failure was tendon mid-substance rupture. The data from cadaveric testing was used to evaluate a computational model of the glenohumeral ligaments and modify the parameters to improve the accuracy of the simulations. A musculoskeletal model of the upper limb, capable of predicting the muscle forces at the shoulder, was modified to accept additional inputs due to the ligament forces. The sensitivity of the ligament model and the musculoskeletal model to the ligament parameters was also analysed. Through these techniques, the ligament forces were found to increase predicted {{glenohumeral joint}} force and shoulder muscle activation at higher levels of abduction and forward flexion. The results of this work can be used to improve surgical techniques and rehabilitation for a range of different shoulder pathologies. Future study should focus on improving geometrical wrapping techniques and model assumptions not covered in this work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
