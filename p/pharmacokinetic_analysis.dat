Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with a slow onset and long duration of action.

In addition, cell culture evaluations {{designed to determine}} optimum PPMO length, and <b>pharmacokinetic</b> and toxicity <b>analysis</b> of PPMO were also carried out. Results: Mock-treated AG 129 mice lived for 9 – 17 days following intraperitoneal (ip) infection with 104 – 106 pfu of DENV- 2 (strain New Guinea C). Intraperitoneal administration of 50 SL or 30 CS PPMO before and after DENV infection produced {{an increase in the}} average survival time of up to 8 days. Animals receiving only post-infection PPMO treatment did not benefit significantly. Cell culture studies showed that PPMO of 22 – 24 bases long produced substantially higher DENV titre reductions than did PPMO that were either shorter or longer. <b>Pharmacokinetic</b> and toxicology <b>analysis</b> with non-infected animals showed that nine consecutive once-daily ip treatments of 10 mg/kg PPMO resulted in high concentrations of PPMO in the liver and caused little impact on overall health. Conclusions: The data indicate that PPMO had considerable antiviral efficacy against DENV- 2 in the AG 129 mouse model and that PPMO treatment early in the course of an infection was critical to extending the survival times of DENV- 2 -infected mice in the AG 129 model system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>pharmacokinetic</b> (PK) <b>analysis</b> {{of breast}} MRI data using prior methods like the Tofts model-based {{approaches}} involved {{the estimation of}} the amount of contrast agent (CA) fed to the tissue, called the Arterial Input Function (AIF). The Mohan-Shinagawa model (henceforth referred to as the M-S model), is a novel expanded model (derived from the Tofts model) proposed in (1). It analytically eliminated the AIF from the analysis but required the robust selection of suitable reference regions across images. In this paper, the authors propose a novel framework for Tofts model estimation, using the M-S model as an intermediate stage. The advantages are that the AIF estimation is eliminated, and the final estimated PK parameters are independent of the reference region selected. This highly simplifies the overall analysis and improves the robustness in population studies by reducing the bias introduced by the reference region selection while keeping the advantages of the M-S framework including a reduction in scattered false positives. Also, as compared to the M-S model, the physical interpretation of the Tofts model parameters is well documented (2).

40|$|Current {{methods of}} {{studying}} angiogenesis {{are limited in}} their ability to serially evaluate in vivo function throughout a target tissue. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and pharmacokinetic modeling provide a useful method for evaluating tissue vasculature based on contrast accumulation and washout. While it is often assumed that areas of high contrast enhancement and washout comprise areas of increased angiogenesis and tumor activity, the actual molecular pathways that are active in such areas are poorly understood. Using DCE-MRI in a murine subcutaneous tumor model, we were able to perform <b>pharmacokinetic</b> functional <b>analysis</b> of a tumor, coregistration of MRI images with histological cross-sections, immunohistochemistry, laser capture microdissection, and genetic profiling of tumor heterogeneity based on pharmacokinetic parameters. Using imaging as a template for biologic investigation, we have not found evidence of increased expression of proangiogenic modulators at the transcriptional level in either distinct pharmacokinetic region. Furthermore, these regions show no difference on histology and CD 31 immunohistochemistry. However, the expression of ribosomal proteins was greatly increased in high enhancement and washout regions, implying increased protein translation and consequent increased cellular activity. Together, these findings point to the potential importance of posttranscriptional regulation in angiogenesis and the need for the development of angiogenesis-specific contrast agents to evaluate in vivo angiogenesis at a molecular level...|$|R

40|$|When {{performing}} a population <b>pharmacokinetic</b> modelling <b>analysis</b> covariates are often {{added to the}} model. Such additions are often justified by improved goodness of fit and/or decreased in unexplained (random) parameter variability. Increased goodness of fit is most commonly measured by the decrease in the objective function value. Parameter variability {{can be defined as}} the sum of unexplained (random) and explained (predictable) variability. Increase in magnitude of explained parameter variability could be another possible criterion for judging improvement in the model. The agreement between these three criteria in diagnosing covariate-parameter relationships of different strengths and nature using stochastic simulations and estimations as well as assessing covariate-parameter relationships in four previously published real data examples were explored. Total estimated parameter variability was found to vary with the number of covariates introduced on the parameter. In the simulated examples and two real examples, the parameter variability increased with increasing number of included covariates. For the other real examples parameter variability decreased or did not change systematically with the addition of covariates. The three criteria were highly correlated, with the decrease in unexplained variability being more closely associated with changes in objective function values than increases in explained parameter variability were. The often used assumption that inclusion of covariates in models only shifts unexplained parameter variability to explained parameter variability appears not to be true, which may have implications for modelling decisions...|$|R

The information collected included patient-related demographic variables (age, weight, gender, and other underlying illness), the individual's dosing regimens (dose and dosing interval), time of blood drawn, and the resulting tobramycin concentration. Neural networks were trained with this information to capture the relationships between the plasma tobramycin levels and the following factors: patient-related demographic factors, dosing regimens, and time of blood drawn. The data were also analyzed using a standard population pharmacokinetic modeling program, NONMEM.
