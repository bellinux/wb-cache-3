40|$|This paper {{explains}} the multifacet technology for analyzing <b>performance</b> <b>examinations</b> and the fair average method of setting criterion standards. The multidimensional nature of <b>performance</b> <b>examinations</b> requires that multiple and often different facets {{elements of a}} candidate's examination form be accounted for in the analysis. After this is accomplished, all candidate ability estimates are located on the same scale. The fair average standard setting method, while substantially different from more traditional methods, provides a criterion standard in a score metric that is easy for most people to understand. Yet, it accounts for {{the influence of the}} particular facets elements in each test form, and can be used to establish a pass point that applies appropriately to all candidates regardless of the raters or tasks or problems on each candidate's <b>examination.</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>examinations</b> are extremely complex {{because of the number of}} possible examination forms that may occur during an administration...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the impact of self-efficacy and {{intelligence}} on <b>performance</b> on <b>examinations.</b> As reported by Gist (1987), an experience of mastering a task or ability (e. g., examination) is one way to influence self-efficacy. This study suggests that personal self efficacy regarding examinations is very important to student success at first, but that over time other factors negate this advantage. For example, the student???s initial view of their intelligence can impact their <b>performance</b> on <b>examinations.</b> However, an effective and positive learning experience during the course can increase performance and minimize the impact of their perception of his or her intelligence on their <b>performance</b> on <b>examinations...</b>|$|R

40|$|For planning, developing, implementing, {{and scoring}} a <b>performance</b> <b>examination,</b> the {{assessment}} design {{is the basis}} for the construction of meaningful ability estimates. The purpose of a <b>performance</b> <b>examination</b> is to infer candidate abilities that go beyond the particular sample of tasks, items, and judges encountered. Whether the goal is to make reproducible pass/fail decisions or to position candidates according to demonstrated ability, the <b>performance</b> <b>examination</b> must measure candidate ability consistently. This is most efficiently accomplished by using a latent trait model to give examinees an ability estimate which is independent of the current value of individual facet elements, such as judges, tasks and items. Thus, candidate ability estimates are comparable regardless of the particular judge or examination encountered. This paper applies a multi-facet Rasch mode to the analysis of two medical performance examinations. Comments concerning the facets typically included in <b>performance</b> <b>examination</b> designs are followed by a description of the multi-facet Rasch latent trait model used.

SAMPLE: A total of 579 students from two secondary schools. METHOD: Data were collected over four waves at approximately 3 -month intervals. Behavioural engagement data were collected at T 1 and T 3, fear appeal frequency and appraisal at T 3, and <b>examination</b> <b>performance</b> at T 2 and T 4.

There was a change of curriculum from a 2 -year program to a 3 -year program, and eventually to a 4 -year one. As a result, a profound approach to subject revision of the Korean Optometrist Licensing Examination became necessary from the perspective of optometrist manpower and its management system.
