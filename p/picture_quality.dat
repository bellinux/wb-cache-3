5|$|The {{original}} home video release of The Fifth Element {{took place in}} North America on 10 December 1997, on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD. The original DVD presented the film in its original 2.39:1 anamorphic widescreen format though carried no special features. The film was released in Sony's Superbit format in October 2001. In his review, Conrad Jeremy from IGN gave the <b>picture</b> <b>quality</b> of the original DVD release 9 out of 10, though awarded the Superbit version a perfect score for <b>picture</b> <b>quality.</b> Overall the Superbit version was given 8 out of 10; the final score was brought down by the version's complete lack of special features.|$|E
5|$|The DVD {{includes}} stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 {{sound and}} presents the video {{in its original}} 1.33:1 aspect ratio. An error in the sound mix on this DVD left much of Peter Frampton's guitar playing scarcely audible. Pegg claimed that as a result, although the <b>picture</b> <b>quality</b> is superior on the DVD release, the original VHS or 1999 DVD remain a superior choice for audio.|$|E

Alternative dyes such as pen ink and aniline have variable coloring efficiency. In this work, Brachiaria decumbens roots, discolored with caustic soda (NaOH), were stained with açai, annatto, saffron, trypan blue and pen inks.

5|$|The DVD {{version was}} re-{{released}} in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008. A Laserdisc version of The Phantom Menace {{was released in}} Japan several months before it was available on DVD in the U.S. The Star Wars films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011; The Phantom Menace was restored to improve the <b>picture</b> <b>quality</b> and remove the magnification present on the previous DVD release, restoring approximately 8 percent of the picture to the frame. In the Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, the Yoda puppet was replaced with a CGI model, making it consistent with the other films of the prequel trilogy.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{has become much}} more positive in recent years. Film critic James Berardinelli summed this up in his review of the movie: [...] "with the exception of one production aspect, [...] is by far the best entry of the long-running James Bond series. The film contains some of the most exhilarating action sequences ever to reach the screen, a touching love story, and a nice subplot that has agent 007 crossing (and even threatening to resign from) Her Majesty's Secret Service. The problem is with Bond himself... George Lazenby is boring, and his ineffectualness lowers the <b>picture's</b> <b>quality.</b> Lazenby can handle the action sequences, but that's about all he masters." ...|$|R

25|$|Peter Stephens' only {{film as a}} director, Mustang!, was {{released}} through United Artists in 1959. It {{was based on the}} book Capture of the Golden Stallion by Rutherford Montgomery, and tells of the attempts by occupants of a ranch first to kill a troublesome wild mustang horse, and then to capture and tame it. He had been approached by film producers Robert Franklyn and Sam Abarbanel to make the Western in the early 1950s, and shooting took place in California and Oklahoma, with the final edit ready by 1955. Unfortunately, the <b>picture</b> <b>quality</b> was poor, reputedly because it had been shot with 16mm film and then enlarged to 35mm.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Japanese {{version of}} King Kong vs. Godzilla is infamous for {{being one of}} the most poorly-preserved tokusatsu films. In 1970, director Ishiro Honda prepared an edited version of the film for the Toho Champion Festival, a children's matinee program that showcased edited re-releases of older kaiju films along with cartoons and then-new kaiju films. Honda cut twenty-four minutes from the film's original negative, and as a result, the highest quality source for the cut footage was lost. For years all that was thought to remain of the uncut 1962 version was a faded, heavily damaged 16mm element from which rental prints had been made. 1980s restorations for home video integrated the 16mm deleted scenes into the 35mm Champion cut, resulting in wildly inconsistent <b>picture</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{refers to}} {{determining}} the opinions or sentiments expressed on different features or aspects of entities, e.g., {{of a cell}} phone, a digital camera, or a bank. A feature or aspect is an attribute or component of an entity, e.g., the screen of a cell phone, the service for a restaurant, or the <b>picture</b> <b>quality</b> of a camera. The advantage of feature-based sentiment analysis is the possibility to capture nuances about objects of interest. Different features can generate different sentiment responses, for example a hotel can have a convenient location, but mediocre food. This problem involves several sub-problems, e.g., identifying relevant entities, extracting their features/aspects, and determining whether an opinion expressed on each feature/aspect is positive, negative or neutral. The automatic identification of features can be performed with syntactic methods, with topic modeling, or with deep learning. More detailed discussions about this level of sentiment analysis {{can be found in}} Liu's work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{algorithm}} for generating {{a high quality}} test bit-stream to evaluate the static image quality of DTV receiver based on a target bit allocation {{in the process of}} rate control. In order to allocate the number of target bits, we consider the normalized complexities, which are updated or maintained according to GOP <b>picture</b> <b>qualities.</b> The proposed rate control method is suitable for compression of static test pattern while MPEG- 2 Test Model 5 is suitable for moving picture. To evaluate the performance of pro-posed algorithm, the test bitstream are generated by an MPEG- 2 software en-coder using the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that average PSNR of the proposed method is higher than those of the conventional case. With experiment in DTV system, we have confirmed that the proposed algorithm has a stable bit rate and good video quality and it is suitable for evaluation of the DTV receiver. 1...|$|R
