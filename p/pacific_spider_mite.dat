40|$|In this study, {{we hoped}} to record <b>Pacific</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> (Tetranychus pacificus) and Willamette spider mite (Eotetranychus willamettei) survival, development, reproduction, and {{longevity}} {{in the presence}} of various fungicides and on water stressed Chardonnay (Vitis vinifera) cuttings. It has been observed in the San Joaquin Valley that Pacific mite populations drastically increase under warm dry conditions (Hanna et al., 1997 a), although it has never been explained exactly why. Water stressed grapevines may elicit responses in the plant that effect mite reproduction or longevity, or there may be a physiological or behavioral response from the spider mites under these conditions. While these same population responses to drought have not been observed in Willamette mite, collecting information on these types of conditions may unveil interesting results. There has also been evidence that shows broad spectrum pesticide applications may be responsible for temporary reduction in <b>Pacific</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> populations, but due to the loss of natural enemies may allow a more severe population explosion to occur later (Prischmann et al., 2005). Sulfur has shown effects on Pacific mite populations (Costello, 2007) and other fungicides may also have interactions we are still yet to discover. More investigation into these interactions could possibly allow us to better manage spider mites in California vineyards...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} genotypic {{variation in}} constitutive and induced resistance in grapes against Willamette <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> Eotetranychus willametti Ewing, and <b>Pacific</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> Tetranychus pacificus McGregor, 2 common species of tetranychid mites found in California vineyards. We {{found evidence that}} early-season injury by Pacific mites induced resistance against subsequent Willamette mite populations but early-season injury by Willamette mites did not induce resistance against subsequent Willamette mite populations. Significant levels of induction were detected for several cultivars of the Old World species Vitis vinifera L. {{as well as the}} North American species V. calif arnica Bentham. Phylogenetic relationships among grape genotypes explained little of the variation we observed in induced resistance. Phylogenetic relatedness among grapes did help explain patterns of constitutive resistance for Pacific mites; cultivars of V. vinifera L. tended to be susceptible, whereas North American species were resistant. Wi 11 amette mites, however, performed well on some Old World cultivars and 2 North American species of Vitis that are native to California. We did not find any strong evidence of a negative correlation between constitutive resistance and strength of induction for these grape genotypes. Our results show that several factors contribute to variation in constitutive and induced resistance in grapes against these 2 species of <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> including grape genotype, previous history of mite injury (induction), the species of mite causing previous injury, and to some extent, phylogenetic relatedness among grapes. We also suspect that mite genotype has important influence...|$|R
40|$|Mites and leafhoppers are {{important}} pests of grapevines and {{can sometimes be}} hard to control. In this study, various levels of deficit irrigation were applied to Merlot grapevines during the summer to determine if mite and leafhopper populations could be manipulated {{by the amount of}} water applied to grapevines. There was a field and lab component to this project. In 2008, in Madera, CA, two treatments were used in the field component applying approximately 70 and 100 % ET. In 2009, three treatments were applied at approximately 50, 70, and 100 % ET to grapevines. No significant differences were seen in leaf water potential between treatments in year 1 except on 9 / 11 / 08 and only on 9 / 1 / 09 in year 2. Irrigation treatment goals were not achieved during the season and therefore, mite populations also showed no significant differences among treatments in either year 1 or 2. The lab component was held at UC Kearney Agricultural Center in a greenhouse using <b>Pacific</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> Merlot vines were held at five different water stress levels (100, 80, 60, 40, and 20 % ET) under two different temperature ranges to see how mite survival and reproduction was affected by water stress levels under different temperatures. No trends were seen in mite survival or reproduction across temperature or water treatments...|$|R
40|$|Life history {{variation}} {{is a general}} feature of arthropod systems, but is rarely included in models of field or laboratory data. Most studies assume that local processes occur identically across individuals, ignoring any genetic or phenotypic variation in life history traits. In this study, we tested whether field populations of <b>Pacific</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> (Tetranychus pacificus) on grapevines (Vitis vinifera) display significant intraspecific life history variation associated with host plant cultivar. To address this question we collected individuals from sympatric vineyard populations where either Zinfandel or Chardonnay were grown. We then conducted a "common garden experiment" of mites on bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) in the laboratory. Assay populations were sampled non-destructively with digital photography to quantify development times, survival, and reproductive rates. Two classes of models were fit to the data: standard generalized linear mixed models and a time-to-event model, common in survival analysis, that allowed for interval-censored data and hierarchical random effects. We found a significant effect of cultivar on development time in both GLMM and time-to-event analyses, a slight cultivar effect on juvenile survival, and no effect on reproductive rate. There were shorter development times and a trend towards higher juvenile survival in populations from Zinfandel vineyards compared to those from Chardonnay vineyards. Lines of the same species, originating from field populations on different host plant cultivars, expressed different development times and slightly different survival rates when reared on a common host plant in a common environment...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that pest species diversity enhances biological pest control with generalist predators, we studied the dynamics of three major pest species on greenhouse cucumber: Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), and two-spotted <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> Tetranychus urticae Koch {{in combination with the}} predator species Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot. When <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> infested plants prior to predator release, predatory mites were not capable of controlling <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> populations in the absence of other pest species. A laboratory experiment showed that predators were hindered by the webbing of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> In a greenhouse experiment, <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> leaf damage was lower in the presence of thrips and predators than in the presence of whiteflies and predators, but damage was lowest in the presence of thrips, whiteflies and predators. Whitefly control was also improved in the presence of thrips. The lower levels of <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> leaf damage probably resulted from (1) a strong numerical response of the predator (up to 50 times higher densities) when a second and third pest species were present in addition to <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> and (2) from A. swirskii attacking mobile <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> stages outside or near the edges of the <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> webbing. Interactions of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> with thrips and whiteflies might also result in suppression of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> However, when predators were released prior to <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestations in the absence of other pest species, but with pollen as food for the predators, we found increased suppression of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> with increased numbers of predators released, confirming the role of predators in <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> control. Thus, our study provides evidence that diversity of pest species can enhance biological control through increased predator densitie...|$|R

40|$|Perceived {{benefits}} of insecticidal transgenic crops include reduced usage of broad-based insecticides, and therefore lower risk to non-target organisms. Numerous studies have documented low or no direct toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) -derived toxins against non-target organisms, {{but there has}} been less research on (a) effects of secondary pest infestations on Bt expressing in crops and (b) behavioural responses by predators feeding on host arthropods from Bt crops - both topics are investigated in this study.

In this study, the herbivorous mite, Tetranychus urticae, and its predator, Phytoseiulus persimilis, were given a choice between Lima bean plants induced by JA or <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> and uninduced control plants. Infestation densities resulting in the induction of predator attractants were much lower than thus far assumed, i. e., predatory mites were significantly attracted to plants that were infested for 2 days with only one or four <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> per plant. Phytoseiulus persimilis showed a density-dependent response to volatiles from plants that were infested with different numbers of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> Similarly, treating plants with increasing concentrations of JA also led to increased attraction of P. persimilis.

A commercial hop variety, Fuggle, was used as a standard, and the fecundity of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> on this variety was arbitrarily set at 100 percent. Striking differences in fecundity was found during the screening experiments, and 24 varieties which showed 50 percent or less fecundity compared to the standard were re-screened during the 1966 season. Although the results of the 1966 re-screening program were not as striking as the data obtained during the 1965 screening experiments, six hop varieties were selected as possible resistant varieties and were compared to two commercial hop genotypes in a growth chamber under controlled environmental conditions.

Moreover, surveys of arthropods on elms and boxwoods showed no evidence of disruption of a key predator of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> that could explain the outbreaks. Importantly, I found a plant-mediated effect of imidacloprid on fecundity of <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> while {{there was no evidence that}} the insecticide applied directly to the mites exerted the same effect on their reproductive performance. Lastly, two genes involved in jasmonic and salicylic acid showed a differential expression in tomatoes treated with imidacloprid, indicating that it affected plants' defense pathways in ways that could render plants more suitable for <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> This research demonstrated that changes in quality of plants brought about by imidacloprid seem to be the driving mechanism of secondary outbreaks of <b>spider</b> <b>mites...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} plant age and {{infestation}} {{level of the}} twospotted <b>spider</b> <b>mite,</b> Tetranychus urticae Koch, on visible plant damage, {{as well as the}} effect of plant age on <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> population growth on impatiens, were determined by inoculating impatiens plants of three different ages with two densities of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> To achieve different <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> densities and ensure that plants of all three ages received the same <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> density, each plant was inoculated with either 1 adult female mite per 3 leaves or 6 leaves based on the average number of leaves on plants of each of the three age classes. Subsequently, leaf damage was correlated with cumulative <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> density (cumulative numbers/leaf/day) and action thresholds were developed. The results showed that older-aged plants exhibited greater damage than younger ones. Regression models of damage thresholds for each plant age were created. The results suggest that monitoring for <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> must be done periodically throughout the entire plant production cycle and more attention should be given {{towards the end of the}} cycle. I found that measurements of visible leaf damage were correlated with plant marketability. Specifically, the level of damage (proportion of damaged leaves/plant) at which plant marketability changes from a ‘premium’ to a ‘discounted’ category was (0. 04 - 0. 06). Thus, regression equations of the damage threshold could be used to estimate a cumulative <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> density equivalent to the economic threshold. Based on these equations, 5 % leaf damage corresponds to cumulative <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> densities of 2. 1, 1. 51, and 1. 25 for youngest, intermediate, and oldest plants, respectively. Because the damage threshold on impatiens was shown to be very low, the action threshold for biological control is essentially zero and predators would need to be released as soon as damage is observed...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{products}} with miticidal activity were applied {{both in the}} spring and summer of 2002 to alfalfa in the Blythe, CA, area to evaluate their efficacy for twospotted <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> (Tetranychus urticae) control. These two application periods differed in regards to presence of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), a predator of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> Western flower thrips populations were high in the spring but essentially absent during the period following the summer application, providing contrasting data for effects of western flower thrips interactions with many miticides for <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> control. Miticides tested included those currently utilized for mite control in alfalfa hay production as well as a number of new and/or potential products for alfalfa hay. In the spring testing, most treatments had more <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> than the untreated check at three days post treatment when western flower thrips were present and actively feeding on <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> Two fertilizer treatments that contained high amounts of sulfur also had more <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> than the untreated check at three days post treatment, thought due to repellency of adult western flower thrips. Many of the treatments that had more <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> than the check following the spring application are known to have thrips activity (Zephyr, Trilogy, Dimethoate, Lorsban, etc.). Fewer motile (adults and immatures, not eggs) <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> than in the check were noted only from the Capture + Dimethoate 400, Capture, and the combination of the two Gowan numbered products (1528, 1549) at three days after treatment.

40|$|Prenatal or {{embryonic}} learning, {{behavioral change}} following experience made prior to birth, may have significant consequences for postnatal foraging {{behavior in a}} wide variety of animals, including mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and molluscs. However, prenatal learning has not been previously shown in arthropods such as insects, <b>spiders</b> and <b>mites.</b> We examined prenatal chemosensory learning in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus. We exposed these predators in the embryonic stage to two flavors (vanillin or anisaldehyde) or no flavor (neutral) by feeding their mothers on <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> prey enriched with these flavors or not enriched with any flavor (neutral). After the predators reached the protonymphal stage, we assessed their prey choice through residence and feeding preferences in experiments, in which they were offered <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> matching the maternal diet (neutral, vanillin or anisaldehyde <b>spider</b> <b>mites)</b> and non-matching <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> Predator protonymphs preferentially resided in the vicinity of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> matching the maternal diet irrespective of the type of maternal diet and choice situation. Across treatments, the protonymphs preferentially fed on <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> matching the maternal diet. Prey and predator sizes did not differ among neutral, vanillin and anisaldehyde treatments, excluding the hypothesis that size-assortative predation influenced the outcome of the experiments. Our study reports the first example of prenatal learning in arthropods...|$|R
40|$|Attack by {{multiple}} herbivores {{often leads to}} modification of induced plant defenses compared to single herbivory, yet {{little is known about}} the effects on induced indirect plant defense. Here, we investigated the effect of sequential induction of plant defense by Mamestra brassicae caterpillar oral secretion and an infestation by Tetranychus urticae <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> on the expression of indirect plant defense in Lima bean plants. The effect on indirect defense was assessed using behavior assays with the specialist predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis in an olfactometer, headspace analysis of 11 major herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) including (E) -ß-ocimene, and transcript levels of the corresponding gene Phaseolus lunatus (E) -ß-ocimene synthase (PlOS). Predatory mites were found to distinguish between plants induced by <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> and caterpillar oral secretion but not between plants with single <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestation and plants induced by caterpillar oral secretion prior to <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestation. Indeed, the volatile blends emitted by plants induced by <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> only and the sequential induction treatment of caterpillar oral secretion followed by <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestation, were similar. Our results suggest that plant indirect defense is not affected by previous treatment with oral secretion of M. brassicae caterpillars...|$|R
40|$|Spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) are an {{important}} agricultural pest of many crops and landscape plants. They can reproduce rapidly and quickly develop resistance to many pesticides, making them difficult to manage. Plant water-stress and high temperatures promote <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestations, while <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> outbreaks can also result from neonicotinoid insecticide applications. Drought is predicted to increase in the Intermountain West due to increases in temperature and reduced frequency of precipitation events in the region, and neonicotinoids are currently {{one of the most}} widely used classes of insecticides in field crops. I studied the interactive effect of these two simultaneously occurring abiotic factors on <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> outbreaks and plant biosynthesis of herbivore-related defense proteins. I also evaluated ways to alleviate <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> outbreaks with drought-tolerant corn and the exogenous application of plant phytohormones involved in plant resistance toward biotic stressors. I found that plant water-stress increased <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> and that neonicotinoids exacerbated the effect of water-stress. Although applications of plant hormones did not reduce the effect of water-stress and neonicotinoids, drought tolerant corn showed promise in reducing the effect of water-stress and <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} reported evidence for increased diapause incidence in the <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> Tetranychus urticae {{in the presence}} of the predatory mite Typhlodromus pyri. This effect may arise from (1) selective predation on non-diapause <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> (2) predator-induced diapause in <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> or (3) both. Using a different strain of T. urticae, we first recovered increased diapause incidence in association with predators. Then, we tested for selective feeding in two-choice experiments with equal numbers of non-diapause and diapause <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> We found that the predatory mite had a significant preference for the latter. This indicates that increased diapause incidence in association with predatory mites is not due to selective predation. Therefore, predator-mediated physiological induction of diapause seems a more likely explanation. The cues leading to induction appear to relate to the predators, not their effects, since predation simulated by spider-mite removal or puncturing did not significantly affect diapause incidence. Why <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> benefit from this response, remains an open question...|$|R
40|$|Cucurbitacins are bitter triterpenoid {{compounds}} that are toxic to most organisms and occur widely in wild and cultivated Cucurbitaceae. The only cucurbitacin identified in Cucumis sativus is cucurbitacin C. The bitter taste of cucumber has been correlated with {{resistance to the}} <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> Tetranychus urticae, but a quantitative relationship has not been established. We determined the <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> resistance and cucurbitacin C content in the dihaploid progeny derived from the F 1 generation of {{a cross between a}} bitter, spider-mite-resistant cucumber line and a bitter-free, spider-mite-susceptible line. The ratio of the number of bitter to bitter-free dihaploids conformed to the expected 1 : 1 ratio, based on a monogenic segregation pattern. Genetic analysis ascribed 69 % of the variance of the difference in <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> survival rate to the bitterness locus. Within the group of bitter dihaploids, cucurbitacin C content was significantly correlated with <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> resistance. Thus, a quantitative relationship between cucurbitacin C content and <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> resistance could be establishe...|$|R
