50|$|Meanwhile the duke’s ambitious {{plans for}} re-constructing the Palais-Royal left the Orchestre Olympique without {{a home and}} Saint-Georges unemployed. Seeing his protégé at loose ends and recalling that the Prince of Wales often {{expressed}} a wish to meet the legendary fencer, Philippe approved Brissot’s plan to dispatch Saint-Georges to London to ensure the Regent-in-waiting’s support of Philippe as future “Regent” of France. But Brissot had a secret agenda as well. He considered Saint-Georges, a “man of color,” the ideal <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> his fellow abolitionists in London and ask their advice about his plans for Les Amis des Noirs (Friends of the Blacks) modeled on the English anti-slavery movement.|$|E
50|$|In 1858 {{the family}} went to England for two years. A diary by Georgina Mann {{indicates}} that William Baker Boulton may have leased the property {{during this time}} as she speaks of the Boultons at a ball there. However {{it is possible that}} Mrs Boulton was the housekeeper for Lindesay as there are numerous advertisements in the Sydney Morning Herald for staff for Lindesay in which Mrs Boulton is listed as the <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact.</b> These occur during and even well before the time the Bradleys left for England. In 1859 there is a birth notice for a son born at Lindesay in the newspaper to Mrs A Rhodes. It is at least possible that the Rhodes were the leasees and the Boultons were staff who perhaps lived at Lindesay.|$|E

50|$|On Monday 26 April 2010, bomb {{disposal}} experts {{were called to}} the village after a dog walker discovered an unexploded grenade in a field behind the primary school on School Road. Police were called at 7.00 am and are also investigating {{as to how the}} device, believed to date back to the Second World War, ended up in the field in the first place. The Ammunition Technician, from the {{bomb disposal}} team, said: “We were called to attend the scene following a call from police that an unexploded hand grenade had been discovered. The number 36 Mills grenade was then destroyed by demolition. We suspect someone has disposed of it in the field which is highly irresponsible and we would urge this <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> the police in future.” Middleton Primary School was closed {{as a result of the}} find.|$|E
5000|$|Family: All of the {{characters}} have varying family troubles. Ironically, Marty has the most stable [...] "nuclear" [...] family with a wife and children, but even his relationship is rocky. On the other extreme, Ann is so disconnected from a family life that she listed Gardner Ross as her <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> {{in case of an}} emergency. A few characters suffer the loss of a close family member during the series. Chris is alienated from his family, and despite the efforts of a family friend to mend the relationship with his father, he never manages to do it. Donald, similarly disowned, does manage to build bridges with his parents. Niko perhaps has the worst relationship history, cutting herself off from her own son in order to further her career, only to find herself caring for the child when her ex-husband is arrested.|$|E
5000|$|Ceremonies and {{mourning}} periods last days, {{weeks and}} even  sometimes months {{depending upon the}} social status of the deceased person.  It is culturally inappropriate for a non-Aboriginal <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> and inform the next of kin of a person’s passing. When someone passes away, {{the family of the}} deceased move out of their house and another family then moves in. Some families will move to [...] "sorry camps" [...] which are usually further away.  Mourning includes the recital of symbolic chants, the singing of songs, dance, body paint, and cuts on the bodies of the mourners. The body is placed on a raised platform for several months, covered in native plants. Sometimes a cave or a tree is used instead. [...] "When nothing but bones are left, family and friends will scatter them in a variety of ways. They sometimes wrap the bones in a hand-knitted fabric and place them in a cave for eventual disintegration or place them in a naturally hollowed out log".|$|E
50|$|Golden Days Radio history {{goes back}} to June 1990 when Dom Iacono, {{registered}} an expression of interest with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for a “special interest licence” catering {{to the needs of}} senior citizens. He placed advertisements in suburban newspapers asking for interested <b>persons</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> him with a view to forming an association for that purpose. Dom convened the first meeting of the group at the Bentleigh RSL. He invited Col Williams (who had already applied for a licence on behalf of the war veteran community) to join the group. Both men, together with Jack Burgesson, the then station engineer at 3SCB Moorabbin, formed a steering committee.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{a society}} {{dedicated}} solely to audio engineering had been discussed for some time before the first meeting, but was first proposed in print in a letter by Frank E. Sherry, of Victoria, Texas, in the December 1947 issue of the magazine Audio Engineering. A New York engineer and audio consultant, C.J. LeBel, then published a letter agreeing, and saying {{that a group of}} audio professionals had already been discussing such a thing, and that they were interested in holding an organizational meeting. He asked interested <b>persons</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> him for details. The response was enthusiastic and encouraging. Fellow engineer Norman C. Pickering published the date for an organizational meeting, and announced the appointment of LeBel as acting chairman, and himself as acting secretary.|$|R
50|$|The {{virus is}} most often spread by <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>person</b> <b>contact</b> with the stool or saliva of the {{infected}} person. Two types of vaccines {{have been developed to}} prevent the occurrence and spread of the poliomyelitis virus. The first is an inactivated, or killed, form of the virus and the second is an attenuated, or weakened, form of the virus. The development of vaccines has successfully eliminated the disease from the United States. There are continued vaccination efforts in the U.S. to maintain this success rate as this disease still occurs in some areas of the world.|$|R
50|$|The team meets Fenix Calderon (Laz Alonso) {{who directs}} them {{to drive the}} heroin across the border using {{underground}} tunnels to avoid detection. Brian realizes that the drivers are to be killed following the mission, and when Fenix reveals to Dominic that he killed Letty, Dominic detonates the nitrous in his car, blowing up a bunch of vehicles. In the chaos, Brian hijacks the Hummer that is carrying the heroin. Dominic and Brian drive back to Los Angeles, hiding the heroin in an impound lot. When Dominic learns Brian was the last <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> Letty, he attacks him until Brian reveals that Letty was working undercover for Brian, tracking down Braga in exchange for clearing Dominic's name. Brian negotiates with the agency to free Dominic if they can lure Braga into personally coming to exchange the heroin for cash. However, at the drop site, it is revealed that the Braga they arrested was a decoy, and that the real Braga (John Ortiz) has escaped, fleeing to Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Every day {{at about}} 3.35pm, three records are played that all centre round a {{particular}} theme. The first week's themes were {{chosen by the}} presenters themselves, after which the themes were chosen by listeners. At first the linking theme was announced before the records were played, however it soon became popular for listeners to guess what the link was so now the connecting theme isn't mentioned until all the records have been played and listeners contact the show with their guesses {{as to what the}} theme is. Although there is no prize for getting the theme correct the first <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> the show with the correct answer has the honour of having their name mentioned as the winner. Radcliffe and Maconie used to say that the first correct answer received the [...] "Tea Time Theme Time Crown of Joy." [...] Although the winner didn't receive an actual crown, a picture of a paper hat representing a crown would be tweeted along with the winners name. However they no longer refer to the [...] "Tea Time Theme Time Crown of Joy." ...|$|E
50|$|Clandestine human {{intelligence}} is intelligence collected from human sources using clandestine espionage methods. These sources consist {{of people working}} {{in a variety of}} roles within the intelligence community. Examples include the quintessential spy (known by professionals as an asset or agent), who collects intelligence, couriers and related personnel, who handle an intelligence organization's (ideally) secure communications, and support personnel, such as access agents, who may arrange the contact between the potential spy and the case officer who recruits them. The recruiter and supervising agent may not necessarily be the same individual. Large espionage networks may be composed of multiple levels of spies, support personnel, and supervisors. Espionage networks are typically organized as a cell system, in which each clandestine operator knows only the people in his own cell, perhaps the external case officer, and an emergency method (which may not necessarily involve another <b>person)</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> higher levels if the case officer or cell leader is captured, but has no knowledge of people in other cells. This cellular organization is a form of compartmentalisation, which is an important tactic for controlling access to information, used in order to diminish the risk of discovery of the network or the release of sensitive information.|$|E
50|$|Swine flu {{is one of}} many {{diseases}} that are contracted by <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>person</b> <b>contact.</b> In April 2009 the virus was discovered in the USA, 2 months later in June the CDC (center for disease control) announced the disease as a pandemic. It is believed that door handles provide a suitable environment for the disease to spread on, as the bacteria can survive on these metallic surfaces from 2 up to 8 hours. Door handles provide a popular medium for the disease to spread as every person uses the handle, they can extend the duration that the germs survive.|$|R
40|$|Influenza is a {{significant}} cause of morbidity and death in the United States and around the world. 1 – 6 Seasonal influenza circulates annually and is spread from <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>person</b> through <b>contact</b> with contaminated surfaces, coughing, and sneezing. For many people, influenza is an uncomfortable but recoverable illness, although in higher-risk populations such as the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, immunocompromised people, and people with chronic medical conditions, {{it can lead to}} serious complications including death...|$|R
50|$|Hepatitis A {{is usually}} spread when {{the virus is}} taken in through the mouth through coming in contact with objects, food, or drinks that have been {{contaminated}} by the feces of an infected person. It also spreads from <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>person</b> <b>contact</b> such as when there is improper hand washing after bathroom use, changing diapers, or sexual contact with an infected partner (not limited <b>to</b> anal-to oral <b>contact).</b> Contaminated food or water {{is more common in}} areas with poor sanitary conditions or poor personal hygiene. In the United States, chlorination of the water kills Hepatitis A virus that enters the water supply.Hepatitis A can live outside the body for months. High temperatures (185 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 1 minute) can kill the virus, freezing can not.|$|R
