25|$|With {{the first}} of the new {{commuter}} cars in service on the Burlington the next railroad that approached Budd to design of new type of car with a greater seating capacity while also improving the accommodations for coach passengers was the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The Santa Fe was searching for a better design for its long distance passenger trains and, with the design of the Burlington coaches in mind Budd set out to create a similar passenger car design to meet the Santa Fe's needs. In September 1952 the Santa Fe placed an order for two two-level prototypes, Budd's Lot 9679-129. The two coaches carrying the numbers 526 and 527 were delivered in July 1954, at which time both were placed into service for evaluation. These two prototypes had seating on the both levels, stairs on one end to provide access to single-level cars, a stairway {{at the center of the}} car for access to toilets on the lower level, as well as the door in the side of the car for embarking and departing passengers.

40|$|The {{objective}} of work {{described in this}} paper is to propose a new method of measuring gas leakage for pneumatic industry. The measurement is enabled by employing standard flow. Standard flow is used to determine the internal volume of the measured equipment. An algorithm is formulated to describe, to the extent possible, the relationship between gas leakage and standard flow. This measurement method deviates from the theoretical leakage values by less than 5 %, and shows a good precision and scope compared with the traditional flow measurements. In addition, the proposed parallel connection based on standard flow makes easy operation and fast measuring possible, thus promising new area of application for <b>pneumatic</b> <b>equipments...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study {{the focus was on}} {{developing}} a relationship as practical and convenient&# 13; option for computing the friction force in O-ring sealing elements as used in the hydraulic and&# 13; <b>pneumatic</b> <b>equipments.</b> For low-pressure applications, the developed relationship was applied for a&# 13; different number of O-ring diameters, by investigating the obtained results, a good agreement has been&# 13; observed for some of the tested diameters through the comparison between the obtained results from the&# 13; developed relationship with those experimentally measured, which ensures the validity of the&# 13; relationship. Regarding the low-pressure applications, theoretical and experimental studies were carried&# 13; out in order to evaluate the effect of most important working parameters and conditions on the friction&# 13; behavior. A remarkable advantage of using the relationship that reveals the accuracy of the relationship&# 13; was detected through the comparison between the computed results with those obtained from the friction&# 13; characteristic curves. Because the developed relationship having more important and quantified working&# 13; parameters, it gives more accurate results, while in the characteristic tests curves the working parameters&# 13; cannot be quantified, because they overlap and then they act cumulatively. The experimental study was&# 13; performed and the obtained results are presented for two working cases, in which the friction force was&# 13; determined in absence of pressurized fluid as in the first case, while in the second case the friction force&# 13; was determined on basis of the presence of a pressurized fluid`s...|$|R

The transmission system uses a bogie mounted traction motor (one per axle) connected to the wheelset via a hollow shaft drive and flexible coupling, traction forces are tranmissed by low-lying rods connected to the bogie frame.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>equipment</b> and dry, windy conditions that created the pesticide dust cloud and drove it into the neighboring fields, the BVL also identified several other factors {{that contributed to the}} incident. Though the normal corn seed treatment formulation of clothianidin was authorized for use against fruit flies and wireworms at 25 grams of the chemical per 50,000 seeds, the seed batches associated with this incident received a special authorization at a much higher concentration, 62 grams per 50,000 seeds, to protect against an infestation of western corn rootworm. Furthermore, a glue-like polymer coating, known as [...] "sticker", that is commonly used in the U.S. to ensure that seed treatment pesticides adhere to corn seeds was omitted in error by the seed treater that supplied the seed to German farmers. [...] Weather conditions earlier in the year also contributed to the incident. While corn planting would normally not take place in the Baden-Württemberg region of Germany {{at the same time that}} canola is in bloom, unseasonably early and heavy rain pushed back the corn planting.|$|E

40|$|Introducing loads {{onto the}} soil via <b>pneumatic</b> tyred <b>equipment</b> {{is the major}} cause of {{compaction}} of agricultural soils, which causes damage to the soil-water-air-plant system. The degree of soil compaction is largely influenced by the loads applied to the soil and resulting surface and subsurface pressure. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} in order to determine an effective method to measure the pressure distribution under a selection of pneumatic agricultural tyres on a hard surface and in the soil profile. As a result of this, it has been possible to evaluate the influence of tyre inflation pressure, load, ply rating and tread pattern on the resulting pressure. Also, the carcass stiffness of the tyres studied was determined and alternative methods to predict the carcass stiffness were evaluated and an improved technique was developed. Cont/d.
