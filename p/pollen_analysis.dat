The nuts were harvested in a single year and <b>pollen</b> <b>analysis</b> suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E

40|$|Pollen size {{is often}} used as a {{biological}} parameter to estimate the ploidy and viability of mature pollen grains. In general, pollen size quantification is performed one- or two-dimensionally using image-based diameter measurements. As these approaches are elaborate and time consuming, alternative approaches that enable a quick, reliable <b>analysis</b> of <b>pollen</b> size are highly relevant for plant research. In this study, we present the volume-based particle size analysis technique as an alternative method to characterize mature pollen. Based on a comparative assay using different plant species (including tomato, oilseed rape, kiwifruit, clover, among others), we found that volume-based pollen size measurements are not biased by the pollen shape or position and substantially reduce non-biological variation, allowing a more accurate determination of the actual pollen size. As such, volume-based particle size techniques have a strong discriminative power in detecting pollen size differences caused by alterations in the gametophytic ploidy level and therefore allow for a quick and reliable estimation of the somatic ploidy level. Based on observations in Arabidopsis thaliana gametophytic mutants and differentially reproducing Boechera polyantha lines, we additionally found that volume-based <b>pollen</b> size <b>analysis</b> provides quantitative and qualitative data about alterations in male sporogenesis, including aneuploid and diploid gamete formation. Volume-based <b>pollen</b> size <b>analysis</b> therefore not only provides a quick and easy methodology to determine the somatic ploidy level of flowering plants, but {{can also be used}} to determine the mode of reproduction and to quantify the level of diplogamete formation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction:Hokkaido University campus {{has been}} {{designated}} a National Archelogical Site (K 39 Site and K 435 Site) (Yoshiwaki 1986, Kosugi 2003, 2005, 2008). Therefore, there there are many excavations related to ancient vegatation, such as seeds, pollen fossil, wooden tools and charred wood. These excavation allow us to estimate ancient forest vegetation and the wood utilization of ancient {{people who lived in}} the area of what is now Hokkaido University campus. Watanabe et al. (2005), the first author, has been identifying the buried ancient woods found at sites on Hokkaido University campus since 2003. The results, including charred wood, have been reported in archeological excavation reports. However, no one has summarized these results in relation to wood identification and <b>pollen</b> fossil <b>analysis,</b> or systematically organized the date concerning the ancient forest culture, i. e., ancient forest vegetation and wood utilization of ancient people who lived in the area of Hokkaido University. To clarify the ancient forest culture is important because it can lead to an understanding of how ancient people managed forests and we may learn from them forest managemanet techniques suitable for the current global climate changes. Hokkaido University Forests has developed a course on "Environmental Science for Biological Resources" as a part of "Hokkaido University Short Term Exchange Program", HUSTEP(Sasa and Koike 2002, Koike et al. 2006, 2007). To introduce "Ancient Forest Culture" of Hokkaido University campus, we created panels that summarize the results of the wood identification and <b>pollen</b> fossil <b>analysis</b> using the accumulated archeological data from excavations on Hokkaido University campus...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{agricultural}} practice across Europe and North America {{have been associated}} with declines in wild bee populations. Bee diet breadth has been associated with sensitivity to agricultural intensification, but much of this analysis has been conducted at the categorical level of generalist or specialist, and it is not clear to what extent the level of generalisation within generalist species is also associated with species persistence. We used <b>pollen</b> load <b>analysis</b> to quantify the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on 19 farms across southern England, UK. A total of 72 species of solitary bees were recorded, but only 31 species were abundant enough to allow for formal diet characterisation. The results broadly conformed to existing literature with the majority of species polylectic and collecting pollen {{from a wide range of}} plants. <b>Pollen</b> load <b>analysis</b> consistently identified <b>pollens</b> from more plant species and families from each bee species than direct observation of their foraging behaviour. After rarefaction to standardise pollen load sample sizes, diet breadth was significantly associated with frequency of occurrence, with more generalist bees present on more farms than less generalist bees. Our results show that the majority of bee species present on farmland in reasonable numbers are widely variable in their pollen choices, but that those with the broadest diet were present on the greatest number of farms. Increasing the diversity of plants included in agri-environment schemes may be necessary to provide a wider range of pollen resources in order to support a diverse bee community on farmland...|$|R

25|$|<b>Pollen</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has allowed}} archaeologists to analyze {{vegetation}} selectively cultivated by area residents, the “native vegetation” {{of a particular}} area, and allow archaeologists to map out land use over time (which can be ascertained from weeds).

Failure to collect a suitable sample can be due in part to not sampling from areas where suitable pollen samples can be gathered (e.g. lakes and bogs, sites that were sufficiently exposed to air-borne pollen, sites that had both a long exposure to air and are deeply buried into the ground), or because pollen is vulnerable to destruction by the oxidation process or soil microbes such as bacteria and fungi, it negatively impacts an archaeologist’s ability to collect a suitable pollen sample.|$|E

40|$|Compared to upland {{areas and}} Scotland, the Holocene vegetational history of lowland England is poorly known. This is {{particularly}} {{the case for}} the region of Holdemess, eastern Yorkshire, where only a low number of poor temporal resolution pollen diagrams have been published, none of which include analysis of microscopic charcoal content. The records are also largely undated and as a result reliable correlation between sites is not possible, and the timings of the key vegetation changes recorded in the data remain unknown. In this study, high resolution pollen and charcoal records were produced from four small (24 ha) infilled basins located within central Holderness. Complementary techniques of percentage loss-on-ignition and <b>pollen</b> preservation <b>analysis</b> were also employed, and a comprehensive radiocarbon-dating programme was undertaken to provide a secure chronological framework. The palaeoecological records produced provide a high temporal resolution reconstruction of the Holocene development of central Holderness, particularly during the Early-Mid Holocene, and allow consideration of the changing roles that ecological interactions, climate, and human influence have played in determining the Holocene vegetational composition of the region. A number of significant landscape-scale disturbances of inferred anthropogenic origin were identified from ca 9290 BP onwards and shown to vary significantly in timing, duration and character between sites. It is proposed that this palaeoecological data can be used to supplement the poor archaeological record of the area. Several key issues including the role of climatic instability in determining vegetational composition during the Early Holocene, the interpretation of incidences of cereal-type pollen, the use of the charcoal record as a proxy indicator of human activity, and the use of <b>pollen</b> preservation <b>analysis</b> as an interpretational tool are also considered...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—For over 100 years, bison in the Greater Yellowstone Area {{have been}} managed intensely. Even {{during the years}} of “natural regulation, ” bison herds have been heavily managed by culling. One of the {{fundamental}} goals of the plan for the Greater Yellowstone Area is to maintain the ecosystem’s integrity using sound science. In order to reach this goal, it must be recognized that it is a dynamic system, continually undergoing change. However, our knowledge of such changes is ex-tremely limited. In the case of bison, our knowledge is based on non-systematically collected historic records and modern studies of small, isolated populations.

During the Last Glacial Maximum of the Pleistocene, the paleoecology of the region varied drastically, marking movements of the upper tree line and the types of vegetation. <b>Pollen</b> <b>analysis</b> shows that páramo vegetation was abundant from 30 ka to 17,500 years ago, with an increase in Andean forest frequency dated at 15.6 ka. Between 13,000 and 11,000 years BP, a decrease in Andean forest percentage is observed, indicative of a colder climate than before. This period has been named the Fúquene stadial. The stadial is followed by an interstadial (Guantivá), with an increase in lake levels of Lake Fúquene.

25|$|In 1998 pollen {{found on}} the Shroud of Turin was {{analysed}} and with 29%, the pollen assigned to Gundelia was the most numerous. Such a high density makes it very unlikely that this would merely {{be the result of}} the Shroud having been exposed to the wind, particularly because Gundelia is an insect-pollinated, not a wind-pollinated plant. Some researchers have suggested this implies that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia-branches. Other authors doubt the accuracy of the <b>pollen</b> <b>analysis</b> and of the process of gathering the pollen from the Shroud. One reason for doubt is that during the period that pollen is present in the plant, the thorns would have still been tender. It was suggested the pollen is from Helichrysum-species which have a similar type of pollen. Helichrysum was used in classical times to make crowns and garlands for the diseased because they do not wither and remain scented for a long time. An alternative explanation suggested is that rather more recent different flowers have been pressed against the Shroud to create contact relics, while in the process contaminating it with pollen and therefore diluting the original pollen signature.|$|E
