[...] She also wrote that given who their parents are, [...] "that can only mean trouble". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: [...] "Everything he does is for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that." [...] In another interview, he stated of their relationship: [...] "I think Fen’s first love is Summer; he falls in love; he’s infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it’s going is – will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he’s still the same kid, it’s just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase." [...] Tracey Bregman (who portrays his mother Lauren) stated that she [...] "was always hoping they would show the dark side of our child, because both Lauren and Michael have dark sides. That is something they both work hard on to suppress, that comes out now and them." [...] Christian LeBlanc (who portrays his father Michael) stated Michael has [...] "troubled youth to deal with", saying: [...] "It’s the first time on Y that such a young storyline has pulled such focus.

[...] The character was later involved in a cyberbullying storyline with Summer and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo).

[...] Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: [...] "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone.

30|$|This article investigates metacognitive {{conditions}} that induce <b>people’s</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> An mTurk survey revealed {{that people think}} they are most curious—operationalized, in the survey, as having the strongest urge to Google the answer—when {{they do not know}} the answer but not when they know the answer. However, they think they are indiscriminate among ‘not known’ states: when they are sure they do not know, when they have a feeling that {{they might be able to}} recognize the answer, and when they are in a genuine ‘tip-of-the-tongue’ (TOT) state. To ascertain whether they were correct that all ‘don’t know’ states were equal, or whether there is a special metacognitive state associated with curiosity, we gave participants 82 general information questions, asked them to give the answers, asked them whether they were in a TOT state, and then asked them whether they wanted to see the answer. They overwhelmingly wanted to see the answer when they were in a TOT state. This occurred regardless of what their response was, including when they had been correct, had made a commission error, or had made an omission error. Philosophers have sometimes suggested that metacognitive feeling states may be epiphenomenal—having no function in human cognition. By contrast, our results indicate that the special feeling of mild torment that is the hallmark of the TOT state is a goad to epistemic action. It triggers <b>people’s</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b>|$|R
50|$|DIC {{has largely}} {{replaced}} the older oblique illumination (OI) technique, which was available on reflected light microscopes prior to about 1975. In OI, the vertical illuminator is offset from perpendicular, producing shading effects that reveal height differences. This procedure reduces resolution and yields uneven illumination {{across the field}} of view. Nevertheless, OI was useful when <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if a second phase particle was standing above or was recessed below the plane-of-polish, and is still available on a few microscopes. OI can be created on any microscope by placing {{a piece of paper}} under one corner of the mount so that the plane-of-polish is no longer perpendicular to the optical axis.|$|R

5000|$|Person centred {{thinking}} was first {{developed by a}} group of people practicing Essential Lifestyle Planning in the US (now known as 'The Learning Community for Person Centred Practices). These planners realised that while many plans were being written, many of these were not leading to real change in peoples lives. This group decided that person centred planning was something a small group of <b>people</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> but that for planning to work, a much wider group of <b>people</b> <b>need</b> skills around listening for what's important to people and how to best support people. Michael Smull who is a leading figure in this group describes Person centred thinking as [...] "something that virtually everyone who touches a person <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> know" [...] because change was most powerful when all staff were using person centred thinking tools in their roles, rather than relying solely on person centred planning facilitators to create plans. To enable these tools to be shared at scale, Essential Lifestyle Planning was 'deconstructed' into a range of person centred thinking tools, that enable staff to participate with the person in a cycle of listening, learning and action by building up a set of tools recording this process to form a person centred description of the person.|$|R

30|$|Several {{precursors}} in {{the literature}} provide convergent support for {{the idea that the}} TOT state may be related to curiosity and information seeking. First, going back as far as Berlyne’s (1954) theory of epistemic curiosity, theorists have proposed that <b>people’s</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is ignited by materials that are neither completely unknown nor completely known, but are, instead, in an intermediate zone (Atkinson, 1972; Kornell & Metcalfe, 2006 b; Litman, 2009; Loewenstein, 1994; Metcalfe, 2002). These theories indicate that people are best off, as far as learning goes, if they study items that are at an intermediate state of learning. For example, Atkinson (1972) employed an early computerized learning program which sorted items into those that were reliably remembered, intermediate items that were somewhat learned but not permanently (which he called ‘T’ or transitional items), and those that were unlearned. He found that the most effective learning algorithm involved having people selectively study the ‘T’ items. Metcalfe and Kornell (2003, 2005) called T items those in the Region of Proximal Learning (RPL). In addition, they found that college students selectively chose these particular items for further study. Loewenstein (1994), like Berlyne (1954), also zeroed in on such items in his theory of curiosity, pointing to them as being the items people found particularly interesting and deserving of attention.|$|R
