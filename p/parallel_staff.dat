5000|$|A rastrum (or raster) is a five-pointed writing {{implement}} used {{in music}} manuscripts to draw <b>parallel</b> <b>staff</b> lines when drawn horizontally across a blank piece of sheet music. The word [...] "raster" [...] {{is derived from}} the Latin for [...] "rake". Rastra were used to draw lines on paper that had not been pre-ruled, and were widely used in Europe until printed staff paper became cheap and common in the nineteenth century. Some rastra are able to draw more than one staff at a time. Rastrology, the study of the use of the rastrum, is a branch of music manuscript studies that uses information about the rastrum to help find the date and provenance of musical materials.|$|E
50|$|The linking pin {{model is}} an idea {{developed}} by Rensis Likert. It presents an organisation {{as a number of}} overlapping work units in which a member of a unit is the leader of another unit. In this scheme, the supervisor/manager has the dual task of maintaining unity and creating a sense of belonging within the group he or she supervises and of representing that group in meetings with superior and <b>parallel</b> management <b>staff.</b> These individuals are the linking pins within the organisation and so they become the focus of leadership development activities.|$|R

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2013. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. The hiring process for all positions is handled by the Human Resources division of a company, Chevron Bangladesh fills its workforce needs through two <b>parallel</b> <b>staffing</b> plans. The first is hiring full time employees who are contracted to Chevron directly. These employees enjoy a range of benefits beyond that their base pay such as insurance coverage with Metlife Alico in Bangladesh, cumulative gratuity pay, etc. However, shortfalls in staff or positions not considered permanent enough also filled with contractual employees under a scheme known as Staff Augmentation (SAF) or Hire of Labour (HoL). As the company can only hire {{a certain number of}} regular employees in a particular business year, rest of the workforce support is being covered through the HOL process. Chevron’s full time employees may be either transferred from operations abroad or hired locally. Their Pay Scale Grade (PSG) level is dependent on their position, however different home markets have different Pay Scale Grades (i. e. e. g. an employee from the Bangladeshi operation at PSG 17 will likely be remunerated less than an employee from the UK operation). we was fortunate to be intimately involved in the creation and publication of a tool called the Recruitment Metrics in my capacities of first Human Resources wentern and then as Human Resource Administrator. This internship report will catalogue this tool and how it helps Chevron track recruitment of employees in the Bangladeshi market. The report will be prefaced with a company overview and company history of both Chevron as well as Chevron Bangladesh, its departments and finally the recruitment metrics process. This report shall additionally reflect some the process knowledge we acquired while discharging my range of responsibilities in the two roles we served in this organization along with independent research into the subject matter. we shall conclude with a series of recommendations that the company may implement to improve its conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} an exploratory, nationwide survey of maintained secondary schools in England on the perception, understanding {{and use of}} pupil performance data among teachers and school leaders, {{and the extent to}} which this is related to school performance. The survey was informed by an extensive review of research and policy literature, and was followed-up by a series of in-depth interviews. Both quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques were employed. The use and availability of pupil performance data was found to be widespread, but least in use among classroom teachers, who reported relatively low levels of understanding. The research also reveals a hierarchy of data use in schools with many indicating that data is accessible only to management staff or is given to teachers pre-interpreted. In <b>parallel,</b> most <b>staff</b> make regular use of their own sources of pupil data, and there is widespread belief across the profession that ‘own data’ is at least as useful as official data, which poses a clear challenge for policy makers in raising levels of use and creating a ‘mixed economy’ of data sources. Despite the limitations of this exploratory study, it presents some potential lines of enquiry for larger scale research studies on data-use. <br/...|$|R

5000|$|South Korea 1945-1950 As the Empire of Japan {{surrendered}} in August 1945, {{under the}} leadership of Lyuh Woon-Hyung committees throughout Korea formed to coordinate transition to Korean independence. On August 28, 1945 these committees formed the temporary national government of Korea, naming it the Peoples Republic of Korea (PRK) a couple of weeks later. On September 8, 1945, the United States government landed forces in Korea and thereafter established the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGK) to govern Korea south of the 38th <b>Parallel.</b> The USAMGK <b>staffed</b> the governing administration with Japanese governors and many other Japanese officials who {{had been part of the}} brutal Japanese imperial colonial government and with Koreans who had collaborated with it, which made the government unpopular and engendered popular resistance. USAMGK refused to recognize the PRK government, which had been formed to self-govern the country, and the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which had been based in China during WWII and had fought against the Japanese, and then the USAMGK by military decree outlawed the PRK government. In October 1948, USAMGK sent units to attack Koreans who were seeking Korean independence, and carried out several mass atrocities, including the killing hundreds of Korean civilians on Jeju Island who were suspected of supporting those in favor of independence.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. Coinciding with a rebirth in South Africa, new {{education}} {{legislation has}} given considerable {{more power and}} responsibility for making decisions. While assuming a degree of autonomy, schools are also expected to resource themselves with the minimum support from their respective provincial departments. The extent to which schools {{will be able to}} make the transition depends a great deal upon the nature and quality of their internal management. (Department of Education 1996). The Task Team on Education Management Development (1996) says that a move to self-management does not mean that you are guaranteed positive change. It is the nature and quality of internal management that will influence real transformation. So, a self-managing school is accompanied by an internal devolution of power and by a leadership style that is transformational. It is here that an attempt is made to look at the extent to which transformational leadership is practiced in a Durban Secondary School. Seeing that transformational leadership is linked with school effectiveness, (Coleman, 1994) it is the aim of this research project to evaluate the principal's leadership style. Does the way the school is managed contain any evidence of transformational leadership? Is the principal's perception of his leadership style <b>parallel</b> with the <b>staff's</b> perception of how he leads the school? The findings of this research have shown that there is no evidence of transformational leadership at this school. The recommendations have highlighted ways in which the principal can begin to transform the school so that they too may improve to such an extent that the school is seen as being effective...|$|R
40|$|Community {{self-help}} {{has gained}} increasing prominence in Cambodia, and elsewhere, as an urban poverty reduction strategy of non-government organisations and the state. Embedded {{in this approach}} are assumptions of ‘community’ as a site of cooperation and ‘women’ as an inherently cohesive social group with a shared identity. If such interventions are to be effective and inclusive {{it is critical to}} understand how the practices and discourses that underscore them interact with local struggles to produce new forms of power. A qualitative case study of an urban informal settlement in Phnom Penh involving multiple semi-structured interviews with 25 women residents and staff of a nongovernment organisation identified differing perspectives of how development interventions worked and what they were supposed to achieve. Divergent motivations for participation, the selves women constructed as distinct from the identities they were expected to perform by non-government organisation <b>staff,</b> <b>parallel</b> group membership pathways controlled by wealthier residents, and the silencing of violence experienced by women illustrated these cleavages. In response to these misalignments women found alternate ways to assert entitlement and subvert social power to further their respective interests. This thesis makes three arguments. First, that in this settlement development and aid were a both a struggle over redistribution of resources and a symbolic struggle over morality and entitlement. Second, that development adapted to social structures by entrenching the power of existing elites, while social structure adapted to development by creating parallel discourses and modes of participation. Third, that women were both oppressed (by local authorities, men, landlords, and police) and oppressors (of each other). These themes have important implications for self-reliance groups that mobilise women on the assumption that economic marginalisation will shape collective identity. Gender-based group formation offers the potential to transcend and transform the exclusions that women in urban informal settlements encounter in their everyday lives. Attention, however, must be paid to gradients of power and social hierarchy within and across groups – beyond the state/citizen dyad – and an understanding of ‘development’ as embedded in everyday politics...|$|R
40|$|The Karlsruhe Vitrification Plant (VEK) {{plant is}} a {{milestone}} in decommissioning and complete dismantling of the former Karlsruhe Reprocessing Plant WAK, which is in an advanced stage of disassembly. The VEK is scheduled to vitrify approx. 70 m 3 of the highly radioactive liquid waste (HLW) resulting from reprocessing. Site preparation, civil work and component manufacturing began in 1999. The building will be finalized by mid of 2002, hot vitrification operation is currently scheduled for 2004 / 2005. Provisions against damages arising from construction and operation of the VEK {{had to be made}} in accordance with {{the state of the art}} as laid down in the German Atomic Law and the Radiation Protection Regulations. For this purpose, the appropriate analysis of accidents and their external and internal impacts were investigated. During the detailed design phase, a failure effects analysis was carried out, in which single events were studied with respect to the objectives of protection and ensuring activity containment, limiting radioactive discharges to the environment and protecting of the <b>staff.</b> <b>Parallel</b> to the planning phase of the VEK plant a cold prototype test facility (PVA) covering the main process steps was constructed and operated at the Institut fuer Nukleare Entsorgung (INE) of FZK. This pilot operation served to demonstrate the process technique and its operation with a simulated waste solution, and to test the main items of equipment, but was conducted also to use the experimental data and experience to back the safety concept of the radioactive VEK plant. This paper describes the basis of the safety concept of the VEK plant and results of the failure effect analysis. The experimental simulation of the failure scenarios, their effect on the process behavior, and the controllability of these events as well as the effect of the results on the safety concept of VEK are discussed. Additionally, an overview of the actual status of civil work and manufacturing of the technical equipment is given...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the role of values within {{contemporary}} mental health recovery services, outlining the rationale and approach for a specific values-focused staff intervention to promote autonomously motivated uptake of recovery-oriented practices. Design/methodology/approach - Recent advances in understanding of the enduring gap between ideological and applied acceptance of personal recovery within mental health services are outlined, with particular focus on the limited utility of training programmes as a means to promoting implementation. Frequently, mental health service organisations have adopted recovery policies in a primarily 2 ̆ 2 top-down 2 ̆ 2 fashion standing in contrast to the high autonomy approaches espoused for service users. Drawing from the extensive research related to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), a complementary focus on 2 ̆ 2 bottom-up 2 ̆ 2 approaches that enable service-delivery staff to develop a sense of autonomy for changed work practices in order to increase implementation is indicated. Findings - Application of values-focused interventions for mental health recovery <b>staff</b> <b>parallel</b> to the approaches acknowledged as effective for service participants are likely to be effective in promoting implementation of newly trained recovery-oriented practices. Research limitations/implications - The paper is conceptual in nature and therefore reflects the priorities and views of the authors but the paper draws together well-established literature to develop a novel approach to a highly relevant issue. Practical implications - Training transfer and implementation of evidence-based practice are issues with broad relevance and the explication of additional methods to promote employee uptake of new practices is a key priority for organisations and policy makers. Social implications - Significant social implications include furthering the discussion and insight to the development of effective delivery of mental health services to individuals accessing service. Originality/value - A novel aspect of this paper is the provision of a theoretical rationale for the application of SDT as a framework for understanding the continuing challenge of recovery operationalisation, which despite the conceptual good-fit, currently stands as an association not well exploited. Moreover, this paper proposes values-clarification and coaching as a specific and reproducible approach to enhancing recovery-oriented service provision...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 2000 s, the Chinese {{government}} has undertaken {{a series of}} reforms in the health sector. Among these, the threemost important have been concerned with medical insurance, hospital administration, and pharmaceutical policies. The aims of these reformswere to extend health insurance coverage, to increase the activities and {{the efficiency of the}} health establishments, and to improve patientcare. This article focuses on two components of these reforms: the development of health insurance in rural areas and the policy on essentialmedicines in conjunction with hospital reforms. Our longstanding co-operation with a research team from Weifang University and with the WeifangHealth Bureau allowed us to follow these reforms and collect data (primary source) from a sample of township hospitals from WeifangPrefecture. Those data allowed us to study their effects on health facilities' level of activity and efficiency. This article provides an overview ofstudies we carried out on these issues over the period from 2000 to 2012. Our analyses were mainly based on non-parametric models (Data EnvelopmentAnalysis, Malmquist Index, and partial frontiers) and impact analyses, coupled with interviews with hospital staff and medical authorities. Results show that the development of health insurance in rural areas had a positive effect in greatly increasing the activities of thehospitals covered by our study. On the other hand, it did not have a positive influence on their efficiency, which declined in the period concerned. This result is to be explained by the fact that, even though staff activity increased, it remained low, since the observed increase in activitywas not sufficient {{to make up for the}} <b>parallel</b> increase in <b>staff</b> numbers. Similarly, reforms in the hospital and pharmaceutical sectors had noeffect on the township hospitals of our survey. In fact, in order to compensate for the observed reduction of hospital resources following the introductionof the reforms, on the one hand the government increased the subsidies allocated to township hospitals, and on the other hand thehospitals strongly innovated in sophisticated and expensive care, to the benefit of a relatively small number of patients. Therefore, there weresome very positive steps forward, but they still call for a more nuanced assessment of the effects of the reforms...|$|R
40|$|Aims. Shared {{decision}} making has been advocated {{as a means}} to improve patient-orientation and quality of health care. There is a lack of knowledge on clinical {{decision making}} and its relation to outcome in the routine treatment of people with severe mental illness. This study examined preferred and experienced clinical decision making from the perspectives of patients and staff, and how these affect treatment outcome. Methods. "Clinical Decision Making and Outcome in Routine Care for People with Severe Mental Illness" (CEDAR; ISRCTN 75841675) is a naturalistic prospective observational study with bimonthly assessments during a 12 -month observation period. Between November 2009 and December 2010, adults with severe mental illness were consecutively recruited from caseloads of community mental health services at the six study sites (Ulm, Germany; London, UK; Naples, Italy; Debrecen, Hungary; Aalborg, Denmark; and Zurich, Switzerland). Clinical decision making was assessed using two instruments which both have <b>parallel</b> patient and <b>staff</b> versions: (a) The Clinical Decision Making Style Scale (CDMS) measured preferences for decision making at baseline; and (b) the Clinical Decision Making Involvement and Satisfaction Scale (CDIS) measured involvement and satisfaction with a specific decision at all time points. Primary outcome was patient-rated unmet needs measured with the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Appraisal Schedule (CANSAS). Mixed-effects multinomial regression was used to examine differences and course over time in involvement in and satisfaction with actual decision making. The effect of clinical decision making on the primary outcome was examined using hierarchical linear modelling controlling for covariates (study centre, patient age, duration of illness, and diagnosis). Analysis were also controlled for nesting of patients within staff. Results. Of 708 individuals approached, 588 adults with severe mental illness (52 % female, mean age =  41. 7) gave informed consent. Paired staff participants (N =  213) were 61. 8 % female and 46. 0 years old on average. Shared decision making was preferred by patients (χ 2  =  135. 08; p <  0. 001) and staff (χ 2  =  368. 17; p <  0. 001). Decision making style of staff significantly affected unmet needs over time, with unmet needs decreasing more in patients whose clinicians preferred active to passive (- 0. 406 unmet needs per two months, p =  0. 007) or shared (- 0. 303 unmet needs per two months, p =  0. 015) decision making. Conclusions. Decision making style of staff is a prime candidate for the development of targeted intervention. If proven effective in future trials, this would pave the ground for a shift from shared to active involvement of patients including changes to professional socialization through training in principles of active decision making...|$|R
