5000|$|In power engineering, a {{one-line}} diagram or single-line diagram (SLD) is a simplified notation for representing a three-phase power system. [...] The {{one-line diagram}} has its largest application in power flow studies. Electrical {{elements such as}} circuit breakers, transformers, capacitors, bus bars, and conductors are shown by standardized schematic symbols. Instead of representing each of three phases with a separate line or terminal, only one conductor is represented. It {{is a form of}} block diagram graphically depicting the paths for power flow between entities of the system. Elements on the diagram do not represent the physical size or location of the electrical equipment, but it is a common convention to organize the diagram with the same left-to-right, top-to-bottom sequence as the switchgear or other apparatus represented. A one-line diagram {{can also be used to}} show a high level view of conduit runs for a <b>PLC</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The {{control of}} {{gravimetric}} feeding is generally done by <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> which utilize feedback control. The main problem with these <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> {{is that they}} generally revert to volumetric feeding during the refilling cycle. Furthermore the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> software is proprietary information and therefore not {{in the public sector}} and also very expensive. The main {{purpose of the study was}} therefore to review the basics of gravimetric feeding and to apply the knowledge in the design of a <b>control</b> <b>system</b> with applicable software for gravimetric feeding which is not affected by material bulk density variations, targeting food extrusion applications. It is also aimed at producing a test bench to test the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and the developed software.
