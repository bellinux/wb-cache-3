5000|$|There is a {{trade-off}} between {{the amount of}} time spent figuring out the best query plan and the quality of the choice; the optimizer may not choose the best answer on its own. Different qualities of database management systems have different ways of balancing these two. Cost-based query optimizers evaluate the resource footprint of various query plans and use this as the basis for <b>plan</b> <b>selection.</b> These assign an estimated [...] "cost" [...] to each possible query plan, and choose the plan with the smallest cost. Costs are used to estimate the runtime cost of evaluating the query, in terms of the number of I/O operations required, CPU path length, amount of disk buffer space, disk storage service time, and interconnect usage between units of parallelism, and other factors determined from the data dictionary. The set of query plans examined is formed by examining the possible access paths (e.g., primary index access, secondary index access, full file scan) and various relational table join techniques (e.g., merge join, hash join, product join). The search space can become quite large depending on the complexity of the SQL query. There are two types of optimization. These consist of logical optimization—which generates a sequence of relational algebra to solve the query—and physical optimization—which is used to determine the means of carrying out each operation.|$|E

His first book, Bleeding Edge: The Business of Health Care in the New Century, published in 1998, was a harsh critique of the economic conflict generated by the imposition of untested managed care methods on what was at the time an antiquated, fragmented health care financing and delivery system. His second book, Oxymorons: The Myth of a US Health Care System published in 2001, described in detail a health care system rebuilt around consumer choice, increasing patient cost-sharing, mandated coverage, and exchange-based health <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> - the cornerstones of what would become the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” in 2010. Kleinke’ third book, Catching Babies, published in 2011, is a medical novel about the training of obstetrician-gynecologists and the culture of childbirth in the US. Catching Babies is currently in development as a TV series. From the early 1990s, Kleinke was one of the earliest advocates for the measurement of health care quality, the quantification-based accountability of health care providers, and the computerization of American medicine. He published several journal-length articles on these inter-related subjects in the peer-reviewed policy journal Health Affairs from the mid-1990s through 2005. This work - in particular “Dot-Gov: Market Failure and the Creation of a National Health Information Technology System” - has been widely cited by subsequent researchers and health information technology advocates. Kleinke’s work on these subjects was used by policymakers to formulate legislation mandating and funding the adoption of electronic medical records by US health care providers, culminating with the Health Information Technology Act of 2010.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the feasibility of an adaptive strategy by assessing the interobserver variation in CBCT-based <b>plan</b> <b>selection.</b> Eleven patients with rectum cancer, treated with a non-adaptive strategy, were selected. Five CBCT scans were available per patient. To simulate the <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> strategy, per patient three PTVs were created by varying the anterior upper mesorectum margin. For each CBCT scan, twenty observers selected the smallest PTV that encompassed the target volume. After this initial baseline measurement, the gold standard was determined during a consensus meeting, followed by a second measurement one month later. Differences between both measurements were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

40|$|Background: Radiation therapy (RT) using a daily <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> {{adaptive}} strategy can {{be applied}} to account for interfraction organ motion while limiting organ at risk dose. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the dosimetric consequences of daily <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> compared with non-adaptive RT in cervical cancer. Material and methods: Ten consecutive patients who received pelvic irradiation, planning CTs (full and empty bladder), weekly post-fraction CTs and pre-fraction CBCTs were included. Non-adaptive plans were generated based on the PTV defined using the full bladder planning CT. For the adaptive strategy, multiple PTVs were created based on both planning CTs by ITVs of the primary CTVs (i. e., GTV, cervix, corpus-uterus and upper part of the vagina) and corresponding library plans were generated. Daily CBCTs were rigidly aligned to the full bladder planning CT for <b>plan</b> <b>selection.</b> For daily plan recalculation, selected CTs based on initial similarity were deformably registered to CBCTs. Differences in daily target coverage (D- 98 %> 95 %) and in V- 0. 5 Gy, V- 1. 5 Gy, V- 2 Gy, D- 50 % and D- 2 % for rectum, bladder and bowel were assessed. Results: Non-adaptive RT showed inadequate primary CTV coverage in 17 % of the daily fractions. <b>Plan</b> <b>selection</b> compensated for anatomical changes and improved primary CTV coverage significantly (p < 0. 01) to 98 %. Compared with non-adaptive RT, <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> decreased the fraction dose to rectum and bowel indicated by significant (p < 0. 01) improvements for daily V- 0. 5 Gy, V- 1. 5 Gy, V- 2 Gy, D- 50 % and D- 2 %. However, daily <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> significantly increased the bladder V- 1. 5 Gy, V- 2 Gy, D- 50 % and D- 2 %. Conclusions: In cervical cancer RT, a non-adaptive strategy led to inadequate target coverage for individual patients.

40|$|An {{important}} {{drawback to}} the popular Belief, Desire, and Intentions (BDI) paradigm is that such systems include no element of learning from experience. In particular, the so-called context conditions of plans, on which the whole model relies for <b>plan</b> <b>selection,</b> are restricted to be boolean formulas {{that are to be}} specified at design/implementation time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel BDI programming framework that, by suitably modeling context conditions as decision trees, allows agents to learn the probability of success for plans based on previous execution experiences. By using a probabilistic <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> function, the agents can balance exploration and exploitation of their plans. We develop and empirically investigate two extreme approaches to learning the new context conditions and show that both can be advantageous in certain situations. Finally, we propose a generalization of the probabilistic <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> function that yields a middle-ground between the two extreme approaches, and which we thus argue is the most flexible and simple approach...|$|E
40|$|The belief-desire-intention (BDI) {{model is}} one of the most widely used for {{developing}} agents. One of its benefits is the flexibility of choosing among different plans to achieve a goal and, to leverage this benefit, a particular algorithm that makes this choice must be selected. Although many techniques have been proposed address-ing the <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> process — as well as other aspects of BDI agents — they require many customisations and adaptations to be used in particular applications, thus requiring expert knowledge to be adopted, which is a real barrier to the large-scale adoption of this kind of agent technology. We thus in this paper propose a model-driven approach that allows modelling agents based on an extended BDI model (inspired by the Tropos meta-model) and automatically generating source code that implements agents with the ability of selecting plans. As this <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> process typically involves analysing plan side effects, e. g. cost of execution, in the context of current agent preferences, our approach uses a preference-based <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> process over what we refer to as softgoals. This pro-cess relies on the multi-attribute utility theory, taking into account the uncertainty of plan outcomes. We evaluate our approach exper-imentally...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—When {{an agent}} wants {{to fulfill its}} desires about the world, the agent usually has {{multiple}} plans to choose from and these plans have different pre-conditions and additional effects in addition to achieving its goals. Therefore, for further reasoning and interaction with the world, a <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> strategy (usually based on plan cost estimation) is mandatory for an autonomous agent. This demand becomes even more critical when uncertainty on the observation {{of the world is}} taken into account, since in this case, we consider not only the costs of different plans, but also their chances of success estimated according to the agent’s beliefs. In addition, when multiple goals are considered together, different plans achieving the goals can be conflicting on their preconditions (contexts) or the required resources. Hence a <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> strategy should be able to choose a subset of plans that fulfills the maximum number of goals while maintaining context consistency and resource-tolerance among the chosen plans.

The aim was to quantify the daily dosimetric consequences of <b>plan</b> <b>selection</b> compared to a non-adaptive approach. Ten patients with rectal cancer, treated with 25 Gy in five fractions to the mesorectum and pelvic lymph nodes, were selected. The adaptive strategy was simulated by creating three plans per patient, with varying upper ventral PTV margins, and selecting the smallest PTV covering the entire mesorectum on every daily CBCT scan. Subsequently, mesorectum, bladder, and bowel cavity were delineated on these scans. Daily dose-volume histograms were calculated for both the adaptive and non-adaptive plan, with a ventral PTV margin of 20 mm. Coverage of the mesorectum, defined as V 95 %> 99 %, was calculated, as well as bladder and bowel cavity V 95 % and V 15 Gy. In one patient, mesorectum coverage improved.

To this end, context-dependent merging strategies have been proposed in the literature. In this paper we investigate how one such context-dependent merging strategy (originally defined for possibility theory), called largely partially maximal consistent subsets (LPMCS), {{can be adapted to}} Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory. We identify those measures for the degree of uncertainty and internal conflict that are available in DS theory and show how they can be used for guiding LPMCS merging. A simplified real-world power distribution scenario illustrates our framework.
