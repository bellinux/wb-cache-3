While {{there is no}} one universally agreed upon definition, there are key definitions which capture the scope of government <b>performance</b> <b>auditing.</b> According to Government Auditing Standards, [...] "Performance audits are defined as audits that provide findings or conclusions based on an evaluation of sufficient, appropriate evidence against criteria."

40|$|The {{importance}} of a formal, documented approach and methodology {{as part of the}} audit process is wellrecognised. In South Africa, only a few national departments have dedicated <b>performance</b> <b>audit</b> sections within the Internal Audit Function (IAF), and limited <b>performance</b> <b>audits</b> are being conducted. The limited execution of <b>performance</b> <b>audits</b> and the lack of information on <b>performance</b> <b>audit</b> methodologies adopted within the public sector by IAFs prompted this research. The research objective was to identify the differences in the <b>performance</b> <b>audit</b> planning practices followed by internal auditors within the South African public sector, as well as the reasons behind these differences, by critically comparing the <b>performance</b> <b>audit</b> methodologies within the IAFs in selected national departments with the methodology followed by the AGSA. The results indicated that, although differences do exist between the <b>performance</b> <b>audit</b> planning practices of these institutions and those of the AGSA, numerous similarities also exist. Research on the different planning activities prescribed by the methodologies adopted by national departments and the AGSA provides valuable information that may contribute to the growth of the <b>performance</b> <b>audit</b> discipline in the public sector and could enable the <b>performance</b> <b>audit</b> process itself to become more effective and efficient. It is recommended that national departments and the AGSA consider these differences and the rationale behind these differences when compiling or updating their <b>performance</b> <b>audit</b> methodology.

40|$|Although {{thus far}} only few {{academic}} studies {{were conducted in}} which the effectiveness of <b>performance</b> <b>audits</b> has been examined, it is often contended that these kind of audits impact upon {{and contribute to the}} effectiveness, the efficiency and the accountability of public sector.

50|$|Sawyer often {{talked about}} “catching a manager doing {{something}} right” and providing recognition and positive reinforcement.

Sawyer helped make internal auditing more relevant and more interesting through a sharp focus on operational or <b>performance</b> <b>auditing.</b> He strongly encouraged looking beyond financial statements and financial-related auditing into areas such as purchasing, warehousing and distribution, human resources, information technology, facilities management, customer service, field operations, and program management. This approach helped catapult the chief audit executive into the role of a respected and knowledgeable adviser who was thought to be reasonable, objective, and concerned about helping the organization achieve the stated goals.|$|E
