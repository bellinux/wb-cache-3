40|$|Abstract A {{microcomputer}} interface for computer-assisted monolayer experiments was developed, tested, {{and used}} for analysis of the enzymatic hydrolysis by pancreatic phospholipases A 2 (EC 3. 1. 1. 4) of 1, 2 -didodecanoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -sulfate monitored under constant surface pressure. The interface described multiplexes two different analog signals onto one set of 12 data input lines to the computer.

40|$|Abstract A Virtual Machine {{has led to}} a fully {{automatic}} spot welding system. All necessary parameters are created by measuring systems and algorithms running in the Virtual Machine. A hybrid operating circuit allows the Virtual Machine to read the exact process voltage between the tips of the electrodes every 50 µs. Actual welding voltage and current allow for the first time reading process impedance, electric power and total energy being transferred to the spot weld. Necessary energy input is calculated by a calorimetric model after measuring the total thickness of the materials to be welded as soon as the welding gun is positioned at the workpiece. A <b>precision</b> <b>potentiometer</b> implemented in the gun delivers the total material thickness within the 0. 1 mm range during the pre-pressure phases. The internal databank of the Virtual Machine controls all essential parameters to guide the total welding process. Special generator characteristics of the welding power unit are created by the Virtual Machine just during the upslope and the welding phases. So the process will be initialized in differentiating the kind of material, mild steel or high strengthen steel. This will affect the kind of energy input and current decrease during the upslope and downslope phases...|$|E

At the National Institute for Aerospace Research from Bucharest, Romania, a multidisciplinary collective of scientists performed both theoretical and experimental research on flapping flight.

40|$|Nowadays, {{different}} kinds of experimental realizations of chaotic oscillators have been already presented in the literature.

40|$|A lamp robot that obeys verbal orders. The {{principle}} of the lamp is basically a combination of two new technologies : speech recognition and memory metal. The lamp can move in six directions, and the movements can be generated by extremely small memory metal elements with a total mass of about 3 grams. The temperature of the memory elements and thus also their shape can be remote controlled by a system which exists of a Personal Computer with a speech recognition card and a microphone, an interface with D/A and A/D-converter and amplifier and the lamp robot itself. Heating of the memory metal is achieved by direct resistance heating pulses from the interface. The position of each drive system is recorded continiously by miniature <b>precision</b> <b>potentiometers</b> and any desired intermediate position can be reached and kept by spoken commands. A fast transformation of the TiNi-elements and so short response times is achieved {{by the use of}} very thin flat rolled wire of 0. 2 * 1. 7 mm, produced by Memory Metal Holland in Enschede. This flat wire combines high recovery forces with much higher cooling rates than round wire.

50|$|At {{least in}} 1958, the {{computer}} was the Mk. 47, an hybrid electronic/electromechanical system. Somewhat akin to the Mk. 1A, it had electrical high-precision resolvers instead of the mechanical one of earlier machines, and multiplied with <b>precision</b> linear <b>potentiometers.</b> However, it still had disc/roller integrators as well as shafting to interconnect the mechanical elements. Whereas access {{to much of the}} Mk. 1A required time-consuming and careful disassembly (think days in some instances, and possibly a week to gain access to deeply buried mechanisms), the Mark 47 was built on thick support plates mounted behind the front panels on slides that permitted its six major sections to be pulled out of its housing for easy access to any of its parts. (The sections, when pulled out, moved fore and aft; they were heavy, not counterbalanced. Typically, a ship rolls through a much larger angle than it pitches.) The Mk. 47 probably had 3-D cams for ballistics, but information on it appears very difficult to obtain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Strokes {{are a very}} {{commonly}} occuring medical event. In Australia alone around 53, 000 {{people suffer}} from a stroke each year. A stroke occurs when the normal {{blood flow to the}} brain is interrupted causing sections of the brain located around the affected areas to become starved of oxygen and nutrients. The damage caused to the brain during a stroke can leave the affected person with different types of mental and physical disabilities. It is currently known that the physical disbalilities that can result after a stroke can be overcome by the use of physical therapy allowing a stroke victim to continue a normal life. The aim of this project was to design and build a computer based system that could assess and exercise the upper extremities of stroke patients. A literature review revealed that the most successful outcome that has been seen with experimental physical rehabilitation is to combine constraint induced therapy with robot-aided neuro-rehabilitation. The system that was designed over the course of this project operated within a two dimensional field, therfore only two degrees of freedom were required. The movements of this two link system were measured and logged with the use of two <b>precision</b> <b>potentiometers,</b> one located in each rotational joint. This allows all movements made by the patient to be later recalled to assess progress the patient has made. Improvements would be determined by comparing the path the patient has taken compared to the optimum path between targets. Overall the system had very high precision and was able to obtain the required work area for sufficient exercise to be completed. The GUI developed in coordination with the stroke technology is simple to use and bug free. The GUI was designed to be very adaptable to the requirements for any user by adding as many functions as possible while still remaining simple. The future work required on this system would include further researching the tracking technology and possibly incorporating a more accurate potentiometer. The system currently offers passive exercise, the addition of other technolgies (e. g. DC motors) has still yet to be introduced to allow active movement. Suggestions of possible technologies and designs to incorporate this function are discussed throughout this dissertation. The GUI software should be further developed to allow automatic improvement calculations to be performed, and displayed in a user friendly manner e. g. percentage of improvement...|$|R

50|$|The company {{produces}} {{a wide range}} of weighing products. The present day product line includes industrial scales, moisture analyzers, and force gauges, and newer versions of lab and analytical balances. An up-to-date line of prescription scales and systems is available for pharmacies. Sensitivity ranges from 0.0001g for its analytical balances, 0.001g for its laboratory and prescription scales, and 0.01g for its industrial scales. Capacities range from 50.0g up to 6000.0g for the lab, analytical, prescription and industrial scales. Torbal crane scales and force gauges can go to higher capacities. The company has produced many products thatreceived industry recognition, e.g., magazine ranking or metrology society awards. The most famous was the Model EA-1 which was the first analytical balance to use electronic force substitution. The last three digits of weight were read from a digital Veeder Root dial that was linked to a <b>precision</b> 10 turn <b>potentiometer.</b> The potentiometer output voltage was converted to force coil current which caused a magnet suspended from the weigh beam to apply a linear force to bring the mechanism into a precise balance condition. Also in the balance an E-Core type structure was used to detect the beam position and the result was displayed on an electronic zero center null meter. The first three decades were done with digital weight loading dials. This balance, which was marketed starting in the early 1960s, is still in use in many labs around the country and they appear fairly regularly on e-bay as they are retired.|$|R
