These tests had relied on technology from 3rd-party partners, but in September 2010, YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure. In April 2011, YouTube announced the rollout of YouTube Live, with a <b>portal</b> <b>page</b> at the URL [...] "www.youtube.com/live". The creation of live streams was initially limited to select partners. It {{was used for}} real-time broadcasting of {{events such as the}} 2012 Olympics in London. In October 2012, more than 8 million people watched Felix Baumgartner's jump from the edge of space as a live stream on YouTube.|$|E

40|$|Library Wageningen UR is a {{relatively}} small, but highly specialized academic library serving {{a population of about}} 5900 researchers and 4700 students in the life sciences. To better serve the needs of our users portal functionality has been introduced gradually to our Desktop Library. A beginning was made with the implementation of portal functionality with the development of subject oriented <b>portal</b> <b>pages,</b> where patrons will find a selection of bibliographies, core journals, reference works and selected websites. There was a need for these pages, since the list of ‘shortcuts’, was found to be too overwhelming for newcomers. However a guided selection system for the library resources failed to meet the requirements of these newcomers to help them with the selection of the right library resources to start their queries. These subject-oriented pages are XML pages generated by queries on our library catalogue. At this moment there are about 110 different subject oriented <b>portal</b> <b>pages.</b> In discussion with our customers the usefulness of these pages has always been stressed, especially for newcomers to the various specialities, but not for the researchers themselves Our second approach to the implementation of portal functionality was the possibility o...|$|R

50|$|Portlets produce {{fragments}} of markup (HTML, XHTML, WML) code that are aggregated into a portal. Typically, following the desktop metaphor, a <b>portal</b> <b>page</b> is displayed {{as a collection}} of non-overlapping portlet windows, where each portlet window displays a portlet. Hence a portlet (or collection of portlets) resembles a web-based application that is hosted in a portal.|$|E

In this paper, we present the main principles of a new ontology acquisition framework applied for semi-automatic generation of scientific portals.

This presentation is an overview of the development processes used on a portal project for managing information in an aero-space manufacturing environment. The focus here is on the pre-production usability re-search, which included interviews with and observations of content owners, content users, management and others, to document processes, terminology, and artifacts; user naviga-tion was also analyzed. The final results were recommendations for a documents directory structure (taxonomy), content for the <b>portal</b> <b>pages</b> based on user profiles, prototype mock-ups, and recommen-dations based on user navigation...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{web portals}} contain {{large amount of}} {{information}} that is meant for various visitors or groups of visitors. To effectively navigate within the content the website needs to “know ” its users {{in order to provide}} personalized content to them. We propose a method for automatic estimation of the user’s interest in a web page he visits. This estimation is used for the recommendation of web <b>portal</b> <b>pages</b> (through presenting adaptive links) that the user might like.

50|$|In-Site Montréal is a {{collection}} of site-specific art presented on the <b>portal</b> <b>pages</b> of five wireless internet hotspots in the Île Sans Fil network. Artists Nicolas Fleming, Maria Legault, and Virginie Laganière have created artwork that can be viewed simply by logging into the Île Sans Fil hotspots shown on the In-Site Montréal map. These playful works respond directly to the hotspots that they are situated in, so the users are treated to a creative and innovative viewpoint on the local environment they may not have expected. Curated by Michelle Kasprzak, a new media curator and Ile Sans Fil volunteer, this project is supported through partnership with Year Zero One.|$|R
