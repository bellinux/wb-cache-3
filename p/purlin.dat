500|$|The {{framing of}} the house is unusual because it has [...] "longitudinal summer beams {{extending}} from the end girts to the chimney girts in both the hall and the parlor. Corner and intermediate posts are flared in gunstock pattern. The walls are sheathed with vertical planking except in the attic gables, where the planks are laid horizontally, alternating the taper. Framing is cased in the parlor and exposed in the hall, where the summers are adzed and roughly chamfered." [...] The attic construction is conventional with equally spaced rafters that have mortise and tenon joints at the ridge. This type of construction indicates that the conventional principal rafter or <b>purlin</b> framing may not have been used in Ledyard during that time.|$|E
2500|$|The English barn (also {{known as}} a three-bay barn, Connecticut barn, Yankee barn, thirty-by-forty and {{sometimes}} confusingly called a New England barn) was built from a very early date in the northeast United States. The defining characteristics are the big, swinging doors on the sidewall with strap hinges mounted on pintles and three or sometimes four bays. The doors being on the side walls creates the spatial arrangement of the bays being the main divisions of these barns. The English barns were built {{during the period of}} using scribe rule framing (the irregular timbers were laid out and scribed to fit together). The framing was raised in sidewall assemblies, made with hewn timbers, in northern New England frequently had common <b>purlin</b> roofs, and often framed with the English tying joint on flared (gunstock) posts although these are not defining characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|Trigg was {{a prosperous}} grocer with a twin-gabled shop in Middle Row, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, {{as well as}} a number of other properties. He was a churchwarden, an {{overseer}} of the parish, and an important man locally. It is said that one night, he and two friends witnessed grave robbers at a local graveyard, and they vowed to make sure that this would not happen to them. Trigg stated in his will that his body should be committed for a minimum of 30 years to [...] "the West end of my Hovel to be decently laid there upon a floor erected by my Executor, upon the <b>purlin</b> for the same purpose, nothing doubting but that at the general Resurrection, I shall receive the same again by the mighty power of God." [...] According to Gentleman's Magazine of 5 Feb 1751, Trigg's will stated that he supposed that he would return to life after 30 years and then his estate would revert to him, and that he ordered that the barn be locked with the key inside his coffin so that he could let himself out. Shortly before he died, Trigg had negotiated with the parish authorities to rent his barn as the town's workhouse.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an investigation into}} the structural behaviour of cold-formed steel zed- and channel-section <b>purlins</b> when subjected to uplift loading in purlin-sheeting systems. In pre-buckling, an analytical model is presented to describe the bending and twisting behaviour of partially restrained zed- and channel-section <b>purlins</b> when subjected to uplift loading. Formulae used to calculate the bending stresses of the roof <b>purlins</b> are derived by using the classical bending theory of thin-walled beams. Detailed comparisons are made between the present model and the simplified model proposed in Eurocode EN 1993 - 1 - 3. In buckling, a numerical investigation is presented on the buckling behaviour of partially restrained cold formed steel zed- and channel-section <b>purlins</b> when subject to transverse distributed uplift loading. The buckling behaviour of zed- and channel-section <b>purlins</b> of different dimensions subjected to uplift loading under the influence of rotational spring stiffness applied on the middle line of the upper flange is examined. In the post-buckling, nonlinear finite element analysis models are created for the partially restrained cold-formed steel zed- and channel-section <b>purlins</b> subjected to transverse uniformly distributed uplift loading. The analyses are performed by considering both geometric and material nonlinearities, and corresponding design curves of zed- and channel-section <b>purlins</b> are established...|$|R
2500|$|Development of the New England barn began {{early in}} the 19th century, but they usually date from after 1830. They were the most popular barn type in New England by 1860. The {{construction}} {{is very different from}} the English barn [...] typically being built using the square rule method of joinery, raised in bents, [...] increasingly of sawn rather than hewn timbers, common rafter roof framing with <b>purlin</b> plates, designed to be used with a , straight posts rather than flared (gunstock) posts, and dropped tie beam framing rather than the English tying joint. The doors are mounted on the gable end rather than the sidewall and after the 1840s mounted on rollers so they slide sideways rather than being mounted on hinges and swinging outward. Sometimes they have interior sliding doors. Doors on rollers are believed to have been a development from rail cars which had sliding doors. A full basement became standard and was used primarily for manure management with trap doors in the floor of the tie-up so manure was easily shoveled into the basement for later use on the fields. This is a significant difference between the Pennsylvania Barn where the cows were housed on the basement level. The basements also had sliding doors, sometimes arranged as a drive through passage. The foundation is dry laid stone, some of which may have been split rather than just being field-stone; and some barns have a top course of large, rectangular, quarried stones. The drive floor was not needed for hand threshing since threshing machines were available by this time. Scarf joints were needed to join timbers longitudinally because these barns are larger in size and the timber supply was more limited so full length timbers were not available. Roof overhangs of a foot are typically built in on the gables and eaves protecting the walls from water. Later in the 19th century these barns may also have ventilators or a cupola on the roof to help reduce moisture build-up inside. Stairways are sometimes found in New England barns but built-in ladders are common but less prevalent than ladders found in the New World Dutch barn. The number and size of cows were larger and were given more headroom so the New England barns were not just longer and wider but taller. Also the New England barn was popular during the period in northern New England when the connected farm building arrangement was popular and so were more likely to be connected to the house through a series of smaller rooms. Some New England barns have an indoor silo. These barns are easier to add on to by adding more bays. The New England barn almost always has a gable roof, but a gambrel roof form may be found on some New England barns. Sometimes the New England barn is framed with studs in the walls and horizontal sheathing boards instead of the more common rails with vertical sheathing.|$|E

40|$|Cold {{formed steel}} (CFS) sigma {{sections}} {{are commonly used}} as <b>purlins</b> {{in the construction of}} modern industrial and residential buildings due to their excellent strength-to-weight ratio. This thesis reports investigations on the structural behaviour of CFS sigma <b>purlins</b> in three different parts of modern roof systems. In the first investigation, the pre-buckling, buckling, post-buckling and post-failure behaviour of continuous CFS sigma <b>purlins</b> near internal supports was studied by experimental and numerical methods. In the second investigation, the moment-rotation response as well as the moment resistance of the sleeve connection of sigma <b>purlins</b> was studied by laboratory tests. Engineering models were developed to predict the behaviour of this connection and a good correlation was observed with the experimental data. In the third investigation, the flexural stiffness and moment resistance of CFS sigma <b>purlins</b> fastened to roof sheeting with large screw spacing was studied experimentally. The purlin-sheeting assemblies were subjected to both downward and uplift loadings, from which different behavioural aspects such as flexural stiffness, failure modes and ultimate load were examined. Test results are utilized to develop design proposals for sigma <b>purlins</b> that codes or standards have not yet covered. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{advantage of}} cold-formed steel {{is the great}} flexibility of cross-sectional shapes and sizes available to the structural steel designer. However, the lack of standard optimized shapes makes {{the selection of the}} most economical shape very difficult. This task is further complicated by the complex and highly nonlinear nature of the rules that govern their designs. In this thesis, genetic algorithms are used to carry out the optimization of cold-formed steel <b>purlins,</b> which are assumed to be continuous over two spans subjected to a gravity load. A genetic algorithm based optimum design method for cold-formed steel <b>purlins</b> is developed firstly. This method obtains the optimum dimensions for <b>purlins</b> with the highest load efficiency subjected to the geometrical and strength constraints provided in Eurocode 3, Part 1. 3, and fabrication constraints. The design of cold-formed steel <b>purlins</b> is based on Eurocode 3, Part 1. 3. The integrated design method is general for any shape of cold-formed steel <b>purlins.</b> However, in this thesis, the investigations are concentrated on Z-shape and Σ-shape cold-formed steel <b>purlins.</b> With this design method, an optimization tool and a set of optimum sections that can be easily accessed are provided for structural steel designers and steel manufacturers. An integration of a modified Eurocode 3 method into genetic algorithm optimization is carried out. Currently, the design of cold-formed steel <b>purlins</b> in Eurocode 3 relies on the effective width approach. The method works by considering the strength reduction due to local plate buckling as an effective width for each element of the cross-section and to a distortional buckling as a reduced thickness for the stiffener. In the modified Eurocode 3 method, the numerical elastic buckling stresses are introduced into the calculation of the effective section properties. Via this integration, it is shown that such numerical method as the finite strip method may also be integrated into the genetic algorithm optimization process. In addition, the modified Eurocode 3 method depends on the buckling types which differs from the variations of the dimension. Thus, the typical buckling types of the Z-shape and Σ-shape cold-formed steel <b>purlins</b> are investigated. reviewe...|$|R
