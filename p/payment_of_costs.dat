5000|$|In {{international}} law and diplomacy, a compromis (French for [...] "special agreement") is an agreement between two parties to submit a dispute to international arbitration for a binding resolution. A compromis is made after a dispute has already arisen, rather than before. (This {{is in contrast to}} provisions in existing treaties or protocols made before the dispute arose). The compromis identifies a neutral third party - the arbitrator or arbitral tribunal - or specifies the manner of appointment. The compromis often sets forth the precise question or questions to be decided; the arbitral rules of procedure; the seat of the tribunal; the languages {{to be used in the}} proceeding; the applicable law; and the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{get around}} the issue of {{confidentiality}} referred to above, a standard procedure consent order, known as a Tomlin Order is entered into.

The order also deals with <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs,</b> and payments of money out of court if any money is held by the court (as these are matters which must be dealt with by Court Order). However, the actual terms of the settlement are dealt with in a 'schedule' to the order, which can remain confidential. Breach of the schedule can be dealt with as breach of contract, or breach of the consent order.|$|E

50|$|St Alban's {{increasingly}} {{became a}} focus of Low Church ire, drawing the attention of Lord Shaftesbury and the ultra-Protestant and anti-ritualist Church Association. In 1867, a prosecution was brought against Mackonochie by John Martin, supported by the Church Association, under the Church Discipline Act 1840. The charges brought were elevating the host above his head, using a mixed chalice and altar lights, censing things and persons, and kneeling during the prayer of consecration. The first decision (of the Court of Arches) was against Mackonochie on two counts and in his favour on the other three, with no decision as to the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b> Despite Mackonochie agreeing to comply, the anti-ritualists appealed to the Privy Council, which found against Mackonochie in the remaining three charges; and {{he was ordered to}} pay all costs. Even after the prosecution the Church Association continued to pursue Mackonochie, believing that he had re-introduced the prohibited ritual. This led to further judgments against Mackonochie, culminating on 25 November 1870 with his suspension from office for three months. In the interim he had become a hate-figure for the Low Church; in 1869 he was banned from preaching in the Diocese of Ripon and a Low Church cleric, Hugh M‘Neile, refused to speak at the Liverpool Church Congress because Mackonochie would also be speaking.|$|E
5000|$|Controversy arose over plans {{which had}} {{originated}} in the late 1970s to convert the small Warnervale Airport into a commercial and freight airport and regional hub, expected in 1995 to operate 24 {{hours a day and}} cater for 65,000 flights annually - even as the state's property development agency, Landcom, was advertising estates in the area as [...] "tranquil". The upgrade was expected in 1994 to cost 6 million, and a proposal by Traders Finance Australia to develop the airport was accepted in January 1995, with contracts being signed in July 1995. Residents responded by forming the Central Coast Airport Action Group, and taking the Wyong Shire Council to the Land and Environment Court to fight the move. The action failed, and Wyong Shire Council demanded <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> from the residents group. However, the State Government intervened, passing the Warnervale Airport (Restrictions) Act 1996, which restricted future aircraft movements, the length and siting of the runway, and any future expansion of airport operations, and compensating residents for $65,000 in legal bills. In 1999, the Wyong Shire Council proposed extending the runway to 1600 metres to cater for jet aircraft of between 50 and 116 passengers, but the plans were eventually scrapped in a council meeting in February 2003 which decided instead to focus on job creation as a driver for the area's growth, including assisting the establishment of a $100 million distribution centre for Woolworths Limited on part of the land initially earmarked for the airport upgrade.|$|E
