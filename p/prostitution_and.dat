Eventually, she got out of <b>prostitution</b> <b>and,</b> with her mother's support, went through drug rehabilitation, finished high school, and eventually received a diploma in Wife Assault and Child Advocacy from George Brown College.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Communist rule in China, the social status of women {{improved}} greatly. Women were empowered to work outside the home. Communist rule also brought {{about the end of}} practices such as foot binding, child marriages, <b>prostitution,</b> <b>and</b> arranged marriages. China has seen a decrease in domestic violence due to government-supported grassroots programs to counter these practices. Women in rural areas remain largely uneducated.|$|E
5|$|California {{was quickly}} granted {{statehood}} in 1850 and the U.S. military built Fort Point at the Golden Gate and a fort on Alcatraz Island {{to secure the}} San Francisco Bay. Silver discoveries, including the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859, further drove rapid population growth. With hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city, lawlessness was common, and the Barbary Coast section of town gained notoriety as a haven for criminals, <b>prostitution,</b> <b>and</b> gambling.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{views of}} {{pornography}} range from condemnation of pornography {{as a form}} of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression. Feminists' views on prostitution vary, but many of these perspectives can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive of <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> sex work.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, The New York Times Book Review {{published}} a lengthy letter of hers {{in which she}} describes the origins of her deeply felt hatred of <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> pornography ("mass-produced, technologized prostitution") as her history of being violently inspected by prison doctors, and battered by her first husband and numerous other men.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{proposed}} high-risk transmission channels, {{allowing the}} virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic {{with the emergence of}} colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of <b>prostitution,</b> <b>and</b> the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church calls {{all members}} to {{practise}} chastity {{according to their}} state in life.

Chastity {{for those who are}} not married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the century, some of {{the most}} widely read Russian {{literary}} figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to forced <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> slavery, a theme that he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{concession}} was given construction of the railway had already started. At the most 2,000 workers {{were involved in the}} construction of the plant, the Rjukan Line, and the Tinnoset Line. This was in addition to the Svelgfoss Power Station and a new potassium nitrate factory in Notodden. During the construction one worker lost his life in a landslide, while two survived the accident. Housing was provided in simple barracks, and few laborers came with family. <b>Prostitution</b> <b>and</b> the sale of illegal liquor during the prohibition flourished; the lack of proper law enforcement making Vestfjorddalen known as a lawless valley.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo III de' Medici (14 August 1642 – 31 October 1723) was the {{penultimate}} (sixth) Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany.

Cosimo's 53-year-long reign, the longest in Tuscan history, was marked {{by a series of}} ultra-reactionary laws which regulated <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> banned May celebrations. His reign also witnessed Tuscany's deterioration to previously unknown economic lows. He was succeeded by his elder surviving son, Gian Gastone, when he died, in 1723.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the {{territory}} gained its first representative in the Parliament, although at first with limited speaking and voting rights.

In 1988 it gained {{the trappings of}} self-government with a Legislative Assembly {{with most of the}} powers and responsibilities of an Australian state, although subject to a federal right of veto, similar to the arrangements adopted for the Northern Territory in 1978. The Legislative Assembly legalised some things that were prohibited in other parts of Australia, such as <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> X-rated pornography; in 2006, an attempt to allow civil unions for same-sex couples was overruled by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria's {{human rights}} record remains poor; {{according}} to the US Department of State, the most significant human rights problems are: use of excessive force by security forces; impunity for abuses by security forces; arbitrary arrests; prolonged pretrial detention; judicial corruption and executive influence on the judiciary; rape, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners, detainees and suspects; harsh and life‑threatening prison and detention centre conditions; human trafficking {{for the purpose of}} <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> forced labour; societal violence and vigilante killings; child labour, child abuse and child sexual exploitation; domestic violence; discrimination based on ethnicity, region and religion.|$|E
5|$|One of the East End {{industries}} that serviced ships moored off the Pool of London was <b>prostitution,</b> <b>and</b> in the 17th century, this was centred on the Ratcliffe Highway, a long street {{lying on the}} high ground above the riverside settlements. In 1600, it was described by the antiquarian John Stow as 'a continual street, or filthy straight passage, with alleys of small tenements or cottages builded, inhabited by sailors and victuallers.' Crews were 'paid off' {{at the end of}} a long voyage, and would spend their earnings on drink in the local taverns.|$|E

5|$|Street {{crime was}} {{prevalent}} in Indianapolis during the war. The city government increased its police force, local merchants hired private security, and guards were posted at Union Station {{to deal with}} law-enforcement issues. Fights, robberies, gambling, <b>prostitution,</b> <b>and</b> drunkenness became significant problems. Prohibition of alcohol sales had to be established in the city. Because {{there was so much}} street violence, city police never bothered to discover who murdered an officer from Pennsylvania. The bodies of many deceased soldiers killed in the war were held at Indianapolis's Union Station, awaiting transport to their eventual burial spots.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had good}} {{relations}} with other towns, Silver Reef had the usual labor disputes between mining camp wage laborers and mine owners. After a major dispute with the Stormont Mining Company, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed to support wages. Gambling, <b>prostitution,</b> <b>and</b> shootouts were also commonplace. One shootout involved Town Marshal Johnny Diamond and mine guard Jack Truby. Tensions between Diamond and Truby temporarily shut down the Kinner mine. Truby was hired by Colonel Enos Wall, foreman {{and owner of the}} Kinner, to guard the mine until told otherwise. Diamond went to the Kinner mine to serve the closure warrant, but Truby refused to allow Diamond into the mine, and forced Diamond to leave the property immediately.|$|E
5|$|As {{the title}} suggests, {{one of the}} major themes of the film {{involves}} the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling. This is perhaps most strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the vow of celibacy required of Catholic priests. As Father John goes deeper into the red-light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis, he appears to face temptations from the <b>prostitution</b> <b>and</b> overt sexuality surrounding him. Additionally, it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction, as well as a desire to help her. This is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend, for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings. The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions when it comes to maintaining his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine.|$|E
