50|$|In the New Forest of {{southern}} England, a particular right <b>of</b> <b>turbary</b> belongs not {{to an individual}} person, dwelling or plot of land, but to a particular hearth and chimney.|$|R
50|$|The water which descends Rowten Pot sinks 150 m to {{the west}} of the pot on the other side <b>of</b> <b>Turbary</b> Road, into a shallow {{horizontal}} cave system, known as Rowten Caves.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the site}} <b>of</b> the <b>Turbary</b> Woods Owl and Bird Sanctuary.|$|R
5000|$|Geographic regions <b>of</b> <b>turbary</b> {{works in}} Europe include the Netherlands, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and The Broads in Norfolk and Suffolk, England, and the Audomarois lakes near Saint-Omer, France [...] The term {{is also used}} in colloquial {{language}} by older generations in Ireland, {{in places such as}} County Clare, to refer to the area where turf is cut, or to the material extracted.|$|R
50|$|Turbary is {{the ancient}} right to cut turf, or peat, for fuel on a {{particular}} area of bog. The word may {{also be used to}} describe the associated piece of bog or peatland and, by extension, the material extracted from the turbary. Turbary rights, which are more fully expressed legally as common <b>of</b> <b>turbary,</b> are often associated with commonage, or, in some cases, rights over another person's land.|$|R
50|$|In {{more recent}} times, as the {{ecological}} {{significance of the}} bog lands has been better understood, and {{as the amount of}} remaining peat has been decreasing, partly due to fuel usage and partly due to usage of peat as fertiliser, as well as agricultural incursions into drained bog lands, some of the remaining bogs have come under environmental protection. This has created controversy over the rights <b>of</b> <b>turbary,</b> and in some cases extinguished the right.|$|R
50|$|Like most fen-edge parishes, it {{was laid}} out more than a {{thousand}} years ago, in an elongated form, to afford the produce from a variety of habitats for the villagers. The village itself lies along the road between King Street, a road built in the second century, and Baston Fen which is on the margin of the much bigger Deeping Fen. Until the nineteenth century, the heart of Deeping Fen was a common fen on which all the surrounding villages had rights <b>of</b> <b>turbary,</b> fowling and pasture.|$|R
50|$|Commoning has {{probably}} existed in Scotland {{for over a}} millennium. However, there is no modern legislation relating to commons which formally identifies the extent of common land or clarifies {{the full range of}} rights. The right <b>of</b> <b>turbary</b> - the ability to cut peat as fuel - clearly exists in large parts of Scotland, whilst the scale of such rights, {{and the extent to which}} they are utilised, remain unknown. The main work undertaken on Scottish commons concerns grazing, using a pragmatic definition, where such commons were defined as pastures with multiple grazing rights and/or multiple graziers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913, the [...] "advanced nationalist" [...] Keating Branch {{took control}} of the Gaelic League and O'Flanagan was elected to the Standing Committee for two years. After the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, he was sent to neutral Italy to advocate Irish independence in Rome. On 1 August 1914, Coyne transferred him to Cliffoney and Grange parish in north county Sligo. There he called for land redistribution to his parishioners, condemned the export of food from the area, and demanded a continuation <b>of</b> <b>turbary</b> rights. In newspaper pieces he contrasted Irish opinion-makers' outrage against Germany's contemporary treatment of Belgium with their indifference to England's ongoing treatment of Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|After the Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland, {{the lands of}} la Garde, or the Ward, were possessed by the family of le Bank. Nicholas le Bank was granted extensive property in Ireland by King Henry II of England. In {{the first half of}} the thirteenth century a right <b>of</b> <b>turbary</b> in his [...] "tenement near Finglas" [...] was conveyed by Sir Raymond le Bank to the canons of All Saints. During {{the first half of the}} sixteenth century the castle, round which the village sprang up, was occupied by Richard Delahide, who was a judge. The castle came into the possession of the barons of Howth.|$|R
