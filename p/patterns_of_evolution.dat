40|$|We {{argue that}} if there is a {{category}} of slightly deleterious mutations, then there should be a category of slightly advantageous back-mutations. We show that when there are both slightly deleterious and advantageous back-mutations, there is likely to be an increase in the rate <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> after a population size expansion. This increase in the rate <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> is short-lived. However, we show how its signature can be captured by comparing the rate <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> in species that have undergone population size expansion versus contraction. We test our model by comparing the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> in pairs <b>of</b> island and mainland species in which the colonization event was either island-to-mainland (population size expansion) or mainland-to-island (contraction).

Polymorphism in one phocid species, the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), was comparable to that seen in human populations, while the other phocid, the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), has been through a severe population bottleneck and exhibited much less variation at this locus. A phylogenetic comparison of the four species {{was consistent with the}} trans-specific <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> described for other taxa at this locus, and relative nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates suggest the maintenance of polymorphisms by natural selection.
