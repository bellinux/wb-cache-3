5|$|The first {{specimens}} of C.mutica outside of its native range was recovered from Humboldt Bay, California by Donald M. Martin in 1973. Martin misidentified {{them as a}} subspecies of C.acanthogaster. He named them Caprella acanthogaster humboldtiensis. Additional specimens (also treated as C.acanthogaster or C. acanthogaster humboldtiensis) were recovered between 1976 and 1978 from the Oakland Estuary, Elkhorn Slough, and San Francisco Bay. It wasn't until 1981, when the specimens were correctly identified as C.mutica by Dan C. Marelli. Along with additional specimens discovered in 1983 in Coos Bay, Oregon, these populations {{are believed to have}} been introduced to the area {{as a result of the}} importation of oyster spat of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) from Japan for oyster farming. Oysters are usually transported with algae as a <b>packing</b> <b>material,</b> particularly Sargassum muticum in which C. mutica are associated with.|$|E

25|$|Void {{volume is}} the amount of space in a column that is {{occupied}} by solvent. It is the space within the column that is outside of the column's internal <b>packing</b> <b>material.</b> Void volume is measured on a chromatogram as the first component peak detected, which is usually the solvent that was present in the sample mixture; ideally the sample solvent flows through the column without interacting with the column, but is still detectable as distinct from the HPLC solvent. The void volume is used as a correction factor.|$|E

25|$|In modern {{industrial}} uses, a <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> {{is used in}} {{the column}} instead of trays when low pressure drops across the column are required. Other factors that favor packing are: vacuum systems, smaller diameter columns, corrosive systems, systems prone to foaming, systems requiring low liquid holdup, and batch distillation. Conversely, factors that favor plate columns are: presence of solids in feed, high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges.|$|E
25|$|As the {{solution}} to be purified is heated, its vapors rise to the fractionating column. As it rises, it cools, condensing on the condenser walls and the surfaces of the <b>packing</b> <b>material.</b> Here, the condensate continues to be heated by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, {{the composition of the}} fresh vapors are determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a theoretical plate) will yield a purer solution of the more volatile component. In reality, each cycle at a given temperature does not occur at exactly the same position in the fractionating column; theoretical plate is thus a concept rather than an accurate description.|$|E
25|$|S. schenckii has a {{worldwide}} distribution but {{certain areas of}} the world including Peru, have a higher incidence of disease.

S. schenckii is often isolated from plants and associated <b>packing</b> <b>material.</b> Gardeners, landscapers, and foresters are at high risk of infection. Sporothrix infection can also be transmitted by cat bites or scratches. This mode of transmission has been responsible for epidemics of sporotrichosis. Immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk of infection and such patients often exhibit more severe forms of disease.|$|E

25|$|The {{collection}} contains 111 mummies, mostly women, with some men and about 20 children, but only 59 {{of these are}} on display. It is considered the largest collection of mummies in the Western Hemisphere. Almost {{all of the people}} were commoners and came from backgrounds such as miners and farmers. The mummies were disinterred from the municipal cemetery between 1870 and 1958, and were people who died between 1850 and 1950. The first of the documented mummies, which has been on display {{in one form or another}} since the 1870s, is that of a French doctor named Remigio Leroy. He can be seen at the current museum. Of the children in the collection, one can see evidence of a practice where deceased Catholic children were dressed as angels, if girls, or as saints, if boys, to indicate their purity and assured entrance into heaven. Several are babies, including one considered the smallest mummy in the world. Two of these small bodies were partially embalmed by taking out internal organs and replacing the cavities with <b>packing</b> <b>material.</b> One was a fetus, which probably miscarried at about 24 weeks, and the other is a newborn male infant. This embalming process may have enhanced the natural mummification process but was not the cause. It is not known why these had been embalmed, nor are their years of death exactly known. There is a mummy of a woman who died in childbirth or miscarriage (a dried placenta is attached to her) but it is not known if she is the mother of either of these mummified children.|$|E
25|$|Cats were mummified as {{religious}} offerings in enormous quantities and {{were believed to}} represent the war goddess Bastet. This cult was primarily centered at Thebes and Beni Hasan beginning in the Ptolemaic Period. At Beni Hasan, {{there were so many}} cat mummies {{that at the end of}} the 19th century, a total of 19 tons of mummified Egyptian cats were shipped to England to be used as fertilizer. In addition, thousands of cat mummies have been found at the catacombs of Saqqara. Cats who were bred to become offerings of this type usually died due to strangulation or the breaking of their necks. During mummification, the cat bodies would be dried and filled with soil, sand or some other kind of <b>packing</b> <b>material.</b> They were either positioned with their limbs folded closely to their bodies or in a sitting, lifelike position. The wrapping was usually completed through intricate, geometric patterns. Early in the development of animal mummification, cat mummies were placed in little bronze or wooden sarcophagi. More expensive mummies were typically adorned with features drawn in black paint and colored glass, obsidian or rock crystal eyes. Kittens and fetuses were mummified and buried inside the stomach of a statue that represented their mother. As time went by, like all mummies designed for this purpose, the mummification became less precise. In fact, Sir T. C. S. Morrison-Scott, Director of the British Museum of Natural History, unwrapped a large number of cat mummies, but discovered many were simply stuffed with random body parts of cats and not mummified with detailed care.|$|E
500|$|Another way of {{improving}} the separation in a distillation column {{is to use a}} <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> instead of trays. [...] These offer the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to plates or trays), beneficial when operating under vacuum. [...] If a distillation tower uses packing instead of trays, the number of necessary theoretical equilibrium stages is first determined and then the packing height equivalent to a theoretical equilibrium stage, known as the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP), is also determined. [...] The total packing height required is the number of theoretical stages multiplied by the HETP.|$|E

500|$|This <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> {{can either}} be random dumped packing such as Raschig rings or {{structured}} sheet metal. [...] Liquids tend to wet {{the surface of the}} packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. [...] Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor–liquid equilibrium, the vapor–liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when modeling packed columns it is useful to compute a number of theoretical plates to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect to more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing performance.|$|E
500|$|Although {{small size}} units, mostly made of glass, {{can be used}} in laboratories, {{industrial}} units are large, vertical, steel vessels [...] (see images 1 and 2) known as [...] "distillation towers" [...] or [...] "distillation columns". [...] To improve the separation, the tower is normally provided inside with horizontal plates or trays as shown in image 5, or the column is packed with a <b>packing</b> <b>material.</b> [...] To provide the heat required for the vaporization involved in distillation and also to compensate for heat loss, heat is most often added {{to the bottom of the}} column by a reboiler, and the purity of the top product can be improved by recycling some of the externally condensed top product liquid as reflux. [...] Depending on their purpose, distillation columns may have liquid outlets at intervals up the length of the column as shown in image 4.|$|E
500|$|To {{move all}} the stones, Byne and Steilberg had a road built to the Tagus, and a barge {{attached}} to a fixed cable was assigned to ferry stones across. An old World War I trench railway {{was brought in to}} transport stones from the monastery to the ferry; its rails could be laid into any of the buildings. Men pushed the small rail cars along the narrow gauge tracks; the stones were then lifted into the ferry by crane, and another crane lifted them out of the ferry into trucks. One of the biggest problems that Byne encountered was that Spain's three excelsior factories could not make enough <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> to keep the crate-packing crew supplied. At one point, realizing that the stones were likely to be used in California as external cladding for structural steel walls, Steilberg suggested the facing surface of each stone be sliced to a [...] "veneer" [...] of the thickness of [...] for easier packing and shipping, but Hearst wanted to retain the authenticity of the full-sized stones.

500|$|Throughout the 1970s, the Mary Rose was meticulously surveyed, {{excavated}} {{and recorded}} {{with the latest}} methods {{within the field of}} maritime archaeology. Working in an underwater environment meant that principles of land-based archaeology did not always apply. Mechanical excavators, airlifts and suction dredges were used in the process of locating the wreck, but as soon as it began to be uncovered in earnest, more delicate techniques were employed. Many objects from the Mary Rose had been well preserved in form and shape, but many were quite delicate, requiring careful handling. Artefacts of all sizes were supported with soft <b>packing</b> <b>material,</b> such as old plastic ice cream containers, and some of the arrows that were [...] "soft like cream cheese" [...] had to be brought up in special styrofoam containers. The airlifts that sucked up clay, sand and dirt off-site or to the surface were still used, but with much greater precision since they could potentially disrupt the site. The many layers of sediment that had accumulated on the site could be used to date artefacts in which they were found, and had to be recorded properly. The various types of accretions and remnants of chemicals with artefacts were essential clues to objects that had long since broken down and disappeared, and needed to be treated with considerable care.|$|E
