However, a number of athletes have achieved success in both middle- and long-distance events, including Saïd Aouita who set world records from 1500m to 5000m. The use of pace-setters in long distance events is very common at the elite level, although they are not present at championship level competitions as all qualified competitors want to win.|$|E
5|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} disability grouped {{into one of}} five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific <b>physical</b> <b>demands</b> of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.|$|E
40|$|A {{case-control study}} has been {{conducted}} examining the relationship between preterm birth and occupational physical activity among U. S. Army enlisted gravidas from 1981 to 1984. The study includes 604 cases (37 or less weeks gestation) and 6, 070 controls (greater than 37 weeks gestation) treated at U. S. Army medical treatment facilities worldwide. Occupational physical activity was measured using existing <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> ratings of military occupational specialties. ^ A statistically significant trend of preterm birth with increasing <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> level was found (p = 0. 0056). The relative risk point estimates for the two highest <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> categories were statistically significant, RR 2 ̆ 7 s = 1. 69 (p = 0. 02) and 1. 75 (p = 0. 01), respectively. Six of eleven additional variables were also statistically significant predictors of preterm birth: age (less than 20), race (non-white), marital status (single, never married), paygrade (E 1 - E 3), length of military service (less than 2 years), and aptitude score (less than 100). ^ Multivariate analyses using the logistic model resulted in three statistically significant risk factors for preterm birth: occupational physical demand; lower paygrade; and non-white race. Controlling for race and paygrade, the two highest <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> categories were again statistically significant with relative risk point estimates of 1. 56 and 1. 70, respectively.

40|$|Although {{the role}} of gold {{in the world economy}} has {{declined}} since the gold standard was abandoned, it remains important as a central bank reserve, a hedge against risks, a barometer of geopolitical uncertainty, and an input for jewellery. While portfolio demand for gold has been well studied, determinants of <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> are less understood. Certain emerging-market countries such as China and India import substantial amounts of gold, with several factors that may contribute: low financial development, need for precautionary savings and/or strong cultural valuation of gold itself. This article uses panel data on gold imports of 21 countries to examine determinants of <b>physical</b> <b>demand.</b> We find that determinants of <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> differ from those of portfolio demand, and that they differ between the developed and developing worlds.

5|$|Hutton captained the England Test team between 1952 and 1955, {{although}} his leadership was at times controversial. He pursued a cautious approach and faced criticism for negativity. Never {{comfortable in the}} role, Hutton felt that the former amateur players who administered and governed English cricket did not trust him. In 23 Tests as captain, he won eight Tests and lost four with the others drawn. Worn out by the mental and <b>physical</b> <b>demands</b> of his role, Hutton retired from regular first-class cricket during the 1955 season. Knighted for his contributions to cricket in 1956, {{he went on to}} be a Test selector, a journalist and broadcaster. He also worked as a representative for an engineering firm until retiring from the job in 1984. Hutton remained involved in cricket, and became president of Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1990. He died a few months afterwards in September 1990, aged 74.|$|E

Apart from the rest days in Montreal taken {{at the request of}} the Cancer Society, he refused to take a day off, even on his 22nd birthday. He frequently suffered shin splints and an inflamed knee. He developed cysts on his stump and experienced dizzy spells. At one point, he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away. Although he feared he had developed a stress fracture, he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention, and was then relieved to learn it was tendonitis and could be treated with painkillers. Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups, and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health.|$|E

However, measurements used are often established from a global score, notably with several questionnaires that originally reflect several dimensions. The present study tested the effect of driving situation complexity, experience and subjective levels of tension and alertness on each dimension of the NASA-TLX questionnaire of workload, in order to highlight the potential influence of intrinsic, extraneous and germane load factors. The results showed that, in complex situation, mental, temporal and <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> (load dimensions) increased, and that novice drivers presented high <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> when subjective tension was low and low own performance. Moreover, increase of mental and <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> increased effort.

5|$|Farmer {{left school}} to tour {{with a group}} led by Johnny Otis, but this job lasted for only four months, as Farmer's lip gave out. Performing for long periods {{seven days a week}} for this job put great {{pressure}} on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such <b>physical</b> <b>demands.</b> His lip eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play. He then received technique training in New York, where he worked for a time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948. An audition for Dizzy Gillespie's big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of Jay McShann's band. Club and studio work was hard to get in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians. Farmer played and toured with Benny Carter, Roy Porter and Gerald Wilson, then played with Wardell Gray in 1951–52. The hazards of the touring jazz musician's lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and El Paso, to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, the car that Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter with broken ribs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between psychosocial and other working conditions and body-mass index (BMI) in a working population. This study contributes to the approximately dozen investigations of job stress, which have demonstrated mixed positive and negative results in relation to obesity, overweight and BMI. Methods A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted among working Australians in the state of Victoria. Participants were contacted by telephone from a random sample of phone book listings. Information on body mass index was self-reported as were psychosocial work conditions assessed using the demand/control and effort/reward imbalance models. Other working conditions measured included working hours, shift work, and <b>physical</b> <b>demand.</b> Separate linear regression analyses were undertaken for males and females, with adjustment for potential confounders. Results A total of 1101 interviews (526 men and 575 women) were completed. Multivariate models (adjusted for socio-demographics) demonstrated no associations between job strain, as measured using the demand/control model, or ERI using the effort/reward imbalance model (after further adjustment for over commitment) and BMI among men and women. Multivariate models demonstrated a negative association between low reward and BMI among women. Among men, multivariate models demonstrated positive associations between high effort, high psychological demand, long working hours and BMI and a negative association between high <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> and BMI. After controlling for the effort/reward imbalance or the demand/control model, the association between <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> and working longer hours and BMI remained. Conclusion Among men and women the were differing patterns of both exposures to psychosocial working conditions and associations with BMI. Among men, working long hours was positively associated with higher BMI and this association was partly independent of job stress. Among men <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> was negatively associated with BMI and this association was independent of job stress. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if functional capacity (FC) and <b>physical</b> work <b>demands</b> can be matched {{and to determine}} the validity of normative values for FC related to <b>physical</b> work <b>demands</b> as a screening instrument for work ability. Methods: Forty healthy working subjects were included in this study. Subjects were categorized into four <b>physical</b> work <b>demand</b> categories (sedentary, light, moderate and heavy). FC was tested with a standardized Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) following the WorkWell Protocol and <b>physical</b> work <b>demands</b> were determined with an onsite Work Load Assessment (WLA) according to the Task Recording and Analyses on Computer (TRAC) method. <b>Physical</b> work <b>demands</b> were compared to FC and normative values derived from previous research. Results: 88 % of the subjects scored higher on FCE than observed during WLA. The tenth percentile of normative values appeared valid in 98 % for sedentary/light work for the subjects tested in this study. For moderate or heavy work, the thirtieth percentile of normative values appeared valid in 78 % of all cases. Conclusion: Functional capacity and <b>physical</b> work <b>demands</b> can be matched in most instances, but exceptions {{should be kept in}} mind with regards to professions classified as moderate or heavy physical work, especially concerning lifting high. Normative values may be considered as an additional screening tool for balancing workload and capacity.

Isokinetic and isometric lifting strength at low, waist and shoulder assessment levels were measured using the LIDO Workset II based on a sample of 93 normal Chinese adults (63 men and 30 women) between the ages of 21 - 51. The 50 th percentile score for adult Chinese female's lifting strength was 17. 71 % lower than the American female while the adult Chinese male's lifting strength was 14. 94 % lower than the American male. Lifting forces were higher in the 20 - 40 year age group. The isometric work mode had considerable impact on the lifting capacities, with shoulder level having the highest lifting capacities. The gender and body weight had a significant positive correlation to lifting capacity while job <b>physical</b> <b>demand</b> had a moderate correlation.
