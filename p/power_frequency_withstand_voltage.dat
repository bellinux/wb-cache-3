For effective analysis, the FEM is conducted in transient quasistatic electric field, using a finite element FORTRAN code. The structure parameters of disconnectors that provide the required electric field strength are obtained by the Response Surface Method (RSM) and the optimal values are presented by the variation in maximal electric field strength. The RSM and optimal design methods are also conducted by FORTRAN codes. The optimal result reveals that a uniform electric field distribution is achieved in 550 kV disconnectors.

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen the rapid and {{successful}} deployment of ester oils as transformer dielectrics. When evaluating the compatibility of ester oils with existing transformer insulation designs, {{it is essential to}} not only compare the mean breakdown voltages of the oils, but also to consider the role of dispersion and thus the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> levels (with the acceptable breakdown likelihood). Insulation designers sometimes estimate the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> of mineral oil from the dispersion of the data, assuming that the breakdown voltages of the oil follow a parametric distribution. However, {{there is a lack of}} discussion as to whether this method would be suitable for estimating the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltages</b> of ester oils. This paper uses samples of breakdown voltages of a synthetic ester, a natural ester and a mineral oil to analyze their distributions, and discusses the applicability of using Weibull and Gaussian distributions to estimate the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltages</b> of the esters.

40|$|Today's {{design and}} {{manufacturing}} of high voltage equipment focuses increasingly on a {{shift away from}} SF 6 as a quenching and isolation medium. SF 6 is has a detrimental effect on the atmosphere's greenhouse potential. Bans or regulations regarding SF 6 may well be imposed on the industry in the future. In order to replace SF 6 with air as insulation, {{more research is needed}} to achieve compact and efficient designs. The goal of this master thesis has been to investigate the effect of barriers on the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> in rod-plane gaps, with atmospheric air, subjected to positive high voltage impulses. The high voltage electrode was a rod with a spherical tip and a diameter of 7 mm. The barriers used as insulation were made out of Lexan polycarbonate plates and measured 1 mm times 600 mm times 600 mm. The 50 %breakdown voltage, the standard deviation and the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> have been determined using the up- and down-method. The barriers were tested in several configurations, changing both the horizontal and vertical placement of the barrier in the rod-plane gap. In addition to physical experiments, these configurations have been investigated in terms of electric background eld calculations in COMSOL,as well as streamer inception voltage calculations in MATLAB. The results show an increase in the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> of up to 28 % for the configuration with the largest barrier protrusion. The optimal barrier position has been found to be close to the high voltage rod. However, a relative decrease in the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> is observed when the rod is touching the barrier. This can be explained by a strong tangential eld allowing the streamer to propagate along the surface of the barrier. For a small barrier, protruding 0 mm from the tip of the rod, the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> is lower than that of a barrier-less rod plane gap when the barrier touches the rod. A sharp increase of above 10 % in the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> is shown in a barrier with a 0 mm overlap, by simply moving the barrier 10 mm closer to the high voltage rod. This can to some degree be explained by applying electric potential to the barriers in the background eld distributions. It has been shown that the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> can be predicted to some extent with a very simple formula for the congurations with the largest barrier protrusions. A method of predicting <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> based on streamer inception calculation in several steps, with electric eld distribution calculations has been suggested...|$|R
40|$|The vacuum {{switching}} technology is preferred {{used in the}} medium voltage level due to its high reliability, {{the high number of}} switching operations, its free-maintenance as well as its long term durability. Contrary to gas-insulated switches, the contact surface of a vacuum circuit breaker has a substantial influence on the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage.</b> Charge carriers, escaped from the contacts due to an electrical field stress, will be accelerated in the contact gap, whereas the absorbed energy could not be reduced significantly, because of the marginal number of collisions. Caused by the impact on the contact surface, additional charge carriers may be generated with a subsequent breakdown. The required <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> of a vacuum circuit breaker is reached by a conditioning of the metallic surfaces inside the vacuum circuit breaker. A mechanical handling alone is not sufficient. All established procedures for conditioning vacuum circuit breakers to reach a required <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> use current limited breakdowns to remove emission centers which are the origin of a breakdown. In this work, a conditioning process for industrial type vacuum circuit breakers is investigated, using high-frequency currents in the kHz-range. Due to high current rises before and high voltage rises after a current interruption during a current zero crossing, a reignition of a vacuum insulation can be enforced. On the one hand the high-frequency conditioning process has been evaluated if the required lightning impulse <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> can be reached reliably, on the other hand it has been investigated, how far the lightning impulse <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> can be increased beyond it. It is investigated, to what extend the voltage and current distribution, measured during a high frequency conditioning process, can be used to specify the reached lightning impulse <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage.</b> The conditioning process is successful only, if every critical emission centre is removed. Therefore the spatial distribution of the arcs is an important information for the evaluation of the conditioning process. Here, a circuit breaker model is used for optical investigations of the conditioning arcs.

40|$|Today, {{manufacturers}} of medium voltage equipment {{are searching for}} alternatives to sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_ 6 $) as the insulating gas. The advantageous thermal and molecular properties make it suitable as an insulating gas, however, it is a strong green house gas. With the present climate challenges, one of the measures of reducing emission of climate gases is to phase out the use of SF$_ 6 $-insulated medium voltage switchgears. An environmentally friendly alternative is air, which has a lower <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> than SF$_ 6 $. For backwards compatibility, the primary manufacturers in this development is optimization (to compensate for lower withstand) of current designs without increasing the dimensions. This work have investigated the breakdown voltage and optical detected partial discharges activity during AC stress in ambient air. The measurements {{have been carried out}} for two cylindrically symmetric test objects, containing triple junctions.
