Ambitious about Autism, with its partners, nasen and the Association of Colleges, was commissioned by the Department for Education (DfE) to run the Succeeding at College project from April 2015 until March 2016. The Succeeding at College project aimed to support more young people with autism to move from school into further education and improve their prospects of positive life outcomes in adulthood. The Succeeding at College project built on the earlier Department for Education sponsored Finished at School Programme which ran from April 2013 until March 2015 and involved four college–led partnerships ('hubs') supporting around 110 young people with autism to make a successful transition to <b>post-school</b> <b>education.</b> The Succeeding at College project involved the development and delivery of new face-to-face training hosted by colleges in all regions across England.

40|$|M. Ed. The {{choice of}} a career, an {{institution}} to study at and an appropriate course programme {{are some of the}} important decisions that have to be made by learners who leave school. The more informed, rational and independent the decisions are made, the better the chances to make choices that might provide personal and career satisfaction on the long term (Beekman, Cilliers, and De Jager, 2011, p. 235). Career decisions need thorough self-knowledge in terms of personality, interests, values, aptitude and ability as well as knowledge of the world of work and occupations (Stead and Watson, 2006, p. 35). Career guidance in South Africa {{is an integral part of}} career education throughout the education bands, meaning that it is integrated in Life Orientation as one of the learning areas and school subjects. Career guidance also forms part of services rendered by <b>post-school</b> <b>education</b> and training <b>institutions,</b> such as Further Education and Training (FET) colleges and Higher <b>Education</b> and Training <b>institutions</b> (universities and universities of technology). This study is an investigation of career guidance and placement at an FET College. The purpose of this study was to investigate the career counselling and placement of students at a selected FET College in order to make recommendations regarding the development of guidelines for career counselling and student placement. The aim was to conduct a situational analysis at one specific college where there is currently only a few guidelines to help prospective students with career and study choices. The results of the analysis informed the researcher to make recommendations to the FET college regarding the development of guidelines for career counselling for careers and study choice. A qualitative approach was followed. Henning describes qualitative research as a form or strategy that allows for a different view of the theme that is studied and in which the respondents have a more open ended way of giving their views and demonstrating their actions (Henning, van Rensburg, and Smit, 2004, p. 5). The qualitative approach provided a perspective of the situation in its unique context, taking all aspects of the context into consideration whilst attempting to make meaning of the phenomenon. The understanding was an end in itself, which did not attempt to predict what may happen in future settings, but to gain a greater understand of the nature of this setting (Merriman, 1998, p. 6) ...|$|R
