5000|$|Clean-outs are {{fittings}} with removable elements, allowing {{access to}} drains without {{the removal of}} plumbing fixtures. They are used to allow an auger (or plumber's snake) to clean out a <b>plugged</b> <b>drain.</b> Since clean-out augers are limited in length, clean-outs should be placed in accessible locations at regular intervals throughout a drainage system (including outside the building). Minimum requirements are typically {{at the end of}} each branch in piping, just ahead of each water closet, at the base of each vertical stack and inside and outside the building in the main drain or sewer. Clean-outs usually have screw-on caps or screw-in plugs. They are also known as [...] "rodding eyes", because of the eye-shaped cover plates often used on external versions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The need {{to improve}} on {{parboiling}} techniques by rural farmers in Nigeria {{has led to the}} development of a parboiling device at the Department of Agricultural and Environmental Engineering, University of Agriculture, Makurdi. Design and construction of a paddy rice parboiler was carried out using an empty 200 litres metal drum. It has a soaking chamber of 0. 1378 m 3 with perforated floor of 570 m 3 and a steaming chamber of 0. 0919 m 3. The steaming chamber is directly below the soaking chamber and it is provided with two <b>drain</b> <b>plugs</b> to <b>drain</b> water off from the paddy mass and the steaming chamber...|$|R

As his toys watch, he breaks out of his crib and manages to discover his wings, which had been taken away from him at birth, from a cupboard. The baby grabs the matches and lights one, only for one of his wings to catch fire, plunging him into a sink full of water. His toys then spring into action in an attempt to rescue him, some destroying themselves in {{the process of trying to}} get to him. The baby manages to pull the <b>plug,</b> <b>draining</b> the water and inadvertently sending some of his toys down the drain.

40|$|For {{reasons of}} {{national}} policy, environmental need, and funding availability, wetlands have {{become one of}} the most active areas for ecological restoration. But, as this timely and useful book points out, such projects too often have consisted of <b>plugging</b> the <b>drain</b> tile or ditch and letting nature do the rest. This approach has resulted in failure more often than recognized. Failure is obvious when a restored 2 ̆ 2 wetland 2 ̆ 2 remains dry because the regional water table has dropped, more subtle when natural plant communities fail to regenerate spontaneously, or nearly invisible when predation exceeds waterfowl production. Lack of planning and basic understanding of the ecosystem has often resulted in restoring wetlands in the wrong places or establishing the wrong kind of wetlands in otherwise suitable sites. Later, lack of objective evaluation standards lets the assumption of success go unchallenged...|$|R
50|$|Nearly all front-loader washers for the {{consumer}} market must also use a folded flexible bellows assembly around the door opening, to keep clothing contained inside the basket during the tumbling wash cycle. If this bellows assembly were not used, small articles of clothing such as socks could slip out of the wash basket near the door, and fall down the narrow slot between the outer tub and basket, <b>plugging</b> the <b>drain</b> and possibly jamming rotation of the inner basket. Retrieving lost items from between the outer tub and inner basket can require complete disassembly of {{the front of the}} washer and pulling out the entire inner wash basket. Commercial and industrial front-loaders used by businesses (described below) usually do not use the bellows, and instead require all small objects to be placed in a mesh bag to prevent loss near the basket opening.|$|R

50|$|In {{preparation}} for freezing temperatures, an in-ground swimming pool's pipes must be emptied. An above-ground pool {{should also be}} closed, so that ice does not drag down the pool wall, collapsing its structure. The plumbing is sealed with air, typically with rubber plugs, to prevent cracking from freezing water. The pool is typically covered to prevent leaves and other debris from falling in. The cover {{is attached to the}} pool typically using a stretch cord, similar to a bungee cord and hooks fitted into the pool surround. The skimmer is closed off or a floating device is placed into it to prevent it from completely freezing and cracking. Floating objects such as life rings or basketballs can be placed in the pool to avoid its freezing under the cover. Sand or DE filters must be backwashed, with the main <b>drain</b> <b>plug</b> removed and all water <b>drained</b> out. <b>Drain</b> <b>plugs</b> on the pool filter are removed after the filter has been cleaned. The pool pump motor is taken under cover. Winter chemicals are added to keep the pool clean. The innovation of a composite construction of fibreglass, with an epoxy coating and porcelain ceramic tiles has led to the Pre-form, Composite-type with significant advantages over older methods; however, it also has increased sensitivity to metal staining.|$|R

In 1974, Matthews {{was invited to}} perform at The Jesus Festival, a Woodstock type event in which attenders camped out and listened to Christian music and Bible {{teaching}} for three days. When Matthews' band took the stage, the promoters and many in the crowd were shocked at their rock and roll presentation; {{up to this point}} most contemporary Christian music was more influenced by folk than rock. Matthews' band was unplugged by the promoters and chased off the stage by the concert-goers. Matthews referenced this experience on his fourth album, 1975's Eyes to the Sky, with a song called Pennsylvania song: [...] "you pulled the <b>plug</b> and <b>drained</b> my soul, but I know I left a ring around the tub of tradition, I saw some dance and sing" [...] and again in his ninth solo album, titled Plugged In.|$|R

50|$|Magnetic filters use a {{permanent}} magnet or an electromagnet to capture ferromagnetic particles. An advantage of magnetic filtration is that maintaining the filter simply requires cleaning the particles {{from the surface}} of the magnet.

40|$|The {{economic}} feasibility of alternative wetland restoration activities to store water and reduce flood damage was evaluated in the Maple River Watershed, North Dakota, a sub-watershed of the Red River of the North Watershed. The evaluation {{was based on}} recent hydrologic modeling and wetland restoration studies, the National Wetland Inventory, local land rental values, and site-specific historical flood damage. With benefit-cost ratios ranging from 0. 08 to 0. 13, neither simple wetland restoration based on <b>plugging</b> existing <b>drains,</b> nor restoration with outlet control devices, nor complete restoration intended to provide {{a full range of}} wetland-based environmental services were economically feasible over a 20 -year future period. Peak flood stages and flood damage would need to be reduced by between 4 and 12 percent in order for wetland restoration options to break even.

40|$|Excerpt} A {{knowledge}} worker {{is someone who}} is employed because {{of his or her}} knowledge of a subject matter, rather than ability to perform manual labor. They perform best when empowered {{to make the most of}} their deepest skills. Assumptions about people working in organizations are less and less tenable. One misleading notion is that they are subordinate employees retained around the clock; another is that they rely on their organization for livelihood and career. One hundred years ago, in the United States and Europe, the largest single group of workers labored in agriculture. Sixty years later, it consisted of technical, professional, and managerial people. Today, it is made up of {{knowledge worker}}s who may practice at an organization but might not be its employees. And, if they are in full-time employment, fewer and fewer are subordinates. What of it? Observers make out that working habits are shifting from lifetime employment in a single organization to portfolio work. Knowledge workers produce and distribute ideas and information rather than goods or services. They are individuals with different aspirations from the hierarchy-conscious personnel of the past; they are also mobile and they do leave. Hiring talented people is difficult. Keeping them is more difficult still. So, to <b>plug</b> the <b>drain</b> of human capital in a competitive knowledge economy, knowledge workers should be treated as an asset rather than as a cost.
