5|$|The clutch is {{a single}} egg, usually pure white, {{sometimes}} with some reddish brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost early enough, on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38–50days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three {{days at a time}} on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are altricial and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50days, the chicks are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. The chicks fledge about 56–86days after hatching, and receive no <b>parental</b> <b>support</b> after leaving the nest hole.|$|E

Unfortunately, nutritious dietary consumption and physical activity frequency tend to decline during the adolescent years and reaches its lowest level as the adolescent nears adulthood. In this study of 132 freshman and sophomore college students, the influence of <b>parental</b> autonomy <b>support</b> on overall adolescents self-determination was examined to determine whether self-determination influences adolescents&# 39; motivation to engage in healthy diet and exercise behaviors. Utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses, <b>parental</b> autonomy <b>support</b> was not predictive of older adolescents&# 39; motivation for diet and exercise; however, study results did indicate that <b>parental</b> autonomy <b>support</b> remains highly influential in adolescent self-determination (F[2, 130] = 22. 21; P = 0. 001) during early college years and that in this sample, adolescent self-determination is predictive of motivation for diet (t = 2. 21; P < 0. 05), but not exercise. Findings suggest that <b>parental</b> autonomy <b>support</b> continues to influence adolescent internalization of attitudes and behaviors during latter adolescence, but may play a lessor role in motivation for specific health-related behaviors as the adolescent nears adulthood. A better understanding of health motivation antecedents of adolescents may facilitate nurses develop new approaches to health-promotion strategies.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundBeginning in the {{elementary}} school years, there are differences among children on how they perceive their competence in physical activity (PA). Children's competence perceptions may influence their affective reactions to PA. A crucial question is how to motivate children who hold low competence perceptions to enhance their enjoyment and PA involvement. Because parents play critical roles in children's development and socialization, social support from parents can be an important factor to complement teachers' effort to enhance children's enjoyment and PA involvement. In this research we identified the associations among children's beliefs about <b>parental</b> social <b>support,</b> perceived competence and enjoyment in school PA. MethodsThree hundred and twenty children (9 – 11 years old) participated in a two-wave study. At the first wave, children completed questionnaires measuring their beliefs about <b>parental</b> social <b>support,</b> perceived competence and enjoyment in school PA; they reported their enjoyment again 8 months later at the second wave. ResultsBoth concurrent and longitudinal analyses revealed that beliefs about <b>parental</b> social <b>support</b> were important factors associated with children's enjoyment in school PA, especially among girls with low competence perceptions. ConclusionFamily socialization factors should be taken into consideration. The efficacy of individual and community-level strategies should be included and evaluated when designing effective intervention strategies that enhance children's PA in school. In this research we identified the associations among children's beliefs about <b>parental</b> social <b>support,</b> perceived competence and enjoyment in school PA...|$|R
50|$|Expressive suppression, as {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, serves different purposes such as supporting goal pursuits and satisfying hedonic needs (Larsen 2012). Though expressive suppression {{is considered a}} weak influence {{on the experience of}} emotion, it has other functions. Expressive suppression is a goal-oriented strategy which is guided by people’s beliefs and potentially by abstract theories about emotion regulation (Larsen 2012). In a study by Larsen et al. (2012), the researchers looked at the positive association between expressive suppression and depressive symptoms among adults and adolescents which are influenced by <b>parental</b> <b>support</b> and peer victimization. They found a reciprocal relationship between <b>parental</b> <b>support</b> and depressive symptoms. The same was not true for the relationship between peer victimization and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms followed decreased perception of <b>parental</b> <b>support</b> one year later. They found that initial suppression occurred after increases in depressive symptoms one year later, yet depression did not occur after suppression.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that adolescent health requires both reducing problem behavior and promoting {{the development of}} social competence. There is {{strong support for the}} influence of parenting practices on both aggressive and competent behavior. However, there has been little research to date focused on parental messages, or the verbal communication parents provide to their children, about aggressive and effective nonviolent responses to conflict. The present study used hierarchical regression to examine <b>parental</b> messages <b>supporting</b> fighting and <b>parental</b> messages <b>supporting</b> effective nonviolent responses to problem situations in relation to adolescent aggressive and effective nonviolent behavior. These relations were expected to be moderated by adolescent gender. Additionally, the unique influence of parental messages was explored, relative to the effects of parental behavioral modeling of antisocial and prosocial acts. Messages supporting fighting and messages supporting nonviolent responses were analyzed as distinct constructs in the current study, and were expected to produce different patterns of influence on each adolescent behavior. Discrepancies based on respondent (parent or adolescent) were also anticipated. Participants included a predominantly African American sample of 105 adolescents and a parent or caregiver, who were assessed {{as part of a larger}} project evaluating the effects of a neighborhood intervention. As hypothesized, youth reports of <b>parental</b> messages <b>supporting</b> nonviolent responses were significantly related to lower levels of youth aggression, even when controlling for parental modeling. Youth reports of <b>parental</b> messages <b>supporting</b> nonviolent responses also predicted higher levels of effective nonviolent behavior, but these effects could be better accounted for by parental modeling. Contrary to expectation, <b>parental</b> messages <b>supporting</b> fighting did not significantly predict adolescent aggression or effective nonviolent behavior, and only minimal support was found for the moderating influence of gender. As anticipated, youths’ perceptions of parental messages were better predictors of their behavior than were parents’ reports. Overall, the current study’s findings have important implications for violence prevention efforts, and call for continued research...|$|R
