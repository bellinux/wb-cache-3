5000|$|In principle, {{there is}} no fixed recipe for this dish - any {{preparation}} of hot sauerkraut with meat and potatoes could qualify - but in practice there are certain traditions, favourite recipes, and stereotypical garnishes that are more easily called choucroute garnie than others.

Fatty, inexpensive or salted cuts of pork also often form a part of choucroute garnie, including ham hocks, <b>pork</b> <b>knuckles</b> and shoulders, back bacon and slices of salt pork. Other recipes call for pieces of fish or goose meat, but this is far less typical.|$|R
40|$|Modified {{atmosphere}} packaging (MAP) {{is being}} utilized extensively in European countries as a preservation technique for meat products. In the United States, large supermarkets are reducing or eliminating in-store meat departments and {{replacing them with}} prepackaged case-ready products shipped from a centralized processing facility. Fresh ground pork shoulder (SBLDR) and ground <b>pork</b> <b>knuckles</b> with sirloin fat trim (GS) were packaged in either 80 : 20 O 2 :CO 2 (80 / 20) or 100 % CO 2 (CO 2) and held for 2 days (2 DAY) or 8 days (8 DAY) in unlighted storage (2 °C) prior to lighted display for 8 days to determine differences in retail shelf-life due to these parameters. ^ A high level of carbon dioxide (CO 2) was more effective in inhibiting microbial growth than a gas mixture of 80 : 20 O 2 :CO 2. During extended storage, (8 DAY) in 100 % CO 2 inhibition of growth of aerobic microorganisms resulted in a 2 log reduction in aerobic plate counts (APC). During lighted storage, aerobic plate counts of ground GS and SHLDR packaged in CO 2 were at least 1 log lower than when packaged in 80 / 20. ^ Increased storage time prior to retail display resulted in higher APC and psychrotropic plate counts. A half-log difference in bacterial counts (log 10 c. f u. /gram) resulted in a 6 day difference in product shelf-life as measured by aerobic bacterial plate counts for ground <b>pork.</b> Ground <b>pork</b> <b>knuckles</b> with sirloin trim in 80 / 20 had higher surface oxymyoglobin than ground pork shoulder, but ground pork shoulder displayed a more red color (higher a* values). After 8 days of lighted display, metmyoglobin reducing ability was still present and capable of keeping surface metmyoglobin levels below 40 %, the point where customers reject red meat due to discoloration. ^ The findings reported in this dissertation {{support the use of}} <b>pork</b> <b>knuckles</b> with sirloin trim in MAP to produce a ground pork product of the highest quality. In situations were shipping times are lengthy and/or distances from the distribution center to retail display are long, an atmosphere of 100 % CO 2 is recommended to give product the longest possible shelf-life. ^ Oxidation of lipids is another important characteristic determining the shelf-life and quality of food products. Assays exist which measure malonaldehyde, a secondary product of lipid oxidation. Each assay has advantages and drawbacks which are unique to the specific assay. Disadvantages common to aqueous extraction and distillation techniques include creation of large quantities of spent chemicals, number of samples which can be analyzed in a single day, and the time necessary to evaluate the samples which have been processed. ^ Rapid distillation and extraction methods to quantify malonaldehyde were developed. These methods used microliter quantities of material, increased the quantity of samples evaluated and reduced the time necessary to process a large number of samples when compared to the original methods. ...|$|R
2500|$|The main meal {{might be}} eaten about 2p.m. or later. It {{is larger than}} the North American lunch. It might be {{composed}} of three courses especially among the traditionalists, starting with a soup like a popular rosół and tomato soup or more festive barszcz (beet borscht) or żurek (sour rye meal mash), followed perhaps in a restaurant by an appetizer such as herring (prepared in either cream, oil, or in aspic); or other cured meats and vegetable salads. The main course usually includes a serving of meat, such as roast or kotlet schabowy (breaded pork cutlet), or chicken. Vegetables, currently replaced by leafy green salads, were not very long ago most commonly served as surówka [...] – shredded root vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, celeriac, seared beetroot) or sauerkraut (...) [...] The side dishes are usually boiled potatoes, rice or more traditionally kasza (cereals). Meals often conclude with a dessert such as makowiec, a poppy seed pastry, or drożdżówka , a type of yeast cake. Other Polish specialities include chłodnik [...] (a chilled beet or fruit soup for hot days), golonka (<b>pork</b> <b>knuckles</b> cooked with vegetables), kołduny (meat dumplings), zrazy (stuffed slices of beef), salceson and flaki (tripe).|$|R
5000|$|Postpartum {{confinement}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Sitting the month": 坐月子 [...] "Zuo Yue Zi" [...] in Mandarin or 坐月 [...] "Co5 Jyut2" [...] in Cantonese) is a pseudoscientific Chinese custom practised by many women of East Asian descent for recovery following birth, typically for 1 month, with regional variations at different lengths from 40 days, 2 months to 100 days. Similar practices are popular among Japanese women called 産後の肥立ち and Korean women called 삼칠일 [...] "Samchilil" [...] {{for at least}} 21 days. The custom {{is referred to as}} 'confinement' as women are advised to stay indoors for recovery from the trauma of birth and feed the newborn baby. Aspects of traditional Chinese medicine are included, with a special focus on eating foods considered to be nourishing for the body and help with the production of breastmilk. In Guangdong and neighboring regions, new mothers are barred from visitors until the baby is 12 days old, marked by a celebration called 'Twelve mornings' (known as 十二朝). From this day onwards, Cantonese families with a new baby usually share their joy through giving away food gifts such as <b>pork</b> <b>knuckles</b> with ginger and vinegar, while some families mark the occasion by paying tribute to their ancestors. In ancient China, women of certain ethnic groups in the South would resume work right after birth, and allow the men to practice postpartum confinement instead.|$|R
