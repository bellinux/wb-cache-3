5000|$|Avalanche {{transceivers}} or avalanche beacons are a {{class of}} active radio beacon transceivers operating at 457 kHz and specialized {{for the purpose of}} finding people or equipment buried under snow. When the owner sets out on a skiing descent, the transceiver is activated, causing the device to emit a low-power <b>pulsed</b> <b>beacon</b> signal during the trip. [...] Following an avalanche, and if the holder of the transceiver is safe and has not themselves been caught by the avalanche, they may switch the transceiver from transmit into receive mode, allowing use as a radio direction finding device to search for signals coming from other skiers' transmitter beacons who may be trapped. A 457 kHz beacon is an active device that requires batteries. A ski suit may also contain a passive RECCO transponder sewn into the clothing.|$|E
30|$|Thus {{we use a}} <b>pulsed</b> <b>beacon</b> laser on the OGS {{and fast}} photo diodes in the CubeSat to {{implement}} a phase-locked loop {{and make sure that}} the CubeSat clock oscillates at the same frequency as the OGS’s. A beacon laser pulsed at a repetition rate of f_SYN = 10 MHz coupled with a fast photo diode receiver (≈ 1  GHz bandwidth) on the satellite can be used to synchronize the two oscillators to within 10  ps. Additionally, turbulence in the atmosphere can account for up to 3  mm (i.e. ≈ 10  ps) of jitter in the beacon laser’s arrival time [77]. The effects of such phase jitter on the received signal can be mitigated to a large extent using a technique called jitter attenuation [78]. Doppler and relativistic shifts could also affect the oscillator synchronization. The latter is corrected for by precompensating the CubeSat oscillator frequency on the ground similar to Ref. [79]. The former can be addressed by adjusting the repetition frequency of the <b>pulsed</b> <b>beacon.</b> Nevertheless, let us conservatively consider a total clock synchronization jitter of 20  ps. Using our chosen coincidence window of 80  ps, the above results in a synchronization loss 1 /Λ _SYN< 0.5 dB. Alternatively, we could avoid this additional loss by increasing the coincidence window to accommodate the uncertainty in clock synchronization (i.e. the coincidence window would be 100  ps instead of the chosen 80  ps).|$|E
30|$|Synchronization can be {{achieved}} using various methods such as coarse synchronization to 10  ns using GPS [74], exploiting the intrinsic time correlation of entangled photon pairs [75], or using a <b>pulsed</b> <b>beacon</b> laser [2]. GPS alone is insufficiently precise. In order to exploit the time correlations of photon pairs, we must measure a cross-correlation peak in the arrival times between the OGS and CubeSat. The smallest measurement duration where we can unambiguously identify almost every coincidence peak (with the maximum acceptable total loss calculated above) is 100  ms. 15 In LEO, the velocity of the CubeSat is so large that the optical path length between the OGS and satellite can change {{by as much as}} ≈ 6  km/s. Naturally, this causes the coincidence peak to broaden significantly. Orbital predictions and measurements can be used to correct for this. However, their typical precision is about 10  cm [76]. This still adds a few hundred picoseconds to the coincidence window needed.|$|E

We describe an analysis methodology for optical SETI, which we have used to analyze nine hours of serendipitous archival observations of KIC 8462852 made with the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory between 2009 and 2015. No evidence of <b>pulsed</b> optical <b>beacons,</b> above a pulse intensity at the Earth of approximately 1 photon m^- 2, is found.

25|$|Tunguska {{underwent}} further improvement when, in 2003, the Russian {{armed forces}} accepted the Tunguska-M1 or 2K22M1 into service. The M1 introduced the new 9M311-M1 missile, which {{made a number}} of changes allowing the 2K22M1 to engage small targets like cruise missiles by replacing the eight-beam laser proximity fuze with a radio fuse. An additional modification afforded greater resistance to infrared countermeasures by replacing the missile tracking flare with a <b>pulsed</b> IR <b>beacon.</b> Other improvements included an increased missile range from 8 to 10km, improved optical tracking and accuracy, improved fire control co-ordination between components of a battery and the command post. Overall, the Tunguska-M1 has a combat efficiency 1.3–1.5 times greater than the Tunguska-M.|$|R
40|$|Concerning the {{historical}} background of <b>pulsed,</b> broadband, targeted-beam <b>beacons</b> for interstellar communication Dear Professor Cady, I am writing {{in regard to}} the two papers published in the June issue of Astrobiology authored by G. Benford, J. Benford, and D. Benford entitled "Searching for cost optimized interstellar beacons " and "Messaging with cost optimized interstellar beacons. "(1, 2) Both discuss the advantages of using <b>pulsed,</b> broadband, targeted <b>beacons</b> for extraterrestrial communication as opposed to the discrete frequency continuous-broadcast-type signals traditionally searched for in ongoing SETI programs. I found both papers interesting to read. However, I wanted to bring to the reader's attention that the concept of pulsed, broadband, directed-beam, ETI communication which their papers discuss is not new. I had first proposed this concept at the spring 2000 American Astronomical Society meeting. (3) A video of this oral presentation has been available as a DVD since 2001. (4) Also I had described this broadband, directed-beam concept in considerable detail in my book, The Talk of the Galaxy, published in 2000, which was reprinted in 2006 as an updated second edition with the title, Decoding th...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of the {{laboratory}} characterization of the ARGOS LGS wavefront sensor (LGSW) and dichroic units. ARGOS is the laser guide star adaptive optics system of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). It implements a Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO) correction for LUCI, an infrared imager and multi-object spectrograph (MOS), using 3 <b>pulsed</b> Rayleigh <b>beacons</b> focused at 12 km altitude. The LGSW is a Shack-Hartman sensor having 15 × 15 subaspertures over the telescope pupil. Each LGS is independently stabilized for on-sky jitter and gated to reduce spot elongation. The 3 LGS pupils are stabilized to compensate mechanical flexure and are arranged on a single detector. Two units of LGSW have been produced and tested at Arcetri Observatory. We report on the results obtained in the pre-shipment laboratory test: internal active flexure compensation loop performance, optomechanical stability under different gravity conditions, thermal cycling, Pockels cells performance. We also update on the upcoming installation and commissioning campaign at LBT...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{integration}} {{status of the}} ARGOS wavefront sensor {{and the results of}} the closed loop tests performed in laboratory. ARGOS is the laser guide star adaptive optics system of the Large Binocular Telescope. It is designed to implement a Ground Layer Adaptive Optics correction for LUCI, an infrared imaging camera and multi-object spectrograph, using 3 <b>pulsed</b> Rayleigh <b>beacons</b> focused at 12 km altitude. The WFS is configured as a Shack-Hartman sensor having a 15 x 15 subaspertures over the telescope pupil. In the WFS each LGS is independently stabilized for on-sky jitter and range-gated to reduce spot elongation. The 3 LGS are arranged on a single lenslet array and detector by the use of off-axis optics in the final part of the WFS. The units of WFS are in the integration and testing phase at Arcetri Observatory premises. We describe here the test aimed to demonstrate the functionality of the WFS in an adaptive optics closed loop performed using the internal light sources of the WFS and a MEMS deformable mirror...|$|R
40|$|The Harvard/Smithsonian/Planetary Society all-sky optical SETI {{observatory}} is a 1. 8 meter spherical f/ 2. 5 optical telescope, soon {{to survey}} the Northern sky (− 20 ◦ < δ < + 60 ◦) for <b>pulsed</b> optical <b>beacons.</b> Its meridian transit survey mode requires ∼ 150 clear nights to cover the Northern sky with ∼ 1 minute dwell time per source point. It images a 1. ◦ 6 × 0. ◦ 2 patch of the sky on two matched focal planes {{with a total of}} 1024 photomultiplier tube pixels. Each pair of pixels images the same 2. 3 square arcminute patch of sky, and fast electronics filters the incoming visual band light for nanosecond pulses. Coinci-dent optical flashes in a pair of pixels triggers one of 32 PulseNet full-custom chips to record the pulse profiles at nanosecond resolution. This experiment is an all-sky, kilopixel evolution of our targeted search.

40|$|We present {{plans for}} an all-sky search for <b>pulsed</b> optical SETI <b>beacons</b> at Agassiz station in Harvard, Massachusetts. We will use a 1. 8 meter f/ 2. 5 spherical “light bucket ” (2 - 3 arcmin resolution) focused onto a multi-pixel camera {{consisting}} of sixteen 64 -pixel photomultiplier tubes (with pixels measuring 1. 5 arcmin on a side) in two matched focal planes.

40|$|The {{integration}} {{status of}} the ARGOS wavefront sensors is presented. ARGOS is the laser guide star AO program for the LBT. It will implement a Ground Layer AO correction for the instruments LUCI, an infrared imaging and spectrograph camera, using 3 <b>pulsed</b> low-altitudes Rayleigh <b>beacons</b> for each LBT's eye. It profits of the LBT's adaptive secondary mirrors and of FLAO's pyramid unit for NGS sensing. Each LGS is independently stabilized for on-sky jitter and range-gated using custom Pockels cells and then sensed by a 15 x 15 SH sensor. The 3 pupil images are reimaged on a single lenslet array and a single detector. In the WFS are also installed 3 patrol cameras for the acquisition of the laser beacons, a system for the stabilization of the pupil images on the lenslet array and an internal source for calibration purposes. The two units are now completing the integration phase in Arcetri premises. We describe the characterization of the units and the closed-loop test realized using a deformable MEMS mirror...|$|R
40|$|The Optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence is now 40 years old. However, it {{was only}} during the closing years of the 20 th Century, after a 25 -year hiatus, that the optical search has regained respectability in the SETI {{community}} at large. The quarter-of-a-century delay in American Optical SETI research was due to a historical accident {{and not for the}} lack of any enabling technology. This review paper describes aspects of past, present and future Optical SETI programs. Emphasis is placed on detecting fast, <b>pulsed</b> attention-getting laser <b>beacon</b> signals rather than monochromatic, continuous wave beacons. Some examples of commercial detection equipment that may be employed for either type of OSETI are given. It is expected that in time, some of the great telescopes of the world will be employed in this optical search for ETI signals. This may take the form of either dedicated observations or a type of Optical SERENDIP program, as had been done with Microwave SETI. There will also be large observatories built dedicated only to the optical search. Just as the microwave SETI@Home project has proved very popular with the public, {{the time has come for}} its optical equivalent. This paper also speculates on the eventual need to move Optical SETI observatories into space with high altitude balloons and space-based telescopes. It is expected that by the end of the first decade of the Third Millennium, the electromagnetic search for extraterrestrial intelligence on planet Earth will be dominated by SETI of the optical kind...|$|R
40|$|URL] audienceCivil Aviation {{standardisation}} bodies (ICAO, RTCA, EUROCAE) are currently investigating {{the use of}} Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as a stand-alone navigation solution for civil aircraft. For obvious safety reasons, on-board GNSS receivers must guarantee minimum requirements in given phases of flights. These requirements, dependent upon the system and signals used, are stated in the Minimum Operational Performance Specification (MOPS), published (or being published) by the corresponding authorities. With that respect, the future use of Galileo E 5 and GPS L 5 bands has raised, among others, interference issues. Indeed, pre-existent RF systems emit in this band, though interfering with the E 5 /L 5 signals. The main threat was identified as being DME/TACAN ground <b>beacons</b> <b>pulsed</b> emissions [RTCA, 2004]. Without any mitigation capability, these systems can disturb the proper functioning of on-board GNSS receivers, preventing them from complying with safety requirements. Two Interference Mitigation Techniques (IMT) have been proposed to fight this threat, the Temporal Blanker (TB) and the Frequency Domain Adaptive Filtering (FDAF). The TB technique [Grabowsky, 2002] offers a fairly simple implementation and was shown [Bastide, 2004] to provide enough benefits {{to ensure that the}} specified requirements were met in all phases of flights for a GPS L 5 or Galileo E 5 receiver. However, it was also demonstrated that the resulting performances were meeting the requirements by only a small margin on the worst locations. In contrast, the FDAF is a more demanding mitigation technique against pulsed interference in terms of required resources but [Raimondi, 2006] showed that it could bring a stronger margin with respect to the civil aviation requirements. Simulations [Raimondi, 2006] showed that the use of FDAF allowed an decrease of the postcorrelation C/N 0 over the worst DME/TACAN interference environment that can be found in Europe, so called the European "hot spot". However, simulations obtained through running an accurate model of a GNSS receiver are often extremely time-consuming, and, in this condition, it is a cumbersome work to draw a world map checking the good functioning of FDAF in all locations. It is then interesting to find a simplified theoretical way to derive the post-correlation C/N 0 degradation suffered by the signal {{as a function of the}} interference environment, using an FDAF technique. The aim of this article is to describe a new simulation tool aiming at calculating this degradation in all location in a very short time. Results are first confirmed and then compared to temporal blanker's one...|$|R
