5|$|Initially most Luftwaffe fighter wings {{consisted}} of three groups (Gruppe), which were the equivalent of USAAF groups or RAF Wings. Groups were identified using Roman numerals, followed by the unit number; e.g. I./JG 1. In 1942 JG 1 was the first unit to be expanded to incorporate a fourth group. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> JG 1's expansion, other Luftwaffe fighter wings incorporated a fourth group from mid-1943.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 tour of England {{would be}} Collins's last. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a wet English summer, {{the first four}} Tests of the five-Test series ended in draws. Collins had a disappointing tour, {{suffering}} from neuritis and in constant pain from arthritis. He missed the Third and Fourth Tests when admitted to hospital but recovered to resume his place as captain for the Fifth Test.|$|E
5|$|The League also {{succeeded in}} {{reducing}} the death rate of workers constructing the Tanganyika railway from 55 to 4 percent. Records were kept to control slavery, prostitution, and the trafficking of women and children. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> pressure brought by the League of Nations, Afghanistan abolished slavery in 1923, Iraq in 1924, Nepal in 1926, Transjordan and Persia in 1929, Bahrain in 1937, and Ethiopia in 1942.|$|E
50|$|Violent crime, {{including}} {{violence against}} women and children, and organised criminal activity are at high levels and are <b>a</b> grave concern. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> vigilante action and mob justice sometimes occur.|$|R
5000|$|Public {{funding of}} {{minority}} languages continues to produce mixed reactions, {{and there is}} sometimes resistance to their teaching in schools. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> proficiency in languages other than [...] "Standard" [...] English can vary widely.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{movement}} [...] "limits quite severely {{the values}} of many domains," [...] for example featuring [...] "only two durational values (quarter and half notes)," [...] and, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> [...] "features great uniformity in texture and gesture".|$|R
5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} {{to an extreme}} length of time is accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during the verses, by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic.|$|E
5|$|Urse's estates grew under William II, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the {{inheritance}} {{of some of}} the lands of his brother, Robert Despenser, who died about 1097. Later, Urse consolidated his holdings by exchanging some of Robert's lands in Lincolnshire with Robert de Lacy for lands closer to his base in Worcestershire. Urse d'Abetot gained and passed to his heirs an estate that later became the Barony of Salwarpe, Worcestershire.|$|E
5|$|Having already {{gained some}} {{coaching}} experience in China, Gascoigne signed for Boston United on 30 July 2004. After {{being at the}} club for 11 games he left (<b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the club refusing to let him participate in the reality television show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!) on 5 October, to begin a football coaching course. After leaving Boston, he stated that {{he was interested in}} taking over as manager of Scottish side Greenock Morton, but this came to nothing.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{most states}} {{repealed}} breach of promise laws or limited them, beginning in 1935. [...] <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> expensive diamond engagement rings, previously uncommon, began to become commonplace, {{and formed a}} sort of financial security for the woman.|$|R
25|$|When Tynan {{was called}} up for National Service, {{he put on}} an act of {{appearing}} outrageously camp including wearing a floppy hat, velvet coat, painted fingernails {{and a great deal}} of Yardley scent. Perhaps <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> he was rejected as 'medically unfit' for service.|$|R
5000|$|When {{he was in}} Congress from 1957 through 1961, Porter {{quickly became}} known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong liberal. He backed admitting China to the United Nations, opening trade with China and halting nuclear testing. [...] <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> he was {{defeated}} for reelection in 1960 Republican Edwin R. Durno.|$|R
5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> this humiliation, Hansell {{declined}} {{an appointment}} to the United States Military Academy to attend the Georgia School of Technology, {{where he was a}} member of Sigma Nu. Despite problems understanding differential equations, and twice attempting to transfer to another school (which his father would not permit), he overcame his difficulties with complex mathematics and graduated in 1924 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering. While at Georgia Tech he participated in varsity football as a walk-on substitute, and boxing. Hansell was awarded Georgia Tech's highest individual recognition, membership in the ANAK Society.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ships were}} {{designed}} {{around the time}} of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there. To a certain extent, the carrier operations in Vietnam demonstrated the need for increased capabilities of aircraft carriers over their survivability, as they were used to send sorties into the war and were therefore less subject to attack. As a result of this experience, Nimitz carriers were designed with larger stores of aviation fuel and larger magazines in relation to previous carriers, although this was <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> increased space available by the new design of the ships' propulsion systems.|$|E
25|$|When {{oil prices}} {{increased}} from 2002 onwards, the regulator failed to approve electricity tariff increases, {{because they were}} expected to have been very unpopular. The financial burden of the higher generation costs was thus passed on to the privatized distribution company, which has, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> been suffering severe losses.|$|R
50|$|Grassby's actions {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} anti-immigration groups, {{led by the}} Immigration Control Association, which targeted his electorate in a campaign at the May 1974 election. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> Grassby was defeated by the National Party candidate, John Sullivan, by just 792 votes. Grassby and his supporters accused these groups of mounting a racist smear campaign against him.|$|R
25|$|In the 1960s, {{prices for}} these {{traditional}} exports declined, and in 1973 New Zealand lost its preferential trading {{position with the}} United Kingdom when the latter joined the European Economic Community. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> from 1970 to 1990, the relative New Zealand GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power declined from about 115% of the OECD average to 80%.|$|R
5|$|The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy {{recommendations}} before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, and in the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all capitalist governments had done so. Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, {{and partly because of}} criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists. He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the business cycle favourably with fiscal policy.|$|E
5|$|Violence erupted {{again in}} early May 1995. The RSK lost {{support from the}} Serbian {{government}} in Belgrade, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> international pressure. At the same time, the Croatian Operation Flash reclaimed all of the previously occupied territory in Western Slavonia. In retaliation, Serb forces attacked Zagreb with rockets, killing 7 and wounding over 200 civilians. The Yugoslav army responded to the offensive with a show of force, moving tanks towards the Croatian border, in an apparent effort to stave off a possible attack on the occupied area in Eastern Slavonia.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{has had a}} {{significant}} African American population since the city's foundation. African American residents composed about 30% of the District's total population between 1800 and 1940. The black population reached a peak of 70% by 1970, but has since steadily declined due to many African Americans moving to the surrounding suburbs. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> gentrification, there was a 31.4% increase in the non-Hispanic white population and an 11.5% decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010.|$|E
50|$|The Victoria Bridge <b>partly</b> {{collapsed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of {{the continuous}} boring by toledo worms in 1924.|$|R
5000|$|Official {{recognition}} of women's internationals was not immediate. Almost all women's rugby was originally organised {{outside of the}} control of either national unions or World Rugby (WR). <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> no internationally agreed list of rugby internationals exists. However, even in the men's game, WR does not decide which matches are [...] "full internationals" [...] (or [...] "test matches"), leaving such decisions up to participating unions.|$|R
50|$|When he was 16, Gardner and {{his mother}} had met the Arabian {{explorer}} Sir Wilfred Thesiger (whom his mother had previously known) on a bus. Invited to the explorer's home in Chelsea, the initially reluctant Gardner fell in love with Arabia. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> - and <b>partly</b> reasoning that knowing the Arabic language would make him recruitable in 22 countries many of which had oil - he determined to study the Arabic language.|$|R
5|$|After the Civil War, Oxford Castle served {{primarily}} {{as the local}} prison. As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging. The prison also had a gallows to execute prisoners, such as Mary Blandy in 1752. For most of the 18th century, the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including {{the extent to which}} vermin infested the prison. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> this criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison.|$|E
5|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Marshall's {{attacks on}} {{prominent}} Democratic-Republicans such as Governor Shelby, the Federalists gained {{influence in the}} state legislature. The Federalist cause was also bolstered by the quashing of the Whiskey Rebellion by federal forces in 1794, and the federal victory over the Northwest Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794. Later that year, the Federalists in the General Assembly nominated Marshall for the United States Senate. On the first ballot, Marshall garnered 18 votes, compared with 16 for Democratic-Republican John Breckinridge, 8 for John Fowler, and 7 for incumbent John Edwards. On the runoff ballot that followed, Marshall defeated Breckinridge {{by a vote of}} 2822.|$|E
5|$|St Columba was {{probably}} a disciple of Finnian. He left Ireland after being exiled, and founded the monastery at Iona off {{the west coast of}} Scotland in 563, probably on land granted from a Christian king. From there missions were carried out to western Argyll and the islands around Mull. Later the influence of Iona would extend to the Hebrides. Iona emerged as the most important religious centre in the north of Britain, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the work of Adomnan, who was abbot there from 679 to 704. Although it is unclear whether the historic Columba did conduct missions outside of a small part of Dál Riata, Adoman's Life of St. Columba elevated him to become the apostle of North Britain in general.|$|E
50|$|The SFR of Yugoslavia {{was one of}} {{only two}} European {{countries}} that were liberated by its own forces during World War II, with limited assistance and participation by the Allies. It received support from the Western democracies and the Soviet Union, {{and at the end of}} the war no foreign troops were stationed on its soil. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> the country found itself halfway between the two camps at the onset of the Cold War.|$|R
5000|$|ACORN had a {{reputation}} of being more forceful than faith-based (FBCO) groups, and {{there are indications that}} their local groups were more staff (organizer) directed than leader (local volunteer) directed. (However, {{the same can be said}} for many forms of organizing, including FBCOs.) The [...] "door-knocking" [...] approach is more time-intensive than the [...] "organization of organizations" [...] approach of FBCOs and requires more organizers who, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> can be lower paid with more turnover.|$|R
50|$|Smith was hospitalised in 1999 with stomach ulcers, {{after an}} {{accidental}} overdose {{of more than}} 50 Nurofen Plus tablets a day, after previously admitting an addiction to sleeping pills. Smith {{said at the time}} that the pressures of film work were a contributing factor, along with a desperate need to ease the pain caused by gout. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> he agreed to sell Talkback Productions. On 31 December 2008, Smith appeared on Celebrity Mastermind whilst suffering from severe pharyngitis.|$|R
5|$|The first {{significant}} insight into Sorabji's life {{comes from his}} correspondence with Peter Warlock, which began in 1913. At least <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Warlock's influence, Sorabji {{began to focus on}} composition and music criticism. In those letters he showed great interest in interacting with the world of musicians—an attitude that changed dramatically in later years. The {{first significant}} instance of such interaction took place in November 1919. Sorabji had sent several of his scores, including that of his First Piano Sonata, to Ernest Newman, who paid them no attention. Sorabji then played the piece to Ferruccio Busoni, who expressed some reservations about the work, but gave him a letter of recommendation, which helped Sorabji get it published.|$|E
5|$|Thus it {{was that}} the Allied fleet {{remained}} off the coast of Salamis into September, despite the imminent arrival of the Persians. Even after Athens fell to the advancing Persian army, the Allied fleet still remained off the coast of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the navies finally engaged in the cramped Straits of Salamis. There, the large Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to manoeuvre and became disorganised. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet attacked, and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships, and thus ensuring the Peloponnesus would not be outflanked.|$|E
5|$|Timmons' career {{declined}} {{quickly in}} the 1960s, {{in part because of}} drug abuse and alcoholism and <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> frustration at being typecast as a composer and player of seemingly simple pieces of music. In 1968 he made his second, final, recording for Milestone, Do You Know the Way? In the following year he played in a quartet led by Sonny Red, with Dexter Gordon on one of the saxophonist's temporary returns to the US from Europe, and in a trio backing vocalist Etta Jones. Timmons continued to play in the early 1970s, mostly in small groups or in combination with other pianists, and mainly in the New York area.|$|E
50|$|The Sharks' round two {{loss to the}} Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles was {{marred by}} the sickening injury {{suffered}} by Keith Galloway <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of <b>a</b> high elbow shot from Manly winger John Hopoate. Galloway missed {{a huge part of}} the 2005 season <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> from the injury and due to limited opportunities at Cronulla he signed with the Wests Tigers for the 2006 season onwards. For his part, Hopoate was sacked by the Sea Eagles after receiving a mammoth 17-week ban by the NRL Judiciary.|$|R
50|$|A Chilean {{military}} mission {{led by the}} Carabineros de Chile helped reorganize the National Guard in the same year. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> it later expanded its responsibilities in the 1950s to include pentinentiary protection and security, maritime security, forestry protection and highway patrol duties as well as security in the tourism sector and even in dog handling. Its present formation of 12 regional commands dates from 1950 when the 1st Regional Command was raised. In the late 1970s the Guard established its own air arm.|$|R
5000|$|Wang is the {{co-founder of}} Chez JJ with Jocelyn Berl. Chez JJ is a [...] "chain of three hacker homes", two in San Francisco {{and one in}} Mountain View in Silicon Valley. Chez JJ has been {{investigated}} for not complying with zoning codes, and was fined {{by the city of}} San Francisco after complaints from neighbors, whose disputes with Chez JJ were widely reported in the press. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> Chez JJ shut down in 2015, after providing housing for over 400 residents.|$|R
