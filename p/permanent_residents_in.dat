The Canadian public as-well as the major political parties support the current level of immigration. In 2014, a total of 260,400 immigrants were admitted to Canada. The Canadian government anticipated between 280,000 and 305,000 new <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> the following years. a similar number of immigrants as in recent years. New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Canada also accepts large numbers of refugees, accounting for over 10 percent of annual global refugee resettlements.|$|E

25|$|The Elon Peace Plan is a {{solution}} for the Arab-Israeli conflict proposed in 2002 by former minister Binyamin Elon. The plan advocates the formal annexation of West Bank and Gaza by Israel and that Palestinians will be become either Jordanian citizens or <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> Israel {{so long as they}} remained peaceful and law-abiding residents. All these actions should be done in agreement with Jordan and the Palestinian population. This solution is tied to the demographics of Jordan where it's claimed that Jordan is essentially already the Palestinian state, as it has so many Palestinian refugees and their descendants.|$|E

Tamerlan, his brother, was unable to naturalize expeditiously due to an investigation against him, which held up the citizenship process.

25|$|Another {{challenge}} is to make tuberculosis services accessible to the entire population. Although China has a policy of free tuberculosis services, in most places these are available only to <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> a particular community. Urban migrants, who have relocated from poor rural areas to seek a better livelihood, {{are not eligible for}} such free services. These vulnerable, predominantly young migrants—now numbering more than 150 million—tend to live and work in crowded environments and are unlikely to seek medical care when they become ill. Such individuals contribute to the spread of tuberculosis, HIV infection, and other infectious diseases within urban centers. The growing epidemic of co-infection with tuberculosis and HIV if left unchecked will substantially increase the number of tuberculosis cases and deaths.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1996, section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) {{prevented}} {{the federal government}} from recognizing the marriages of same-sex couples on the same basis as the marriages of different-sex couples.

U.S. citizens and <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> same-sex marriages could not petition for their spouses, nor could they be accompanied by their spouses into the U.S. {{on the basis of}} a family or employment-based visa.

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Chesapeake Bay settlements, colonial {{officials}} found it difficult to attract and retain laborers under the harsh frontier conditions, and there was a high mortality rate. Most laborers came from Britain as indentured servants, having signed contracts of indenture to pay with work for their passage, their upkeep and training, usually on a farm. The colonies had agricultural economies. These indentured servants were young people who intended to become <b>permanent</b> <b>residents.</b> <b>In</b> some cases, convicted criminals were transported to the colonies as indentured servants, rather than being imprisoned. The indentured servants were not slaves, but were required to work for four to seven years in Virginia to pay the cost of their passage and maintenance. Many Germans, Scots-Irish, and Irish came to the colonies in the 18th century, settling in the backcountry of Pennsylvania and further south.|$|E
25|$|Acre was {{captured}} by Israel on 17 May 1948, displacing about three-quarters of the Arab population of the city (13,510 of 17,395). Throughout the 1950s, many Jewish neighbourhoods were established at the northern and eastern parts of the city, as it became a development town, designated to absorb numerous Jewish immigrants, largely Jews from Morocco. The old city of Akko remained largely Arab Muslim (including several Bedouin families), with an Arab Christian neighbourhood in close proximity. The city also attracted Bahá'í worshippers, some of whom became <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> the city, where the Bahá'í Mansion of Bahjí is located. Acre has {{also served as a}} base for important events in Baha'i history, including being the birthplace of Shoghi Effendi, and the short-lived schism between Baha'is initiated by the attacks by Mírzá Muhammad `Alí against `Abdu'l-Bahá. Baha'is have since commemorated various events that have occurred in the city, including the imprisonment of Bahá'u'lláh.|$|E
