40|$|In 1991 a tower {{controller}} at Los Angeles International airport {{cleared a}} commuter aircraft to position {{and hold on}} runway 24 L while she worked to clear other aircraft to cross {{the other end of}} the runway. There were several communications delays because one of the other aircraft was on the wrong radio frequency. Visibility was poor at twilight because of haze and glare. The controller’s workload was considered moderate by air traffic controllers, though laypeople might consider it quite busy. The controller forgot to clear the commuter aircraft to take off and cleared another aircraft to land on 24 L, which it did, destroying both aircraft and killing 34 people. Similar errors by pilots have also led to major accidents. In 1994 an airliner ran off the runway at LaGuardia airport after the crew rejected the takeoff at high-speed because they observed anomalous indications on their airspeed indicators. The NTSB determined that the anomalous indications occurred because the crew failed to turn on the <b>pitot</b> <b>heat,</b> a normal procedural step, that keeps the pitot input to the airspeed indicators from freezing in cold, wet weather. Two previous major airline accidents occurred in the 1980 ’s when the crews forgot to extend wing flaps and slats to takeoff position, a normal procedural step required before takeoff. More recently, in 1996, an airliner landed gear-up in Houston when the landing gear failed to extend because the crew forgot to set the hydraulic pumps to the high position, which was part of the normal procedure for preparing their type of aircraft for landing. Obviously multiple factors were at play in each of these accidents, but a central aspect of each accident was the failure of the cre...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, novel methods devoted to develop high heat {{transfer}} efficiency devices have been presented. These methods rely on both novel manufacturing techniques, {{belonging to the}} class of additive manufacturing (AM), and thermal and fluid-dynamics studies and optimization procedures. As a first result, optimization of a traditional heat exchanger from a real application, i. e. million of units produced per year, is presented; That is manufactured by extrusion. A thermal fluid-dynamic model is experimentally validated (from an industrial experimental test rig) and used for optimization purposes. Results demonstrate {{there is room for}} efficiency optimization even in well established heat transfer devices configurations based on traditional manufacturing techniques. Then, an experimental rig for ''in house'' thermal characterization is designed. It guarantees high precision measurement of small convective heat fluxes (forced air) on enhanced solutions investigated hereinafter, namely micro-structured surfaces and small heat transfer devices. To deal with that challenge, an innovative convective heat flux sensor is developed. That exploits the concept of thermal guard to avoid any spurious perturbation between the flow field and investigated surfaces, while it allows to cancel out terms due to spreading conduction phenomenon. Results demonstrate remarkable accuracy in direct measurement of convective heat fluxes through this novel concept. Relying on the proposed experimental rig, various methods for enhanced convective heat transfer are experimentally investigated. Firstly, regular patterns of micro-protrusions are studied. Effect of fluid-dynamics and geometrical length on heat transfer performances are discussed. More important, they have been applied to develop an optimization procedure tailored to deal with AM techniques. Results from both experimental investigation and optimization procedure suggest the existence of an optimal value of protrusion height, that maximize performance-to-cost ratio for patterns made by AM. Then, surface roughness of components built by DMLS has been investigated as an augmentation heat transfer technique. Surface roughness is controlled varying DMLS process parameters and its effect on convective heat transfer is measured. The results demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in convective heat transfer due to DMLS artificial roughness, in the investigated configurations. That preliminary study unveils the potential of AM artificial roughness as an heat transfer enhancement techniques. It has been considered, by academic and industrial institutions, as an important step towards development of next generation gas turbine components and electronic cooling devices. Finally, extreme flexibility in shape of parts built by DMLS is exploited to design and fabricate in one step an unconventional heat transfer device, called <b>Pitot</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. Enhanced heat transfer efficiency is achieved, with regard to standard heat exchangers. Nevertheless, the most important achievement has been to highlight unusual morphologies allowed by AM can pave the way to revolutionary changes in conceiving and designing heat transfer component...|$|E
50|$|The Bü 181 evolved {{very little}} during the war, the {{differences}} between the B type and the C types were minimal, the most important being the increased autonomy of the C types. The main difference between the B-1 & C-1 and the B-2 and C-2 sub-types was the presence of <b>pitot</b> <b>heating</b> and position & cabin lights while the B-2 and C-2 types lacked any electrical system.|$|R
25|$|All three {{crew members}} on board died when the {{aircraft}} struck the ground following a stall and rapid descent {{caused by the}} crew's reaction to erroneous airspeed readings caused by atmospheric icing. The icing occurred due to failure {{to turn on the}} <b>pitot</b> tube <b>heating</b> {{at the start of the}} flight. This was one of two Boeing 727s to crash in the United States that day; the other was TWA Flight 514 in northern Virginia, northwest of Dulles airport.|$|R
50|$|Icing is {{a problem}} for pitot tubes when the air {{temperature}} is below freezing and visible moisture is present in the atmosphere, as when flying through cloud or precipitation. Electrically <b>heated</b> <b>pitot</b> tubes are used to prevent ice forming over the tube.|$|R
50|$|The plot {{revolves}} around the logistics of preparing Flight 1980 for a timely departure. The aircraft serving has been reported with malfunctioning <b>heated</b> <b>pitot</b> tubes, but the captain decides to postpone the repair to avoid delays, relying on redundant instruments available. Bird patrol has been dispatched to fend off pigeons. Immediately after takeoff, an instrument alarm prompts the captain in command to switch to the backup pitot tube as their primary indication. The captain mistakenly transmits the cabin announcement to the air traffic channel.|$|R
500|$|A blocked {{pitot tube}} is a pitot-static problem {{that will only}} affect {{airspeed}} indicators. [...] A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element.

40|$|Flow {{uniformity}} {{in a high}} enthalpy {{facility is}} investigated. The scramjet research facility is composed of a rectangular combustor duct connected to a 100 MW electric arc air heater. The Mach 3. 3 flow is accelerated through a two-dimensional contoured nozzle. Instream measurements were made with water-cooled Pitot probes and stagnation point heat flux gages at stream enthalpy levels ranging from 4 to 7 Mj/kg. Flow surveys were made on the flow centerline and off centerline {{in order to measure}} the three dimensional uniformity of the flow in the rectangular duct. Measurements indicated that although the flow in the aspect ratio 6 : 1 duct was relatively uniform on the centerline, three dimensional viscous effects were apparent near the corners. Flow through the nozzle and constant area duct was modeled computationally using a two dimensional, Navier-Stokes, reacting gas code. The computations predict that the flow in the test section is in vibrational equilibrium. The computed and measured <b>Pitot</b> pressure and <b>heat</b> flux profiles are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
5000|$|BuNo 164584, 292 flights - {{crashed on}} January 19, 1995, north of Edwards AFB, California. The crash {{was caused by}} ice inside the pitot tube, sending {{incorrect}} airspeed data to the flight control computers. Contributing factors included the replacement of a <b>heated</b> <b>pitot</b> tube with an unheated Kiel probe, and ground crew/pilot ignorance of an option to override computer control. The pilot ejected safely. NASA issued in 2005 a film, [...] "X-31: Breaking the Chain," [...] reviewing the events. The novelty of the X-31 trials was computer control of its revolutionary flight controls (the canard wing and engine baffles) to effect manoeuvres impossible for conventional jet fighters. The film discusses at length the combination of independent errors (e.g. that the accompanying chase pilot could not hear the test pilots radio conversation with his base) in prompting loss of control, when the test pilot (correctly) ejected to save his life. Film of the crash shows the aircraft in unusual attitudes as the computer applied its false data to attempt to control flight after the pilot ejected.|$|R

40|$|Rocket plume flowfields have an {{importance}} {{due to their}} influence on the signature of the rocket and also {{on the distribution of}} the plume gases around the vehicle. Little information on the co-flowing situation exists other than a previous study at Oxford. This thesis thus represents a significant database for co-flowing rocket plumes of this form. The work presented deals with two new aspects of co- flowing rocket plumes in that detailed flowfield measurements have been made and plumes from twin nozzle have been investigated {{for the first time in}} this thesis. This study on twinjet rocket plumes was carried out using the University of Oxford Gun Tunnel. Twinjet rockets with nozzle exit Mach numbers of 3 and 5 were tested in quiescent and in co-flow at Mach 7 using nitrogen and hydrogen injections. A major feature of the twinjet case was the so-called impingement shock between the flows from the two nozzles. It was discovered that this shock was insensitive to the freestream and scaling parameters are suggested for its geometry. Comparisons with single equivalent thrust nozzles are made at downstream locations and similar Pitot pressure profiles were observed for nitrogen injection in a nitrogen freestream after approximately 3 nozzle diameters downstream. Shear layers were studied and fluctuations in this region were measured by fast-response <b>Pitot</b> pressure and <b>heat</b> transfer probes sampled at 1. 1 MHz. The extent of the shear layer was deduced using a new Oxford Total Temperature Probe. With the freestream stagnation temperature at approximately 650 K and injected gas at 350 K, a linear variation for the deduced total temperature across the shear layer was obtained. This was consistent with the Pitot pressure variations across this region. Convective heat transfer coefficient fluctuations and flow total temperature fluctuations across rocket flowiields were obtained using three thin-film heat transfer probes and found to be closely correlated. Experimental results for the twinjet and the single jet were compared with CFD simulations and good overall agreements were achieved. Instrumentation for the hypersonic experiments was investigated and a fast-response (~ 20 kHz) Pitot probe suited for flows heavily contaminated with particulate was developed and tested...|$|R
40|$|Ablative thermal {{protection}} materials {{are a key}} technology for current and future space exploration missions. However, the mission feasibility {{is determined by the}} materials available, and the development of new materials is performed, essentially, by an iterative trial-and-error process. This is due to the absence of validated predictive models for ablative material behaviour. Models are tuned to bulk material properties from tests. In order to describe physical processes of the ablation correctly, the European FP 7 project ABLAMOD with the partner organizations DLR, Airbus Defence&Space, Avio, Amoroim, Fluid Gravity Engineering, AIT, OGI, CIRA, VKI and University of Strathclyde has been formed. The main objective of the ABLAMOD project is to make a substantial step towards a predictive model of an ablative {{thermal protection}} system by incorporating aspects of high fidelity mesoscale ablator physics within a modular framework. In order to successfully develop such physics modules, the understanding of the fundamental processes occurring within the ablative materials must be improved. To this end, three major ablation materials, i. e. carbon based, silicon based and cork based ablators, need to be tested in well characterized long duration high enthalpy facilities using both standard instrumentation and advanced measurement techniques. These advanced spectroscopic techniques lead to a significant improvement in the detailed characterisation of the material behaviour at the mesoscale level. Both virgin and char versions of the materials have been thermally characterized and the internal structure has been scanned by means of Computer Tomography (CT). In parallel using the state-of-the-art knowledge of ablator physical processes, modules for the specific phenomena like internal gas flow, radiation, gas transport properties and gas-surface interaction have been developed. Computed <b>Pitot</b> pressure and <b>heat</b> flux profiles using simplified thermal non-equilibrium model show a good agreement with the experimental data in the arc heated facility L 3 K. The computer tomography data allowed studying the microstructure of all three ablator materials before and after charring. This data has been directly used for DSMC modelling. A high enthalpy flow field has been simulated using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code. This simulation used updated transport properties of the gas. The results of numerical rebuilding of the thermal response of the carbon based ablation material using the ablation code FABL in combination with the new modules developed within the ABLAMOD project showed an improved agreement with experimental data...|$|R
