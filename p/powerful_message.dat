25|$|In her works, Abramović affirms her {{identity}} through {{the perspective of}} others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a <b>powerful</b> <b>message.</b> Abramović's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows the spectators to do as they please with her body, pushing the limits of what one would consider acceptable. This type of representation also reflects key political issues such as BDSM, which complicates and questions the relation between art versus sexuality and public discourse.|$|E

[...] MTV News wrote that [...] "Daddy" [...] {{is different from the}} other relationship songs on Dangerously in Love, and added that it has a <b>powerful</b> <b>message.</b> By contrast, Allison Stewart of The Washington Post and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times both called [...] "Daddy" [...] a [...] "creepy bonus track".

500|$|At {{this point}} Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the {{guidance}} of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. In 1919–1920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: [...] "Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster [...] "Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the [...] "Reds" [...] (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the [...] "Whites" [...] (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a <b>powerful</b> <b>message</b> that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: [...] "The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world– it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people." ...|$|E

[...] Wired Kathy Ceceri also noted an artistic similarity to Persepolis; she not only liked how Anya's Ghost intertwined the teenage angst and fantasy elements of the novel, but praised how Anya's desire for a boyfriend doesn't overwhelm the story. [...] Cory Doctorow reviewed Anya's Ghost for Boing Boing, calling it [...] "really sweet, really funny and really scary, [...] a <b>powerful</b> <b>message</b> about identity, fitting in, and the secret selfish bastard lurking in all of us and whether having such a goblin inside makes us irredeemable or merely human." [...] Whitney Matheson with USA Today wrote that Anya's Ghost is a [...] "funny, creepy and a delightful page-turner" [...] and cited author Neil Gaiman who called the novel [...] "a masterpiece". [...] Steve Duin of The Oregonian praised the inventiveness of Brosgol's storytelling, and called her art [...] " [...] little uneven, but... at its best when the lights go out."

Vozick-Levinson called Eminem's rapping [...] "wild" [...] but was dismissive of the production, saying, [...] "The track behind 'Not Afraid' has the same tinny, repetitive, wannabe-epic quality that's annoyed me on Boi-1da productions like 'Forever.'" [...] Mayer Nissem of British site Digital Spy gave the song three stars out of a possible five, and wrote a mixed review; the reviewer first commented, [...] "Thank heavens! – Marshall Mathers III has opted against his usual trick of cobbling together a hook and some 'satire' via two-year-old back issues of the Inquirer to trail it." [...] However, Nissem criticized other aspects of the song, saying that Eminem's [...] "decision to chronicle...feels a little worthy and more than a touch dull." [...] He felt that Eminem's previous songs never bored the listener, unlike [...] "Not Afraid". Jeff Weiss of the Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Not Afraid" [...] was an improvement from the lead singles of Encore (2004) and Relapse, [...] "Just Lose It" [...] and [...] "We Made You", respectively, giving for a more serious and inspirational theme. However, Weiss misses the comic nature of Eminem's classic singles, such as [...] "My Name Is"; instead, he felt that the song was composed of [...] "vague self-help bromides and a bombastic but nondescript beat from...Boi-1da." [...] When discussing the chorus, Weiss commented that it [...] "doesn’t make for very engaging listening." [...] Finally, he discussed possible influences by American rapper T.I., but overall, he named it a disappointing lead single.|$|E
