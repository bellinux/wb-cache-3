40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{exploratory}} case study was: (1) to compare {{a model of}} expected formal business <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> with the content of actual business plans developed within a single company, (2) to develop a modified model of formal business <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> which recognizes organizational influences on <b>plan</b> <b>content,</b> (3) to propose a method for evaluating business plans based on this modified model. The firm studied was Fast Delta Corporation, a 2 ̆ 2 Fortune 5002 ̆ 2 multidivisional manufacturing company in a high technology industry. The business <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> analyzed {{in this study was}} produced through a planning system similar to those implemented by other multidivisional companies. In this study, planning by middle managers rather than top management was the primary focus. The study method was based on the analysis of formal <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> rather than direct observation or inquiry about the planning process. Study steps included: (1) test of goodness of fit between a simple model of expected business <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> and the actual <b>content</b> of business <b>plans</b> produced through the Fast Delta Corporation planning system. (2) analysis of deviations of the actual content from the expected content model. This analysis included comparison of actual formal <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> with non-content characteristics of the formal <b>plans,</b> with the <b>content</b> of business strategy case studies from other firms, and with the content of Fast Delta Corporation managers 2 ̆ 7 responses to case studies in business strategy. The results of this study showed that Fast Delta Corporation formal business <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> was influenced by several factors. These included short-term corporate-wide concerns; shared assumptions among managers about the strengths and limitations of the study firm; and constraints on strategy which may be characteristic of other firms with similar structure, at a similar life cycle stage, or within the same industry. From these results a modified model of business <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> was developed which considered these influences. The validity of this model suggests that the plan analysis techniques used in this study were effective techniques for identifying the planning assumptions which underlie business <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> produced through a firm 2 ̆ 7 s formal business planning system.

40|$|The present work {{presents}} {{a study on}} the application of business plans (BP) (a widely used document for investment decisions of new enterprises), with standard new product development processes (PDPs). The main objective was to find out whether it may be applied and, if so, at which moments it should be used in the PDP. The main source of information in this exploratory research was the existing literature concerning product and business development processes, business plans models and similar documentation, and project selection and evaluation methods. Then, these contents have been compared using the PDP stages as references. As a result, the study points out that a business plan is a document that models business, and it can gather enough information for investment decision analyses, It can also be elaborated concurrently with the PDP stages and used at the PDP decision gates. However, business dynamics has favored other forms of documentation for early decisions, such as synopses, presentations and even web-pages (for external resources).

Development plans have a long history as a key tool of spatial planning practice. Traditionally their role was seen as a directive statement, within a model of planning in which it was assumed planning authorities exercised firm control over what development could take place and how, informed by scientific knowledge and consensus goals. Such a model has been generally rejected in recent years. Planning authorities lacked the powers or inclination to command public and private agencies to build as instructed.

40|$|While deliberating {{and making}} decisions, {{participants}} in urban development processes need {{easy access to}} the pertinent content scattered among different plans. A Planning Markup Language (PML) has been proposed to represent the underlying structure of plans in an XML-compliant way. However, PML currently covers only textual information and lacks specifications about graphic information used in plans. To fill in this gap, this dissertation develops a PML extension, termed PMLGraphics, with the capacity of marking up graphic <b>content</b> of <b>plans</b> in a ???plan usable??? way. The development of the PMLGraphics can significantly impact how plans are made and used in planning practice. The PMLGraphics is built on theoretical research on ontology of graphic representations in plan documents and relationships between different entities of <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> (i. e. text, single graphic and graphic group). The ontology of graphic representations includes typical graphic types in plans, representation methods used by graphics, and classification of intended plan information conveyed by graphics. The proposed PMLGraphics has three components: document metadata that summarizes general information of plan documents, document structure that outlines hierarchical structure of topics in <b>plans,</b> and document <b>content</b> that defines sets of elements to mark up <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> in text, single graphic, and graphic group, as well as relationships between these three content entities. To test the feasibility of the PMLGraphics, three plans are encoded and a prototype for using the PMLGraphics is designed and implemented. Three hypothetical use cases, which simulate scenarios in practical planning processes, are created to test the PMLGraphics capabilities. The use cases demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the PMLGraphics in accessing graphic content scattered in different plans made by different agents. The significance of the PMLGraphics for planning participants is that, as use cases demonstrate, graphic <b>plan</b> <b>content</b> accessed through PMLGraphics would have been harder to find, if found at all, using hardcopy sources or using electronic files without graphic markup...|$|R
40|$|In Malaysia, the Regional and Town Planning Act 1976 {{emphasizes}} {{the need for a}} development plan system as a control mechanism for the usage of land. A development plan system involves a Local Plan whereby the function of the system is to plan, to control and to drive a development at the district level. Therefore, any party who wish to a start housing development must initially make reference to a local plan. In other words, a developer must refer to a local plan to ensure that a future and an upcoming housing development fulfill the requirement set out by the local plan. However, a question arises whether or not a local plan could possibly give sufficient information and thereafter, able to assist a developer to identify whether or not the particular land is ready and suitable for housing development.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted mainly to showing {{the place and}} role of plans of communes — {{introduced}} {{at the beginning of}} 1973 — in general system of national plans of socio-economic development. On the background of three basic functions of a commune plan, i. e. decisive-obligatory, coordinative-integrating and informative-organizational functions, its specific character has been presented. This character determines a mechanism of generation, functioning and realization of the plan. According to central regulations, a plan of a commune is elaborated on the ground of general principles (resolutions of the commune's people's council and tabular specifications) and it is characterized by rather schematic contents while adaptation of <b>plan</b> <b>contents</b> to socio-economic characteristics and to the most important commune problems is indispensable. There is also the necessity pointed out in the article of renouncing the until now practice in which the problem-contents formulation of a five-year commune plan is shaped according to the scope pattern and contents detailed structure of a one-year plan. The present influence of plans of central and voivodeship levels on commune plans should be then supplemented by a broader reverse influence of commune plans on plan regulations of higher levels, taking on simultaneously a more essential character, creating thus a real practice of planning.
