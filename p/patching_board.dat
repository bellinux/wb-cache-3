5000|$|Patching is {{the newest}} duty puzzle, and serves the same purpose as carpentry. The <b>patching</b> <b>board</b> {{consists}} of a field of square pieces representing a torn piece of sail cloth. In order to fix the damage, pirates must maneuver the tears so they connect the spool of thread piece with the tie-off piece. After this is done, the spool can be activated, which will stitch up the tears in the sail cloth. Another board begins once the spool has been activated.|$|E
50|$|A former {{agent of}} EMS in the United States, Ionic Industries in Morristown, New Jersey, {{released}} a portable-keyboard VCS 3 clone. The Ionic Performer, released in 1973, had circuitry {{based on that}} of the VCS 3's. It replaced the <b>patch</b> <b>board</b> matrix with over a hundred push-buttons, and added built-in keyboard and effects units.|$|R

50|$|The VCS3 {{has three}} {{oscillators}} (the first two oscillators are normal oscillators {{and the third}} an LFO or Low Frequency Oscillator), a noise generator, two input amplifiers, a ring modulator, 24 dB/octave voltage controlled low pass filter (VCF), a trapezoid envelope generator, joy-stick controller, voltage controlled spring reverb unit and 2 stereo output amplifiers. Unlike most modular synthesiser systems which use cables to link components together, the VCS 3 uses a distinctive <b>patch</b> <b>board</b> matrix into which pins are inserted in order to connect its components together.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{generalized}} formula is {{proposed for the}} selection of number of slots required for n-phase alternative current (AC) machine design and the criterion for selecting the starting points of each phases. The analytical model is verified using a four-pole machine with a 36 -slot stator. Each coil of the stator winding of this machine is brought out to a <b>patch</b> <b>board</b> that enables the stator to be configured for single-phase to 18 -phase excitation. Experimental results of a five-phase induction machine supplied from a static five-phase supply are provided to support the proposed design...|$|R

50|$|Upon joining Walsall Hospital Radio, new volunteers {{interested}} in presenting are initially placed with the station's Training Officer who teaches them {{the basics of}} operating the mixing desk. Items on the syllabus include how to properly cue tracks, {{how to use the}} computer playout system and how to configure the studio <b>patch</b> <b>board.</b> Once the new volunteers are confident in the studio they are then assigned to a presenter and sit in on his/her show for 3-4 weeks as an observer. The final stage of the training process involves making a demo tape of an off-air show which if reviewed by either the Training Officer or the Programme Manager. Providing that the demo tape is acceptable, the new volunteer is then able to take up a show of their own.|$|R
40|$|A {{multiplex}} {{optical transmission}} system which minimizes external interference while simultaneously receiving and transmitting video, digital data, and audio signals is described. Signals are received into subgroup mixers for blocking into respective frequency ranges. The outputs of these mixers are in turn fed to a master mixer which produces a composite electrical signal. An optical transmitter {{connected to the}} master mixer converts the composite signal into an optical signal and transmits it over a fiber optic cable to an optical receiver which receives the signal and converts it back to a composite electrical signal. A de-multiplexer is coupled to {{the output of the}} receiver for separating the composite signal back into composite video, digital data, and audio signals. A programmable optic <b>patch</b> <b>board</b> is interposed in the fiber optic cables for selectively connecting the optical signals to various receivers and transmitters...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION All {{aspects of}} human-computer interaction, from the {{high-level}} concerns of organizational context and system requirements to the conceptual, semantic, and syntactic levels of user interface design, are ultimately funneled through physical {{input and output}} actions and devices. This chapter considers the input half of this physical level of human-computer interaction, the final {{means by which the}} user communicates information to the computer. It is also called the Lexical level of the design of an interactive system, in contrast to the successively higher Syntactic, Semantic, and Conceptual levels [Foley, 1990 a]. Computer input once consisted of such actions as setting switches and knobs and plugging and unplugging jumper wires in <b>patch</b> <b>boards.</b> For many years after that, the primary form of computer input was the punched card. Users or, more often, specialist keypunch operators punched the input information as holes in paper cards, which could then be read by comput...|$|R
40|$|Development of a {{permanent}} data system for SMD tests was studied that would simulate all elements of the shuttle onboard, telemetry, and ground data systems that are involved with spacelab operations. The onboard data system (ODS) and the ground data system (GDS) were utilized. The air-to-ground link was simulated by a hardwired computer-to-computer interface. A <b>patch</b> <b>board</b> system was used on board to select experiment inputs, and the downlink configuration from the ODS was changed by a crew keyboard entry to support each experiment. The ODS provided a CRT display of experiment parameters to enable the crew to monitor experiment performance. An onboard analog system, with recording capability, was installed to handle high rate data {{and to provide a}} backup to the digital system. The GDS accomplished engineering unit conversion and limit sensing, and provided realtime parameter display on CRT's in the science monitoring area and the test control area...|$|R
60|$|Elsa {{shut her}} eyes. When she opened them again {{the woman was}} alone upon the little <b>patch</b> of red <b>boarding,</b> her body splayed out over it {{like that of a}} dead frog. So she lay a while till {{suddenly}} the cap of the Red Mill dipped slowly like a lady who makes a Court curtsey, and she vanished. It rose again and Meg was still there, moaning in her terror and water running from her dress. Then again it dipped, this time more deeply, and when the <b>patch</b> of rusty <b>boarding</b> slowly reappeared, it was empty. No, not quite, for clinging to it, yowling and spitting, was the half-wild black cat which Elsa had seen wandering about the mill. But of Black Meg there was no trace.|$|R
40|$|A user {{interface}} is {{that portion of}} an interactive computer system that communicates with the user. Design of the {{user interface}} includes any aspect {{of the system that}} is visible to the user. Once, all computer user were specialists in computing, and interfaces consisted of jumper wires in <b>patch</b> <b>boards,</b> punched cards prepared offline, and batch printouts. Today a wide range of nonspecialists use computers, and keyboards, mice, and graphical displays are the most com-mon interface hardware. The user interface is becoming a larger and larger portion of the software in a computer system—and a more important portion, as broader groups of people use computers. As computers become more powerful, the critical bottleneck in applying computer-based systems to solve problems is now more often in the user interface, rather than the computer hardware or software. Because the design of the user interface includes anything that is visible to the user, inter-face design extends deep into the design of the interactive system as a whole. A good user interface cannot be applied to a system after it is built but must be part of the design process from the beginning. Proper design of a user interface can make a substantial difference in training time, performance speed, error rates, user satisfaction, and the user’s retention o...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1976 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe {{primary role}} of the Space and Missile Test Center (SAMTEC) is to provide support for the {{relatively}} large number of various types of missiles launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB). Associated with this function is the requirement to provide telemetry decommutation/data processing systems capable of processing the telemetry transmitted by the missiles. At present, the telemetry data is routed {{to and from the}} analog tape recorders and bit synchronizers through <b>patch</b> <b>boards,</b> which totals over 200 inputs. This represents a myriad of patching combinations when considering the number of different missile formats and outputs that have to be manually patched and unpatched. SAMTEC contracted with Electrospace Systems, Inc., (ESI) for a dry reed relay switching system. The switching system, Analog Data Equipment Switching System (ADESS), consists of seven matrices under the control of a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Model PDP- 11 / 05 minicomputer. The ADESS matrices 1 and 2 are three stage switching systems with the respective input/output - 100 x 90 and 60 x 70. Matrices 3 through 7 range from a 40 x 40 down to a 10 x 20 rectangular matrix configuration. Matrix 1 has a frequency response range of DC- 12 MHz, matrices 2 through 6 have a range from DC- 3 MHz, and matrix 7 ranges from DC- 15 MHz. The PDP- 11 / 05 peripherals include a CRT/Keyboard and dual floppy disk which controls the latching and status of the matrix switches and stores the mission set up files which can be rapidly called up by the operator. The ADESS will decrease turn around by up to ten times as compared to present operations...|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of the area continued to grow, and, by 1940, Sawyer realized the new Negaunee airport could not handle its ever-increasing demands. Therefore, in 1941, the then-superintendent of the county highway department stepped out of his role and presented {{a plan for a}} new airport. The most significant landmarks on his proposed site were a hill of sand and a wealth of blueberry <b>patches.</b> The <b>board</b> agreed with the idea. Shortly thereafter, the United States was drawn into World War II. Local concern {{for the protection of the}} Great Lakes inter-lake navigation locks named Soo Locks at the trans-border area of Sault Ste. Marie prompted area citizens to propose that the U.S. Army Air Forces take over the new airfield. At that time, the proposal was shelved.|$|R
50|$|The rank of Inspekteur {{was divided}} into two levels: Landesinspekteur and Reichsinspekteur. The Landes level was {{concentrated}} on Nazi organization within specific German states, while the Reich level coordinated Nazi activities across the entire country. The position of Inspekteur was denoted on Nazi Party brown shirts by either one of two collar bars worn on a dark red collar <b>patch.</b> The shoulder <b>boards</b> were also paired up with a one or two knotted gold shoulder cord.|$|R

50|$|Around this time, {{the band}} {{addressed}} the constant {{demand for a}} Live Record. Mr. Blotto had been, from its inception, an improvisational band and had always allowed people to record the shows. A taper path was built that included an analog to digital converter, a distribution amplifier, and an open invitation for all to enjoy the high quality of a constant gain <b>board</b> <b>patch</b> in either digital or analog. As a result, clean Mr. Blotto boots began to cross the country, often {{in advance of the}} band—this is especially true outside of the Midwest, where they rarely tour.|$|R

60|$|It was dreadfully cold {{up there}} hanging to the sail-bar, for {{now that the}} rain had finished, it began to freeze. Indeed, had it not chanced that Elsa was dressed in her warm winter gown with fur upon it, and dry from her head to her feet, it is {{probable}} that she would have fallen off and perished in the water. As it was gradually her body became numb and her senses faded. She seemed to know that all this matter of her forced marriage, of the flood, and of the end of Simon and Meg, was nothing but a dream, a very evil nightmare from which she would awake presently to find herself snug and warm in her own bed in the Bree Straat. Of course it must be a nightmare, for look, there, on the bare <b>patch</b> of <b>boarding</b> beneath, the hideous struggle repeated itself. There lay Hague Simon gnawing at his wife's foot, only his fat, white face was gone, and in place of it he wore the head of a cat, for she, the watcher, could see its glowing eyes fixed upon her. And Meg--look how her lean limbs gripped him round the body. Listen to the thudding noise as the great knife fell between his shoulders. And now, see--she was growing tall, she had become a giantess, her face shot across the gulf of water and swam upwards through the shadows till it was within a foot of her. Oh! she must fall, but first she would scream for help--surely the dead themselves could hear that cry. Better not have uttered it, it might bring Ramiro back; better go to join the dead. What did the voice say, Meg's voice, but how changed? That she was not to be afraid? That the thudding was the sound of oars not of knife thrusts? This would be Ramiro's boat coming to seize her. Of him and Adrian she could bear no more; she would throw herself into the water and trust to God. One, two, three--then utter darkness.|$|R
