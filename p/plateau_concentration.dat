If present in sufficient amounts, focusing analyte ions can displace all electrolyte coions, reaching a <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration.</b> Multiple analytes with sufficiently different ionic mobilities will form multiple plateau zones. Indeed, [...] "plateau mode" [...] ITP separations are readily recognized by stairlike profiles, each plateau of the [...] "stair" [...] representing an electrolyte or analyte zone having (from LE to TE) increasing electric fields and decreasing conductivities. In [...] "peak mode" [...] ITP, analytes amounts are insufficient to reach plateau concentrations, such analytes will focus in sharp Gaussian-like peaks. In peak mode ITP, analyte peaks will strongly overlap, unless so-called spacer compounds are added with intermediate ionic mobilities between those of the analytes; such spacer compounds are able to segregate adjacent analyte zones.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the computation of ion-exchange when an ambient groundwater of one uniform composition is displaced by an injection solution of a constant but differing composition. The {{problem is to}} sort out the composition change from the initial to the injected compositions. An analytical method for the n-dimensional homovalent system is described by Rhee, Aris and Amundson (1970). Conditions are given under which this method can be used to calculate an approximate solution to the <b>plateau</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the n-dimensional heterovalent system. Further, two algorithms for the three-component heterovalent system are derived from Charbeneau (1988). Finally, a discretisation method is introduced in which the concept of adaptive mesh refinement is applied. Such a method can be used in more complex situations and it still can represent sharp moving fronts. The results for the different approximate computations are compared for a real-life problem as found by Valocchi, Street and Roberts (1981) ...|$|R

AES images reveal dramatic evidence for micron-scale diffusion of O from Al 2 O 3 into GaN. Conversely, <b>plateau</b> <b>concentrations</b> of N can extend microns into the sapphire, corresponding spatially to a 3. 8 eV defect emission and Auger chemical shifts attributed to Al-N-O complexes.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the antioxidant activities of an aqueous O. gratissimum extract (OGE) and to evaluate its cytoprotective activity against hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity in human HepG 2 cells. The results revealed that the total phenolic content of the OGE reached 20 %. In the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, the OGE reduced up to 80 % of the free radicals at a <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> of 66. 7  μg/mL.

40|$|Organochlorine {{pesticides}} and heavy metals were analyzed in fish from remote mountain lakes and Lhasa River in Tibetan <b>Plateau.</b> <b>Concentrations</b> of Sigma HCH, Sigma DDT and HCB in fish muscles {{were in the}} range of 0. 13 - 2. 6 ng/g, 0. 78 - 23 ng/g, 0. 31 - 3. 2 ng/g based on wet weight, respectively. Heavy metals were routinely found with different levels in fish. The Cu and Zn levels were relatively high with the maximum concentrations reaching 2. 0 and 6. 9 mu g/g, respectively. Accumulation of OCPs and heavy metals are quite different in tissues and organs. Gill seems to accumulate more OCPs due to absorption by its larger surface per tissue. Heavy metal levels were generally high in liver, eggs and gill, and low in brain and muscle.

This work aims to investigate the levels, patterns and distribution of semi-volatile organoclorine pollutants and to improve {{the understanding of the}} long-range atmospheric transport and fate of contaminants on the Tibetan Plateau. A total of 60 fish samples were collected from eight lakes located between 2813 and 4718 m above sea level across the <b>Plateau.</b> <b>Concentrations</b> of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were measured in fish muscle.

Carrots were grown in control soils and soils amended with three sludge application rates, 15, 55, and 180 t/ha. Applied sludge contained 17. 2 mg PAH/kg, a concentration typical for a sludge {{derived from a}} rural area. Carrot foliage, root peels and root cores were analyzed for 15 PAH compounds. Carrots foliage PAH concentrations were unaffected by sludge applications (PAH loadings), but root peel PAH concentrations increased to a <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> with increasing soil PAH levels. Low molecular weight PAH compounds dominated individual components of the PAH load in the root tissues. The PAH concentrations detected in the root peels were all significantly lower than in the foliage, which receives PAH inputs from the atmosphere. Carrot core PAR concentrations were unaffected by sludge application, implying little or no transfer of PAHs from the peels to the core. About 70 % of the PAH burden found in carrots {{was associated with the}} peels. Fresh weight carrot core concentrations were all < 4. 2 µg/kg.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) (7 - 36) amide is an {{intestinal}} incretin hormone {{which also}} inhibits gastric acid secretion in humans. Its {{mechanism of action}} is unclear, but it strongly inhibits vagally induced secretion (sham feeding), suggesting that it could influence vagal activity. AIM/METHODS: The effect of intravenous GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide) (1 pmol/kg/min) was studied on pentagastrin induced acid secretion in otherwise healthy subjects, previously vagotomised for duodenal ulcer (n = 8) and {{in a group of}} young (n = 8) and old (n = 6) healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Pentagastrin increased acid secretion significantly in all three groups, but the <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> in the vagotomised subjects was lower than in controls. Infusion of GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide) significantly inhibited acid secretion in the control groups (to 67 (SEM 6) and 74 (SEM 3) % of plateau concentrations in young and old controls, respectively) but had no effect in the vagotomised subjects. Differences in plasma concentrations of GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide), recovery of gastric marker, duodenal regurgitation, or Helicobacter pylori status could not explain the lack of effect. Blood glucose was lowered equally by GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide) in all subjects. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect of GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide) on acid secretion depends on intact vagal innervation of the stomach...|$|E
40|$|Objective-To {{investigate}} {{penetration of}} a topically applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) into tissues and synovial fluid. Animals- 5 Greyhounds. Procedure-Dogs were anesthetized and microdialysis probes {{placed in the}} dermis and gluteal muscle over each coxofemoral (hip) joint. Methylsalicylate (MeSA) was applied topically over the left hip joint. Dialysate and plasma (blood samples from the cephalic and femoral veins) were obtained during the subsequent 5 hours. Dogs were euthanatized, and tissue samples and synovial fluid were collected and analyzed for salicylic acid (SA) and MeSA by use of high-pressure liquid chromatography. Results-SA and MeSA concentrations increased rapidly (< 30 minutes after application) in dialysate obtained from treated dermis. Salicylic acid also appeared in plasma within 30 minutes and reached a <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> after 2 hours, although combined drug concentrations (SA plus MeSA) in plasma obtained from femoral vein samples were twice those measured in plasma obtained from the cephalic vein (SA only). Treated muscle had a progressive decrease in NSAID concentration with increasing depth (SA and MeSA), but it {{was significantly higher than}} the concentration in untreated muscle. Substantial amounts of SA and MeSA were also measured in synovial fluid of treated joints. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Topically applied NSAIDs can penetrate deeply into tissues and synovial fluid. Local concentrations higher than circulating systemic concentrations are suggestive that direct diffusion and local blood redistribution are contributing to this effect. Systemic blood concentrations may be inadequate to describe regional kinetics of topically applied drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{with which}} the concentration dependence of the sedimentation coefficient, s = s (0) (1 - kc), can be quantified for globular proteins by commonly used procedures has been examined by subjecting simulated sedimentation velocity distributions for ovalbumin to c(s) ‒s analysis. Because this procedure, {{as well as its}} g(s) ‒s counterpart, is based on assumed constancy of s over the time course of sedimentation coefficient measurement in a given experiment, the best definition of the concentration coefficient k is obtained by associating the measured s with the mean of <b>plateau</b> <b>concentrations</b> for the initial and final distributions used for its determination. The return of a slightly underestimated k (by about 3 %) is traced to minor mislocation of the air‒liquid meniscus position as the result of assuming time independence of s in a given experiment. Although more accurate quantification should result from later SEDFIT and SEDANAL programs incorporating the simultaneous evaluation of s (0) and k, the procedures based on assumed constancy of s suffice for determining the limiting sedimentation coefficient s (0) -the objective of most s‒c dependence studies...|$|R

These media were assayed for erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA) using human peripheral blood monocyte-depleted mononuclear cells as targets and assessing the stimulatory {{effect of the}} conditioned media on growth of early erythroid progenitor cells. Both monocytes and endothelial cells produced modest amounts of detectable BPA. Addition of varying concentrations of media conditioned by monocytes to <b>plateau</b> <b>concentrations</b> (5 - 10 %) of media conditioned by endothelial cells had no additive effect. Endothelial cells incubated {{in the presence of}} 50 % monocyte-conditioned medium produced 2. 5 - to 6. 6 -fold more BPA than did endothelial cells incubated only in control tissue culture medium. In contrast, endothelial cell conditioned medium did not stimulate increased BPA production by monocytes. Neither neutrophil- nor marrow fibroblastoid cell-conditioned medium stimulated BPA production by endothelial cells. Therefore, both monocytes and endothelial cells produce BPA. Moreover, monocytes produce a monokine that, in turn, stimulates the production of BPA by endothelial cells. Inasmuch as a monokine also has been shown to stimulate production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity, we propose that monocytes {{play a critical role in}} regulating the production of humoral regulators of the very early stages of hemopoietic cell differentiation...|$|R

This temporal data opens up new possibilities {{in the study of}} human physiology, broadly applicable from assessing high performance athletes to monitoring Cystic Fibrosis (CF) sufferers. Our compact Sodium Sensor Belt (SSB) consists of a sodium selective Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) integrated into a platform that can be interfaced with the human body during exercise. No skin cleaning regime or sweat storage technology is required as the sweat is continually wicked from the skin to a sensing surface and from there to a storage area via a fabric pump. Our results suggest that after an initial equilibration period, a steady-state sodium <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> was reached. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) was used as a reference method, and this has confirmed the accuracy of the new continuous monitoring approach. The steady-state concentrations observed were found to fall within ranges previously found in the literature, which further validates the approach.

As a further application, we attempted to monitor the sweat of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) sufferers using the same device.

Post-implantation annealing were performed at 1700 or 1800 °C up to 30 min in Ar ambient. During this process, some samples were encapsulated with a graphite (C) cap obtained by thermal conversion of a spin-coated AZ 5214 E photoresist. From Atomic Force Microscope measurements, the roughness is found to increase drastically with annealing temperature for unprotected samples while the C capped samples show a preservation of their surface states even for the highest annealing temperature. After 1800 °C/ 30 min annealing, the RMS roughness is 0. 46 nm for the lower fluence implanted samples, slightly higher than for unimplanted samples (0. 31 nm). Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy measurements confirm that the C cap was totally removed from the SiC surface. The total Al-implanted fluence is preserved during postimplantation annealing. A redistribution of the Al dopants is observed at the surface which might be attributed to Si vacancy-enhanced diffusion. An accumulation peak is also observed after annealing at 0. 29 9 m, depth corresponding to the amorphous/crystalline interface that was determined on the as-implanted samples by Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy in channeling mode. The redistribution of the dopants {{has an impact on}} their electrical activation.

CFU-GM were isolated from cyclophosphamide-treated mice by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation followed by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. The resulting population had a cloning efficiency of 62 - 99 % in cultures containing conditioned medium from pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen cells and 55 - 86 % {{in the presence of a}} <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> of purified recombinant murine GM-CSF. Equilibrium binding studies with 125 I-labeled GM-CSF showed that normal bone marrow cells, casein-induced peritoneal exudate cells, and purified CFU-GM had a single class of high-affinity receptor with an approximate Ka of 10 (8) - 10 (9) M- 1. CFU-GM expressed an average of 3783 +/- 4 receptors per cell; normal bone marrow cells, 1518 +/- 242 receptors per cell; and peritoneal exudate cells, 2025 +/- 216 receptors per cell. Affinity crosslinking studies demonstrated that 125 I-labeled GM-CSF bound specifically to two species of Mr 180, 000 and 70, 000 on CFU-GM, normal bone marrow cells, and peritoneal exudate cells. The Mr 70, 000 species is thought to be a proteolytic fragment of the intact Mr 180, 000 receptor. The present studies indicate that the GM-CSF receptor expressed on CFU-GM and mature myeloid cells are structurally similar.

The first objective {{of this study was to}} establish the time course of lidocaine and its metabolites, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), in clinically normal dogs. The ultimate goal was to identify the best time(s) for sample collection when disposition of lidocaine is used as a test of hepatic dysfunction. The second goal was to compare the disposition of lidocaine and its metabolites in normal dogs (G 1) and dogs with Alport syndrome, a hereditary proteinuric nephritis (G 2). Lidocaine (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously (IV) to six clinically normal dogs. Blood samples were collected intermittently for twelve hours. Concentrations of lidocaine, MEGX, and GX were quantitated in plasma using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The resulting data was subjected to standard non-compartmental analysis. A <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> for MEGX occurred between 10 and 60 minutes and for GX between 60 and 120 minutes after the administration of lidocaine. The ratio of concentrations of GX to MEGX versus time was linear from 15 minutes to 180 minutes after IV administration of lidocaine characterized by a slope of 0. 0144 ? 0. 0090 GX/MEGX ratio over time. Subsequently, lidocaine (3 mg/kg) was administered IV to six dogs with Alport syndrome. Pharmacokinetic parameters for lidocaine, MEGX, and GX were compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Values for the parameters did not differ between the two groups (p > 0. 05). In G 2, the <b>concentration</b> <b>plateaus</b> for MEGX and GX occurred at the same time as that found in G 1.

40|$|Analysis of {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) on human breath has great potential as a non-invasive diagnostic technique. It is, therefore, surprising that no single, standard procedure has evolved for breath sampling. Here we present a novel repeated-cycle isothermal rebreathing method, where one cycle comprises five rebreaths, which could be adopted for breath analysis of VOCs. For demonstration purposes, we present measurements of three common breath VOCs: isoprene, acetone and methanol. Their concentrations measured in breath are shown to increase with number of rebreaths until a plateau value is reached by at least 20 rebreaths. The average ratio of <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> to single mixed expired breath concentration {{was found to be}} 1. 92 ± 0. 57 for isoprene, 1. 25 ± 0. 13 for acetone and 1. 12 ± 0. 12 for methanol (mean ± standard deviation). Measurements from on-line single exhalations are presented which demonstrate a positive slope in the time-dependent expirograms of isoprene and acetone. The slope of the isoprene expirogram is persistently linear and the end-expired concentration of isoprene is highly variable in the same subject depending on the duration of exhalation. End-expired values of acetone are not as sensitive to the length of exhalation, and are the same to within measurement uncertainty for any duration of exhalation for any subject. It is concluded that uncontrolled single on-line exhalations are not suitable for the reliable measurement of isoprene in the breath and that rebreathing can be the basis of an easily tolerated protocol for the reliable collection of breath samples. © 2008 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicin...|$|E

This difference is mainly attributed to the species-specific burden by the metabolically formed 1, 2 : 3, 4 -diepoxybutane (DEB). However, only limited data exist on the DEB blood burden of rodents at BD concentrations below 100 ppm. Considering this, DEB concentrations were determined {{in the blood of}} mice and rats immediately after 6 h exposures to various constant concentrations of BD of between about 1 and 1200 ppm. Immediately after its collection, blood was injected into a vial that contained perdeuterated DEB (DEB-D 6) as internal standard. Plasma samples were prepared and treated with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate that derivatized metabolically produced DEB and DEB-D 6 to their bis(dithiocarbamoyl) esters, which were then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer. DEB concentrations in blood versus BD exposure concentrations in air could be described by one-phase exponential association functions. Herewith calculated (±) -DEB concentrations in blood increased in mice from 5. 4 nmol/l at 1 ppm BD to 1860 nmol/l at 1250 ppm BD and in rats from 1. 2 nmol/l at 1 ppm BD to 92 nmol/l at 200 ppm BD, at which exposure concentration 91 % of the calculated DEB <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> in rat blood was reached. This information on the species-specific blood burden by the highly mutagenic DEB helps to explain why the carcinogenic potency of BD in rats is low compared to that in mice...|$|E
40|$|The {{solubility}} {{advantage of}} indomethacin amorphized by co-grinding with Neusilin US 2 in various media was investigated. Physical mixtures of γ-indomethacin and Neusilin US 2 (in the ratios 1 : 1, 1 : 4 and 1 : 5) were amorphized {{at room temperature}} employing 75 % RH in a porcelain jar mill using zirconia balls. The crystallinity of the samples was determined using ATR-FTIR and PXRD. The solubility and dissolution profiles of co-ground powders and crystalline counterparts were evaluated in 0. 1  N HCl, water and phosphate buffer (pH  6. 8) in a USP type II dissolution apparatus at 250  rpm and 37 °C. Very high concentrations of dissolved indomethacin {{as compared to the}} solubility of γ-indomethacin (~ 500 times in water and ~ 3. 7 times in phosphate buffer) were attained. However, the presence of other polymorphs detected by PXRD and a change in the pH of the medium made interpretation of the results difficult. In 0. 1  N HCl the solubility (i. e., the peak in a concentration versus time plot) of the amorphized drug in a 1 : 5 ratio with Neusilin increased to 109 times the solubility of crystalline γ-indomethacin alone. An increase in amount of drug and Neusilin in the same ratio added to the dissolution medium also increased peak and plateau dissolution concentrations. The presence of silicic acid and ions (Mg 2 + and Al 3 +) in the dissolution media were found to cause the increase in the <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> of indomethacin. Amorphization alone does not account for all of the dissolution enhancement; acidity, ions, and silicic acid are major contributors to dissolution enhancement...|$|E
40|$|Most nutrient-spiraling {{studies have}} focused on {{estimates}} of gross uptake (Ugross), which show that streams take up dissolved inorganic nutrients very efficiently. However, studies based on estimates of net uptake (Unet) emphasize that streams tend to be at biogeochemical steady state (i. e., Unet ≈ 0), at least on a time scale of hours. These findings suggest that streams can be highly reactive ecosystems but remain at short-term biogeochemical steady state if Ugross is counterbalanced by release (R), a process that remains widely unexplored. Here, we propose a novel approach to infer R by comparing Unet and Ugross estimated from ambient and <b>plateau</b> <b>concentrations</b> obtained from standard short-term nutrient additions along a reach. We used this approach to examine the temporal variation of R and its balance with Ugross in 2 streams with contrasting hydrological regime (i. e., perennial vs intermittent) during 2 years. We focused on the spiraling metrics of NH 4 + and soluble reactive P (SRP), essential sources of N and P in stream ecosystems. R differed substantially between the 2 streams. The perennial stream had a higher proportion of dates with R > 0 and a 2 × higher mean R than the intermittent stream for both nutrients. Despite these differences, the magnitude of R and Ugross tended to be similar for both nutrients within each stream, which lead to Unet ≈ 0 in most cases. A notable exception occurred for SRP in the intermittent stream, where R tended to be higher than Ugross during most of the winter period, probably because of desorption of P from stream sediments. Together, our findings shed light on the contribution of release processes to the dynamics of nutrient spiraling and support the idea that streams can be active ecosystems with high spiraling fluxes while simultaneously approaching short-term biogeochemical steady-state...|$|R
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) with [18 F]fleroxacin {{was used to}} study the pharmacokinetics of fleroxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, in 12 healthy volunteers (9 men and 3 women). The subjects were infused with a standard therapeutic dose of fleroxacin (400 mg) supplemented with approximately 20 mCi of [18 F]fleroxacin. Serial PET images were made and blood samples were collected for 8 h, starting at the initiation of the infusion. The subjects were then treated with unlabeled drug for 3 days (400 mg/day). On the fifth day, infusion of radiolabeled drug, PET imaging, and blood collection were repeated. In most organs, there was rapid accumulation of radiolabeled drug, with stable levels achieved within 1 h after completion of the infusion. Especially high peak concentrations (in micrograms per gram) were achieved in the kidney (> 34), liver (> 25), lung (> 20), myocardium (> 19), and spleen (> 18). Peak concentrations of drug more than two times the MIC for 90 % of Enterobacteriaceae strains tested (> 10 -fold for most organisms) were achieved in all tissues except the brain and remained above this level for more than 6 to 8 h. The <b>plateau</b> <b>concentrations</b> in tissues (2 to 8 h, in micrograms per gram +/- standard error of the mean) of drug were as follows: brain, 0. 83 +/- 0. 032; myocardium, 4. 53 +/- 0. 24; lung, 5. 80 +/- 0. 48; liver, 7. 31 +/- 0. 33; spleen, 6. 00 +/- 0. 47; bowel, 3. 53 +/- 0. 74; kidney, 8. 85 +/- 0. 64; bone, 2. 87 +/- 0. 29; muscle, 4. 60 +/- 0. 33; prostate, 4. 65 +/- 0. 48; uterus, 3. 87 +/- 0. 39; breast, 2. 68 +/- 0. 11; and blood, 2. 35 +/- 0. 09.

We utilized {{a new technique}} that employs a variable flow rate to estimate key flow-independent parameters characteristic of NO exchange in a group (n = 9) of 10 to 14 yr-old healthy children and children with cystic fibrosis (CF). maximum flux of NO from the airways (J No,max, pl s - 1), diffusing capacity of NO in the airways (D No,air, pl s - 1 ppb - 1), steady-state alveolar concentration (C alv,ss, ppb), and mean tissue concentration of NO in the airways (C tiss,air, ppb). We determined the following mean (± SD) values in the healthy children and patients with CF for J No,max, D No,air, C̄ alv,ss, and C̄ tiss,air, respectively; 784 ± 465 and 607 ± 648 pl s - 1; 4. 82 ± 3. 07 and 17. 6 ± 12. 1 pl s - 1 ppb - 1; 4. 63 ± 3. 59 and 1. 96 ± 1. 18 ppb; and 198 ± 131 and 38 ± 25 ppb. D No,air is elevated (p = 0. 007), and both C alv,ss and C̄ tiss,air are reduced (p = 0. 05 and 0. 002, respectively) in CF. In contrast, C NO,plat for healthy control subjects and patients with CF are not statistically different at both exhalation flow rates of 50 ml/s (17. 5 ± 11. 5 and 11. 5 ± 8. 97) and at 250 ml/s (7. 11 ± 5. 36 and 4. 28 ± 3. 43).

In the first experiment, anhydrous gas was introducedNH 3 {{at the bottom of}} a 1. 2 m silo filled with sisal pulp. Two vertical cores of silage were removed from the silo, the first after one week. and the other after 3 weeks. Samples of silage juice were taken at intervals aloe?, the profile and analysed for,,!Brix and pH. The diffusion of was very slow and after 3 weeksNH 3 NH 3 it was only partially mixed with the lower half of the silage (up to 0. 6 m). The pH was related to NH 3 concentration, varying from pH 3. 6 to 4. 2 at low levels of NH up to pH 10 at the bottom of the silo. To investigate the use of an ammonia solution to overcome the problem of mixing with the silage, Experiment Two was carried out.

40|$|Pancreatogenic {{diabetes}} (PD), secondary {{either to}} chronic calcific pancreatitis or to pancreatectomy, {{is characterized by}} higher frequency of hypoglycemic events during insulin therapy in comparison with type I insulin-dependent diabetes (IDD). Not only glucagon deficiency, but an enhanced peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin could account for this metabolic behavior. We investigated several facets of insulin action, e. g., tissue sensitivity to insulin, insulin binding to red cells, and insulin kinetics in seven patients with PD in comparison with type I. Tissue sensitivity to insulin was evaluated {{by means of the}} glucose-insulin clamp technique as M/I x 100 ratio (mg. kg. - 1 min- 1 /muU. ml- 1), where M is the amount of glucose infused by Biostator GCIIS to clamp BG at basal level and I is the free insulin <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> achieved by a primed-constant insulin infusion. At high BG 15 h after the last injection of regular insulin M/I x 100 was 7. 79 (range 4. 25 - 9. 75) in PD and 4. 20 (range 1. 20 - 6. 91) in D (P less than 0. 05). At low and equal BG M/I x 100 was 8. 55 (range 6. 35 - 9. 72) in PD and 3. 42 (range 1. 19 - 6. 75) in D (P less than 0. 01). The rate of endogenous glucose production was nearly totally suppressed in both groups of patients. Just before the two clamps, 125 I-insulin specific binding to red cells was studied. The maximum specific binding was significantly higher in PD than in D at high BG (10. 7 +/- 1. 7 vs. 7. 4 +/- 0. 8 / 10 (9) red cells) and at low and equal BG (12. 4 +/- 1. 2 vs. 6. 8 +/- 0. 8). Receptor concentration also was significantly higher in PD thant in D (P less than 0. 02) while {{no significant differences were found}} in high affinity (Ke).

40|$|Changes in {{the natural}} {{abundance}} of delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 in soil are proposed as indicators {{in the evolution of}} ecosystems caused by land management and/or vegetational succession. Such changes are seldom known {{due to the lack of}} comparative data on the levels of delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 in soils. To understand the distribution of C and N during revegetational succession, we investigated the changes in the levels of delta C- 13, delta N- 15, organic carbon (OC), and total nitrogen (TN) for soils sampled from three incremental depths (0 - 10, 10 - 20, and 20 - 40 cm) during a revegetational succession from alfalfa (Medicago sativa, C- 3 plant) to the natural vegetation of bunge needlegrass (Stipa bungeana, C- 3 plant) in the northern Loess Plateau. The levels of delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 increased gradually with the succession of the alfalfa community and decreased with the succession to the bunge needlegrass community, indicating that the dynamics of the delta C- 13 /delta N- 15 isotopic signatures differed within the different revegetational stages of succession. A pronounced inverse relationship developed between the soil water storage (0 - 40 or 0 - 100 cm depths) and the natural abundance of delta C- 13 /delta N- 15. The use of this relationship may be of value to scientists modelling nutrient cycling within different ages of vegetational succession across the semiarid regions of the Loess <b>Plateau.</b> <b>Concentrations</b> and stocks of OC and TN increased with revegetational age during the two successional stages, suggesting that revegetation enhanced the sequestration of OC and N in soils by reducing soil erosion and increasing inputs of organic materials. Our results highlight the utility of stable isotopes in studying C and N dynamics along revegetational succession on degraded land and emphasise the improvement in soil OC and N by well-managed strategies of vegetational restoration in the northern Loess Plateau.
