50|$|The {{taxability}} of {{alcoholic beverages}} is slightly complicated. In Pennsylvania, alcohol is sold to businesses and consumers through the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB). The PLCB always charges sales tax {{directly to the}} <b>purchasing</b> <b>entity.</b> Therefore, if a consumer purchases alcohol in PLCB stores, the sales tax is assessed {{at the point of}} purchase, but if a consumer purchases alcohol at a licensed business (such as a bar or restaurant), the sales tax is not applied because it had already been paid when the business purchased the alcohol from the PLCB. The PLCB charges an additional 18% levy on liquor and wine, but this tax is always included in the price regardless of the purchasing location. Beer is subject to an excise of $0.08 per gallon.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this paper}} is to review {{procurement}} trends of facilities management (FM) services and to describe the partnership control mechanisms that contribute to the success of FM partnerships. The investigation is based on a questionnaire survey, which was carried out in Finland. It was found that a transition – similar to those in other industries – towards closer relationships and bigger <b>purchase</b> <b>entities</b> is taking place also in the FM context. In most cases, the choice of the partnering approach is related to developing wider service packages. When implementing partnering relationships, the task of top management is to provide the shared values and visions. Having established these in the organisation, top management does not seem to have any significant role in relationship management. During the ongoing partnership, the operational level runs the daily initiative, development and problem solving based on ad hoc procedures...|$|R
40|$|The {{centralization}} of purchases has been increasingly a strategic trend, {{particularly in the}} health sector. In Portugal, the SPMS, Serviços Partilhados do Ministério da Saúde, E. P. E., was established in 2010 as a central <b>purchasing</b> <b>entity</b> for the health sector. Centralized purchasing can bring advantages, such as increasing {{the efficiency of the}} purchasing process, but also disadvantages, such as the possibility of oligopoly by suppliers, generated by imperfect competition, and a diminished response to the most decentralized units. This theme {{was the subject of a}} reflection meeting, which aimed to promote a debate on the national framework aspects of this process, challenges of implementation for hospital medicines and suggestions for improvement of this process. The main ideas generated for a successful centralized purchasing indicate that the central <b>purchasing</b> <b>entity</b> should be dynamic and facilitator, should ensuring equity, safety, accessibility and quality of drugs. There should be better planning and rigorous procurement of drugs, and an integrated information system that allows sharing and networking among the central purchasing and the various health institutions, fostering a proximity policy, should be created. Professionals should be trained in the necessary technical procedures for the completion of the acquisition of drugs, and hospital pharmacists should be included as consultants in the development of specific procedures of centralized procurement, according to the hospital’s needs. Finally, this entire process must be followed by constant monitoring through an annual assessment of the economic and financial feasibility. The benefits of the activity performed annually should adequately quantify the quality and efficiency gains that demonstrate the financial impact achieved in scope of the reduction of expense in the National Health Service...|$|E
40|$|The phrase {{mergers and}} acquisitions, or M 2 ̆ 6 A for short, signifies both the {{business}} activity of growing (or divesting) corporate operations {{and the legal}} rules surrounding that activ- ity. One typical acquisition technique is the purchase of busi- ness assets by one company from another. Indeed, General Mo- tors and Chrysler utilized this transactional structure in their bankruptcy reorganization following the recent global financial crisis, with the United States Government as a part owner of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>entities.</b> 1 Asset sales transactions have various benefits, {{one of which is}} that the purchaser presumptively does not assume any of the seller‘s liabilities as part of the purchase transaction. With respect to this ability to purchase assets without also assuming liabilities, the Supreme Court declared over 120 years ago that ―[t]his doctrine is so familiar that it is surprising that any other can be supposed to exist...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the public sector's {{expenditures}} has been revised heavily. The New Public Management-wave has set its footprints on how to govern. In Denmark the municipalities are focusing {{more and more on}} how to cope with much lower budgets. The citizens are expected to receive the same quality in public services even though a smaller amount of resources is available. Hence they've created so called municipal <b>purchasing</b> <b>entities</b> (MPE's) which are concentrated on sharing knowledge and experience in public purchasing. The main goal for MPE's is to reduce the cost associated with the purchase of private goods. These MPE's have in the period of 3 to 4 years, from 2009 and forward, developed from lose structured networks with a horizontal organization into organizations with a somewhat stricter and more hierarchical structure. This study examines the organizational changes which the MPE's are undergoing. The study use network theory combined with a comparative methodological framework to examine the subject. It deals with 3 cases from the Danish municipality world; KomUdbud, FællesUdbud Sjælland and Vestegnens Indkøbsforum. On the basis of a generated hypothesis the study concludes that the MPE's are moving towards becoming more hierarchical and structured organizations, so far as the degree of complexity has been reduced to a significant level. This study shows an understudied academic field of study; namely the movement from the network approach to hierarchical organizing.

5000|$|Lean {{times were}} ahead for Rochester, with the 1940s finding the Red Wings {{on the bottom}} half of the standings. Even former famed pitcher Burleigh Grimes couldn't change the team's fortunes. He lasted a little more than a season and a half when he was {{replaced}} by Benny Borgmann. The team would capture three more league championships in the Cardinals era, those coming in 1952, 1955, and 1956. In the fall of , the Cardinals ceased to operate the Red Wings and put both the team and the stadium up for sale. In response, Morrie Silver, a Rochester businessman, formed Rochester Community Baseball, Inc.

The attempt was successful as RCB <b>purchased</b> both <b>entities</b> from the Cardinals on February 27, 1957, in an event that was dubbed the [...] "72 Day Miracle".

50|$|A {{capital market}} {{can be either}} a primary market or a {{secondary}} market. In primary markets, new stock or bond issues are sold to investors, often via a mechanism known as underwriting. The main entities seeking to raise long-term funds on the primary capital markets are governments (which may be municipal, local or national) and business enterprises (companies). Governments issue only bonds, whereas companies often issue either equity or bonds. The main <b>entities</b> <b>purchasing</b> the bonds or stock include pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and less commonly wealthy individuals and investment banks trading on their own behalf. In the secondary markets, existing securities are sold and bought among investors or traders, usually on an exchange, over-the-counter, or elsewhere. The existence of secondary markets increases the willingness of investors in primary markets, as they know {{they are likely to}} be able to swiftly cash out their investments if the need arises.|$|R
5000|$|Findings: (1) In June 2005, 14 {{percent of}} total <b>purchases</b> by 340B <b>entities</b> {{exceeded}} 340B ceiling prices, resulting in total overpayments of $3.9 million. (2) The largest overpayments were due to prices that did not follow HRSA's [...] "penny price" [...] policy in situations to which the statutory 340B ceiling price calculation yielded a negative number. (3) Low-volume entities, manufacturers, and wholesalers were associated with higher rates of overpayments. (4) Inaccuracies in HRSA's ceiling prices limit HRSA's ability to monitor 340B program compliance.Recommendations: (1) HRSA should improve its oversight of the 340B program to ensure that entities are charged at or below the 340B ceiling price. (2) HRSA should provide technical assistance regarding 340B program implementation to all participating entities, manufacturers, and wholesalers. (3) HRSA should publish guidelines regarding its penny price policy. (4) To accurately calculate 340B ceiling prices, HRSA should obtain data on consistent unit of measure and package size.|$|R
