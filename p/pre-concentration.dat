In gold recovery the jigs produce highly concentrated products {{which can be}} easily upgraded by methods such as barrel amalgamation, treating across shaking tables or processing through centrifugal concentrators. In other placer operations the heavy minerals being sought are recovered efficiently and cheaply with similar high ratios of concentration. In iron, manganese and base metal treatment flowsheets, the jigs are operated to produce marketable grades of concentrate; or, as <b>pre-concentration</b> devices, to reject barren gangue prior to the ore entering the fine grinding section of the mill flowsheet.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{increase}} of stope height due to increasing mechanization in the years 60 to 90, more waste were produced {{for the same amount}} of ore (dilution) resulting in higher amounts of low grade ore reaching the plant. It was necessary to replace the <b>pre-concentration</b> done by manual selection (handpicking) and jigging, with a more efficient method and with greater capacity to deal with the greater volume of ore plus waste that reached the plant. In 1971 a Heavy Medium separation (HMS) was installed which carries out <b>pre-concentration</b> in a very effective way and with minimal losses. Due to improvement in the mine stopping method and greater need for fragmentation for the medium separation, a fines recovery circuit was installed in the 60’s which was improved and expanded in the 80s. Currently, the ore is stopped with a grade of approximately 0.15% WO3 [...] Its concentration is in the first stages totally hydrogravitic. Taking advantage of the dense characteristic of the minerals to be exploited (volframite, cassiterite and chalcopyrite) {{and in the case of}} the Panasqueira of coarse mineralization. After secondary crushing to 20mm the ore undergoes enrichment through dense medium and shaking tables until a pre-concentrate with approximately 6% of W03 is obtained. This pre-concentrate is then concentrated to grades close to those of final concentration in flotation tables, for the simultaneous enrichment of the dense particles and separation of the sulfides, which are then flotated [...] to obtain a final copper concentrate (chalcopyrite). The dense pre-concentrate is then separated in tables and electromagnetic separation in wolfram (wolframite) and tin (cassiterite) concentrates.|$|E

The machine generates forces up to 300 times {{the force of gravity}} (300 G's) and operates by using a smooth-walled, rotating bowl to stratify the material into heavier and lighter fractions then uses pneumatic valves to control the amount of heavy material that reports to the concentrate collection stream. It does not use any fluidization water and relies entirely on centrifugal force for separation. The Falcon C concentrator is used in various process plants around the world, such as the Tanco mine in Canada, the Sekisovskoye mine in Kazakhstan and the Renison tin mine in Tasmania.|$|E
50|$|Variations in density {{within the}} {{specimen}} are amplified to enhance contrast in unstained cells which is especially useful for examining living unpigmented cells. In other words, phase contrast is a contrast-enhancing optical technique {{that can be}} used to produce high contrast images such as living cells and subcellular including nuclei and other organelles. One of the major advantages of using phase contrast microscopy is that living cells can be examined in their natural state without being killed, fixed, or especially stained. As a result, biological processes in the cell can be observed and recorded in high contrast with sharp clarity of minute specimen details.When the ligand binds to its specific receptor, the ligand-receptor complex accumulates in the coated pits. In many cells these pits and complexes begin to concentrate in one area of a cell. Cytochemically, this appears as patches of label on the cell surface (patching). Eventually, the patches coalesce to form a cap at one pole of the cell (capping). Not all cells form caps, but most do form patches. The <b>pre-concentration</b> process minimizes the amount of fluid that is taken up in the vesicle.|$|E
50|$|The Condor Dense Medium Separator (DMS) is a multi-stage, high {{efficiency}} media separation machine for mineral processing {{operations at the}} rougher and scavenger stage. It is typically used in a <b>pre-concentration</b> duty prior to processing or milling to reject barren material. The unit is manufactured with either two or three stages of separation depending on the media {{with one or two}} valuable densities resulting, while the unit can produce up to four products from one dense medium vessel altogether. The Condor DMS can take a larger feed particle size compared to a DMS cyclone of the same diameter and capacity, and is capable of handling higher sinks or floats loading without affecting performance. The valuable dense material (or 'sinks') can be combined or separated at the final stage and is then pumped onto the next process in the circuit.Sepro Mineral Systems Corp. supplies customizable DMS Plants {{for a wide variety of}} application requirements. Sepro’s standard two product (concentrate, tailings) DMS Plant utilizes a two-stage Condor Separator and single density medium circuit, while the three product (concentrate, middlings, tailings) DMS Plant utilizes a three-stage Condor Separator and two medium circuits at high and low density.|$|E
50|$|Most {{prominent}} {{example of}} the application of sensor-based ore sorting is the rejection of barren waste before transporting and comminution. Waste rejection is also known under the term <b>pre-concentration.</b> A discrimination has been introduced by Robben. Rule of thumb is that at least 25% of liberated barren waste must {{be present in the}} fraction to be treated by sensor-based ore sorting to make waste rejection financially feasible.Reduction of waste before it enters comminution and grinding processes does not only reduce the costs in those processes, but also releases the capacity that can be filled with higher grade material and thus implies higher productivity of the system. A prejudice against the application of a waste rejection process is, that the valuable content lost in this process is a penalty higher than the savings that can be achieved. But it is reported in the literature that the overall recovery even increases through bringing higher grade material as feed into the mill. In addition, the higher productivity is an additional source of income. If noxious waste such as acid consuming calcite is removed, the downstream recovery increases and the downstream costs decrease disproportionally as reported for example by Bergmann. The coarse waste rejected can be an additional source of income if there is a local market for aggregates.|$|E
50|$|During decades {{there were}} three {{independent}} plants and later they complemented each other: Panasqueira, Cabeço do Pião and Barroca Grande. Panasqueira Plant began {{to be built in}} the XIX century and was progressively transferred, from 1928, to Barroca Grande which has a more central location, more available area, greater access to water and other advantages that led to the Panasqueira Plant being totally deactivated in the 60's. The Cabeço do Pião plant such as Panasqueira began to be built {{at the end of the}} XIX century. With the abandonment of this vein exploitation zone, and due to the greater availability of water of the Zêzere River, this plant only treated the pre-concentrates that came, first by aerial cable and later by truck from the Barroca Grande Plant. At the end of the 80s, the Panasqueira mine had enough extension so that its drainage water was sufficient to supply the necessary flow to the entire industrial structure; so between 1992 and 1996 in order to rationalize costs and due to environmental reasons the centralization of all ore concentration operations was done in Barroca Grande. The ore enrichment process has evolved greatly over time. In the beginning it began in the stopes with manual selection of the ore, reaching the plant with an enrichment of approximately 6 times in relation to its grade when stopped. It was difficult to do adequate manual selection in the stopes, therefore a coarser choice was done in the stopes, and a finer choice made in the Barroca Grande Plant in ore already washed, screened and with good lighting conditions. The <b>pre-concentration</b> continued by jigging and the pre-concentrate then went to the Cabeço do Pião plant.|$|E
