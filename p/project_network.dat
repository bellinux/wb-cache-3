40|$|Many natural, technological, {{and social}} systems {{incorporate}} multiway interactions, yet are characterized and measured {{on the basis}} of weighted pairwise interactions. In this article, I propose a family of models in which pairwise interactions originate from multiway interactions, by starting from ensembles of hypergraphs and applying projections that generate ensembles of weighted <b>projected</b> <b>networks.</b> I calculate analytically the statistical properties of weighted <b>projected</b> <b>networks,</b> and suggest ways these could be used beyond theoretical studies. Weighted <b>projected</b> <b>networks</b> typically exhibit weight disorder along links even for very simple generating hypergraph ensembles. Also, as the size of a hypergraph changes, a signature of multiway interaction emerges on the link weights of weighted <b>projected</b> <b>networks</b> that distinguishes them from fundamentally weighted pairwise networks. This signature could be used to search for hidden multiway interactions in weighted network data. I find the percolation threshold and size of the largest component for hypergraphs of arbitrary uniform rank, translate the results into <b>projected</b> <b>networks,</b> and show that the transition is second order. This general approach to network formation has the potential to shed new light on our understanding of weighted networks. Comment: 4 figures. 3 tables. 28 pages.

5000|$|For further {{research}} of project networks {{it is reasonable}} to enter some concepts. At the initial stage the <b>project</b> <b>network</b> is in the [...] "sleep mode", so there is a regular, for a social network, information exchange between potential participants of project teams and, therefore, in a network [...] "traditional agents" [...] or other actors. After that, within processes of initiation of projects, there are project teams (the description of mechanisms of initiation of project teams is beyond this article) that are expressed in the emergence of nodes with the increased concentration of connections, the <b>project</b> <b>network</b> leaves [...] "sleep mode" [...] and begins to carry out the functions on ensuring implementation of the initiated projects. For designation of the working teams, that the nodes made in a <b>project</b> <b>network</b> with the increased concentration of connections between actors, the concept of the actor of 1 level is entered. This basic concept for a <b>project</b> <b>network</b> as it designates availability in a <b>project</b> <b>network</b> of the operating command executing the project. If actors of 1 level establish connection among themselves, for example, within a matrix organizational structure, the concept of the actor 2 levels is entered.

40|$|Summary Global regulations, such {{as social}} and {{environmental}} standards, often result from project-based multi-stakeholder initiatives. Many initiatives fail because key stakeholders cannot be mobilized, or partners are incapable of establishing common ground. We show that local development projects aimed at testing and implementing new practices {{at the local level}} and strategically coordinated <b>project</b> <b>networks</b> linking local <b>projects</b> and project partners together across national boundaries can facilitate global institution-building. Based on a longitudinal case study of the emergence of the Common Code for the Coffee Community, we develop a process model of global standard development and discuss in particular the importance of global <b>project</b> <b>networks</b> as intermediary organizational forms. We inform research on global standard development and institution-building, and project-based learning and coordination across national boundaries.

40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} {{managing}} customer relationships in project-based industries, {{such as the}} television industry, should be looked at in terms of managing <b>project</b> <b>networks</b> with pools of competent service providers. That is, the conventional dyadic view of customer relationship is extended towards a network perspective, which accounts for the fact that, in particular in dynamic and highly innovative industries, customers as well as suppliers, {{in order to stay}} competitive, must reconcile their needs for stability and flexibility in maintaining long-term relationships. This idea is developed from marketing concepts of customer relationship management and two concepts borrowed from structuration theory. With the help of these concepts essential binding practices are discussed in the context of <b>project</b> <b>networks</b> in the television industry. In terms of empirical evidence, this paper draws on a large number of expert interviews in the television industry and a particularly interesting case of a German production firm which, as an organizer of <b>project</b> <b>networks,</b> sustains customer relationships with all major television channels in Germany...|$|R

40|$|Many {{complex systems}} present an {{intrinsic}} bipartite structure where elements of one set link to {{elements of the}} second set. In these complex systems, such as the system of actors and movies, elements of one set are qualitatively different than elements of the other set. The properties of these complex systems are typically investigated by constructing and analyzing a <b>projected</b> <b>network</b> {{on one of the}} two sets (for example the actor network or the movie network). Complex systems are often very heterogeneous in the number of relationships that the elements of one set establish with the elements of the other set, and this heterogeneity makes it very difficult to discriminate links of the <b>projected</b> <b>network</b> that are just reflecting system's heterogeneity from links relevant to unveil the properties of the system. Here we introduce an unsupervised method to statistically validate each link of a <b>projected</b> <b>network</b> against a null hypothesis that takes into account system heterogeneity. We apply the method to a biological, an economic and a social complex system. The method we propose is able to detect network structures which are very informative about the organization and specialization of the investigated systems, and identifies those relationships between elements of the <b>projected</b> <b>network</b> that cannot be explained simply by system heterogeneity. We also show that our method applies to bipartite systems in which different relationships might have different qualitative nature, generating statistically validated networks in which such difference is preserved...|$|R

Our longitudinal study reveals how integrators develop connecting functions that, together with contracts' steering functions, largely drive coordination dynamics. Further data analyses provide insight into how coordination hinges on the prevalence of connecting or steering, which may more or less fit with coordination needs in various project phases.
