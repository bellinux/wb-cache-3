25|$|For speech production, the ACT model {{starts with}} the {{activation}} of a phonemic representation of a speech item (phonemic map). In {{the case of a}} frequent syllable, a co-activation occurs {{at the level of the}} phonetic map, leading to a further co-activation of the intended sensory state at the level of the sensory state maps and to a co-activation of a motor plan state at the level of the motor plan map. In the case of an infrequent syllable, an attempt for a motor plan is generated by the motor <b>planning</b> <b>module</b> for that speech item by activating motor plans for phonetic similar speech items via the phonetic map (see Kröger et al. 2011). The motor plan or vocal tract action score comprises temporally overlapping vocal tract actions, which are programmed and subsequently executed by the motor programming, execution, and control module. This module gets real-time somatosensory feedback information for controlling the correct execution of the (intended) motor plan. Motor programing leads to activation pattern at the level lof the primary motor map and subsequently activates neuromuscular processing. Motoneuron activation patterns generate muscle forces and subsequently movement patterns of all model articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis). The Birkholz 3D articulatory synthesizer is used in order to generate the acoustic speech signal.|$|E

5000|$|The {{decision-making}} system {{consists of}} a <b>planning</b> <b>module</b> and a contentment function.

The contentment function maps from the agent's current beliefs, or anticipated beliefs, to {{an evaluation of the}} utility of being in that state. It is trained by reinforcement from a human teacher. In order to facilitate this reinforcement learning, MANIC provides a mechanism for the agent to generate [...] "fantasy videos" [...] that show anticipated observations if a candidate plan were to be executed. The idea is that a human teacher would evaluate these videos and rank them according to desirability or utility, and the agent could then use that feedback to refine its contentment function.|$|E

40|$|Actions in a multi-agent setting have complex characteris-tics. They may {{not only}} affect the real world, but also affect the {{knowledge}} and beliefs of agents in the world. In many cases, {{the effect on the}} beliefs or knowledge of an agent is not due to that agent actively doing some actions, but could be simply the result of that agent’s perspective in terms of where it is looking. In dynamic epistemic logic (DEL), such multi-agent actions are expressed as complex constructs or as Kripke model type structures. This paper uses the multi-agent action language mA+ to show how one can take advantage of some of the perspective fluents of the world to model com-plex actions, in the sense of DEL, as simple action sequences. The paper describes several <b>plan</b> <b>modules</b> using such actions.

50|$|An Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP system) {{can also}} help an {{organization}} reduce its level of safety stock. Most ERP systems provide a type of Production <b>Planning</b> <b>module.</b> An ERP module such as this can help a company develop highly accurate and dynamic sales forecasts and sales and operations plans. By creating more accurate and dynamic forecasts, a company reduces their chance of producing insufficient inventory for a given period and, thus, {{should be able to}} reduce the amount of safety stock that they require. In addition, ERP systems use established formulas to help calculate appropriate levels of safety stock based on the previously developed production plans. While an ERP system aids an organization in estimating a reasonable amount of safety stock, the ERP module must be set up to plan requirements effectively.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNowadays, one of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in factory planning is the consistent and coherent information processing along planning processes. Despite the current efforts in the fields of Virtual Production and Digital Factory, planning and simulation applications mostly support only analyses and optimizations of single planning aspects. To match nowadays challenges, planners require solutions that provide an integrated view on all data generated along planning processes to evaluate planning scenarios in advance and to achieve increasing production quality and efficiency. We have developed an essential solution by combining the ‘Condition Based Factory Planning’, a flexible planning approach which decomposes the process into standardized <b>planning</b> <b>modules,</b> and the ‘Virtual Production Intelligence’. This fusion creates a basis for the integration and analysis of data aggregated along production (planning) processes. The current information model provides factory planners to perform integrated analyses of process characteristics on the bases of module parameters to increase transparency of information flows. In this paper, the enhanced process of semantic information modelling is described to integrate precise planning values within a factory planning project from heterogeneous data sources and to provide a consistent information base within the planning system. Therefore, we define the relevant concepts of the domain and their interrelations in a formalized and explicit way. Furthermore, specific templates for the <b>planning</b> <b>modules</b> are developed to ensure the completeness and high data quality which are then mapped against the information model by means of semantic annotation and interpretation. This approach provides semantic interoperability of planning and simulation applications used in factory planning without the need to change their individual data models and structures. Thus, the business logic of the domain and the technical implementation of the planning system are decoupled which provides a generality of the business logic and a flexible adaption of <b>planning</b> <b>modules...</b>|$|R

Links back to ERP systems (after orders turned into optimal shipments), and sometimes secondarily to WMS programs also linked to ERP are also common.|$|E
