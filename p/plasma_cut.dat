The effect of the injection polarization on the mode conversion rate to EB waves at the extremely overdense regime has been investigated and an improvement in the plasma current is observed. ...|$|E
40|$|Welding is a multi-faceted {{procedure}} of manufacturing and can occur {{at any point}} during {{the creation of a}} product. Quality issues in welding can have disastrous, or even deadly, consequences. The issue of weld preparation angle is one of several different elements that have a direct correlation on the quality of a welded joint. The purpose of this research centers on resultant tensile strength of a single-vee butt joint in carbon steel with various preparation angles. Preparation angles were machined on twenty-six pieces of ASTM A 36 carbon steel in 5 ° increments in order to produce thirteen samples with included preparation angles ranging from 0 ° to 120 °. Test samples were developed using an automated welding process that remained consistent for all of the welds. Each sample was <b>plasma</b> <b>cut</b> into ten coupons, which were machined to have a uniform cross section of the welded joint and surrounding parent material using a computer numerically controlled machining center. This yielded a total population of 130 coupons, which were tested to failure using a United Testing Systems stress/strain tensile tester. The empirical data were analyzed via the use of SPSS 18 statistical software. Initially, the level of population variance was assessed within groups and between groups by use of a one-way ANOVA test at the. 05 alpha level. The result showed a statistically significant difference of the sample population. Secondly, a comparison of the data at various preparation angles to that of the industry standard angle of 60 ° was assessed using a Bonferroni multiple comparisons at the. 05 alpha level, which resulted in one angle being statistically significant compared to the industry standard.

However, this application requires efficient EBW coupling in the high-β, H-mode ST plasma regime. EBW emission (EBE) diagnostics and modelling have been employed on the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) to study oblique EBW to O-mode (B–X–O) coupling and propagation in H-mode plasmas. Efficient EBW coupling was measured before the L–H transition, but rapidly decayed thereafter. EBE simulations show that EBW collisional damping prior to mode conversion (MC) in the plasma scrape off reduces the coupling efficiency during the H-mode phase when the electron temperature is less than 30 eV inside the MC layer. Lithium evaporation during H-mode plasmas was successfully used to reduce this EBW collisional damping by reducing the electron density and increase the electron temperature in the plasma scrape off. Lithium conditioning increased the measured B–X–O coupling efficiency from less than 10 % to 60 %, consistent with EBE simulations...|$|R

Plasma arc cutting (PAC) is a widely used process for the cutting of different types of metals in several operating conditions. PAC is considered a challenging technology compared to its main competitors: oxy-fuel and laser cutting. Today, because of advances in equipment design and improvement in cut quality, previously unheard of applications, such as multiple torch cutting of mild steel, are becoming common place. The aim of the work is the optimization of PAC of mild steel thin plates, both in terms of cut quality and performances of the consumables, to achieve cut quality standards and productivity levels usually obtainable through laser cutting processes. The temperature of the plasma arc melts the metal and pierces through the work piece while the high velocity gas flow removes the molten material {{from the bottom of the}} cut.

A 30 A commercial plasma torch was investigated with a lens-type schlieren setup, a vertical knife edge and a microsecond-flash lamp synchronized with a video camera. In order to improve the image contrast, several different filters were used.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Raised plasma {{ferritin}} concentrations occur unexpectedly during iron {{studies done}} by primary care physicians. Plasma ferritin concentration has been {{positively associated with}} alcohol use among men. AIM: To determine the post-test probability that men in the community with raised plasma ferritin concentrations are hazardous drinkers. METHODS: The subjects were 152 men, randomly selected from a city's electoral roll. Nineteen (12. 5 (2. 7) %, mean (SEM)) admitted to drinking hazardously. The pretest probability of a man being a hazardous drinker was 0. 125. This was converted to pretest odds of 0. 14. The likelihood ratio (the ratio of the probability of obtaining a raised plasma ferritin concentration in a hazardous drinker (sensitivity) to the probability of obtaining a raised plasma ferritin concentration in a non-hazardous drinker (1 -specificity)) was calculated for different <b>plasma</b> ferritin <b>cut</b> off points. RESULTS: A plasma ferritin level of > 652 micrograms/l gave the largest likelihood ratio, 4. 16. Post-test odds were obtained by multiplying the pretest odds (0. 14) by the likelihood ratio (4. 16). A plasma ferritin level of > 652 micrograms/l had a post-test odds for a man being a hazardous drinker of 0. 58. This was converted to a post-test probability of 0. 37.

The main diagnostic tool {{that has been used}} is High Speed Imaging (HSI), often assisted by Schlieren imaging to analyse non-visible phenomena. Furthermore, starting from thermo-fluid-dynamic models developed by the University of Bologna group, such plasma processes have been studied also with new advanced models, focusing for instance on the interaction between a melting metal wire and a plasma, or considering non-equilibrium phenomena for diagnostics of plasma arcs. Additionally, the experimental diagnostic tools that have been developed for industrial thermal plasmas have been used also for the characterization of innovative low temperature atmospheric pressure non equilibrium plasmas, such as dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) and Plasma Jets. These sources are controlled by few kV voltage pulses with pulse rise time of few nanoseconds to avoid the formation of a plasma arc, with interesting applications in surface functionalization of thermosensitive materials. In order to investigate also bio-medical applications of thermal plasma, a self-developed quenching device has been connected to an ICP torch.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 1999 The {{simulation}} of <b>Plasma</b> Arc <b>Cutting</b> {{is presented in}} this study. The plasma arc cutting process employs a plasma torch with a very narrow bore to produce a transferred arc to the workpiece. A technique for modelling plasma arc cutting has been developed by applying the thermo-metallurgical model to the process and integrating a model of material removal to this model. The model is solved using the finite element method using the FE package SYSWORLD, more specifically SYSWELD. The objective {{is to determine the}} minimum energy required to cut a plate of some thickness using this virtual model. The characteristics of the cut need to exhibit the characteristics of a "high quality cut". The model presented can predict the kerf size given certain process variable settings. The numerical results obtained are assessed by conducting experiments. By maintaining Ill 1 rumum energy input cost savings can be made through energy savings, limiting additional finishing processes and reducing expense of shortening the electrode and nozzle lifetimes.

40|$|Abstract. In {{conventional}} aspect-ratio tokamaks, electron cyclotron (EC) waves {{can provide}} local heating and current drive. However, the high-β spherical tokamak (ST) <b>plasma</b> conditions <b>cut</b> off propagation of EC waves. The electron Bernstein wave (EBW) does not experience a density {{cut off and}} is strongly absorbed and emitted at the EC harmonics, allowing EBWCD {{to be used in}} STs for current profile control to increase global stability, as well as possible NTM suppression. A critical challenge is to establish and maintain efficient EBW coupling in these high-β, H-mode ST plasmas. EBW emission (EBE) diagnostics and EBE modelling have been employed on NSTX to study oblique EBW to O-mode (B-X-O) coupling and propagation. Initial EBE measurements in H-mode plasmas exhibited strong emission before the L-H transition, but the emission rapidly decayed after the transition. EBE simulations show that collisional damping of the EBW prior to mode conversion (MC) can significantly reduce the measured EBE for T e < 30 eV, explaining the observations. Lithium evaporation was used to reduce EBW collisional damping near the MC layer. The evaporation rate was increased from 0 to 19 mg/min to reduce the electron density and increase the electron temperature outside the last closed flux surface (LCFS) in an H-mode plasma. With edge conditioning, an increase in T e near the fundamental MC layer from 10 eV (no Li) to 20 eV (with Li) was observed. As a result the measured B-X-O transmission efficiency increased from < 10 % (no Li) to 60 % (with Li), consistent with EBE simulations. This work has significan...|$|R
