40|$|The common legal {{assumptions}} {{in regard}} to memory come most clearly to the surface in the rules governing <b>present</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>revived,</b> past recollection recorded, and cross-examination to impeach. Between the first two, sharp distinctions are drawn which result partly {{from the fact that}} a memorandum used to refresh recollection generally does not go to the jury as evi dence - whereas a memorandum of past recollection does - and partly from the psychological theories of the courts. Thus a federal judge lately remarked: 2 ̆ 2 It is one thing to awaken a slumbering recollection of an event, but quite another to use a memorandum of a recollection, fresh when it was correctly recorded, but presently beyond the power of the witness so to restore that it will exist apart from the record. In the former case it is quite immaterial by what means the memory is quickened; it may be a song, or a face, or a newspaper item, or a writing of some character. It is sufficient that by some mental operation, however mysterious, the memory is stimulated to recall the event, for when so set in motion it functions quite independently of the actuating cause. 2 ̆...|$|E

Lady Diana accepted me cordially and kindly as a daughter, and said all that was proper; but she actually forestalled us by desiring her son not {{to come out to}} her, for she thought it much better for Viola not to have painful <b>recollections</b> <b>revived,</b> and Viola herself wrote in a way that disappointed us--loving indeed, but with a strain of something between lightness and bitterness, and absolutely congratulating her brother that there was no one on my side to bring up bygones against him. One half of her letter was a mere guide-book to the Roman antiquities, and was broken off short for some carnival gaiety. Lord Erymanth clearly liked his letters as little as we did. In the abstract, in spite of the first cousinship, I am afraid he would rather have given Viola to Pigou St. Glear than to Harold Alison, but he had thought better of his niece than to think she could forget such a man so soon.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I employ {{critically}} {{the idea of}} urbicide to explore the reciprocity between geopolitical discourses and the changing materiality of cities experiencing conflict. In doing so, the paper problematises assumptions about cities newly replacing states as post-Cold war pivots of political violence. This critique operates through the example of Beirut, a city which endured conflict {{before the end of}} the Cold War and a city where the production of geopolitical meanings was multi-sited, as national, transnational and sub-national geopolitical discourses were renegotiated through the everyday urban spaces of war. Analysing the relationship between these discourses and the violence perpetrated by the militias amidst and against Beirut’s built fabric, the paper brings a fresh empirical focus on the understudied early phases of the Lebanese civil war (1975 – 1976) by reading contrapuntally a number of state-based geopolitical accounts of the time on Lebanon alongside oral, written and graphic representations produced by urban militias during combat as well as in <b>present</b> <b>recollections</b> by their former members. The paper argues that urbicide is a useful concept to interpret the links between political violence and physical urban space. However, urbicide should also be employed as a theoretical and methodological tool to investigate contextually specific and multi-sited geopolitical accounts between the national and the subnational rather than as a descriptive category exclusive to post-Cold War conflicts or alluding to abstract ideas of urbanity...|$|R

40|$|Master of EducationEducational {{change in}} Victoria was {{characterized}} by a generality of orientation which meant {{that it was not}} restricted by any particular struggle or strategy but pursued its principles in a great variety of areas. Indeed, one of these areas was in the push for teacher autonomy and professionalism and in the re-training of teachers. During the early 1970 s, La Trobe University launched a new Bachelor of Education 'Task Force' course designed to retrain the practicing secondary teacher to the task of innovating in inner urban schools. As {{a major part of the}} education course, teacher-students 2 trained within the secondary school. After calling for interested schools, Collingwood, a working-class 3 high school in the inner city, responded to La Trobe's advertisement. A unique partnership was formed. The innovations brought about by collaborations between the high school and the university centered on finding a suitable educational environment for working-class migrant and native Australian students. One of these led to the development of Collingwood Community School. This thesis explores the early life and development of the school, whilst simultaneously attempting to classify it. Importantly, the thesis is an attempt to provide a vehicle for <b>presenting</b> the <b>recollections</b> of former teachers, and particularly, former students. Giving a voice to the latter group is important as the 'personal evaluations of those working on the project' were documented in 1973. It is time to <b>present</b> the personal <b>recollections</b> of some of those `in the middle' of the project, that is, the individuals the 'project' was apportioned to. The 'school' began as a research project or tool. Whilst some students benefited from a therapeutic, social curriculum, the school was prone to chaotic, ad hoc practices largely due to poorly thought out and conflicting philosophical positions of staff members, insufficient resources (including teachers) and the adoption of a liberal curriculum for working-class students who were generally unacquainted with liberal theory.
