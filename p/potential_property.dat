25|$|Unlike {{in other}} states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, {{natural gas and}} oil {{pipelines}} are exempted from property taxes. Landowners in Blackhawk School District are {{the target of a}} proposed major pipeline. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100 foot wide right-of-way, thereby limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future <b>potential</b> <b>property</b> tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. Blackhawk School District is adversely impacted this way by major transmission pipeline development.|$|E
25|$|Property {{tax rates}} in 2016-17 were {{set by the}} school board at 51.4469 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's {{assessed}} value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account {{for the vast majority}} (between 75–85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. A new major transmission gas pipeline is being installed in the District called the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100 foot wide right-of-way, there by limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future <b>potential</b> <b>property</b> tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. Benton Area School District is adversely impacted in this way.|$|E
500|$|Gebhard {{was born}} in the Fürstenburg {{fortress}} of Heiligenberg, the second son of William, known as the younger, (6March 1518 – 17January 1566), Freiherr and Seneschal of Waldburg and an Imperial Councilor, and his wife, Johanna v. Fürstenberg [...] (1529–1589). His family was an old Swabian house and he was descended from the Jacobin line of the House: Jakob I Truchseß von Waldburg, also known as the Golden Knight (for his blond hair). The family owned extensive properties that bordered on the Abbey of Kempten and various Habsburg territories in present-day southwestern Bavaria; In 1429 and 1463, the three surviving sons of Johann II, Jakob, Everhard, and George, and their surviving sister Ursula, concluded a covenant of inheritance to protect the family property. In the future, they would occupy and own the property as one; the inheritance of the daughters could not exceed 4000 gulden. They guaranteed each other the right of first refusal on <b>potential</b> <b>property</b> sales.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Sustainable {{development}} support, {{balanced scorecard}} development and business process modeling {{are viewed from}} the position of systemology. Extensional, intentional and <b>potential</b> <b>properties</b> of a system are considered as necessary to satisfy functional requirements of a meta-system. The correspondence between extensional, intentional and <b>potential</b> <b>properties</b> of a system and sustainable, unsustainable, crisis and catastrophic states of a system is determined. The inaccessibility cause of the system mission is uncovered. The correspondence between extensional, intentional and <b>potential</b> <b>properties</b> of a system and balanced scorecard perspectives is showed. The IDEF 0 function modeling method is checked against balanced scorecard perspectives. The correspondence between balanced scorecard perspectives and IDEF 0 notations is considered...|$|R
