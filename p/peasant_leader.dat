5|$|Tanyus Shahin Saadeh al-Rayfouni (also spelled Tanios Chahine Saadé Al Rayfouné, {{given name}} also spelled Taniyus or Tanius) (1815–1895) was a Maronite muleteer and <b>peasant</b> <b>leader</b> from Mount Lebanon. He led a peasants' revolt {{in the area}} of Keserwan in 1859, during which he drove out the area's Maronite nobility, the feudal Khazen lords, and {{declared}} a peasants' republic. While he had a reputation as a ruffian and provocateur among members of the Maronite clergy and European consuls, Shahin became a popular figure among Christian commoners, many of whom considered him the guardian of their interests, a view which Shahin promoted.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} view remained ambivalent at best, though. A scene {{devoted to}} the peasant war of 1653 in a theatre production for the Swiss sexacentennial celebrations in 1891, for instance, was cut on {{the demands of the}} organizers. The first statues to honor the peasants of 1653 and their leaders were erected in 1903 {{on the occasion of the}} 250th anniversary of the peasant war. A monument honoring Schybi and Emmenegger was unveiled at Escholzmatt on July 26, 1903, at Rüderswil, a statue in honor of Leuenberger was erected the same year, and at Liestal an obelisk honoring the peasant victims of the war was inaugurated on September 25, 1904. More statues and plaques were installed in various other places at the tricentennial of the war in 1953, for instance a relief showing Schybi in a chapel at Sursee, where the <b>peasant</b> <b>leader</b> had been incarcerated.|$|E

The peasant armies retreated. The Tagsatzung, the federal council of the Old Swiss Confederacy, then sent an army from Zürich to definitely end the rebellion, and after the Battle of Wohlenschwil, the Huttwil League was forcibly annulled in the peace of Mellingen. The last resistance in the Entlebuch valley was broken {{by the end of}} June. After their victory, the city authorities took drastic punitive measures. The Huttwil League and the peace of the Murifeld were declared null and void by the city council of Bern. Many exponents of the insurrection were captured, tortured, and finally received heavy sentences. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered in Bern on September 6, 1653.|$|E

25|$|The Great Revolt {{began in}} the year 66 CE, {{originating}} in Roman and Jewish ethnic and religious tensions. The crisis escalated due to anti-taxation protests and attacks upon Roman citizens. The Roman governor, Gessius Florus, responded by plundering the Jewish Temple, claiming the money was for the Emperor, {{and the next day}} launching a raid on the city, arresting numerous senior Jewish figures. This prompted a wider, large-scale rebellion and the Roman military garrison of Judaea was quickly overrun by the rebels, while the pro-Roman king Herod Agrippa II, together with Roman officials, fled Jerusalem. As it became clear the rebellion was getting out of control, Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, brought in the Syrian army, based on Legion XII Fulminata and reinforced by auxiliary troops, to restore order and quell the revolt. Despite initial advances and conquest of Jaffa, the Syrian Legion was ambushed and defeated by Jewish rebels at the Battle of Beth Horon with 6,000 Romans massacred and the Legion's aquila lost. During 66, Judean Free Government was formed in Jerusalem including former High Priest Ananus ben Ananus, Joseph ben Gurion and Joshua ben Gamla elected as leaders. Yosef ben Matityahu was appointed the rebel commander in Galilee and Eleazar ben Hanania as the commander in Edom. Later, in Jerusalem, an attempt by Menahem ben Yehuda, leader of the Sicarii, {{to take control of the}} city failed. He was executed and the remaining Sicarii were ejected from the city. Simon bar Giora, a charismatic, but radical <b>peasant</b> <b>leader,</b> was also expelled by the new government.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of his college years, Chávez and various {{associates}} developed a left-nationalist doctrine that they dubbed [...] "Bolivarianism". Although drawn heavily from Simón Bolívar's ideals, this philosophy was also influenced by the writings of Marxist historian Federico Brito Figueroa. Other contributions came via the philosophies of Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, Fidel Castro, Salvador Allende, and Che Guevara—all representative of the South American breed of socialism and communism. Nevertheless, Simón Bolívar, Simón Rodríguez (Bolívar's tutor and companion), and Ezequiel Zamora (a <b>peasant</b> <b>leader</b> who warred in support of the landless poor) held central importance for Chávez. Together, these influences were key in the formation of his political philosophy and style of governance.|$|E
2500|$|Most sources {{agree that}} the Austrians {{encouraged}} the peasants to revolt. A number of sources point to {{the actions of the}} Austrian Tarnów administration, in particular an official identified as the District Officer of Tarnów, Johann Breindl von Wallerstein. Wallerstein reached out to <b>peasant</b> <b>leader</b> Jakub Szela. Serfs were promised the end of their feudal duties if they helped to put down the insurgent Polish noblemen, and were also paid in money and salt for the heads of nobles. Hahn notes [...] "it is generally accepted as proven that the Austrian authorities deliberately exploited peasant dissatisfaction in order to suppress then national uprising." [...] Magosci et al. write that [...] "most contemporaries condemned the Austrian authorities for their perfidious use of the peasantry for counter-revolutionary aims." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a revolutionary}} <b>peasant</b> <b>leader</b> Makhno {{has been called}} a [...] "colourful personality" [...] and his career [...] "legendary". [...] However, the German and Mennonite {{communities}} in Ukraine considered him to be an instigator of paramilitary banditry against innocent farmers, and an [...] "inhuman monster whose path is literally drenched with blood." [...] He is consistently referred to as a terrorist or bandit in Mennonite literature. At the age of 11 Makhno began working as an ox driver on the Janzen estate in Silberfeld. Here he began to develop a hatred for the ruling classes. In his memoirs he writes: [...] "At this time I began to experience anger, envy and even hatred towards the landowner [...] and especially towards his children – those young slackers who often strolled past me sleek and healthy, well-dressed, well-groomed and scented; while I was filthy, dressed in rags, barefoot, and reeked of manure from cleaning the calves' barn."

2500|$|In November 1940, the Legionary {{journalist}} Ovid Țopa, publishing in the Guard's newspaper Buna Vestire, {{claimed that}} Codreanu stood alongside the mythical Dacian prophet and [...] "precursor of Christ" [...] Zalmoxis, the 15th century Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, and Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu, {{as an essential}} figure of Romanian history and Romanian spirituality. Other Legionary texts of the time drew a similar parallel between Codreanu, Eminescu, and the 18th century Transylvanian Romanian <b>peasant</b> <b>leader</b> Horea. Thus, in 1937, sociologist Ernest Bernea had authored Cartea căpitanilor ("The Book of Captains"), where the preferred comparison was between Codreanu, Horea, and Horea's 19th century counterparts Tudor Vladimirescu and Avram Iancu. Also in November 1940, Codreanu {{was the subject of}} a conference given by the young philosopher Emil Cioran and aired by the state-owned Romanian Radio, in which Cioran notably praised the Guard's leader for [...] "having given Romania a purpose".

2500|$|This system {{failed to}} keep order when the peasants of Keserwan, {{overburdened}} by heavy taxes, rebelled against the feudal practices that prevailed in [...] Lebanon. In 1858 Tanyus Shahin, a Maronite Christian <b>peasant</b> <b>leader,</b> demanded that the feudal class abolish its privileges. The demand refused, the peasants began {{to prepare for a}} revolt. In January 1859, an armed uprising headed by Shahin flared up. The uprising targeted the Maronite Khazen muqata'jis (feudal lords) of Keserwan, pillaging their land and burning their homes. Having driven the Maronite feudal lords out of Keserwan and seizing their land and property, the insurgent peasants set up their own rule. The Keserwan uprising, as it became known, had a revolutionary effect on other regions in Lebanon. The disturbances spread to Latakia and to central Lebanon. Maronite peasants, actively supported by their clergy, began to prepare for an armed uprising against their Druze masters. [...] In turn, the Druze lords, who had been hesitant to confront the growing assertiveness of Maronite peasantry due to an awareness of the military imbalance in the Maronites' favor, began to arm the Druze irregulars.|$|E
