40|$|<b>Prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> {{nuts are}} an {{extremely}} popular method of providing resistance to vibration-induced self-loosening of fasteners. Such nuts have a self-contained <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> feature {{that provides a}} degree of resistance to rotation. Although such nuts are frequently used, it is not widely realized that they can occasionally come completely detached from bolts. The mechanism by which this can occur has hitherto been unidentified since {{it has not been}} possible to replicate detachment under laboratory testing. This article identifies a general condition that can result in the complete loosening and detachment of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> <b>type</b> nuts. This mechanism involves the application of an axial load when transverse joint slip is occurring. This article describes a modified Junker test machine that allows the application of axial loading to a joint while experiencing transverse displacement. Tests have been completed using an intermittent as well as a constant axial load. Loading in both modes has been demonstrated to result in the complete detachment of this nut type. Based on this investigation, if the magnitude of the axial loading exceeds the residual preload in the bolt retained from sustaining transverse movement alone, the all-metal <b>type</b> of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> nut can completely detach. Applications that involve shear and axial loading being simultaneously applied to a joint are numerous in engineering...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} tests {{to assess the}} use of anaerobic adhesive for providing a <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature in threaded fasteners. Test procedures are developed and tests are performed on three fastener materials, four anaerobic adhesives, and both unseated assembly conditions. Five to ten samples are tested for each combination. Tests for initial use, reuse without additional adhesive, and reuse with additional adhesive are performed for all samples. A 48 -hour cure time was used for all initial use and reuse tests. Test data are presented as removal torque versus removal angle with the specification required <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> range added for performance assessment. Percent specification pass rates for the all combinations of fastener material, adhesive, and assembly condition are tabulated and reveal use of anaerobic adhesive as a <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature is viable.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine if anaerobic adhesive {{can be used as a}} <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature. Maintaining preload in critical joints is the usual standard that anaerobic adhesives are held to in aerospace and other industry. To test if anaerobic adhesive can be used as a <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature a test procedure was developed and implemented to measure the removal torque of threaded fasteners after an allotted cure time. In total, 191 threaded fasteners of different material and coatings were tested in the unseated and seated states with various strengths and varieties of anaerobic adhesive. A series of three tests were conducted: initial use, reuse with no added anaerobic adhesive, and a third test with added product to the bolt and nut to see how removal torque would behave in these conditions. It was found that using anaerobic adhesive as a <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature is viable in many cases. No published work to date analyzes anaerobic adhesive at the standard of a <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature...|$|R
40|$|Practically every {{engineering}} {{product with}} {{any degree of}} complexity uses threaded fasteners. Although threaded fasteners are generally considered a mature technology, significant problems exist with their use. This study has investigated a number of issues with the tightening and self-loosening of threaded fasteners. - It was found that upon repeated tightening of electro-zinc plated fastners significant wear of the contact surfaces of the bolt/nut thread and nut face occured. This wear was accompanied by an increase in the friction coefficient causing a reduction in the clamp force provided for an assembly when tightened to a specific torque value. - The self-loosening characteristics of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> nuts were also investigated. It was found that there was a significant loss of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> when a fastner self-loosened when compared to the <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> when being deliberately disassembled. The current standard test for <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> nuts on re-use does not reflect this surprising result and leads to a significant over-estimate of the capability of this class of nut to resist self-loosening. This is a contribution to knowledge on this topic. - A further major original finding of this study has been that if an axial load is also acting on a joint which is experiencing transverse slip, <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> nuts can continue to self-loosen leading to their possible detachment from bolts. A number of accidents have been caused by such detachments, but the cause was not understood partly because this detachment could not be reproduced on the standard loosening test. Work reported in this thesis has been found that if an external axial load is acting whilst the joint is experiencing transverse slip, under the approprioate conditions, the loosening process will continue until nut detachment occurs. - A series of tests has been completed in which the forces needed to tighten and loosen threaded fastners were measured whilst the joint was being subjected to transverse slip/vibration. Measurements were made of the frictional resistance forces in the circumfrential direction and the loosening torque acting on a fastner under transverse slip conditions. It was found that the loosening torque range varied between two positive limits rather than between zero and an upper limit as anticipated by the theory. It was also found that the friction coefficient in the circumfrential direction in the threads is greated than that on the nut face bearing surface during conditions of transverse slip...|$|R

40|$|In {{aerospace}} design, where minimizing {{weight is}} always a priority, achieving the full capacity from fasteners is essential. To do so, the initial bolt preload must be maximized. The benefits of high preload are well documented and include improved fatigue resistance, a stiffer joint, and resistance to loosening. But many factors like elastic interactions and embedment tend to lower the initial preload placed on the bolt. These factors provide additional motivation to maximize the initial preload. But, to maximize bolt preload, you must determine what torque to apply. Determining this torque is greatly complicated by the large preload scatter generally seen with torque control. This paper presents a detailed methodology for generating limit torques for threaded fasteners. This methodology accounts for the large scatter in preload found with torque control, and therefore, addresses the statistical nature of the problem. It also addresses <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque,</b> a feature common in aerospace fasteners. Although <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> provides a desired locking feature, it can also increase preload scatter. In addition, it can {{limit the amount of}} preload that can be generated due to the torsion it creates in the bolt. This paper discusses the complications of <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> and how best to handle it. A wide range of torque-tension bolt testing was conducted in support of this research. The results from this research will benefit the design engineer as well as analyst involved in the design of bolted joints, leading to better, more optimized structural designs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods to}} statistically quantify data from fastener vibration life tests. Data from fastener vibration life tests with secondary locking features of threaded inserts is used. Threaded inserts {{in three different}} configurations are examined: no locking feature, <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> locking feature, and adhesive locking feature. Useful composite plots were developed by extracting minimum preloads versus cycles from test data. Minimum preloads were extracted due to the overlapping of varying test data and because the minimum preload is of most interest in such tests. In addition to composite plots, descriptive statistics of the samples were determined including mean, median, quartiles, and extents. These descriptive statistics were plotted to illustrate variability within a sample as well as variability between samples. These plots also reveal that characteristics of loosening for a sample, such as preload loss and rates of preload loss, are preserved when summarizing such tests. Usually fastener vibration life tests are presented and compared with one test sample, which is why statistically quantifying them is needed and important. Methods to predict the sample population have been created as well. To predict populations, tests to determine {{the distribution of the}} sample, such as probability plots and probability plot correlation coefficient, have been conducted. Once samples were determined to be normal, confidence intervals were created for test samples, which provides a range of where the population mean should lie. It has been shown that characteristics of loosening are preserved in the confidence intervals. Populations of fastener vibration life tests have never before been presented or created. The evaluation of loosening has been conducted for fastener vibration life tests in the past with plots of one test sample; however, in this work statistically quantified results of multiple tests were used. This is important because evaluating loosening with more than one test sample can determine variation between tests. It has been found that secondary locking features do help reduce the loss of preload. The <b>prevailing</b> <b>torque</b> secondary locking feature is found to be more effective as preload is lost.

Electrical stimulation then drives the knee back to full extension, as well as restores the spring potential energy. In this paper, genetic algorithm (GA) and its variant multi-objective GA (MOGA) is used to perform the search operation for the ‘best’ spring parameters for the SBO spring mounted on an average sized subject simulated in the sagittal plane. Conventional torsion spring is tested against constant <b>torque</b> <b>type</b> spring in terms of swing duration as, based on first principles, it is hypothesized that constant torque spring would be able to produce slower SBO swing phase as might be preferred in assisted paraplegic gait. In line with the hypothesis, it is found that it is not possible to delay the occurrence of the flexion peak of the SBO swing phase further than its occurrence in the natural gait. The use of conventional torsion spring causes the swing knee flexion peak to appear rather faster than that of the natural gait, resulting in a potentially faster swing phase and hence gait cycle.
