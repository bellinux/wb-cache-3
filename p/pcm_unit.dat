This HVAC system consists of an air-based photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) collector and a phase change material (PCM) thermal storage unit integrated with a reverse cycle heat pump, in a ducted system. The system was designed for operation during both winter and summer using daytime solar radiation and night-time sky radiative cooling, respectively. The PVT collector heats or cools fresh air from ambient and thereby provides heating or cooling either directly to the indoor space, or to the PCM storage unit. The heat stored in the PCM can be used later to condition the space or precondition the air entering the air handling unit. Analytical models for the PVT collector and <b>PCM</b> <b>unit</b> were developed in order to be easily implemented into a practical building management system (BMS).

40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} paper thermal performance of an air-phase change material (<b>PCM)</b> <b>unit</b> has been experimentally studied. The influences of the air inlet temperatures and velocities have been investigated on the charging/discharging time of the PCM panels, heating/cooling load and effectiveness over the phase transition. These parameters play a vital on determining thermal performance of an air-PCM unit. Air inlet temperatures of 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C and air inlet velocities of 0. 6 m/s, 1. 6 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. have been studied. The increase of the air inlet velocity reduced the charging and discharging time, however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0. 6 m/s to 1. 6 m/s. The air inlet temperature has been proved to be most important factor affecting the discharging time. For lower air inlet velocity the cooling and heating loads achieve lower values but remain nearly constant {{over a longer period}} of time. The effectiveness reaches its highest values for the air inlet velocity of 0. 6 m/s for the charging and discharging processes. It has been concluded that discharging time can be extended by reducing the air inlet velocity and making the technology more suitable for heating and cooling applications for the buildings. A simplified methodology is proposed for the analysis of the PCM charging and discharging process through the identification of the critical points as result of the heat transfer behaviour in the air- <b>PCM</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E

30|$|Exergy analysis, {{based on}} second law of {{thermodynamics}} {{is an attractive}} way of evaluating the performance of thermal systems, {{especially when it comes}} to optimization [8]. Exergy analysis has been successfully carried out by many researchers for LHTS systems of different applications [9, 10, 11]. These studies have proved that the exergy analysis only can provide useful information on valuable energy during charging and discharging processes. When a heat transfer enhancement technique is employed for a LHTS system, the comparison between the systems in terms of exergy performance is more useful. This is because the design of LHTS systems musters a compromise between heat transfer rate, quantity and quality of stored/recovered energy [12].

The objective was to evaluate the impact of thermal energy storage systems in dwellings under Mexican climatic conditions. In {{the first part of this}} work thermal behaviors of adobe traditional architecture is discussed; in the second part a latent heat storage system using phase change materials (PCMs) is proposed and assessed. The high thermal mass structural elements of adobe traditional architecture have been charactefted as heat wave modulators. Nevertheless, the moisture content in these structures also plays a significant role {{as a means}} for heat storage and potentially enhancing thermal lag. The objective of this part of the study was to assess the scope of existing coupled heat and mass transport models regarding water contained latent heat storage on porous structures. The significant contribution of latent heat storage recognized in adobe structures, led to the study of a solar-thermal storage system using (PCMs). The objective of this part of the study was twofold: 1) Enhance the existing computational models on the Stephan problem by considering the effect of regional variations (weather conditions imposed) on the boundary conditions. 2) Evaluate the impact of the solar-thermal system proposed when applied in dwellings in view of regional variations under Mexican weather conditions. Solar-thermal storage systems independent of the structure offer the possibility to be applied to existing buildings as well as new constructions. The proposal is a storage element that constitutes internal blinds in windows. The computational model of the Stephan problem was solved with the enthalpy method. Simulations were run under different sets of climatic conditions. For the first time the main factors for promoting system's optimisation, when gathered in a single comparison study, provided a more general insight on system's performance. Experimental work was also carried out regarding the charging of the heat storage unit by heat gains other than direct radiation, and the storage unit's performance as insulator. A large-scale solar simulator was constructed. Statistical analysis of experimental results showed interesting findings including: The important role that internal heat gains play on the charging of the latent heat storage unit proposed. A larger effect on the discharging ratio was found with lower air temperatures than with faster air flow rates. The faster discharging rate tests also released slightly more energy. PCM volume was found to be the most critical factor on system performance. The importance of providing the means to discharge the total quantity of heat stored was pointed out. For the cooling mode, elements to enhance discharging might be required. For system control, thermal insulation was found to be an effective measure when the discharging is required to occur over a longer period. The multiple <b>PCM</b> <b>unit</b> was found to be more efficient during the charging process (storing more energy) than units containing a single PCM.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate heat storage in a heat storage unit utilizing a phase change material (PCM). This included finding an optimal geometry for heat transfer from the heat storage unit to the surroundings, finding an effective thermal conductivity of the PCM, and combine these in an overall PCM heat storage model. The advantage of using a PCM is that the PCM can store large amounts of heat in liquid phase as latent heat. This will contribute to a stable heat release to the surroundings. Methods for enhancing the heat transfer from a <b>PCM</b> heat storage <b>unit</b> to the surroundings were studied. The research considered both free convection and radiation heat transfer. Further objectives were to find a suitable geometry of fins for heat rejection to the surroundings. Heat transfer from two different fin arrangements to the surroundings were investigated, a fin array and fin channels. The dimensions of the geometries were optimized. Both geometries showed satisfying results, but {{it was concluded that}} fin channels were preferable to a fin array. A heat storage unit was investigated experimentally. The experiments considered two different setups, supplying heat to the heat storage units top surface, and supplying heat to the bottom surface. The results were compared to results from numerical simulations. The heat storage unit heated from the top surface showed good agreement compared to results from numerical simulations. The heat storage unit heated from below proved that heat transfer by free convection in the liquid phase {{had a significant impact on}} the melting pace of the PCM. The comparison with results from numerical simulations did however not show an immediate agreement. The effective thermal conductivity of the PCM was found based on the experiments and compared to literature values. An uncertainty analysis was performed on the obtained effective conductivity. The results showed that the method employed for studying the effective conductivity was inaccurate. An overall heat storage model was developed to combine heat supply, heat storage and heat distribution. The simulations were performed using PCM as well as PCM with aluminium foam to enhance the heat distribution in the heat storage unit and the heat transfer rate to the surroundings.

The thermo-physical properties of composites were experimentally obtained using Temperature-History technique. Numerical model was developed to explore the heat transfer characteristics of composites during both charging and discharging modes. The numerical model also features a transport equation for particle flux. The commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, FLUENT, was employed to solve the enthalpy-based two dimensional transient equations. In addition, exergy models were developed to demonstrate the effect of particle dispersion on exergy performance of LHTS systems. The thermal behavior and exergy performance in terms of exergy efficiency and total exergy stored of particle-dispersed PCM units are compared with those of pure <b>PCM</b> <b>unit</b> and nanoparticles composites. The heat transfer performance of PCM is significantly high throughout the discharging when microparticles are added. However, the enhancement could be observed only during the earlier stages of charging as particles are found to be hampering natural convection in the liquid PCM. When it comes to exergy performance, particles help in increasing the exergy efficiency of pure PCM system only when the natural convection is weak during charging. Also, the exergy recovered from composites is higher as compared to that of pure PCM and it is found that particles addition results in reduced storage capacity in terms of exergy.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} use solar {{radiation}} as thermal energy source, heat storage equipments result necessary in each application where continuous supply is required, {{because of the}} natural unsteady intensity of radiation during the day. Thermal solar collectors are especially suitable for low temperature applications, since their efficiency decreases when an high inlet temperature of fluid flowing through them is established. On the other hand, low temperatures and low temperature gaps, above all, make very difficult to use traditional sensible heat storing units (water tanks), because of the very large amounts of material required. In this work, a traditional sensible heat storage system is compared with a latent heat storing unit based on phase change materials (PCMs). As a case study, a 840 m 3 greenhouse heating application was considered with an inside constant temperature of 18 °C. It {{is thought to be}} heated by using single layer plate thermal solar collectors as energy source. Inlet temperature of the collectors fluid (HTF) was fixed at 35 °C (little higher than melting temperature of PCMs) and a constant flux of 12 l/m 2 hour was established as technical usual value. At these conditions, 215 m 2 solar panels exposed surface resulted necessary. The sensible heat storage system considered here is a traditional water tank storing unit equipped with two pipe coils, respectively for heat exchanges with HTF from collectors and water flux for greenhouse heating. Available DT for heat exchange is estimated as the difference of minimum HTF temperature (in outlet from the collectors) and the required water temperature for greenhouse heating. The latent heat storing unit is instead a series of copper rectangular plate shells which a phase change material is filled in (Na 2 SO 4 ⋅ 10 H 2 O). Heat transfer fluids flow through thin channels between adjacent plates, so that a large heat exchange available surface is achieved. The developed computational model (Labview software) permits to superimpose heat exchanges daily curves between heat storing materials and heat transport fluids (for both of the fluids and the heat storing equipments) on the energy supply/demand ones, respectively calculated on the basis of greenhouse energy demand and solar collectors dimensions, characteristics and efficiency. In this manner, units design is achieved by changing thermal energy storing units dimensions, in order that the corresponding heat exchange curves coincide with the previously calculated ones. Successively, among all the possible configurations, the ones showing lower units volumes and less amount of storing materials are chosen as the optimal design solutions. It has been proven that PCMs materials are much more suitable for low temperature applications than sensible heat storing materials (water). In the case of water tank, an about 15. 8 m 3 total volume is required while for PCMs equipment the total volume of storing unit is reduced to about 2. 2 m 3, such as about seven times total volume less.

Furthermore, IESU software module has been developed to simulate a novel cooling unit using Phase Change Material (<b>PCM).</b> This <b>unit</b> is named as Indirect Evaporative and Storage Unit (IESU). Thereafter, complete economic equations for the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) criterion have been formulated. Furthermore this criterion has been optimized for different variables as a function of thermal parameters and economic figures from local markets. An optimum design of both residential buildings and energy systems has great impact on energy consumption. In fact, results showed that the energy consumption is reduced by 85. 62 %, 86. 33 % and 74. 05 % in Berlin, Amman and Aqaba, respectively. Moreover, the LCC criterion is reduced by 41. 85 % in Berlin, 19. 21 % in Amman and 15. 22 % in Aqaba. The macro economic analysis shows that once this research is applied in one million typical residential buildings in the selected climate zones, the annual avoided CO 2 emissions are estimated to be about 5. 7 million Tons in Berlin. In Aqaba, around	 2. 96 million Tons CO 2 emissions will be saved annually and in Amman about 2. 98 million Tons will be reduced. The payback period from the achieved saving is 18 years,	 11 years and 8. 6 years in Amman, Aqaba and Berlin, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Although polymer-modified {{cement mortar}} (PCM) has been {{extensively}} used as finishing and repairing material, {{it is necessary to}} understand its combustion properties and mechanical properties at high temperature. This study evaluated the combustion characteristics with varying experimental parameters such as polymer type, unit polymer content, polymer-cement ratio, and thickness of the specimen. This study also evaluated the compressive strength and elastic modulus of PCMs with focus on the effects of the type of polymer, unit polymer content, and polymer-cement ratio. As a result, the incombustibility of the PCM was in the following order: SBR < VVA < EVA. After heating end, the mass loss rate of the PCM was less than 30 %, regardless of the polymer type, unit polymer content, and W/C. In heat release rate test, the higher the unit polymer content, the greater the total heat release, regardless of the difference in W/C. The PAE series showed excellent fire resistance in the temperature range of 200 ~ 400 °C. <b>PCMs</b> with a <b>unit</b> polymer content of 5 %, modified with EVA and PAE, showed outstanding compressive strength at 200 ~ 400 °C. At elevated temperature, the modulus of elasticity of PCM declined with an increase in the unit polymer content, regardless of the polymer type...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been several {{experimental}} and numerical researches on transparent envelope components that integrate phase change materials (PCMs). To address some of the drawbacks of these systems, new prototypes were created and their summer performance was monitored under Cfa climatic conditions (Turin, Italy). The proposed glazing system comprises a triple glazing unit with a thermotropic layer placed on the outer side, acting as a switchable shading system capable of regulating the phase transition of the PCM. The PCM is tested in both the inner and the outer cavity of the glazing, alternately. In this paper, the summer performance of these responsive glazing systems is reported, complementing the assessment of their performance under winter conditions, which was previously presented in another paper (Bianco et al., 2017). Two additional systems were also tested in parallel for reference purposes: a triple glazing unit with a thermotropic layer only, and a reference triple glazing unit. Direct solar transmission was assessed, and the correlation between glazing temperature and solar transmission coefficient of the thermotropic layer, when coupled with the triple glazing unit, was derived. The solar transmission {{as a function of the}} external surface temperature of the <b>PCM</b> glazing <b>units</b> was also evaluated. The energy performance was assessed by means of a long-term evaluation in addition to daily analyses during cloudy and sunny days. The capability of the aforementioned technologies to improve indoor thermal comfort was investigated, with the effect of the transmitted solar radiation impinging on the occupants also taken into account. The results highlight that the integration of a thermotropic layer in a triple glazing unit allows the cooling load through the transparent component to be reduced by one third when compared to a traditional triple glazing unit. The overall energy performance was found to be primarily affected by the position of the PCM; not only during winter season, but especially in summer, the PCM completed the phase transition only when placed in the outermost cavity. The thermal comfort conditions were improved, when evaluated in terms of traditional PMV, regardless of the position of the PCM layer. However, when the influence of the direct solar radiation impinging on the occupants was taken into account, the solution with the PCM layer located in the inner cavity presented a better performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} performance of a Hybrid Model Predictive Control (HMPC) system implemented to control a novel solar-assisted HVAC system servicing the Team UOW Solar Decathlon house, the overall winner of the Solar Decathlon China 2013 competition. This HVAC system consists of an air-based photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collector and a phase change material (PCM) thermal store integrated with a conventional ducted reverse-cycle heat pump system. The system was designed for operation during both winter and summer, using daytime solar radiation and night sky radiative cooling to increase the energy efficiency of the air-conditioning system. The PVT collector can exchange heat with the <b>PCM</b> thermal storage <b>unit,</b> and the stored heat can be used to condition the space or precondition the air entering the air handling unit (AHU). The HMPC controller includes two levels of control, where the high-level controller has a 24 -hour prediction horizon and a 1 -hour control step is used to select the operating mode of the HVAC system. Low-level controllers for each HVAC operational mode have a 1 –hour prediction horizon and a 5 –minute control step, and are used to track the trajectory defined by the high-level controller and to optimize the operating mode selected. The results from this preliminary experimental work have demonstrated the value of the HMPC approach in optimally controlling the solar-assisted HVAC system in the Solar Decathlon house. Results show that the HMPC controller successfully selected the appropriate operating mode to achieve multiple objectives, including: maintenance of indoor comfort conditions within a defined, and potentially variable, thermal comfort band; and optimization of the overall energy efficiency of the system using all available on-site energy resources...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{feasibility}} of a phase change material (<b>PCM)</b> thermal storage <b>unit</b> is determined, and the design is then optimized to minimize {{the time it takes}} for the PCM to completely melt. The PCM provides a large energy density due to its characteristically large heat of fusion, but has a low thermal conductivity, leading to slow transient responses. Thus, a heatsink is employed to increase the melt rate. The heatsink is analyzed using three different methods to determine which method provides the best results in the least amount of time. First, SolidWorks’ simulation tool with a variable specific heat model is used to perform a thermal finite-element analysis (FEA); second, Fluent is used to perform a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis with the Boussinesq approximation; third, Fluent is used to perform a CFD analysis accounting for the variable specific heat of PCM. The results are compared and used to suggest an analysis technique when working with PCM, as well as the dimensions of a heatsink to be used in thermal storage applications with PCM. A sample solar thermal system is then presented, utilizing the heatsink that was developed. Ultimately, the Fluent CFD analysis, taking into account the variable density of the PCM, was found to provide the best results, but took on average 2. 5 days of computational time to solve. The SolidWorks FEA model was found to provide accurate results for conduction dominated cases with the simulation solving in under 30 minutes. It is found that a variable specific heat finite-element model can quickly provide accurate results when analyzing a conduction dominated melting process...|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} Phase Change Material (PCM) thermal investigation {{methods have}} significant drawbacks and limitations {{in terms of}} the correct determination of phase change temperature and enthalpy values. It results in the inaccuracy and sometimes absence of experimental data which are required for the implementation of PCM based Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems. An advanced T-history method for PCM characterisation was developed to overcome some of the shortcomings of the existing PCM thermal investigation procedures. The advanced T-history setup and the instrumentation system coupled with the LabView virtual instrument, which allows the continuous acquisition of T-history signals, were carefully designed, developed and evaluated. The development process was performed by sequentially addressing all the issues relating to the control and sensing mechanisms of the T-history setup, measurement accuracy and precision, PCM data representation, hysteresis, and finally subcooling. The instrumentation system was iteratively redeveloped and validated in a series of studies until the ± 0. 5 °C accuracy in PCM related measurements was achieved. Once the desired temperature accuracy was reached the data evaluation technique was implemented in MATLAB to allow the determination of thermo-physical PCM properties from the measured T-history data. Furthermore, detailed studies of PCMs from the RT and PT organic series were performed. These comprehensive PCM investigations revealed various results including the details regarding the materials’ behaviour upon both cooling and heating, the heat release/storage in given 0. 5 °C wide temperature intervals, the respective enthalpy-temperature curves, and the total heat released/stored with respect to mass and volume. The comparison of the RT results with the data provided by the manufacturer showed very good agreement in terms of temperature (± 1 °C margin) and heat release/storage content (± 10 % margin) proving the validity of the advanced T-history method. A new data evaluation technique considering subcooling was implemented in MATLAB to allow correct characterisation of inorganic PCMs and the obtained results were presented accordingly. Moreover, the PT PCM data were re-evaluated showing that subcooling in these materials can be neglected. Finally, pilot optical transmittance studies in a wide wavelength range (from 280 to 700 nm) at different temperatures were carried out and showed that the phase change temperature {{is one of the most}} determinative factors of material’s applicability in <b>PCM</b> enhanced glazing <b>units</b> used in solar applications. The results from the PCM characterisation measurements confirmed that a better planned PCM experimental tests in terms of more accurate and precise sensing and control modalities provide more comprehensive and reliable results than those described in the literature so far and hence enable the development of more efficient PCM based TES systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} studies the green geopolymer incorporated with phase change material (PCM) for energy saving in buildings. First class F fly ash (FA) based-geopolymer binder was studied. In {{order to improve}} the mechanical properties, low calcium slag (SG) {{was added to the}} FA to produce geopolymer. The effect of different factors including SG content (at different relative amounts FA/SG = 0 / 100, 25 / 75, 50 / 50, 75 / 25 and 100 / 0), NaOH solution at different concentrations (7. 5, 10 and 15 M), various curing times (1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days) and curing temperatures (25 (ambient), 45, 60, 75 and 90 °C) was investigated. The unit weight and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of the geopolymer specimens were measured. Scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were also performed to characterize the microstructure and phase composition of the geopolymer specimens. The results show that the incorporation of SG not only improves the strength of the geopolymer specimens but also decreases the initial water content and thus the NaOH consumption at the same NaOH concentration required for geopolymer production. In addition, the inclusion of SG increases the unit weight of the geopolymer specimens, simply because SG has a much greater specific gravity than FA. The results also show that the strength of the FA/SG-based geopolymer develops rapidly within only 2 days and no obvious gain of the strength after 7 days. The optimum curing temperature (the curing temperature at which the maximum UCS is obtained) at a FA/SG ratio of 50 / 50 is around 75 °C. Second, FA-based geopolymer concrete was synthesized and the effect of different factors including sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide (SS/SH) ratio, aggregate shape, water to fly ash (W/FA) ratio, curing time, water exposure and PCM inclusion on the compressive strength of the geopolymer concrete specimens cured at different ambient temperatures was studied. The results show that the UCS of the specimens increases with higher SS/SH and W/FA ratios up to a certain level and then starts to decrease at higher ratios. The results also indicate that a major portion of the strength of the specimens cured at ambient temperatures develops within the first four weeks. In addition the strength of the FA-based geopolymer concrete is slightly decreased with water exposure and PCM incorporation. Third, the mechanical and thermal properties of geopolymer mortar synthesized with FA and different amount of PCM were studied and the effect of incorporated <b>PCM</b> on the <b>unit</b> weight and UCS of geopolymer mortar was evaluated. SEM imaging was performed to identify the change of micro structure of the geopolymer mortar after incorporation of PCM. The thermal properties of the geopolymer mortar containing different amount of PCM were also characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. In addition model tests were performed using small cubicles built with geopolymer mortar slabs containing different amount of PCM {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} geopolymer mortar wall with incorporated PCM in controlling the heat flow and internal temperature. The results indicate that both the unit weight and UCS of the geopolymer mortar decrease slightly after PCM is incorporated, mainly due to the small unit weight and low strength and stiffness of the PCM, respectively. However, the compressive strength of geopolymer mortar containing up to 20 % PCM is still sufficiently high for applications in buildings. The results also show that the incorporation of PCM leads to substantial increase of heat capacity and decrease of thermal conductivity of the geopolymer mortar and is very effective in decreasing the temperature inside the cubicles. Finally, a numerical study on the thermal performance of geopolymer with incorporated PCM was carried out. In order to simulate the heat transfer through geopolymer containing PCM, a simplified method was first presented. The influence of phase transition was linked to the energy balance equation through variable specific heat capacity of the PCM-geopolymer. The thermal properties of the geopolymer containing PCM for the numerical analysis were determined using DSC and guarded heat flow (GHF) tests. The simplified method was validated based on the good agreement between the numerical and experimental results. With the validated model, the effect of various factors including the specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and wall thickness on the thermal performance of PCM-geopolymer walls was studied. Then a modified numerical method was proposed for simulating the whole thermal transfer processes and the simulation results were used to conduct the economic evaluation of PCM-geopolymer walls for energy savings in buildings...|$|R
