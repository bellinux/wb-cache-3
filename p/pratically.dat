Unfortunately, the theory of computational complexity has established that several relevant problems in this field have an intrinsically-related complexity which is in general hard. Here we refer to both NP-hard and P-hard problems which are widely believed to be not efficiently solved by sequential respectively parallel deterministic algorithms. Thus, the notions of NP-hardness and P-hardness refer both to the domain of deterministic exact algorithms (i. e. algorithms which always generate optimal solutions) and to the worst-case complexity analysis.

40|$|The {{notion of}} arc {{consistency}} plays {{a central role}} in constraint satisfaction. It is known since [19, 4, 5] that the notion of local consistency can be extended to constraint optimisation problems defined by soft constraint frameworks based on an idempotent cost combination operator. This excludes non idempotent operators such as + which define <b>pratically</b> very significant problem such as Max-CSP, where the aim is to minimize the number of violated constraints. In this paper, we show that using a small additional axiom satisfied by most existing soft constraints proposals, it is possible to define a notion of soft arc consistency that extends the classical notion of arc consistency and this even in the case of non idempotent cost combination operators. A polynomial time for enforcing this soft arc consistency exists and its space and time complexities are identical to that of enforcing arc consistency in CSPs when the cost combination operator is strictly monotonic (for example Max-CSP). A directional version of arc consistency, first introduced in [6] is potentially even stronger than the non-directional version, since it allows non local propagation of penalties. We demonstrate the utility of directional arc consistency by showing that it implies a form of local optimality, which we call arc irreducibility...|$|E

We investigate the rotational evolution of young VLM stars and BDs using Monte Carlo simulations under {{the hypothesis of}} disk locking and stellar angular momentum conservation. Methods. We built a set of objects with masses ranging from 0. 01 Mo to 0. 4 Mo and considered models with single- and double- peaked initial period distributions with and without disk locking. An object {{is considered to be}} diskless when its mass accretion rate is below a given threshold. Results. Models with initial single-peaked period distributions reproduce the observations well given that BDs rotate faster than VLM stars. We observe a correlation between rotational period and mass when we relax the disk locking hypothesis, but with a shallower slope compared to some observational results. The angular momentum evolution of diskless stars is flatter than it is for stars with a disk which occurs because the moment of inertia of objects less massive than 0. 2 Mo remains <b>pratically</b> constant for a time scale that increases with decreasing stellar mass. Conclusions. Comparing our results with the available observational data we see that disk locking is not as important in the low-mass regime and that the rotational behaviour of VLM stars and BDs is different from what is seen in their solar mass counterparts.

For this purpose, the penetration rates of probe liquids into thin porous layers of the celluloses deposited onto horizontal glass plates were measured. It was found that the wicking was a reproducible process and that the thin-layer wicking technique could be used for the determination of the celluloses' surface free energy components. The size of the cellulose particles was characterized with the Galai CIS- 100 system and their crystallinity was measured by X-ray diffraction. The three celluloses have high apolar (ys LW = 50 - 56 mJ/m²) and electron donor ys- = 42 - 45 mJ/m²) components, while the electron acceptor component (ys+) is <b>pratically</b> zero. The free energy interactions of cellulose/water/cellulose calculated from the components are positive, regardless of the cellulose crystallinity. This would mean that the cellulose surfaces have a hydrophilic character. However, the work of spreading of water has a small negative value (3 - 9 mJ/m²), indicating that the surfaces are slightly hydrophobic. It is believed that the work of spreading characterizes better the hydrophobicity of the surface than the free energy of particle/water/particle interaction, because in the latter case, no electrostatic repulsion is taken into account in the calculations.

40|$|Under {{conditions}} of bulk depletion, the speciation and bioavailability of trace metals {{must be considered}} at two different time scales: (i) the time scale of the biouptake flux, as determined by diffusion of the bioactive free metal, dissociation of the bioinactive complex species, and the internalization rate; and (ii) the time scale of depletion of the bulk medium. The implications of these two time scales for the speciation dynamics are {{discussed in terms of}} experimental conditions. The geometry of the system is taken into account via a spherical cellular model. It considers a spherical organism depleting a spherical volume in a nonstirred medium and assumes linear adsorption of the metal at the biointerface and first-order internalization kinetics. In cases where the rate of biouptake is fully controlled by the internalization step, concentration gradients in the medium are insignificant. Then the biouptake becomes independent of the geometry of the system, and the model has a much simpler solution. Examples of trace metal uptake by microorganisms are analyzed: (i) cobalt uptake by Prochlorococcus in the presence of NTA, under conditions where bulk depletion is the controlling process due to the large number of organisms and high internalization rates, (ii) silver uptake by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with significant effects of bulk depletion, due to the high internalization rate; (iii) lead uptake by Chlorella vulgaris with <b>pratically</b> negligible bulk depletion due to the low internalization rate of the metal; and (iv) lead uptake by intestinal Caco- 2 cells, illustrating the simplification of the bulk depletion model for a system with different geometry where internalization is the rate-controlling step...|$|E

The immunological tests were done at the Division of Clinical Immunology of HURNP from May 1990 to December 1994. The serum samples were studied by the indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA, using kits commercially obtained from EBRAM) and by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI, using kits from LIO SERUM) with anti-human IgG conjugate (LABORCLIN). The results demonstrated that 643 serum samples were positive in both assay corresponding to a seroprevalence of 1. 4 %, i. e., a significant decrease in anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in the region in comparison with the previously mentioned rates. Data correlating sex and age of seropositive blood donors are presented, as well as the possible factors that {{may have contributed to the}} results observed...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} a simple {{introduction}} to the ecological requirements of Cephaelis ipecacuanha {{and only a few}} preliminary conclusions are reached. Cephaelis ipecacuanha has the habit of a forest plant, which is closely connected with the meteorological and floristic factors. This makes it very necessary to study its ecolo-gical relationships carefully, so as to understand its productivity in accordance with its mi¬croclimatic and microedaphic reactions. Conclusions: 1 — Within the ecological range of Cephaelis ipecacuanha, some zones show more fa¬vourable phytosociological conditions than other zones. Consequently, the vegetative and biological types must be investigated in different associations. a — The most favourable vegetative and biological types encountered, in regard to the phytosociological characteristcs of Cephaelis ipecacuanha, were found respectively in the rain forest on the slopes of the Serra dos Parecis and in the serclimax of the river Galera and its tributaries. b — The phytosociological optimum of Cephaelis ipecacuanha was seen in the Vochysietum (Vochysia sp.) which corresponds to number 11 of the original text. It can be defined as follows: shading by vegetation approximately 90 %, as the herbaceous sinusium covers 90 % of the area worked in, though the arboreal and arbustive coverture is only 65 % and 60 % respectviely. The inclination is <b>pratically</b> nil (less than 5 °) but the drainage is good because the soil is deep and silicous-humous, thus facilitating infiltration by the rain water which inundates the ground temporarily during the periods of floods. The pH oscillates between 5 and 6, denoting a slightly acid soil...|$|E
