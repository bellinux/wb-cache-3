5|$|Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian {{subsidiary}} of the multinational health care company Baxter International. Baxter manufactured intravenous (IV) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia. Because {{of the cost of}} importing sterile IV fluids and the absence of a rival domestic producer, Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume <b>parenteral</b> fluids, irrigating solutions and <b>parenteral</b> nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal dialysis fluids (PD fluids).|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total <b>parenteral</b> nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, {{in much the same way}} as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{analgesia}} is {{the cheapest}} and simplest mode of delivery. Other delivery routes such as sublingual, topical, transdermal, <b>parenteral,</b> rectal or spinal {{should be considered}} if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma. Current evidence for the effectiveness of fentanyl transdermal patches in controlling chronic cancer pain is weak but they may reduce complaints of constipation compared with oral morphine.|$|E
5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with <b>parenteral</b> beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{deficiency}} {{is rare in}} otherwise healthy, well-nourished individuals. It {{can occur}} in patients with severely compromised intestinal function, those undergoing total <b>parenteral</b> nutrition, and in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although New Zealand soil has low levels of selenium, adverse health effects have not been detected in the residents.|$|E
5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a <b>parenteral</b> anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E
5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, <b>parenteral</b> artesunate {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over <b>parenteral</b> routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple analgesia does not resolve local pain or clinical features of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, Redback antivenom can be given. Redback antivenom can also cross-neutralise katipo venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from Latrodectus katipo in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. Antivenom will usually relieve symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated in anyone suffering symptoms consistent with Latrodectus envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it is not limited to patients with signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using antivenom are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast some doubt on antivenoms efficacy in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as <b>parenteral</b> opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parenteral</b> {{formulations}} of oxycodone (brand name OxyNorm) are also available, and {{are widely used}} in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Its {{volume of}} {{distribution}} is approximately 306 L after oral administration and 203 L after <b>parenteral</b> administration.|$|E
25|$|For adults, {{intravenous}} (IV) or intramuscular (IM) artesunate is recommended. Quinine is {{an acceptable}} alternative if <b>parenteral</b> artesunate is not available.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of relapse after oral refeeding {{may be reduced}} by post-pyloric enteral rather than <b>parenteral</b> feeding prior to oral refeeding. IMRIE scoring is also useful.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to oral administration, <b>parenteral</b> progesterone, such as with vaginal administration, avoids the first-pass effect, {{and is not}} associated with supraphysiological concentrations of neurosteroid metabolites, nor with spikes or marked fluctuations in neurosteroid levels. <b>Parenteral</b> routes can be used instead of oral administration to avoid neurosteroid-related adverse effects if they prove to be problematic. Lower doses of oral progesterone are also associated with relatively reduced rates of conversion into neurosteroid metabolites and may similarly help to alleviate such side effects.|$|E
25|$|Late chronic: delayed {{exchange}} arthroplasty. Surgical débridement and <b>parenteral</b> antibiotics {{alone in}} this group has limited success, and standard of care involves exchange arthroplasty.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parenteral</b> {{administration}} {{can be performed}} by injection, that is, using a needle (usually a hypodermic needle) and a syringe, or by the insertion of an indwelling catheter.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolines use in {{children}} may be appropriate when the infection is caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, or when alternative treatment options require <b>parenteral</b> administration and oral therapy is preferred.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of chromium deficiency caused by long-term total <b>parenteral</b> nutrition are severely impaired glucose tolerance, weight loss, and confusion. However, subsequent studies questioned {{the validity of}} these findings.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parenteral</b> {{nutrition}} is {{feeding a}} person intravenously, bypassing the usual process of eating and digestion. The person receives nutritional formulas containing salts, glucose, amino acids, lipids and added vitamins.|$|E
25|$|Anaemia, {{caused by}} both chronic blood loss from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract and reduced absorption {{due to the}} up-regulation of hepcidin should also be treated, and this often {{requires the use of}} <b>parenteral</b> iron.|$|E
25|$|Flucloxacillin is more acid-stable {{than many}} other {{penicillins}} and can be given orally, in addition to <b>parenteral</b> routes. However, like methicillin, it is less potent than benzylpenicillin against non-β-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{should be}} stored at room {{temperature}} (15–30°C). The solution for <b>parenteral</b> injection should be protected from light and kept from freezing. The oral forms should be stored in air-tight containers and protected from light.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parenteral</b> antimalarials {{should be}} {{administered}} {{for a minimum}} of 24 hours, irrespective of the patient's ability to tolerate oral medication earlier. Thereafter, complete treatment is recommended including complete course of ACT or quinine plus clindamycin or doxycycline.|$|E
25|$|Chromium may {{be needed}} as an {{ingredient}} in total <b>parenteral</b> nutrition (TPN), since deficiency may occur after months of intravenous feeding with chromium-free TPN. For this reason, chromium is added to normal TPN solutions for people with diabetes, and in nutritional products for preterm infants.|$|E
25|$|Horses are {{withheld}} feed when colic {{signs are}} referable to gastrointestinal disease. In long-standing cases, <b>parenteral</b> nutrition may be instituted. Once clinical signs improve, the horse will slowly be re-fed (introduced {{back to its}} normal diet), while being carefully monitored for pain.|$|E
25|$|Most protein {{formulations}} are <b>parenteral</b> due to {{the fragile}} nature of the molecule which would be destroyed by enteric administration. Proteins have tertiary and quaternary structures which can be degraded or cause aggregation at room temperature. This can impact the safety and efficacy of the medicine.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s, Dr. Jonathon E. Rhoads of the Department of Surgery (which {{he would later}} go on to head for many years), mentored Dr. Stanley Dudrick who pioneered the {{successful}} use of total <b>parenteral</b> nutrition (TPN) for patients unable to tolerate nutrition through their GI tract.|$|E
25|$|GH {{has also}} been used {{experimentally}} to treat multiple sclerosis, to enhance weight loss in obesity, {{as well as in}} fibromyalgia, heart failure, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and burns. GH {{has also been}} used experimentally in patients with short bowel syndrome to lessen the requirement for intravenous total <b>parenteral</b> nutrition.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{specific}} {{treatment for the}} canine distemper. As with measles, the treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The supportive care is geared towards treating fluid/electrolyte imbalances, neurological symptoms, and preventing any secondary bacterial infections. Examples include administering fluids, electrolyte solutions, analgesics, anticonvulsants, broad spectrum antibiotics, antipyretics, <b>parenteral</b> nutrition and nursing care.|$|E
25|$|The virus spreads by the fecal–oral route, and infections {{often occur}} in {{conditions}} of poor sanitation and overcrowding. Hepatitis A {{can be transmitted}} by the <b>parenteral</b> route, but very rarely by blood and blood products. Food-borne outbreaks are not uncommon, and ingestion of shellfish cultivated in polluted water {{is associated with a}} high risk of infection.|$|E
25|$|Nutritional {{therapy with}} <b>parenteral</b> multivitamins is {{beneficial}} to implement until the person can maintain adequate nutritional intake. Treatments also include vitamin supplementation (especially thiamine). In more severe cases of nutritional deficiency 320mg/day of benfotiamine for 4 weeks followed by 120mg/day for 4 more weeks may be prescribed {{in an effort}} to return thiamine levels to normal.|$|E
25|$|The acute uveitis {{phase of}} VKH is usually {{responsive}} to high-dose oral corticosteroids; <b>parenteral</b> administration {{is usually not}} required. However, ocular complications may require an subtenon or intravitreous injection of corticosteroids or bevacizumab. In refractory situations, other immunosuppressives such as cyclosporine, or tacrolimus, antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate), or biological agents such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or infliximab may be needed.|$|E
25|$|The data below {{refer to}} oral administration. Oral potency {{may be less}} than <b>parenteral</b> potency because {{significant}} amounts (up to 50% in some cases) may not reach the circulation. Fludrocortisone acetate and deoxycorticosterone acetate are, by definition, mineralocorticoids rather than glucocorticoids, {{but they do have}} minor glucocorticoid potency and are included in this table to provide perspective on mineralocorticoid potency.|$|E
25|$|The gradual loss {{of blood}} from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routinely monitoring for anemia with blood tests repeated every three months in active disease and annually in quiescent disease. Adequate disease control usually improves anemia of chronic disease, but iron deficiency anemia should be treated with iron supplements. The form in which treatment is administered depends both on {{the severity of the}} anemia and on the guidelines that are followed. Some advise that <b>parenteral</b> iron be used first because patients respond to it more quickly, it is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, and it is not associated with compliance issues. Others require oral iron to be used first, as patients eventually respond and many will tolerate the side effects. All guidelines advise that <b>parenteral</b> iron should be administered in cases of severe anemia (a hemoglobin level less than 100 g/L).|$|E
25|$|Another form of {{endocarditis}} is healthcare-associated endocarditis {{when the}} infecting organism {{is believed to}} be transmitted in a health care setting like hospital, dialysis unit or a residential nursing home. Nosocomial endocarditis is a form of healthcare associated endocarditis in which the infective organism is acquired during stay in a hospital and it is usually secondary to presence of intravenous catheters, total <b>parenteral</b> nutrition lines, pacemakers, etc.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} {{clinical}} situations where transfusion with {{red blood cells}} is the only clinically appropriate option, clinicians look at whether alternatives as feasible. This can be due to several reasons, such as patient safety, economic burden or scarcity of blood. Guidelines recommend blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due {{to the degree of}} their anaemia. In these cases <b>parenteral</b> iron is recommended.|$|E
