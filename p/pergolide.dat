5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, <b>pergolide,</b> pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|Several medications, {{including}} verapamil and nifedipine, {{as well as}} ergot derivatives such as bromocriptine and <b>pergolide,</b> {{have been}} associated with medication-induced erythromelalgia.|$|E
25|$|Two {{independent}} studies {{published in}} the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2007, implicated <b>pergolide,</b> along with cabergoline, in causing valvular heart disease. As a result of this, the FDA removed <b>pergolide</b> from the United States market in March 2007. (Since cabergoline is not approved in the United States for Parkinson's Disease, but for hyperprolactinemia, the drug remains on the market. Treatment for hyperprolactinemia requires lower doses than that for Parkinson's Disease, diminishing the risk of valvular heart disease).|$|E
25|$|As with fenfluramine, some {{of these}} drugs have been {{withdrawn}} from the market after groups taking them showed a statistical increase {{of one or more}} of the side effects described. An example is <b>pergolide.</b> The drug was declining in use since it was reported in 2003 to be associated with cardiac fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} in {{the brain}} have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors. Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa, but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms {{with the aim of}} delaying motor complications. When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, <b>pergolide,</b> pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine, and lisuride.|$|E
500|$|L-DOPA {{treatment}} cannot {{restore the}} dopamine cells {{that have been}} lost, but it causes the remaining cells to produce more dopamine, thereby compensating for the loss to at least some degree. In advanced stages the treatment begins to fail because the cell loss is so severe that the remaining ones cannot produce enough dopamine regardless of L-DOPA levels. [...] Other drugs that enhance dopamine function, such as bromocriptine and <b>pergolide,</b> are also sometimes used to treat Parkinsonism, {{but in most cases}} L-DOPA appears to give the best trade-off between positive effects and negative side-effects.|$|E

2500|$|In the past, {{three groups}} of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive {{antimigraine}} drugs (ergotamine and methysergide), the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs (fenfluramine, chlorphentermine, and aminorex), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT2B receptors. These include <b>pergolide</b> and cabergoline, but not the more dopamine-specific lisuride.

2500|$|Specific {{drugs that}} have been studied in sleep bruxism are clonazepam, levodopa, amitriptyline, [...] bromocriptine, [...] <b>pergolide,</b> clonidine, propranolol, and l-tryptophan, with some showing no effect and others appear to have {{promising}} initial results; however, {{it has been suggested}} that further safety testing is required before any evidence-based clinical recommendations can be made. When bruxism is related to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression, adding buspirone has been reported to resolve the side effect. Tricyclic antidepressants have also been suggested to be preferable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in people with bruxism, and may help with the pain.|$|E
50|$|Cyproheptadine may {{be added}} to the {{treatment}} regime in horses that are inadequately responding to <b>pergolide,</b> but is usually only used in horses with advanced PPID on high doses of <b>pergolide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pergolide</b> was an antiparkinson {{medications}} {{that was in}} decreasing use since reported in 2003 {{to be associated with}} cardiac fibrosis.

50|$|These drugs include <b>pergolide</b> and cabergoline.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pergolide</b> {{acts as an}} agonist of {{dopamine}} D2 and D1 and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It may possess agonist {{activity at}} other dopamine receptor subtypes as well, similar to cabergoline. Although <b>pergolide</b> is more potent as an agonist of the D2 receptor, it has high D1 receptor affinity {{and is one of}} the most potent D1 receptor agonists of the dopamine receptor agonists that are clinically available. The agonist activity of <b>pergolide</b> at the D1 receptor somewhat alters its clinical and side effect profile in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

50|$|Like <b>pergolide,</b> {{cabergoline}} {{has been}} linked to cardiac damage. Among similar antiparkinsonian drugs, cabergoline exhibits the same type of serotonin receptor binding as <b>pergolide.</b> It should be noted that while lisuride, a related drug, also binds to the 5-HT2B receptor, it acts as an antagonist rather than as an agonist.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pergolide</b> (trade names Permax, Prascend) is an ergoline-based {{dopamine}} {{receptor agonist}} {{used in some}} countries {{for the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease (PD).

50|$|The drug is in {{decreasing}} use, as it {{was reported}} in 2003 to be associated with a form of heart disease called cardiac fibrosis. In 2007, The United States Food and Drug Administration announced a voluntary withdrawal of the drug by manufacturers due to the possibility of heart valve damage. <b>Pergolide</b> is not currently available in the United States for human use. This problem is thought to be due to pergolide's action at the 5-HT2B serotonin receptors of cardiac myocytes, causing proliferative valve disease by the same mechanism as ergotamine, methysergide, fenfluramine, and other serotonin 5-HT2B agonists, including serotonin itself when elevated in the blood in carcinoid syndrome. <b>Pergolide</b> can rarely cause Raynaud's phenomenon. Among similar antiparkinsonian drugs, cabergoline but not lisuride exhibit this same type of serotonin receptor binding. In January, 2007, cabergoline (Dostinex) was reported also to be associated with valvular proliferation heart damage. In March 2007, <b>pergolide</b> was withdrawn from the U.S. market for human use, due to serious valvular damage that was shown in two independent studies.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} {{bread-making}} is also peppered {{with references to}} deadly ergotism caused by ergot, most commonly Claviceps purpurea, a parasite of cereal crops.
