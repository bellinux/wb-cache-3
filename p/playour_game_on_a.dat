We investigate some properties of the core of <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> convex geometry. First, we show that if a game is quasi-convex, then the core is stable. This result can be seen as an extension of a result by Shapley for traditional cooperative games. Secondly, we show the core on the class of balanced <b>games</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> convex geometry has a consistency property, called the reduced game property. Moreover, we axiomatize the core by means of consistency, as is analogous to a result by Peleg for traditional cooperative games...|$|R
