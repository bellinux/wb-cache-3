This case- control study was performed to assess the possible effects of advanced periodontal disease {{on the structure of}} dental pulp. Fifty-two permanent teeth extracted because of advanced periodontitis with &# 61619; 5 mm attachment loss and grade III mobility were compared to fifty-two control teeth, obtained from systemically healthy adults. Two groups were matched for age and teeth types. Inflammation, fibrosis, calcification and necrosis were observed in the (27. 8 - 40 %), (0 - 59. 4 %), (0 - 26. 4 %) and (0 - 20. 9 %) of the different sections of the study group, and (0 %), (9. 7 - 50 %), (0 - 11. 6 %) and (0 %) of the control group (P < 0. 05). Abnormal pulp tissue was observed in the (33. 3 - 88. 1 %) and (12. 9 - 50. 5 %) of different sections of the study and control groups respectively (P < 0. 05). Complete necrosis of dental pulp occurred only when depth of adjacent periodontal pocket reached the apical third of the root. There was an increase in frequency of pathologic changes as the depth of periodontal pocket increased (P = 0. 00). We conclude that advanced periodontal disease can affect the dental pulp, although not necessarily leading to complete <b>pulp</b> <b>disintegration.</b> Careful consideration of diagnostic and treatment planning in patients with endodontic-periodontal involvement is recommended. Fibrosis and diffuse calcification of dental pulp in teeth with advanced periodontal involvement may endanger root canal therapy; if needed...|$|E

This damage decreases the mechanical properties of the paper prepared from recycled pulp. Soft beating of the pulp is {{a simple way to}} partially recover the original mechanical properties, but it is limited by the high degradation of fibres, fines generation and decrease in drainage rate that recycled fibres already present. The present research studies the use of nanofibrillated cellulose (CNF) as an alternative to mechanical beating to improve the strength properties of paper produced from a deinked recycled <b>pulp</b> obtained by <b>disintegration</b> and flotation of a mixture of old newspapers and magazines. Different percentages of CNF were added to this mixture with a retention aid. A fraction of the same pulp without CNF was also beaten at different intensities in a PFI mill. Morphological properties of both beaten and CNF-reinforced pulp suspensions, as well as structural and mechanical properties of handsheets made thereof, were analysed and their results compared. Paper containing 1. 5 % of CNF presented a higher tensile strength and stiffness than paper from beaten pulp with similar freeness and water retention values. A higher amount of CNF further improved the mechanical properties, up to double the tensile index, which opens new possibilities of use for recycled paperThe authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the Spanish Economy and Competitiveness Ministry to the referenced projects: CTQ 2012 - 36868 -C 02 - 01 and CTM 2011 - 28506 -C 02 - 0...|$|R
