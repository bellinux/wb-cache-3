40|$|Phytoestrogens are {{polyphenol}} compounds {{of plant}} origin that exhibit a structural similarity to the mammalian steroid hormone 17 β-oestradiol. In Asian nations the staple consumption of phyto-oestrogen-rich foodstuffs correlates with a reduced incidence of breast cancer. Human dietary intervention trials have noted {{a direct relationship}} between <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> ingestion and a favourable hormonal profile associated with decreased breast cancer risk. However, these studies failed to ascertain the precise effect of dietary phyto-oestrogens on the proliferation of mammary tissue. Epidemiological and rodent studies crucially suggest that breast cancer chemoprevention by dietary <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> compounds is dependent on ingestion before puberty, when the mammary gland is relatively immature. <b>Phyto-oestrogen</b> supplements are commercially marketed for use by postmenopausal women as natural and safe alternatives to hormone replacement therapy. Of current concern {{is the effect of}} <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> compounds on the growth of pre-existing breast tumours. Data are contradictory, with cell culture studies reporting both the oestrogenic stimulation of oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines and the antagonism of tamoxifen activity at physiological <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> concentrations. Conversely, <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> ingestion by rodents is associated with the development of less aggressive breast tumours with reduced metastatic potential. Despite the present ambiguity, current data do suggest a potential benefit from use of phyto-oestrogens in breast cancer chemoprevention and therapy. These aspects are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{brings up}} {{regarding}} the plant derived compounds with estrogenic activity. The authors correctly emphasize {{the need for}} control of estrogenicity of foods containing phyto-oestrogens {{in view of the}} significant health effects of various estrogenic derivatives. This is particularly essential {{in the light of the}} current wave of enthusiasm for vegetarian food in general and phyto-oestrogens in particular. Phytoestrogens are plant-derived hormone-like diphenolic compounds of dietary origin that are present at high levels in plasma of healthy subjects. These compounds are weakly estrogenic and appear to influence the hormone dependent cancers (breast cancer, prostate cancer), viral infection, atherosclerosis, chronic heart diseases and osteoporosis, besides that the review concludes with the discussion of the effects of <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> on reproductive system, neuroprotective effect, retinal thickness, dementia and alcohol metabolism.

40|$|Phyto-oestrogens {{have been}} {{associated}} with a decreased risk for osteoporosis, but results from intervention and observational studies in Western countries have been inconsistent. In the present study, we investigated the association between habitual <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> intake and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) of the calcanaeum as a marker of bone density. We collected 7 d records of diet, medical history and demographic and anthropometric data from participants (aged 45 – 75 years) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer-Norfolk study. <b>Phyto-oestrogen</b> (biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin; genistein, glycitein; matairesinol; secoisolariciresinol; enterolactone; equol) intake was determined using a newly developed food composition database. Bone density was assessed using BUA of the calcanaeum. Associations between bone density and <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> intake were investigated in 2580 postmenopausal women who were not on hormone replacement therapy and 4973 men. Median intake of total phyto-oestrogens was 876 (interquartile range 412) μg/d in postmenopausal women and 1212 (interquartile range 604) μg/d in men. The non-soya isoflavones formononetin and biochanin A were marginally significant or significantly associated with BUA in postmenopausal women (β = 1 · 2; P < 0 · 1) and men (β = 1 · 2; P < 0 · 05), respectively; enterolignans and equol were positively associated with bone density in postmenopausal women, but this association became non-significant when dietary Ca was added to the model. In the lowest quintile of Ca intake, soya isoflavones were positively associated with bone density in postmenopausal women (β = 1 · 4; P < 0 · 1). The present results therefore suggest that non-soya isoflavones are associated with bone density independent of Ca, whereas the association with soya or soya isoflavones is affected by dietary Ca...|$|E
40|$|A grazing {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to study the concentration of <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> in herbage for cattle and in milk during two periods (May and June). Forty-eight Danish Holstein cows were divided into four groups with four treatment diets; white clover, red clover, lucerne and chicory-rich pastures. Each experimental period lasted 15 days. Herbage samples {{from the first day}} and individual milk samples from {{the last day of the}} experimental period were analysed for <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> using LC-MS technique. The total concentration of <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> was 21 399 mg/kg DM for red clover and 238 - 466 mg/kg DM for the other three herbages mainly due to a much higher concentration of biochanin A, formononetin and glycitein in red clover. In the milk, the total concentration of <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> was 253 - 397 μg/l for red clover milk and 56 - 91 μg/l in the milk from the other three treatments. This was especially due to a higher concentration of equol, daidzein and formononetin in the red clover milk. The concentration of biochanin A was significantly higher in milk from the red clover treatment in May while no differences were observed in June. Enterodiol was similar across treatments while the concentration of enterolactone was significantly lower for red clover milk compared with the other treatments. Of the tested pastures, red clover appears to have the highest concentration and to be the best source of <b>phyto-oestrogens,</b> especially equol, in bovine milk...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{high-profile}} studies on {{hormone replacement therapy}} which provided little {{evidence in support of}} the drug therapy improving future health, there remains a growing demand for dietary solutions for maintaining health and preventing disease as women age. Although interest in the relative importance of <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> to human health has increased dramatically over the last decade, the effective dose for health benefits and hypothetical issues on safety remain to be resolved. Plausible mechanisms and epidemiological data are available to support the concept that phyto-oestrogen-rich diets exert physiological effects, but optimal doses and sources of these compounds have still not been elucidated for specific health benefits. In addition, much of the current mechanistic data are difficult to interpret as the experiments have incorporated levels of <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> that may not be achievable in vivo and have to date only used aglycones and glycosides of the pure compounds rather than examining the biological effects of gut and liver metabolites.

40|$|In bovine oviduct cells 17 β-oestradiol can {{induce the}} {{synthesis}} of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a glycoprotein essential for embryo implantation. Therefore substances which are structurally similar to 17 β-oestradiol and possess oestrogenic activity may also modulate LIF synthesis and influence the reproductive process. We used primary cultures of bovine and human oviduct cells (epithelial cells:fibroblasts 1 : 1) to compare the effects of 17 β-oestradiol, <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> (genistein, biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, and equol) and xeno-oestrogens [polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) : trichlorobiphenyl, 4 -hydroxy-trichlorobiphenyl and 4 -hydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl] on LIF synthesis. Immunoreactive LIF-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay {{was used to determine}} the concentration of LIF in the culture medium. Similar to 17 β-oestradiol, genistein (0. 02 - 2 μmol/l) induced LIF synthesis in bovine oviduct cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Equol, biochanin A and daidzein (2 μmol/l), 4 -hydroxy-trichlorobiphenyl and 4 -hydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl (0. 01 - 10 μmol/l) but not formononetin (2 μmol/l) also induced LIF synthesis in bovine cells. <b>Phyto-oestrogens</b> and xeno-oestrogens also induced LIF synthesis in human oviduct cells (P < 0. 05). The stimulatory effects of PCB, <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> and 17 β-oestradiol were blocked by ICI 182, 780 (1 μmol/l). Moreover, 17 β-oestradiol, 4 -hydroxy-trichlorobiphenyl, 4 -hydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl, genistein, tamoxifen and ICI 182, 780 displaced [3 H] 17 β-oestradiol from cytosolic oestrogen receptors in bovine oviduct cells. These results suggest that <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> and PCB mimic the effects of oestradiol in inducing LIF synthesis by bovine and human oviduct cells and that these stimulatory effects are oestrogen receptor-mediated.

40|$|The {{major risk}} factors for breast cancer are hormone-related, and the only {{well-established}} diet-related {{risk factors for}} breast cancer are obesity and alcohol consumption. Obesity increases breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women by around 30 %, probably by increasing serum concentrations of bioavailable oestradiol. Moderate alcohol intakes increase breast cancer risk by about 7 % per alcoholic drink per day, perhaps also by increasing oestrogen levels. Populations with high fat intakes generally have high rates of breast cancer, but studies of individual women have not confirmed an association of high fat diets with breast cancer risk. Phyto-oestrogens can affect hormone metabolism, but data on <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> consumption and breast cancer risk are inconsistent.

40|$|Background: A {{substantial}} fall in {{high-density lipoprotein}} cholesterol (HDL-C) during puberty in boys, but not girls, {{has been reported}} in Western populations. The fall in boys is believed to be due to hormonal changes – androgens {{have been shown to be}} associated with lower HDL-C, whereas oestrogens are associated with higher HDL-C. The fall in HDL-C during puberty was not observed, however, in a study of Moslem boys in Israel, nor in a group of Japanese boys.

40|$|The {{high rates}} of breast cancer in Western {{countries}} have suggested that some features of a Western diet may increase breast cancer risk. Most of the established risk factors for breast cancer are hormonal, and nutrition may affect breast cancer risk through changes in hormone metabolism. The only well established diet-related risk factor for breast cancer is obesity, which increases breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women by around 50 %, probably by increasing serum concentrations of free oestradiol. Moderate alcohol intakes increase breast cancer risk by about 10 - 20 %, perhaps also by increasing oestrogen levels.

40|$|A {{consensus}} view of soyabean <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> {{in clinical}} interventions in post-menopausal women is presented {{that is based}} on data from the EU-funded project Phytohealth. The <b>phyto-oestrogens,</b> primarily genistein and daidzein, were given as soyabean-protein isolates, whole-soyabean foods or extracts, supplements or pure compounds. A comprehensive literature search was conducted with well-defined inclusion or exclusion criteria. For areas for which substantial research exists only placebo-controlled double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCT) conducted on healthy post-menopausal women were included. For emerging areas all available human studies in post-menopausal women were reviewed. In order to make cross comparisons between studies the doses of isoflavones were calculated as aglycone equivalents. There is a suggestion, but no conclusive evidence, that isoflavones from the sources studied so far have a beneficial effect on bone health. The consumption of whole-soyabean foods and soyabean-protein isolates has some beneficial effects on lipid markers of cardiovascular risk. The consumption of isolated isoflavones does not affect blood lipid levels or blood pressure, although it may improve endothelial function. For menopausal symptoms there is currently limited evidence that soyabean-protein isolates, soyabean foods or red-clover (Trifolium pratense L.) extract are effective but soyabean isoflavone extracts may be effective in reducing hot flushes. There are too few RCT studies to reach conclusions on the effects of isoflavones on breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes or cognitive function. The health benefits of soyabean <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> in healthy post-menopausal women are subtle and even some well-designed studies do not show protective effects. Future studies should focus on high-risk post-menopausal women, especially in the areas of diabetes, CVD, breast cancer and bone healt...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in the possible health threat posed by the effects of endocrine disruptors on reproduction.

The purpose of this review {{was to examine the}} evidence regarding the potential detrimental effects of soy and phyto-oestrogens on male reproductive function and fertility in humans and animals. Overall, there are some indications that phyto-oestrogens, alone or in combination with other endocrine disruptors, may alter reproductive hormones, spermatogenesis, sperm capacitation and fertility. However, these results must be interpreted with care, {{as a result of the}} paucity of human studies and as numerous reports did not reveal any adverse effects on male reproductive physiology. Further investigation is needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn. In the meantime, caution would suggest that perinatal <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> exposure, such as that found in infants feeding on soy-based formula, should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Oestrogens exert their {{physiological}} effects {{through two}} receptor subtypes. Here we report the three-dimensional {{structure of the}} oestrogen receptor beta isoform (ERbeta) ligand-binding domain (LBD) {{in the presence of}} the <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> genistein and the antagonist raloxifene. The overall structure of ERbeta-LBD is very similar to that previously reported for ERalpha. Each ligand interacts with a unique set of residues within the hormone-binding cavity and induces a distinct orientation in the AF- 2 helix (H 12). The bulky side chain of raloxifene protrudes from the cavity and physically prevents the alignment of H 12 over the bound ligand. In contrast, genistein is completely buried within the hydrophobic core of the protein and binds in a manner similar to that observed for ER's endogenous hormone, 17 beta-oestradiol. However, in the ERbeta-genistein complex, H 12 does not adopt the distinctive 'agonist' position but, instead, lies in a similar orientation to that induced by ER antagonists. Such a sub-optimal alignment of the transactivation helix is consistent with genistein's partial agonist character in ERbeta and demonstrates how ER's transcriptional response to certain bound ligands is attenuated...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} literature contains {{evidence suggesting that}} {{women who have been}} treated for breast cancer may, {{as a result of their}} diagnosis, increase their <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> (PE) intake. In the present paper, we describe the creation of a dietary analysis database (based on Dietplan 6) for the determination of dietary intakes of specific PE (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, formononetin, biochanin A, coumestrol, matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol), in a group of women previously diagnosed and treated for postmenopausal breast cancer. The design of the database, data evaluation criteria, literature data entry for 551 foods and primary analysis by LC–MS/MS of an additional thirty-four foods for which there were no published data are described. The dietary intake of 316 women previously treated for postmenopausal breast cancer informed the identification of potential food and beverage sources of PE and the bespoke dietary analysis database was created to, ultimately, quantify their PE intake. In order that PE exposure could be comprehensively described, fifty-four of the 316 subjects completed a 24 h urine collection, and their urinary excretion results allowed for the description of exposure to include those identified as ‘equol producers’...|$|E

The research protocol involved the random subdivision of the enrolled sample into two groups of 25 women, group 1 (with an average age of 53. 3 +/- 3. 5 years, and an average menopausal age of 51. 6 +/- 1. 8 years) and group 2 (with an average age of 53. 1 +/- 2. 9 years, and an average menopausal age of 51. 3 +/- 1. 2 years), who were to receive treatment for three months with the product being studied and with a placebo. After the three-month period, as an additional check, the group initially treated with the placebo would move to the <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> and viceversa. All of the patients were subjected to a series of clinical and instrumental examinations and were asked to fill in a questionnaire concerning their complaints, at the start, at halfway (third month) and at the end (sixth month) of the trial. The results of the evaluation of the questionnaires performed on the 47 patients who had completed the trial showed, in the first three months, an improvement in the symptoms (hot flushes) in 11 patients treated with <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> against 6 patients from the group that received only the placebo. In the second three-month period the hot flushes reappeared in 4 of the 11 patients who had previously seen improvements and had then passed to the placebo. In contrast, the group that passed to the <b>phyto-oestrogens,</b> after treatment with the placebo, experienced the disappearance of hot flushes in 11 women, including the 6 who had already improved in the first three months. There was no significant reduction in anxiety, insomnia or vaginal dryness. None of the enrolled patients indicated complaints linked to the treatment. It can be concluded that the use of a product based on <b>phyto-oestrogens,</b> such as the one experimented, can lead to a significant reduction in some of the disorders linked with the menopause, especially hot flushes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{hypothesis}} was tested {{that the rate}} of postmenopausal bone loss is inversely associated with long-term urinary excretion of <b>phyto-oestrogens,</b> as a marker of habitual dietary intake. Design: Secondary analysis of a 10 -year follow-up study (1979 - 1989) among postmenopausal women in the Netherlands. Subjects: From the original population of 154 women, 32 women were selected with an annual rate of radial bone loss of ≤ 0. 5 % over the first 5 years of the study and 35 women with a rate of ≥ 2. 5 % per year. Methods: The isoflavonoids genistein, daidzein and equol, and the lignan enterolactone were determined by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry in aggregate samples from annually collected urine samples. Cortical bone density of the radius had previously been measured annually by single-photon absorptiometry. Results: Excretion of isoflavonoids did not differ between both groups, although in multivariate analysis equol excretion was weakly positively associated with rate of bone loss in the 5 years after the menopause. Enterolactone excretion was significantly higher in the group with high rate of bone loss. This positive association remained in multivariate linear regression analysis after adjustment for age, years since menopause, body mass index and intake of calcium, vegetable protein and dietary fibre. Conclusions: Enterolactone excretion is likely to be an indicator of consumption of grains and legumes; {{it is not clear whether}} the observed positive association with rate of bone loss is a causal one. Our results do not support a preventive effect of low, unsupplemented dietary intake of <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> on postmenopausal cortical bone loss.

40|$|Environmental {{oestrogens}} {{are defined}} as xenobiotics structurally resembling oestrogen, and are divided into two broad categories, xeno-oestrogens and <b>phyto-oestrogens.</b> Environmental oestrogens may contribute importantly to the increased incidence of reproductive disorders in the modern environment. Although the mechanisms by which environmental oestrogens induce their deleterious effects on the reproductive system remain poorly defined, {{it is likely that}} the vascular effects of these compounds play a critical role. In this regard, oestradiol strongly regulates both angiogenesis and vascular remodelling by influencing the growth and function of vascular endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC). Since blood vessels, by undergoing angiogenesis, vascular regression and vascular remodelling, actively participate in the normal functioning of reproductive organs, environmental oestrogens [...] -by mimicking or antagonizing the vascular effects of oestradiol [...] -may induce abnormalities in vascular function and structure leading to reproductive disorders such as pre-eclampsia, endometriosis, impaired follicular development, inefficient implantation, impotence and infertility.

30|$|With {{regard to}} {{preventing}} recurrence {{in breast cancer}} survivors, the data on beneficial effects of phyto-oestrogens are conflicting here as well. The inhibitory effect of enterolactone, a metabolite and marker of dietary lignans, on human aromatase by mammalian lignans and isoflavonoid phyto-oestrogens {{has been shown in}} vitro (Adlercreutz et al. 1993; Adlercreutz 1995), though the protective effects against breast cancer are only slight. It is not yet known whether this is due to a healthy diet or indeed evoked by the presence of dietary phyto-oestrogens (Adlercreutz 2002 a; Adlercreutz 2002 b). The effect of dietary <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> ingestion on the survival of breast cancer patients was investigated in 1, 140 patients (Buck et al. 2011) by determining enterolactone for a median follow-up of 6.1 years. Enterolactone levels correlated positively with patient survival. The highest quartile of serum enterolactones was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death, but only in oestrogen receptor-negative tumours (HR 0.27 (95 % CI 0.08 - 0.87)). It has been suggested that the high concentration of lignans in vegetarians, by inhibiting aromatase (=oestrogen synthetase) in peripheral and/or cancer cells and lowering oestrogen levels, may play a protective role as antipromotional compounds during growth of oestrogen-dependent cancers (Adlercreutz et al. 1993).|$|E

Natural and semi-synthetic 8 -prenylnaringenin showed similar bioactivities both in a yeast screen transfected with the human oestrogen receptor and in oestrogen-responsive human Ishikawa Var-I cells. 8 -Prenylnaringenin showed comparable binding activity to both oestrogen receptor isoforms (ERalpha and ERbeta). 8 -Prenylnaringenin extracted from hops contains similar amounts of both (R) - and (S) -enantiomers, indicating that the compound is normally formed non-enzymatically. Both enantiomers showed similar bioactivity in vitro and similar binding characteristics to ERalpha and ERbeta. The oestrogenic activity of 8 -prenylnaringenin in vitro was greater than that of established phyto-oestrogens such as coumestrol, genistein and daidzein. The high oestrogenic activity was confirmed in an acute in vivo test using uterine vascular permeability as an end point.

40|$|Purpose:  To {{determine}} whether the hill of vision for Short-Wavelength Automated Perimetry (SWAP) is shallower for women who consume phyto-oestrogen-rich foods than for women who do not. Methods:  Visual field data were compared for two groups of healthy amenorrhoeic women 48 – 69 years-old with normal vision and not using hormone replacement: (1) 24 subjects who reported consuming soy and/or flax products and (2) 20 subjects who reported not consuming these products. Two types of 24 - 2 visual fields were measured: (1) Full Threshold SWAP and (2) a white-on-white (W/W) field obtained using a Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA Standard). Results:  The reduction of SWAP sensitivity from {{the centre of the}} field (4 loci, mean eccentricity = 4. 2 °) to the periphery (20 loci, mean eccentricity = 21. 9 °) was less for soy/flax consumers than for nonconsumers, both with age-referencing (mean difference = 1. 7 dB, p = 0. 018) and without (p = 0. 012). Corresponding distinctions existed for the SWAP – W/W difference, and there was minimal effect for W/W fields alone. The peripheral age-referenced SWAP sensitivities averaged 2. 5 dB higher for consumers than nonconsumers (p = 0. 022). Conclusion:  The between-group distinctions are consistent with the possibility (derived from the women’s health literature) that phyto-oestrogens may counteract a decline of short-wavelength-sensitive cone-mediated response among postmenopausal women. These results suggest another potential application for SWAP outside its original intended purpose as a glaucoma test.

Relative risks (RRs) for prostate cancer in relation to plasma concentrations of these <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> were estimated by conditional logistic regression. Higher plasma concentrations of genistein were associated with lower risk of prostate cancer: RR among men in the highest vs the lowest fifth, 0. 71 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 53 - 0. 96, P trend= 0. 03). After adjustment for potential confounders this RR was 0. 74 (95 % CI 0. 54 - 1. 00, P trend= 0. 05).

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the effects of grazing a recently established pasture containing red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and an older pasture containing a variety of sown and unsown plant species on milk concentrations of <b>phyto-oestrogens.</b> Sixteen Norwegian Red dairy cows [mean (standard deviation); body weight 599 (45. 1) kg, stage of lactation 73 (15. 0) d in milk, milk yield 29. 9 (2. 90) kg/d at the start of the experiment] were divided into two groups and grazed either a short-term pasture (SP) or a long-term pasture (LP). The SP was representative of organically managed leys in Norway, which are frequently, approximately every third year, renewed by soil tillage and seeding, whereas LP was representative of organically managed grasslands that are less frequently renewed. The SP contained meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) (mean 34 %), timothy (Phleum pratense L.) (mean 19 %), red clover (mean 28 %), shepherd׳s-purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik.)

In addition to a daily pasture allowance of 20 kg dry matter per cow, supplements of 3. 0 kg barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) concentrate were fed. Herbage, concentrates and milk was sampled during the last week of three experimental periods and analysed for <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> using LC-MS/MS technology.

Milk produced on SP had 14 times higher concentrations of the mammalian isoflavonoid equol, and the concentrations of equol were higher than found in most other studies. This study confirms that grazing pastures containing red clover increases concentrations of isoflavones and especially equol in bovine milk compared to grazing pastures with other botanical composition. The higher milk concentrations of the lignan metabolite enterodiol in milk from SP compared to LP could not be related to differences in intake of the analysed lignans and may therefore be related to unidentified lignans...|$|R
30|$|There are {{conflicting}} data {{as to whether}} CREs act as <b>phyto-oestrogens.</b> Early studies in uterine and pituitary cells of ovariectomised rats showed that a chloroform fraction from a methanolic CRE did bind to oestrogen receptors (ER) (Jarry et al. 1985). Another study showed some evidence for an oestrogenic effect of CR in mice and oestrogen-dependent human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells (Liu et al. 2001 a). Partly contradicting these findings, the same group showed that CRE did not alter expression of different oestrogen-inducible genes (e.g., presenelin- 2, progesterone receptor) (Liu et al. 2001 b).|$|R
40|$|Phyto-oestrogens are polyphenolic non-steroidal plant {{compounds}} with oestrogen-like biological activity. Phyto-oestrogens {{have many}} biological effects including oestrogen agonist/antagonist properties. However, {{the effect of}} phyto-oestrogens on allergic responses remains unclear. In this study we investigated whether formononetin, a <b>phyto-oestrogen,</b> and its metabolites, daidzein and equol, affect production of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), a pro-inflammatory cytokine closely associated with allergic immune response, in primary CD 4 + T cells and EL 4 T lymphoma cells. Formononetin, daidzein and equol significantly enhanced IL- 4 production from both CD 4 + T cells and EL 4 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Formononetin, daidzein and equol also enhanced IL- 4 gene promoter activity in EL 4 cells transiently transfected with IL- 4 gene promoter constructs, but this effect was impaired in EL 4 cells transfected with an IL- 4 promoter construct deleted of P 4 site carrying nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) binding sites. In addition, formononetin, daidzein and equol increased AP- 1 DNA binding activities while did not affect NF-AT DNA binding activities. The enhancing effects on IL- 4 production and AP- 1 DNA binding activities were abrogated by specific inhibitors for phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), protein kinase C (PKC) and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), indicating that formononetin, daidzein and equol might enhance IL- 4 production by increased activation of AP- 1 through the PI 3 -K/PKC/p 38 MAPK signalling pathway. These results suggest that phyto-oestrogens {{and some of their}} metabolites may increase allergic responses via the enhancement of IL- 4 production in T cells...|$|E
40|$|Hop-derived food {{supplements}} and beers contain the prenylflavonoids xanthohumol (X), isoxanthohumol (IX) {{and the very}} potent <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> (plant-derived oestrogen mimic) 8 -prenylnaringenin (8 -PN). The weakly oestrogenic IX can be bioactivated via O-demethylation to 8 -PN. Since IX usually predominates over 8 -PN, human subjects may be exposed to increased doses of 8 -PN. A dietary intervention trial with fifty healthy post-menopausal Caucasian women was undertaken. After a 4 d washout period, participants delivered faeces, blank urine and breath samples. Next, they started a 5 d treatment with hop-based supplements that were administered three times per d and on the last day, a 24 h urine sample was collected. A semi-quantitative FFQ was used to estimate fat, fibre, alcohol, caffeine and theobromine intakes. The recoveries of IX, 8 -PN and X in the urine were low and considerable inter-individual variations were observed. A five-fold increase in the dosage of IX without change in 8 -PN concentration resulted in a significant lower IX recovery and a higher 8 -PN recovery. Classification of the subjects into poor (60 %), moderate (25 %) and strong (15 %) 8 -PN producers based on either urinary excretion or microbial bioactivation capacity gave comparable results. Recent antibiotic therapy seemed to affect the 8 -PN production negatively. A positive trend between methane excretion and 8 -PN production was observed. Strong 8 -PN producers consumed less alcohol and had a higher theobromine intake. From this study we conclude that in vivo O-demethylation of IX increases the oestrogenic potency of hop-derived product...|$|E
40|$|Equol, a {{derivative}} of daidzein produced by enterobacteria, has greater activity as a <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> compared with daidzein. Difructose anhydride III (DFAIII) is a newly manufactured non-digestible disaccharide with unique fermentation properties. The present study evaluated the prebiotic effects of DFAIII on equol production and on plasma cholesterol concentrations {{related to the}} changes in equol production. We compared plasma equol concentrations at 10. 00 and 18. 00 hours and faecal isoflavone excretion in three groups of seven rats (male Wistar-ST strain, 6 weeks old) fed a basal diet or a DFAIII or fructooligosaccharide (15 [*]g/kg diet) diet containing 1 [*]g soya isoflavones/kg diet for 20 [*]d. Equol concentrations in the DFAIII group were {{higher than in the}} control and fructooligosaccharides groups, especially in the later phase of the light period (18. 00 hours) throughout the experiment. Daizein and genistein concentrations did not change between the diet groups. The faecal ratios of equol:daidzein were very high in all groups, but the ratios were higher in the DFAIII group than the control and fructooligosaccharide groups on day 3, and this tendency continued throughout the experiment. On day 20, the plasma total cholesterol concentration was lowest in the DFAIII group. Additionally, the cholesterol concentrations were inversely correlated to plasma equol concentration in all the rats. In conclusion, DFAIII efficiently enhanced plasma equol concentrations, which may be associated with an increase in equol production and a decrease in equol degradation by enterobacteria. Higher plasma equol concentrations may contribute to the hypocholesterolaemic effect of DFAIII feeding...|$|E

40|$|The {{biology and}} {{physiology}} {{of the male}} as well as female reproductive system is hormonally regulated. Abnormalities in the dynamics of hormone production, metabolism and elimination, {{as well as their}} binding to certain target tissues, has been associated with pathophysiological conditions of the reproductive system. Although oestrogens are known {{to be one of the}} major hormone groups in regulating the reproductive function and the fertilization process, the cellular and biochemical mechanism or mechanism(s) via which oestrogens induce their effects are still not fully defined. Moreover, in a modern environment we are also exposed to a wide battery of environmental agents which are structurally similar to oestrogens, and termed 'senvironmental oestrogens'. Because environmental oestrogens have been shown to mimic some of the effects of oestradiol, it has been postulated that these exogenous chemicals may influence or interfere with the oestrogen-dependent reproductive processes, and may be associated with beneficial as well as deleterious effects on the reproductive system. In this regard, two classes of environmental oestrogens have been widely studied, i. e. <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> (plant-derived dietary oestrogens) and xeno-oestrogens (industrial chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyls, DDT, TCDD, dioxins, etc.).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Vegetal Estrogens in Nutrition and the Skeleton (VENUS) project was to evaluate existing data on dietary exposure to compounds with oestrogenic and anti-oestrogenic effects present in plant foods as constituents or contaminants, and to identify and disseminate in vitro and in vivo methodologies to analyse the effects of such compounds on bone. To permit the assessment of exposure to isoflavones in European populations (Italy, the UK, Ireland, The Netherlands), the VENUS database of <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> levels in foods was established. Data on the isoflavone (genistein and daidzein) content of 791 foods, including almost 300 foods commonly consumed in Europe, were collected. Levels of coumestrol, formononetin and biochanin A in {{a limited number of}} foods were also included. Lignan levels (secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol) in 158 foods were incorporated into the database, which also contains information on the references sourced for the compositional data, on the analytical methods used by each author and on the number of foods analysed in each reference. The VENUS database was constructed in Microsoft® Access 2000, which is widely available as part of Microsoft® Office Professional. This paper outlines the procedures used for the selection and evaluation of existing literature data for incorporation into the database. In addition, the design of the database is described, along with the data entry and quality control procedures used in its construction. Limitations of the data are discussed and guidelines for its use are provided.

30|$|The {{effects of}} phyto-oestrogens, plant-based {{compounds}} that exert oestrogen-like effects, on vasomotor menopausal symptoms were assessed in two Cochrane reviews in 2007 and 2013 (Lethaby et al. 2007; Lethaby et al. 2013). The more recent meta-analysis comprised 43 randomised controlled trials {{with a total}} of 4364 participants, however trials with breast cancer survivor had been excluded. Thirty-three of them have also been included in our review. Ten studies were excluded since they did not contain detailed information on HF frequency and/or severity or dealt with (mixed) dietary rather than pharmacological interventions. Certain trials found that some <b>phyto-oestrogen</b> treatments in peri- and post-menopausal women evoked a slight improvement in the frequency and severity of HF and night sweats when compared to placebo (Albertazzi et al. 1998; Scambia et al. 2000; Han et al. 2002; van de Weijer & Barentsen 2002; Jeri 2002; Sammartino et al. 2003; Nahas et al. 2004; Nahas et al. 2007; Khaodhiar et al. 2008; Cheng et al. 2007; Radhakrishnan et al. 2009; Ye et al. 2012; Aso et al. 2012; Mainini et al. 2013; D'Anna et al. 2007; D'Anna et al. 2009; Ferrari 2009; Evans et al. 2011) or with other compounds (Murkies et al. 1995; Crisafulli et al. 2004; Labos et al. 2013). However, many trials were small and confounded by a high risk of bias and unusually high placebo effect. Also, other investigations showed either no or an inconclusive benefit from soy isoflavone administration (Baber et al. 1999; Knight et al. 1999; Upmalis et al. 2000; St Germain et al. 2001; Burke et al. 2003; Faure et al. 2002; Campagnoli et al. 2005; Tice et al. 2003; Penotti et al. 2003; Secreto et al. 2004; Lewis et al. 2006). It is worth mentioning that the study that used the highest dose of isoflavones (200 mg/d) showed an exacerbation of HF symptoms (Levis et al. 2011). Those studies that compared phyto-oestrogens in breast and prostate cancer survivors likewise showed no conclusive evidence that phytooestrogen supplements effectively reduce HF (Quella et al. 2000; Van Patten et al. 2002; Nikander et al. 2003; MacGregor et al. 2005; Sharma et al. 2009).

40|$|<b>Phyto-oestrogens</b> are plant {{compounds}} structurally {{similar to}} oestradiol, {{which have been}} proposed to have protective effects against breast cancer. The main class of <b>phyto-oestrogens</b> in the Western diet is lignans. Literature reports {{on the effect of}} lignans in breast cancer risk have been conflicting. We performed three separate meta-analyses to examine the relationships between (i) plant lignan intake, (ii) enterolignan exposure and (iii) blood enterolactone levels and breast cancer risk. Medline, BIOSIS and EMBASE databases were searched for publications up to 30 September 2008, and 23 studies were included in the random effects meta-analyses. Overall, there was little association between high plant lignan intake and breast cancer risk (11 studies, combined odds ratio (OR) : 0. 93, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : 0. 83 – 1. 03, P= 0. 15), but this association was subjected to marked heterogeneity (I 2 = 44 %). Restricting the analysis to post-menopausal women, high levels of plant lignan intake were associated with reduced breast cancer risk (7 studies, combined OR: 0. 85, 95 % CI: 0. 78, 0. 93, P< 0. 001) and heterogeneity was markedly reduced (I 2 = 0 %). High enterolignan exposure was also associated with breast cancer (5 studies, combined OR: 0. 73, 95 % CI: 0. 57, 0. 92, P= 0. 009) but, again, there was marked heterogeneity (I 2 = 63 %). No association was found with blood enterolactone levels (combined OR: 0. 82, 95 % CI: 0. 59 – 1. 14, P= 0. 24).
