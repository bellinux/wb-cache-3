40|$|This study {{investigates the}} process for {{manufacturing}} of petroleum resin from pyrol-ysis gasoline feedstock taken from Tabriz Petrochemical Company. These resinshave been used extensively {{in a wide variety}} of areas such as adhesives, paint, and printing inks industries.

The resins were characterized by 1 H NMR and IR spectroscopy and the effective factors in the production of <b>petroleum</b> <b>resins,</b> reaction temperature, amount of catalyst and sol-vent types were analyzed. Analysis of the polymerization temperature demonstrates that resins with high molecular weights and softening points are produced at low tempera-tures. The optimal amount of catalyst to prepare resins with high molecular weight and softening point is achieved at 0. 45 - 1. 25 wt % of the feedstock. When polymerization takes place in the presence of aromatic solvents, the molecular weight and softening point of resins are reduced. The addition of compounds such as indene and styrene led to an increase in molecular weight and softening point while it reduced the resin yield dramat-ically. These compounds can be utilized to regulate molecular weight...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{extremely}} wide {{molecular weight}} distribution {{and the ability to}} form molecular aggregates at different intensity at different chemical and physical condition, only average chemical structures and properties of asphaltenes and resins could be established so far. Stability of asphaltene in crude oil depends upon a variety of factors (temperature, pressure, composition, pH, etc.) of which resin content in oil is attributed to have the greatest influence (Andersen and Speight 2001). It is an established fact that <b>petroleum</b> <b>resins</b> with lesser aromaticity but higher polarity compared with asphaltene act as peptizing agents and help stabilizing asphaltene–resin colloids. The mechanism behind this molecular association is believed to be due to opposite surface charge of resins and asphaltene moieties (Taylor 1998). It is observed that destabilization of colloidal asphaltene in oil production systems may occur if the surface charge and the resulting attraction forces between adsorbed resins and asphaltenes are disturbed (Leontaritis 1989; Alkafeef 2001). Later works of Fotland and Anfindsen (1996) and Behar et al. (1998) on electrical conductivity of asphaltene helped in understanding their molecular association phenomena in solution phase, while works of Igor and Aleksander (2010) on electrical conductivity of solid asphaltenes showed that asphaltenes in solid state behave like semiconductors, conductivity increasing at higher temperature, possibly due to structural phase transition.|$|E

The figures and tables contained in this report are designed {{so that they could}} effectively support the discussion about molecular make-up of petroleum fluids, P- and T-effects on phase behavior and phase transition points. Seven naturally occurring hydrocarbon fluids are known as petroleum fluids. They include, in the order of their fluidity, natural gas, gas-condensate (NGL), light crude, intermediate crude, heavy oil, tar sand and oil shale. In this report we present a generalized description of the various phase transitions, which may occur in petroleum fluids with emphasis on heavy organics deposition. At first the nature of every petroleum fluid is presented. Their constituents including their socalled impurities are identified and categorized. Heavy fractions in petroleum fluids are discussed and their main families of constituents are presented including petroleum wax, diamondoids, asphaltenes and <b>petroleum</b> <b>resins.</b> Then the generalized petroleum fluids phase behavior is discussed in light of the known theory of phase transitions. The effects of variations of composition, temperature and pressure on the phase behavior of petroleum fluids are introduced. Finally eleven distinct phase-transition points of petroleum fluids are presented and their relation with state variables and constituents of petroleum fluids are identified. This report is to generalize and relate phase behaviors of all the seven naturally occurring petroleum fluids into a unified perspective.

The culture was acclimatized {{for a period}} of two months to grow in mineral salt medium contained phenol as the sole carbon source. Minimum and maximum concentrations of 50 and 1000 mg/l of phenol in the medium were used for the purpose of culture adaptation. The goals of these experiments were to determine the kinetics of biodegradation by determination of biomass growth rates and phenol concentrations with respect to incubation time. Substrate inhibition kinetics and specific growth rate were defined while data were fitted in Haldane model. The specific growth rate, half-saturation and inhibition coefficients for Haldane model were 0. 067 hG, 25. 32 and 200 mg/l, respectively. The biokinetic parameters were used to predict the biodegradation 1 profile, which was quite consistent with the obtained experimental data.

The evidence shows that there are different effects of oil prices volatility on product prices across individual industries, owing to technical levels, distinct capital scales, and various dependences for crude oil. As the oil price has increased, the production costs of the <b>petroleum</b> chemical industry, <b>resin</b> industry, and synthetic fiber industry have {{a huge amount of}} increases, but the impacts apparently drop off because of change in technical level and industrial structures. Furthermore, the ability of bringing down inflation in Taiwan has lifted after the oil crisis. It follows the lower impacts of increases in oil price on price levels (consumer price index, producer price index, and corporate goods price index). In addition, the price elasticity of import gradually decreases due to change in the input technical level of imported goods and production structural adjustment. Moreover, the function of input technical changes in imported goods brings down inflation. 本研究以「產業關聯價格模型」探討國際原油價格上漲對台灣產業生產成本與物價水準的影響。研究結果顯示，由於產業間存在著技術與資本的差異，以及對原油的依存度不同，原油價格變動對個別產業的產品價格影響亦有所差別。當國際原油價格上漲時，國內石油煉製、燃氣與石油化工等產業的生產成本上升幅度較其他產業大，但由於生產技術的提升與產業結構的調整，使得原油價格上漲所帶來的衝擊與 1980 年代相比有顯著改善。此外，石油危機後台灣經濟抑制通貨膨脹的能力也有提高，因此消費者物價指數（CPI）、生產者物價指數（PPI）與企業物價指數（CGPI）的變動幅度趨於和緩。再者，國內輸入價格彈性逐年下降，主要是因為「輸入財投入技術變動」與「國內生產結構調整」兩項因素獲得改善，同時「輸入財投入技術變動」也發揮抑制通貨膨脹的效果...|$|R

A biobased thermoset resin {{was developed}} from a non-edible waste starch source obtained from mango processing industry and further reinforced with microfibrillated cellulose and sisal fibers {{to form a}} hybrid composite. Starch {{was obtained from the}} defatted mango seed kernel (DMSK) cake using simple filtration process. The mango seed kernel (MSK) starch was crosslinked using a benign crosslinker 1, 2, 3, 4 -butane tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) using two different catalysts, sodium propionate (NaP), a novel green catalyst, and the currently used sodium hypophosphite (SHP). Properties and characteristics of the crosslinked resin prepared using the two catalysts were studied and compared. To improve the resin strength, it was crosslinked and reinforced with a commercially available microfibrillated cellulose (MFC). MFC was completely homogenized with water and starch in order to achieve good dispersion of MFC in the starch. It was observed that with the increase in the MFC content, the tensile properties of the resin improved. Further, sisal fibers were modified using a combination of alkali treatment and drying under tension to enhance their tensile properties. Alkali treatment removed hemicellulose and lignin keeping pure cellulose that results in better adhesion with the starch. Hybrid unidirectional composites were fabricated using the strength-enhanced sisal fibers, MFC and the crosslinked MSK starch. The final hybrid composites fabricated showed Young's modulus of about 8. 5 GPa and tensile strength of around 165 GPa. While these composites are inexpensive, they can replace wood and wood based products such as particle boards, wafer boards, medium density fiber boards.

50|$|Another {{example from}} the pre-modern period is {{the siege of}} Constantinople in 717-718 AD. At that time, the Isaurian dynasty of {{emperors}} ruled in Constantinople. The Isaurian dynasty's founder, Leo the Isaurian, originally named Konon, was commander of the theme (i.e. province) of Anatolia, appointed by the Emperor Anastasius II Artemius. During Konon's term as general of the Anatolics, the Emperor Anastasius II had been deposed by the troops of the elite Opsician regiment, and replaced by an unwilling tax collector named Theodosius. He (Theodosius) finally accepted the offer of the purple, and was made Emperor Theodosius III. Theodosius, however, alienated {{the support of the}} Opsicians, and Konon, changing his name to Leo, took advantage of this and decided to use them to take the purple for himself. He allied with Artabasdus, the commander of the theme of Armenia, and was able to depose Theodosius III, becoming Leo III upon his accession to the Byzantine throne. Meanwhile, the leaders of the Islamic Empire took advantage of the violent anarchy within the Byzantine state to prepare a huge host, comprising more than 100,000 troops and 1,800 ships, to take them to the capital Constantinople. Upon arriving outside the Theodosian walls, the Arab host had some knowledge that the Emperor Leo had allied with Bulgaria under their khan Tervel, and so in preparation for the Bulgarian army, built such military investments, but they failed to work, and so the Arab army was defeated by a number of factors; the failure of their circumvallations and contravallations, the lack of supplies {{near the end of the}} siege, the (mostly) sudden and shocking arrival of Tervel's Bulgarian army, and most importantly, the use of a dangerously flammable substance invented by the Byzantines, an unknown mix of various ingredients that may have included naphtha, saltpetre, <b>petroleum,</b> pine <b>resin,</b> calcium phosphide, quicklime, sulphur and niter, that was called ″sea fire″ (Ancient Greek: πῦρ θαλάσσιον pyr thalássion) or ″Roman fire″ (πῦρ ῥωμαϊκόν pyr rhomaïkón), but is called Greek fire in modern historiography due to the Crusaders′ thinking that the Byzantine state was an Empire of the Greeks.|$|R
3000|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} environmental problems faced by the world is management of wastes (Anupama et al. 2013). Industrial processes generate a variety of molecules that may pollute air and waters due to negative impacts such as toxicity, carcinogenic and mutagenic properties (Busca et al. 2008). Phenols are the major organic constituents found in effluents of coal conversion processes, coke ovens, <b>petroleum</b> refineries, phenolic <b>resin</b> manufacturing, herbicide manufacturing, fiberglass manufacturing and petrochemicals (El-Ashtoukhy et al. 2013; Veeresh et al. 2004; [...] Jadhav and Vanjara 2004). Phenol and its derivatives are a major source of environmental pollutants (Said et al. 2013; Varma and Gaikwad 2008). Phenol, a waste product of industrial processes that is introduced into aquatic ecosystems, adversely affects the indigenous biota, including algae, protozoa, invertebrates, and vertebrates (Babich and Davis 1981). The concentrations of these compounds can range from one to several hundred mg/L (Moussavi et al. 2008). Industrial wastewaters associated with the manufacture of halogenated organics characteristically have concentrations as high as hundreds of mg/L (Annachatre and Gheewala 1996). Water pollution by organic and inorganic compounds is of great public concern (Pradeep et al. 2014). Their fate in the environment is of great importance as they are toxic, recalcitrant and bioaccumulating in organisms (Annachatre and Gheewala 1996). As it adversely affects the aquatic biota, phenol is one of the 129 specific priority chemicals that is considered toxic under the 1977 Amendments to the Clean Water Act and for which the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued water quality criteria (Singh et al. 2013; Babich and Davis 1981). Phenol at concentration as low as 5  mg/L imparts typical smell upon chlorination and the World Health Organization (WHO) prescribed 1  mg/L as the maximum permissible concentration of phenol in drinking water (Saravanan et al. 2008).|$|R

Several adsorbents have been investigated earlier such as activated carbon [12], biosorbents [13], clays [14], zeolites [15] and synthetic resins [16, 17]. An ideal adsorbent should have features of strong affinity to target sorbate, large surface area and high pore volume with more binding sites. In recent years, ordered mesoporous molecular sieves such as SBA-n, MCM- 41 and MCM- 48 have attracted much attention as adsorbents [18]. MCM- 48 presents as a more attractive candidate as an adsorbent or catalyst support than MCM- 41, since the highly interwoven and branched structure provides many places where reactant molecules can avoid pore blockages [19]. Then, the regular pore network of MCM- 48 provides more favorable mass transfer kinetics than the unidirectional pore system of MCM- 41 leading to a perfect reactor for the synthesis of nanocomposites. Modification with ligands, such as amines, carbonates and organosulfides, on the surface of mesoporous materials is necessary to obtain specific adsorption and larger capacity [20, 21]. Silanol groups and amino groups are effective for the adsorption of organic compounds due to their high adsorption energy or potential charge association. In addition, the presence of free electron pairs on amine group within mesopores of MCM- 48 materials should lead to sorptive properties for weak acidic organic compounds in water [22]. Researchers have used ligands containing multi-amine groups in a chain [23, 24] or ligands involving dendrimer-amines [25] to increase removal efficiency of these compounds into the mesoporous structure. Melamine-based dendrimer amines (MDAs) are such ideal dendrimer ligands due to intensively binding amine sites and also to their enhanced hydrophilic silica surface compared to analogous adsorbents. MDAs were first reported in 2000 by Simanek and Zhang [26], but they have not been applied for phenolic compounds. The traditional adsorbents such as activated carbon are difficult to be separated after water treatment. Conventional methods such as centrifugation, precipitation and filtration are not only labor-consumptive but also uneconomical. Therefore, convenient and effective separation methods are in urgent demand. Magnetic adsorbent can be easily and rapidly separated from aqueous solutions under an external magnetic field due to their magnetic property and has the advantages of simplicity, high efficiency and sensitivity as well as low costs [18].Therefore, introducing Fe 3 O 4 which features superparamagnetism into the prepared adsorbent {{is a good way to}} resolve the problem of separation.|$|R
