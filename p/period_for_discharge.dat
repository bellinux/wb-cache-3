40|$|The {{degree of}} belief we have in {{predictions}} from hydrologic models depends on how well they can reproduce observations. Calibrations with traditional performance measures such as the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency are challenged by problems including: (1) uncertain discharge data, (2) variable importance of the performance with flow magnitudes, (3) influence of unknown input/output errors and (4) inability to evaluate model performance when observation time <b>periods</b> <b>for</b> <b>discharge</b> and model input data do not overlap. A new calibration method using flow-duration curves (FDCs) was developed which addresses these problems. The method focuses on reproducing the observed discharge frequency distribution rather than the exact hydrograph. It consists of applying limits of acceptability for selected evaluation points (EPs) of the observed uncertain FDC in the extended GLUE approach. Two ways of selecting the EPs were tested – based on equal intervals of discharge and of volume of water. The method was tested and compared to a calibration using the traditional model efficiency for the daily four-parameter WASMOD model in the Paso La Ceiba catchment in Honduras and for Dynamic TOPMODEL evaluated at an hourly time scale for the Brue catchment in Great Britain. The volume method of selecting EPs gave the best results in both catchments with better calibrated slow flow, recession and evaporation than the other criteria. Observed and simulated time series of uncertain <b>discharges</b> agreed better <b>for</b> this method both in calibration and prediction in both catchments without resulting in overpredicted simulated uncertainty. An advantage with the method is that the rejection criterion {{is based on an}} estimation of the uncertainty in discharge data and that the EPs of the FDC can be chosen to reflect the aims of the modelling application e. g. using more/less EPs at high/low flows. While the new method is less sensitive to epistemic input/output errors than the normal use of limits of acceptability applied directly to the time series of discharge, it still requires a reasonable representation of the distribution of inputs. Additional constraints might therefore be required in catchments subject to snow. The results suggest that the new calibration method can be useful when observation time <b>periods</b> <b>for</b> <b>discharge</b> and model input data do not overlap. The new method could also be suitable for calibration to regional FDCs while taking uncertainties in the hydrological model and data into account...|$|R
40|$|Overbank {{flooding}} {{caused by}} historically high flows, {{such as that}} in the Rio Mundaú watershed (lying between the states of Alagoas and Pernambuco) in 2010, has been the cause of widespread damage. The purpose of work described in this paper was to propose a mapping of areas liable to flooding in the township of Rio Largo (Alagoas) in the Rio Mundaú watershed {{by means of an}} “off-line” coupling of the hydrological/hydraulic models (MGB-IPH/ HEC-RAS), through consideration of extreme floods with different return <b>periods</b> <b>for</b> <b>discharge.</b> The hydrological model had a parameterization appropriate for extreme floods, using as input rainfall data with different return periods. Calibration and validation of the hydrological model were adequate in drainage areas larger than 1500 km 2, but were less acceptable in headwater drainage areas where different geology and soil cover gave rise to surface runoff. The hydraulic model showed good agreement with point observations of flood levels in 2010 in both rural and urban areas along the water-course (R² = 0. 99; RMSE = 1. 41 m and CV (RMSE) = 0. 04). In urban areas distant from the river, however, flood levels were over-estimated, indicating a need to use more detailed Digital Elevation Models. Flood events with return period greater than 50 years have the potential to cause great damage (floods exceeding 0. 46 km 2 in the urban area). The study showed that the use of coupled models was a viable approach for mapping areas liable to flooding, when {{it is not possible to}} analyse local flow frequencies in support of a hydraulic model...|$|R

The data from successive inter-ELM periods during an otherwise steady-state phase of the discharges were combined into a composite inter-ELM <b>period</b> <b>for</b> the purpose of increasing the number of data points in the analysis. These composite periods were partitioned into sequential intervals to examine inter-ELM transport evolution. The GTEDGE integrated modeling code was used to calculate and interpret plasma transport and properties during each interval using particle, momentum, and energy balance. Variation of diffusive and non-diffusive (pinch) particle, momentum, and energy transport over the inter-ELM <b>period</b> are examined <b>for</b> <b>discharges</b> with plasma currents from 0. 5 to 1. 5 MA and inter-ELM periods from 50 to 220 ms. Diffusive transport is dominant for ρ 0. 95, and are taken into account. During the inter-ELM period, diffusive transport increases slightly more than non-diffusive transport, increasing total outward transport. Both diffusive and non-diffusive transport have a strong inverse correlation with plasma current. Weakening the electromagnetic pinch may increase outward particle transport, and enable control over the rebuilding of the edge pedestal between ELMs. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to develop}} a set of quality {{indicators}} for postnatal care after discharge from the hospital, using a systematic approach. Design: key elements of qualitative postnatal care were defined by performing a systematic review and the literature was searched for potential indicators (step 1). The potential indicators were evaluated by five criteria (validity, reliability, sensitivity, feasibility and acceptability) and by making use of the 'Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation', the AIRE-instrument (step 2). In a modified Delphi-survey, the quality indicators were presented to {{a panel of experts}} in the field of postnatal care using an online tool (step 3). The final results led to a Flemish model of postnatal care (step 4). Setting: Flanders, Belgium Participants: health care professionals, representatives of health care organisations and policy makers with expertise in the field of postnatal care. Findings: after analysis 57 research articles, 10 reviews, one book and eight other documents resulted in 150 potential quality indicators in seven critical care domains. Quality assessment of the indicators resulted in 58 concept quality indicators which were presented to an expert-panel of health care professionals. After two Delphi-rounds, 30 quality indicators (six structure, 17 process, and seven outcome indicators) were found appropriate to monitor and improve the quality of postnatal care after discharge from the hospital. Key conclusions and implications for clinical practice: the quality indicators resulted in a Flemish model of qualitative postnatal care that was implemented by health authorities as a minimum standard in the context of shortened length of stay. Postnatal care should be adjusted to a flexible length of stay and start in pregnancy with an individualised care plan that follows mother and new-born throughout pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal <b>period.</b> Criteria <b>for</b> <b>discharge</b> and local protocols about the organisation and content of care are essential to facilitate continuity of care...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to spatially quantify diffuse pollution sources and estimate the potential efficiency of applying riparian buffer zones as a conservation practice for mitigating chemical pollutant losses. This study was conducted using a semi-distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model that underwent extensive calibration and validation in the Sulejów Reservoir catchment (SRC), which occupies 4900 km 2 in central Poland. The model was calibrated and validated against daily discharges (10 gauges), NO 3 -N and TP loads (7 gauges). Overall, the model generally performed well during the calibration period but not during the validation <b>period</b> <b>for</b> simulating <b>discharge</b> and loading of NO 3 -N and TP. Diffuse agricultural sources appeared to be the main contributors to the elevated NO 3 -N and TP loads in the streams. The existing, default representation of buffer zones in SWAT uses a VFS sub-model that only affects the contaminants present in surface runoff. The results of an extensive monitoring program carried out in 2011 – 2013 in the SRC suggest that buffer zones are highly efficient for reducing NO 3 -N and TP concentrations in shallow groundwater. On average, reductions of 56 % and 76 % were observed, respectively. An improved simulation of buffer zones in SWAT was achieved through empirical upscaling of the measurement results. The mean values of the sub-basin level reductions are 0. 16 kg NO 3 /ha (5. 9 %) and 0. 03 kg TP/ha (19. 4 %). The buffer zones simulated using this approach contributed 24 % for NO 3 -N and 54 % for TP to the total achieved mean reduction at the sub-basin level. This result suggests that additional measures are needed to achieve acceptable water quality status in all water bodies of the SRC, {{despite the fact that the}} buffer zones have a high potential for reducing contaminant emissions...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 years {{there have been}} {{dramatic}} changes in health care financing in the United States, such as Medicare's Prospective Payment System for hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries, and in health services delivery, such as the growth in health maintenance organizations {{and other forms of}} managed care. These changes have occurred largely in response to payors' concerns about the rising cost of health care. A study of such changes in financing and delivery, and how specific groups of patients are affected is necessary so that the effects of these changes on patients' health can be determined. We examined the hospitalization rates for patients with musculoskeletal diseases in Michigan from 1980 through 1987. During this period, the overall ageadjusted hospitalization rates decreased 7. 0 % per year (p = 0. 001). The decrease occurred less <b>for</b> surgical <b>discharges</b> (6. 0 % per year) than <b>for</b> medical <b>discharges</b> (8. 6 % per year) (p < 0. 001). While these overall trends are of interest, they obscure disease-specific trends that vary significantly from both the overall, and the medical and surgical trends. For example, while surgical discharges, in general declined, procedures related to major joint and limb reattachment (DRG # 209) increased at a rate of 6. 3 % per year. And while medical discharges in general decreased over this <b>period,</b> <b>discharges</b> <b>for</b> osteomyelitis increased 5. 4 % per year.

There is limited knowledge about admitted persons’ experience of their readiness <b>for</b> <b>discharge</b> from acute psychiatric wards. This study aims to describe and understand how persons with psychotic illness experience to become ready <b>for</b> <b>discharge</b> during their stay on an acute psychiatric ward. Method: During their hospital stay, 12 persons who recently had acute psychotic illness were interviewed about their experiences related to their upcoming discharge.

40|$|The Mandovi and Zuari are two {{tropical}} estuaries {{along the}} west coast of India, characterized by mixed tides with semi-diurnal dominance and heavy fresh water influx during the southwest monsoon (June to September). Previous observations of tides in these estuaries show that the tidal effects in the upstream regions are subject to decay due to freshwater influx during the southwest monsoon. The longitudinal distribution of salinity in these estuaries undergoes large variations between the southwest monsoon and the dry season (February to May). The main objectives of the present study were to simulate the tidal circulation, the longitudinal distribution of salinity and the freshwater influence on tides and the salinity distribution. Another objective was to study the intra-seasonal variations of salinity during the breaks in the southwest monsoon. A hybrid network numerical model was used for the present study to simulate the tidal circulation and the salinity distribution in these estuaries. The model reproduced observed tides accurately during the dry and wet seasons. The model could reproduce the longitudinal distribution of salinity well during the dry season and the simulation of salinity distribution was reasonably well during the wet season. The simulated tidally-averaged salinities over the M 2 tidal <b>period</b> <b>for</b> varying river <b>discharges</b> show that even a small freshwater influx can affect the longitudinal distribution of salinity to a great extent in this type of estuaries...|$|R
