2500|$|Nicholas's casting in {{the role}} was praised by All About Soap, who said, [...] "We reckon this is ace casting—doesn't he look like he belongs in Walford? We can just <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> in The Vic!" [...] Discussing Gavin's first scene in the show, Daily Mail TV critic Jim Shelley said the character's arrival [...] "wasn't quite as revelatory or as menacing as the writers must have assumed." [...] Frances Taylor, writing on BT Group website, said that Gavin's {{introduction}} [...] "got the nation talking about EastEnders for all the right reasons".|$|E
2500|$|One such {{author was}} Samuel Boyse. [...] Contemporary {{accounts}} <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> as a dishonest and disreputable rogue, paid {{for each individual}} line of prose as a Jack of all trades, master of none. [...] He apparently lived in squalor, often drunk, and on one occasion after pawning his shirt, he fashioned a replacement out of paper. [...] To be a called a 'Grub Street author' was therefore often viewed as an insult, however Grub Street hack James Ralph defended the trade of the journalist, contrasting it with the supposed hypocrisy of more esteemed professions: ...|$|E
60|$|Henceforth her {{imagination}} was to <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> only with Isabel Conway.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wrenn, <b>picturing</b> <b>him</b> {{greeting}} the Singer Tower from {{an incoming}} steamer, longed {{to see the}} tower.|$|R
50|$|Velocio died at St-Étienne, France. His {{obituary}} in the Gazette of the Cyclists' Touring Club <b>pictured</b> <b>him</b> with an open-framed small-wheel bicycle.|$|R
50|$|The only {{surviving}} {{picture of}} James Hall <b>pictures</b> <b>him</b> {{standing with his}} friend William McNally. McNally was a winner of the Victoria Cross and a resident of Murton.|$|R
6000|$|... 'After {{writing that}} we may <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> turning this same sword in this same way, and falling on it thus.' He {{inclined}} his body forward as he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Syne when they're a'sitting breathless {{listening}} to his preaching,' she says, 'they'll be able to <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> as a bairn, just as I often do in the kirk mysel'.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “He looks a {{different}} kind of boy altogether,” the captain said. “You could pick him out as a fisher boy anywhere, and <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> in high boots, baggy corduroy breeches, and blue guernsey.” ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Forster looked with {{surprise}} at the strong, well knit figure. He had not before seen Bathurst, and had <b>pictured</b> <b>him</b> to himself as a weak, puny man.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is little}} fear of that, mother," [...] I replied confidently. [...] "Commodore Barney {{is not the}} man Darius has <b>pictured</b> <b>him,</b> if he allows such a villain to escape." ...|$|R
5|$|After CM Punk {{left the}} Allstate Arena with the WWE Championship belt, celebrity website TMZ <b>pictured</b> <b>him</b> showing off his newly won title belt {{on the streets}} of Chicago with Colt Cabana and Ace Steel.|$|R
60|$|Of a lofty God, Almighty, incomprehensible; so {{far above}} us, so {{different}} from us, that we cannot <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> to ourselves; of a glory and majesty utterly beyond all human fancy or imagination.|$|E
60|$|I {{threw my}} mind {{back to the}} red-faced chappie I had met at the restaurant, and tried to <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> cutting up rough. It was only too easy. I spoke to Corky firmly on the telephone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Make {{the fellow}} nice," [...] is his advice. [...] "Let every woman reader <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> {{to herself as}} her {{particular}} man. Then everything he says and does becomes of importance to her. She is careful not to miss a word." ...|$|E
60|$|IV. If a jackass were to {{describe}} the Deity he would represent Him with long ears and a tail. Man's ideal is the higher and truer one; he <b>pictures</b> <b>Him</b> as somewhat resembling a man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] said Holmes, [...] "he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but I {{dare say}} that there was a lurking devil in his eyes. I had <b>pictured</b> <b>him</b> as a more robust and ruffianly person." ...|$|R
60|$|Salome <b>pictured</b> <b>him</b> so, {{with his}} long, curling lashes {{brushing}} his rosy, tear-stained cheek and his chubby fists clasped tightly over his breast {{as was his}} habit; her heart grew warm and thrilling with the maternity the picture provoked.|$|R
60|$|Seaforth {{said nothing}} further. He knew his comrade too well, and could <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> {{clinging}} {{by hand and}} heel as he crawled along the brink of the declivity with the lake below, and gasped from relief when once more a dim whitened object lurched {{up out of the}} snow.|$|E
60|$|Leopold Hirsch, {{having done}} the awful deed, had fled, of course, but his victim {{might not be}} dead, he might be only wounded and dying for want of succour. Klara--closing her eyes--could almost <b>picture</b> <b>him,</b> groaning and perhaps trying to drag himself up in a vain {{endeavour}} to get help.|$|E
60|$|I said I had {{no doubt}} that Mr. Peggotty well {{deserved}} these treasures. I must acknowledge that I felt it difficult to <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> quite at his ease in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece, and that I was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat; but I kept these sentiments to myself.|$|E
60|$|Bob, {{though not}} tall, was {{not likely to}} be {{specially}} selected for shortness. She <b>pictured</b> <b>him</b> on the upper deck, in his snow-white trousers and jacket of navy blue, looking perhaps towards the very point of land where she then was.|$|R
60|$|She had speculated as {{she went}} on Joe's {{probable}} attitude. She had <b>pictured</b> <b>him</b> as annoyed, even rude. What she was not prepared for was to find him on all fours, grunting and rooting about {{in a pile of}} papers. She stopped short.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, Syria {{issued a}} postage stamp commemorating Noguès and the ten years of {{operations}} on the Paris-Damascus air route. That same year Lebanon issued {{a postage stamp}} <b>picturing</b> <b>him</b> and commemorating the tenth anniversary of the first Marseille-Beirut flight, which was made by Noguès.|$|R
60|$|Challenger presided with a solemnity {{as if he}} {{were the}} Lord Chief Justice on the Bench. <b>Picture</b> <b>him</b> seated upon a rock, his absurd boyish straw hat tilted on the back of his head, his supercilious eyes {{dominating}} us from under his drooping lids, his great black beard wagging as he slowly defined our present situation and our future movements.|$|E
6000|$|Always {{the quaint}} form of his humor, {{no matter how}} dark the way. [...] We may <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> walking the floor, planning, scheming, and [...] smoking--always smoking--trying {{to find a way}} out. It was not the [...] kind of scheming that many men have done under the circumstances; [...] not scheming to avoid payment of debts, but to pay them.|$|E
60|$|Having {{come more}} into the open he could now be seen rising against the sky, his profile {{appearing}} on the light background like {{the portrait of a}} gentleman in black cardboard. It assumed the form of a low-crowned hat, an ordinary-shaped nose, an ordinary chin, an ordinary neck, and ordinary shoulders. What he consisted of further down was invisible from lack of sky low enough to <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> on.|$|E
5000|$|According to Skiljan, the IrfanView logo and mascot is a [...] "road cat" [...] (there is a tire track {{across the}} {{smallest}} icon) {{but that he}} [...] "likes cats", and the icon is [...] "a joke" [...] - the IrfanView website <b>pictures</b> <b>him</b> holding a white domestic cat.|$|R
25|$|A life-sized <b>picture</b> of <b>him</b> is {{displayed}} in Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. Another <b>picture</b> of <b>him</b> {{is in an}} interactive display {{in the lobby of}} Asia Society in New York City. In 2000, A Magazine ranked him the 6th of the 25 Most Influential Asian Americans.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] A forlorn little [...] "Oh!" [...] it was. She had <b>pictured</b> <b>him</b> proudly {{planning}} to surprise her. And {{she longed to}} have the best possible impression of him, because of a certain plan which was hotly being hammered out in her brain. She went on, as brightly as possible: ...|$|R
60|$|MATEY. You won't {{know about}} razors, my lady, not being married--as yet--excuse me. But a married lady {{can tell a}} man's age {{by the number of}} his razors. (A little scared.) If you saw his razors--there is a little world of them, from patents of the present day back to {{implements}} so horrible, you can <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> with them in his hand scraping his way through the ages.|$|E
60|$|Kit {{studied his}} hosts. Mrs. Austin was slender and small. Her skin was olive and he noted some white in her hair. She was very graceful, but her glance was rather {{thoughtful}} than commanding. Austin loafed in his easy-chair. He was handsome, but looked languid--his hands {{were white and}} finely-shaped, his glance was careless. Kit could hardly <b>picture</b> <b>him</b> the hero of Macallister's romantic tale. In fact, Austin and Jacinta rather disappointed Kit.|$|E
6000|$|So saying, {{from the}} {{pavement}} he half rose, [...] Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, [...] And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes [...] As in a <b>picture.</b> <b>Him</b> Sir Bedivere [...] Remorsefully regarded through his tears, [...] And would have spoken, {{but he found}} not words; [...] Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, [...] O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, [...] And rising bore him through the place of tombs.|$|E

5000|$|During a 1992 {{write-in}} bid for Dane County sheriff, Masel's campaign poster <b>pictured</b> <b>him</b> naked {{with the}} slogan: [...] "Nothing to Hide, Masel for Sheriff." [...] He {{got more than}} 7,000 votes. And {{when he made the}} ballot in 1994 as the Democratic candidate for sheriff, Masel received more than 39,000 votes.|$|R
60|$|But as {{she walked}} home, she could not help {{thinking}} about Uncle Richard. He would certainly have cold New Year cheer, enough to chill the whole coming year. She felt sorry for <b>him,</b> <b>picturing</b> <b>him</b> returning from Navarre, cold and hungry, to find a fireless house and an uncooked dinner in the pantry.|$|R
