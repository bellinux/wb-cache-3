On the basis of kinetic parameters and optimum pH values, the mechanisms of the oxidative coupling reactions with the different phenols are discussed.

While carbapyranose 1, 2 -epoxides with β-manno configuration react with good yields and regioselectivity both with O- and N-nucleophiles, ring-opening reactions of 1, 2 -epoxides with α-gluco configuration do not give good results because the opening process is not regioselective and occurs only with some N-nucleophiles as the azido ion and amines.

Recent studies have expanded upon this work to look at more complex species, which involves understanding competing dynamics on two different 1 πσ* potential energy surfaces (PESs) localized on different heteroatom hydride coordinates (O–H and N–H bonds) within the same molecule. In a similar spirit, the work presented here utilizes ultrafast time-resolved velocity map ion imaging to study competing dissociation pathways along 1 πσ* PESs in mequinol (<b>p-methoxyphenol),</b> localized at O–H and O–CH 3 bonds yielding H atoms or CH 3 radicals, respectively, over an excitation wavelength range of 298 – 238 nm and at 200 nm. H atom elimination is found to be operative via either tunneling under a conical intersection (CI) (298 ≥ λ ≥ 280 nm) or ultrafast internal conversion through appropriate CIs (λ ≤ 245 nm), both of which provide mechanisms for coupling onto the dissociative state associated with the O–H bond. In the intermediate wavelength range of 280 ≥ λ ≥ 245 nm, mediated H atom elimination is not observed. In contrast, we find that state driven CH 3 radical elimination is only observed in the excitation range 264 ≥ λ ≥ 238 nm. Interpretation of these experimental results is guided by: (i) high level complete active space with second order perturbation theory (CASPT 2) calculations, which provide 1 -D potential energy cuts of the ground and low lying singlet excited electronic states along the O–H and O–CH 3 bond coordinates; and (ii) calculated excitation energies using CASPT 2 and the equation-of-motion coupled cluster with singles and doubles excitations (EOM-CCSD) formalism. From these comprehensive studies, we find that the dynamics along the O–H coordinate generally mimic H atom elimination previously observed in phenol, whereas O–CH 3 bond fission in mequinol appears to present notably different behavior to the CH 3 elimination dynamics previously observed in anisole (methoxybenzene) ...|$|E
