40|$|Technological advancements {{in small}} sized {{electronic}} circuitry {{has led to}} the development of <b>programmable</b> hearing <b>aids.</b> In some systems, a patient's hearing thresholds are entered into a computer and the computer calculates the gain of the hearing aid for each of the test frequencies. The computer then programs the patient's hearing aid to produce the desired gain at the respective frequencies. It is currently possible to use a probe tube placed in a patient's ear canal to measure the amount of gain a patient receives from a hearing aid. Such measures have been found valid and reliable (Mueller and Bryant, 1991) and have generally become the preferred method of evaluating hearing aid performance (Grahl, 1993). The term real-ear is the label usually used to refer to such measurements. As hearing aid technology changes, clinicians are faced with the task of determining how that new technology can be used to better serve the needs of their hearing-impaired client. <b>Programmable</b> hearing <b>aids</b> may make it possible to provide amplification better matched to patients' hearing losses and ear characteristics. It is important, however, to evaluate whether the results achieved with such hearing aids do in fact provide the anticipated results. It was the purpose of the present investigation to evaluate the gain achieved by a <b>programmable</b> hearing <b>aid</b> system (Ensoniq Sound Selector) with real-ear methods. Specifically, real-ear measures obtained with the Rastronics CCI- 10 / 3 were compared to those of the Ensoniq Sound Selector System.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which aid disbursement delays could be used as an indicator of the aid unpredictability and absorptive capacity in recipient countries. Since many recipient countries are dependent on aid, disbursement delays might matter for its effectiveness. The emphasis is put on the so-called pipeline approach, according to which, in the short run, disbursement constraints may lead to huge delays and weak rates of aid disbursement relative to commitments. After the literature review on disbursement delays, we use the framework of <b>programmable</b> <b>aid</b> to run some econometric estimations through a dynamic model, an ARDL, for a panel of 48 African countries during the period of 1975 – 2008. We find disbursement constraints mainly at the short-run level, while the main donor's specific factors seem to be the selectivity and the degree of aid fragmentation. Disbursement rates and rhythms are also influenced by the economic performance and governance quality of the recipient countries and the share of grants in aid modalities. Bilateral donors are found to under-perform in comparison with multilateral donors in terms of the rhythm of aid disbursement. Foreign aid, absorptive capacity, disbursement delays, panel ARDL...|$|E
40|$|Aid has a {{significant}} impact on governance and public spending in sub-Saharan Africa. In Mozambique (amongst others) aid accounts for more public spending than domestic revenues do. Even in countries less dependent on aid, international donors influence policy making by investing in a technical competitive advantage over domestic policy makers in sectors ranging from climate financing to resilience and public financial management. This doubly affects South Africa both because South Africa is a large recipient of international donor aid and because South Africa is an international donor in its own right in sub-Saharan Africa. The problem is that how international donors set their priorities and allocate their aid at country level is not sufficiently answered in the literature. International donors are seen by many as unpredictable even though they have an outsized influence on domestic policy and spending and are not accountable to the sub-Saharan voters. This research project contributes to the literature on the political economy of donor allocations of aid in sub-Saharan Africa. The research approach focuses on country <b>programmable</b> <b>aid,</b> EU joint programming and donor country strategy papers. The foundation is comparing and contrasting international donors stated policies on 'country programmable aid' with what transpires in practice. Key entry points were the relationship between donor country strategies and the beneficiary country's national development plan, {{and the extent to which}} donors made use of political economy and or context analysis and analysis of sector strategies. The key findings are that there are (and what might even be predictable) patterns in how donors programme their aid at country level, not explained by the particular context nor accounted for in the beneficiary country's national development plan. These patterns relate to a tendency to decontextualize aid programming accompanied with a narrative of donor moral and technological superiority and unrealistic programming objectives. The finding is important because it implies that these patterns result from implicit rules governing how international donors allocate aid, thus making them predictable features of an aid relationship, wanted or unwanted consequences of giving aid...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the failure}} of {{economic}} development in some countries of the region (Madagascar and the Comoros), Lome has been a unique tool for development whose impact has been significant though different {{in each of the}} countries. At the same time, Lome is but one development measure supporting the countries of the region. All of these development programs face the challenge of supporting adaptation to an environment of increasing competition from the newly industrialised Asian economies. As far as Lome's differentiated impact, it can be explained by a series of factors ranging from the historical context to strategic economic choices by each country. While <b>programmable</b> <b>aid</b> has given the recipient countries a central roll in the way the aid will be used, it has suffered from too much emphasis on the short term and insufficient local administrative capabilities. Non-programmable aid, such as payments under STABEX, has been more successful. An appropriate EU response to inadequate development has to come at the regional level. Despite many development constraints, such as the diversity in levels of economic development and the lack of infrastructure, the EU has been and can be instrumental in fostering regional co-operation. The existence of institutions like the Indian Ocean Commission depends partly on EU support. As far as regional co-operation, southern Africa is a special case, requiring graded integration, because of the dominance of the South African economy. New challenges in the future lie in the reshaping of the traditional partnership into a more global economic alliance where regionalisation, differentiation and decentralisation (opening-up to the regional private sector) will be key features of a renewed EU-Indian Ocean co-operation. This reformulation of EU co-operation should be based on the elaboration by the countries of the region of a common position on what needs to be preserved in the 'acquis Lome'.

Fred Waldhauer of Bell Labs heard Villchur lecture on this new hearing aid system, and started a Bell Labs project to develop a hearing aid. Bell Labs assigned a team of experts, including Jont B.

This development circuit and effort was then purchased by Rodney Perkins, who created ReSound. Several of the Bell Labs development team from the Holmdel facility went on to work for ReSound, and bought the rights from them for the technology. Based on the AT&T design, and manufactured by AT&T, a <b>programmable</b> hearing <b>aid</b> based on Villchur's principles was marketed under the ReSound label.

The median residual disability measure from the GHABP remained low (10 - 20 %) over the duration of the study.

40|$|Background and Aims: As {{the hearing}} aid {{technology}} progressively promotes toward replacing analog hearing aids with digital and programmable ones, comparison of the patient satisfaction {{of those kinds of}} hearing aids by means of a valuable tool seems so necessary. So, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare self-reported benefit of analog, digitally controlled programmable and digital hearing aids for reducing disability caused by hearing impairment in mild to severe sensorineural hearing impaired persons. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 90 persons with mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss dividing into three groups: 43 subjects were fitted with digital, 15 with programmable, 32 with analog hearing aids. After pure tone audiometry, Abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit (APHAB) was completed before and one month after using hearing aids to determine the benefit of them. Results: Global APHAB mean scores for digital, programmable and analog hearing aids were 49. 05, 33. 19 and 39. 53, respectively. Ease of Communication subscale mean scores were 53. 46 for digitals, 37. 66 for programmables and 39. 09 for analogs.

The present study assesses the effects of hearing aids on mood, quality of life and caregiver burden when hearing loss, comorbidity and depressive symptoms coexist in the elderly. Methods:  A total of 15 patients aged older than 70  years suffering from hearing loss and depressive mood were recruited. Comorbidity was evaluated by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, functional ability by the Activities of Daily Living scale and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, cognitive capacity by the Mini-mental State Examination and the Clock Drawing Test, psychological status by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale, and quality of life by the Short Form (36) Health Survey. Caregiver burden was appraised by the Caregiver Burden Inventory. Testing was carried out at baseline and at 1 -, 3 - and 6 -month intervals, assessing the use of binaural digital and <b>programmable</b> hearing <b>aids.</b> Results:  Reduction in depressive symptoms and improved quality of life at statistically significant levels were observed early on with the use of hearing aids.

The problem of interest naturally surfaces in broad classes of physical and chemical systems whose dynamic behavior needs to be controlled and favorably shaped by external driving forces. In particular, the formulation of the problem under consideration is mathematically realized through a system of first-order quasi-linear singular invariance partial differential equations (PDEs), and a rather general set of conditions is derived that ensures the existence and uniqueness of a solution.

Management science (MS) techniques and management information systems (MIS) approaches have been used successfully in organizations for <b>aiding</b> <b>programmable</b> decisions. ^ On the other hand, the decision making processes used for unprogrammable decisions are more difficult to model because of the ill-structured nature of the problems in terms of complexity, lack of knowledge about the problems, need for nonquantifiable data, etc. To help managers deal with nonprogrammable (unstructured) decisions, a group of information systems researchers have advocated the decision support system (DSS) approach. ^ A very promising aspect of a DSS is its ability to integrate data access and a decision model which can incorporate multiple and frequently conflicting goals and the subsequent subjective judgement that are characteristic of unstructured decision making. It does so by imbedding the decision model in an information system which uses databases as the integration and communication mechanism between models, data, and user. ^ The first objective {{of this study is to}} design and develop a goal programming imbedded decision support system (GPDSS) with emphasis on system flexibility and user friendliness. GPDSS will support the decision maker in resolving problems with multiple criteria that may involve conflicting objectives, but with emphasis on semi-structured and unstructured decisions.
