40|$|During {{the past}} decade, Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) and Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming (PILP), owing to their {{strength}} in capturing structure information, have {{attracted much attention}} for learning relational models such as weighted logic rules. Typically, a generative model is assumed for the structured joint distribution, and the learning process is accomplished in an enormous relational space. In this paper, we propose a new framework, i. e., Statistical Unfolded Logic (SUL) learning. In contrast to learning rules in the relational space directly, SUL propositionalizes the structure information into an attribute-value data set, and thus, statistical discriminative learning {{which is much more}} efficient than generative relational learning can be executed. In addition to achieving better generalization performance, SUL is able to <b>conduct</b> <b>predicate</b> invention that is hard to be realized by traditional SRL and PILP approaches. Experiments on real tasks show that our proposed approach is superior to state-of-the-art weighted rules learning approaches...|$|R
40|$|Fault {{localization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} difficult activities in software debugging. Many existing statistical fault-localization techniques estimate the fault positions of programs by comparing the program feature spectra between passed runs and failed runs. Some existing approaches develop estimation formulas based on mean values of the underlying program feature spectra and their distributions alike. Our previous work advocates the use of a non-parametric approach in estimation formulas to pinpoint fault-relevant positions. It is worthy of further study to resolve the two schools of thought by examining the fundamental, underlying properties of distributions related to fault localization. In particular, we ask: Can the feature spectra of program elements be safely considered as normal distributions so that parametric techniques can be soundly and powerfully applied? In this paper, we empirically investigate this question from the program <b>predicate</b> perspective. We <b>conduct</b> an experimental study based on the Siemens suite of programs. We examine the degree of normality on the distributions of evaluation biases of the predicates, and obtain three major results from the study. First, almost all examined distributions of evaluation biases are either normal or far from normal, but not in between. Second, the most fault-relevant predicates are less likely to exhibit normal distributions in terms of evaluation biases than other predicates. Our results show that normality is not common as far as evaluation bias can represent. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our non-parametric predicate-based fault-localization technique weakly correlates with the distributions of evaluation biases, making the technique robust to this type of uncertainty in the underlying program spectra.

40|$|We {{have been}} told on countless {{occasions}} {{that we are at}} war against international terrorism. Casualties, both civilian and military, mount in this war-the most noteworthy terrorist attack produced more casualties than the attack on Pearl Harbor. Our military forces are engaged in a multitude of ways, from direct combat overseas, to advising friendly governments and their militaries, to assisting domestic law enforcement. We are advised that this war, like the Cold War before it, will be a long and difficult struggle. But if we are at war, it is {{a very different kind of}} war. Our enemies are not the soldiers of a state. In fact, following the military defeat of the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan, there is no state in the world that overtly claims to be anything other than our ally in this struggle. Al Qaeda 2 ̆ 7 s goals are not to conquer territory, control resources, nor even further traditional political or ideological purposes. They seek weapons of mass destruction-not as deterrents against the actions of other states-but for use at times and in places calculated to cause maximum destruction and horror. The enemy 2 ̆ 2 soldiers 2 ̆ 2 wear no uniforms, have no fixed bases, and are themselves essentially stateless. Yet those with whom we are at war must operate from somewhere. They must store weapons somewhere; they must train and house their fighters somewhere; they must develop their plans somewhere; and their leaders must sleep somewhere. These activities must occur on the territory of some state. Moreover, they must be supported from somewhere. Their weapons must come from somewhere, their funds must come from somewhere, and their supplies must come from somewhere. How can states counter this new threat? If a country is to attack nonstate actors, what is the appropriate <b>predicate</b> to <b>conduct</b> that attack on the territory of another state? Is the current state of international law adequately addressing the relatively recent phenomenon of nonstate terrorist organizations that have many of the indicia of statehood? What are the legal theories that support possible state responses to varying degrees of terrorism? Do states have responsibilities and duties to counter terrorist acts, and do other states have a legal basis upon which they can effectively act if these duties are breached? This Article addresses these questions and submits that, in fact, current international law provides a basis for state actions that respond effectively to terrorist acts. However, this Article argues that the precepts of state responsibility and the commonly accepted 19 th century definition of anticipatory self-defense must be adapted to recognize the technological realities of the 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{comments}} on John C. P. Goldberg 2 ̆ 6 Benjamin C. Zipursky, The Strict Liability in Fault and the Fault in Strict Liability 85 Fordham L. Rev. 743 (2016). In their important writings {{over the past}} twenty years, Professors Goldberg and Zipursky have argued that torts are conduct-based wrongs. A conduct-based wrong is one where an agent violates the right of another by failing to conform her conduct to the standard required by the law. Strict liability in tort poses a formidable challenge to the claim that all torts are wrongs whose distinctive feature is that they violate an applicable standard of conduct. When lawyers speak of strict liability causes of action, they are describing a domain of liability where a plaintiff does not have to prove that the defendant’s conduct was defective in order to recover. Strict liability is liability without regard to defective conduct. Defective conduct may be present, but its presence is not essential to liability. When liability in tort is strict, the basis of liability is not that the defendant’s conduct was defective. The defining characteristics of strict liability in tort are obscured when strict liability torts are recast—in a negligence mold—as conduct-based wrongs. The term “strict liability” has multiple meanings. One meaning—the meaning relevant when we speak of strict liability torts as an overarching form of tort liability—is conceptual. Here, strict liability means liability which is not <b>predicated</b> on defective <b>conduct.</b> Two other meanings are also prominent in tort discourse. These two other meanings are normative, or moral. Some liabilities are strict because they impose liability on conduct that is blameless, morally speaking. Other liabilities are strict because they impose liability on conduct which is justified, not defective. The imposition of strict liability on morally innocent conduct is prominent in connection with autonomy rights—powers of control that the law assigns to people over their own persons and property. The imposition of strict liability on justified conduct is found in various torts that address physical harm. Here, tort law stakes out the claim that even though the conduct responsible for inflicting the harm is justifiable, the failure to repair harm justifiably inflicted is not. Neither form matches the template of a conduct-based wrong...|$|R

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 In the current data movement, numerous {{efforts have been}} made to convert and normalize a large number of traditionally structured and unstructured data to semi-structured data (e. g., RDF, OWL). With the increasing number of semi-structured data coming into the big data community, data integration and knowledge discovery from heterogeneous do mains become important research problems. In the application level, detection of related concepts among ontologies shows a huge potential to do knowledge discovery with big data. In RDF graph, concepts represent entities and predicates indicate properties that connect different entities. It is more crucial to ﬁgure out how different concepts are re lated within a single ontology or across multiple ontologies by analyzing predicates in different knowledge bases. However, the world today is one of information explosion, and it is extremely difﬁcult for researchers to ﬁnd existing or potential predicates to per form linking among cross domains concepts without any support from schema pattern analysis. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a mechanism to do predicate oriented pattern analysis to partition heterogeneous ontologies into closer small topics and generate query to discover cross domains knowledge from each topic. In this work, we present such a model that <b>conducts</b> <b>predicate</b> oriented pattern analysis based on their close relationship and generates a similarity matrix. Based on this similarity matrix, we apply an innovative unsupervised learning algorithm to partition large data sets into smaller and closer topics that generate meaningful queries to fully discover knowledge over a set of interlinked data sources. In this dissertation, we present a graph analytics framework that aims at providing semantic methods for analysis and pattern discovery from graph data with cross domains. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • The deﬁnition of predicate oriented neighborhood measures to determine the neighborhood relationships among different RDF predicates of linked data across do mains; • The design of the global and local optimization of clustering and retrieval algorithms to maximize the knowledge discovery from large linked data: i) top-down clustering, called the Hierarchical Predicate oriented K-means Clustering;ii) bottom up clustering, called the Predicate oriented Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering; iii) automatic topic discovery and query generation, context aware topic path ﬁnding for a given source and target pair; • The implementation of an interactive tool and endpoints for knowledge discovery and visualization from integrated query design and query processing for cross do mains; • Experimental evaluations conducted to validate proposed methodologies of the frame work using DBpedia, YAGO, and Bio 2 RDF datasets and comparison of the pro posed methods with existing graph partition methods and topic discovery methods. In this dissertation, we propose a framework called the GraphKDD. The GraphKDD is able to analyze and quantify close relationship among predicates based on Predicate Oriented Neighbor Pattern (PONP). Based on PONP, the GraphKDD <b>conducts</b> a Hierarchical <b>Predicate</b> oriented K-Means clustering (HPKM) algorithm and a Predicate oriented Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering (PHAL) algorithm to partition graphs into semantically related sub-graphs. In addition, in application level, the GraphKDD is capable of generating query dynamically from topic discovery results and testing reachability be tween source target nodes. We validate the proposed GraphKDD framework through comprehensive evaluations using DBPedia, Yago and Bio 2 RDF datasets.
