40|$|International audienceEmbedded systems highly {{contribute}} to the efficiency, safety, and usability of our present-day means of transport like cars and airplanes. Due to the possible hazards and risks involved with their operation, safety standards like DO- 178 C for avionics and ISO 26262 for automotive commend the application of methods and tools {{according to the state}} of the art. Functional safety requirements imposed on hardware and software imply the detection of malfunctions and taking corrective actions, before hazards actually occur. As described in [5] one of the key challenges thereby is the prediction and verification of the system's timing behavior. In this paper we describe a model-based approach for real-time simulation focusing on complex end-to-end data flows typically encountered in safety-critical automotive control applications. Based on first-hand experiences gained during the development of an electrical <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> system, we illustrate how real-time simulation models can be utilized to guide design decisions, and help to achieve safety goals defined at system level. Furthermore, we discuss the issues of response time analysis for dynamic state-dependent data flows considering different semantics for communication {{in the context of the}} AUTOSAR standard. Engineers developing electrical / electronic systems for the automotive or avionics domain have to manage a high degree of functional, technological, and organizational complexity. Design and implementation of highly dynamic safety-critical applications make a model-based approach with careful consideration of fault tolerance indispensable. A fault-tolerant design follows a safety strategy which defines the (worst) conditions that a system must cope with, and defines safety mechanisms for fault detection and error handling that must be implemented. Such a design ensures that a system experiencing malfunctions remains operational – possibly with reduced functionality – and transits into a safe error-free state. Safety mechanisms built into a system are liable to hard real-time requirements. Hence, the transition into a safe state must be achieved under all possible conditions with respect to a limited time span, the so called fault tolerant time interval (FTTI) as defined in [23]. However, if one considers the many different factors that influence a system's timing behavior, e. g. the number of possible faults and failure states, the complexity of the data and control flow, or the scheduling properties of different hardware and software variants, it turns out, that finding a robust and reliable dynamic architecture design is a very challenging task. The problem of verifying the schedulability of processes and messages in a distributed system is NP-hard [7], and besides hard real-time requirements, for safety-critical systems additional requirements must be considered in order to guarantee dependability...|$|E

The constitutions and working principle of EPS system was introduced. Through the control requirements in EPS system, the MAS-based EPS control strategy and architecture was discussed and the basic function and behavior of every agent was represented.

5000|$|The second {{generation}} Vigor also benefited from Honda deciding to employ double-wishbones {{at both the}} front and rear ends—a layout that spread to other Honda products in subsequent years. While more expensive than competitors' MacPherson strut systems, this setup provided better stability and sharper handling for the vehicle. All had front sway bars and upper models had rear sway bars as well. Brakes were either small 4-wheel discs with twin-piston calipers (only available on the JDM 2.0-Si model [...] ), larger 4-wheel discs with single piston calipers, or a front disc/rear drum system. ABS was available as an option on the 4-wheel disc brake models. Base model Vigors rode on 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps with more expensive models having the option of 14-inch alloy wheels.
