40|$|Geographical {{range is}} {{considered}} a good predictor of the levels of isozyme variation in plants. Widespread species, often consisting of historically larger and more continuous populations, maintain higher polymorphism and are less affected by drift, which tends to erode genetic variation in more geographically restricted species. However, widespread species occurring in small and disjunct populations may not fit this pattern. In this study we examined genetic variation in <b>Pilgerodendron</b> uviferum, a conifer endemic to temperate forests of southern South America, and is such a widespread and habitat-restricted species. Twenty populations along {{the whole range of}} <b>Pilgerodendron</b> were analysed by isozyme electrophoresis to resolve 14 putative genetic loci. Eleven were polymorphic in at least one population although only six of them were polymorphic in more than one population. We found reduced within-population levels of isozyme variation, with only 11 % polymorphic loci (0. 95 criterion), 1. 2 mean number of alleles per locus, and mean observed and expected heterozygosities of 0. 024 and 0. 033, respectively. Most genetic diversity was found within populations (H(T) = 0. 039, H(S) = 0. 033, F(ST) 15 %). Greater polymorphism and lower divergence was estimated in the more geographically restricted and closely related Fitzroya. Thus, total range, in combination with information on the degree of among-population isolation, may be a better predictor of the levels of polymorphism than range size alone...|$|E
40|$|The weevil Aegorhinus superciliosus Guérin (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), {{which is}} endemic to Central-Southern Chile and Argentina, {{is one of}} the major berry pests in Chile and the most {{important}} pest in the La Araucanía Region (38 ° 44 ′ 9 ″S, 72 ° 35 ′ 25 ″W). Due to the poor effectiveness and problems surrounding the implementation of the traditional control methods using organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, new strategies for controlling this pest are needed. In this communication, we evaluated the behavioral responses of male and female A. superciliosus to volatile compounds released from the essential oil (EO) obtained from the heartwood of <b>Pilgerodendron</b> uviferum (D. Don) Florin using olfactometric bioassays. The composition of the EO was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). According to these analyses, δ-cadinol (24. 16 %), cubenol (22. 64 %), 15 -copaenol (15. 46 %) and δ-cadinene (10. 81 %) were the principal components of the EO. The <b>Pilgerodendron</b> uviferum EO, which is almost exclusively composed of sesquiterpenes (99. 5 %), exhibited a repellent effect against A. superciliosus adults, regardless of the sex or concentration used (56. 6 mg/cm 3 and 1. 58 × 10 − 2 mg/cm 3).

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that, owing {{to a lack of}} seed trees, the natural rate of {{recovery}} of fire-disturbed bog forests previously dominated by the endemic and endangered conifer <b>Pilgerodendron</b> uviferum (D. Don) Florin is extremely slow. Hence, increasing the number of seed trees in the landscape through restoration planting could remove the principal biotic filter, limiting recovery of these forests. Here, we analyzed how the success of restoration plantings may be improved through the choice or manipulation of microsites in P. uviferum forests on Chilo&# 233; Island in North Patagonia. For this purpose, we manipulated microtopography in water-logged sites in bogs (mounds, flat terrain, mineral soil) and changed canopy conditions (gaps, semi-open, closed canopy) in upland sites with better drainage. In bogs, there was no significant effect of microtopography on growth and survival of P. uviferum plantings. However, fluorescence measurements indicated lower stress in seedlings established on mounds. Seedlings in upland areas established beneath a nurse canopy had lower mortality and higher relative shoot growth, foliar nutrients, photosynthetic light use efficiency and chlorophyll fluorescence values than those planted in the open. This indicates that seedlings of the slow growing P. uviferum can tolerate extremely wet conditions, yet suffer from stress when grown in the open. Here, the removal of canopy appeared to have also removed or reduced mycorrhizal networks for seedlings, leading to poorer nutrition and growth. Based on these results, recommendations for restoration plantings in highly degraded P. uviferum forests are presented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Cupressaceae, new lateral shoots are {{not present}} at each node ('continuous branching'), {{nor are they}} {{obviously}} grouped in regularly spaced tiers ('rhythmic branching'). Thus, branching pattern in Cupressaceae {{is referred to as}} 'diffuse', although this does not imply that the spatial arrangement of sibling shoots along an axis is completely unpredictable or random. For example, some taxa exhibit regularly alternate branched and unbranched nodes in some axis categories (such as trunk, branch, twig, twiglet), with sibling shoots arranged in a single plane. However in most cases, branching patterns seem more complex or disturbed due to background noise. In order to characterize their variability within the family, we studied different axis categories for several species and genera (Cupressus spp., Austrocedrus chilensis, <b>Pilgerodendron</b> uviferum and Fitzroya cupressoides). Axes were described as a set of sequences, in which index parameters were the node ranks and attached variables were the number of twigs (for a given phyllotaxis). In opposite-decussate phyllotaxy for instance, 0, 1 or a maximum of 2 sibling shoots can develop per node and their arrangement along an axis can be resumed as a succession of 0, 1 or 2 (ex : 10101101020 ). Using statistical models such as variable-order Markov chains and hidden semi-Markov chains, we highlighted hidden regularities and quantified morphological observations. Along axes, we identified homogeneous branching zones defined by contrasted proportions of the number of sibling shoots per node. We also observed that each zone comprised remarkable patterns in the succession of number of sibling shoots (for instance, a mixture of 101001 and 2002). In addition, for a given species, different branching patterns were identified for different axis categories and such patterns could be ordered and related to morphogenetic gradients...|$|E
40|$|The present {{knowledge}} of temperature variability {{during the past}} millennium has been greatly improved due to an increasing availability of reconstructions made based on paleoclimate proxies, such as tree-rings. These improvements however, do not suffice to provide a coherent representation of the past climate at local to regional scale at higher latitudes. The reasons, are mainly due to the poor spatial density of the networks and the little understanding of how microsite variability affects the signal stored in the varied tree-ring proxies. Fennoscandia and Patagonia are strategic locations for studies on past climates, and were chosen to extend and improve the existing dendrochronology networks. This work also aimed to provide high quality improved chronologies with skills to reconstruct primarily temperature, with attention {{to the effects of}} microsite conditions and large scale atmospheric and oceanic patterns. Using Pinus sylvestris L., two temperature reconstructions were made: a local from the west central Scandinavian mountains extending 970 years using the blue light intensity absorption from tree-rings, and a regional built on ten chronologies extending through the Scandinavian mountains using density and blue intensity information from the tree rings. Additionally, a gridded reconstruction was made on the latter. In Patagonia six Nothofagus betuloides and one <b>Pilgerodendron</b> uviferum chronologies were developed and analyzed. These contained limited and non-statinary information on temperature and precipitation, probably on account of microsite conditions. Chronologies at both study sites were proven to contain information of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic patterns. In Fennoscandia, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Summer North Atlantic Oscillation in addition to volcanic forcing modulate significantly local to regional climate and therefore tree-growth. In Southern Patagonia in turn, tropical and subtropical sea surface temperatures seem to affect tree-growth. While relationships between tree-growth with the Southern Annular Mode were found on years of extreme growth, they were marginal and non-stationary when tested with index at interannual scale. Patterns of spatial correlations with sea level pressure further suggest these links. Moreover, the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, specifically the areas of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas are indicated to have an unprecedented importance to the growth dynamics of the southernmost forest in the world. The new chronologies developed in the study areas possess potential to be used on studies of climate evolution at higher latitudes taking into account that microsite conditions affect the climate signal recorded in the tree-growth...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe {{understanding}} of the long-term variation of large rivers streamflow with a high economic and social relevance is {{necessary in order to}} improve the planning and management of water resources in different regions of the world. The Baker River has the highest mean discharge of those draining both slopes of the Andes South of 20 degrees S and it is among the six rivers with the highest mean streamflow in the Pacific domain of South America (1100 m(3) s(- 1) at its outlet). It drains an international basin of 29, 000 km(2) shared by Chile and Argentina and has a high ecologic and economic value including conservation, tourism, recreational fishing, and projected hydropower. This study reconstructs the austral summer - early fall (January-April) streamflow for the Baker River from Nothofagus pumilio tree-rings for the period 1765 - 2004. Summer streamflow represents 45. 2 % of the annual discharge. The regression model for the period (19612004) explains 54 % of the variance of the Baker River streamflow (R-adj(2) = 0. 54). The most significant temporal pattern in the record is the sustained decline since the 1980 s (tau = - 0. 633, p = 1. 0144 * 10 (- 5) for the 1985 - 2004 period), which is unprecedented since 1765. The Correlation of the Baker streamflow with the November-April observed Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is significant (1961 - 2004, r=- 0. 55, p < 0. 001). The Baker record is also correlated with the available SAM tree-ring reconstruction based on other species when both series are filtered with a 25 -year spline and detrended (1765 - 2004, r = - 0. 41, p < 0. 01), emphasizing SAM as the main climatic forcing of the Baker streamflow. Three of the five summers with the highest streamflow in the entire reconstructed record occurred after the 1950 s (1977, 1958 and 1959). The causes of this high streamflow events are not yet clear and cannot be associated with the reported recent increase in the frequency of glacial-lake outburst floods (GLOFs). The decreasing trend in the observed and reconstructed streamflow of the Baker River documented here for the 1980 - 2004 period is consistent with precipitation decrease associated with the SAM. Conversely, other studies have reported an increase of summer streamflow for a portion of the Baker River for the 1994 - 2008 period, explained by ice melt associated with temperature increase and glacier retreat and thinning. Future research should consider the development of new tree-ring reconstructions to increase the geographic range and to cover the last 1000 or more years using long-lived species (e. g. Fitzroya cupressoides and <b>Pilgerodendron</b> uniferum). Expanding the network and quality of instrumental weather, streamflow and other monitoring stations as well as the study and modeling of the complex hydrological processes in the Baker basin are necessary. This should be the basis for planning, policy design and decision making regarding water resources in the Baker basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|While the {{majority}} of peatlands and wetlands are concentrated in the boreal zone, millions of ha of these ecosystems are also found in subantarctic areas of the southern hemisphere. In spite of the extensive area of bogs in the southern cone of South America, there have been very few studies on structure and dynamics of conifer bog forests in this regían, although {{many of them have}} been greatly changed by humans. Southern bog forests dominated by the conifer <b>Pilgerodendron</b> uviferum in Northern Patagonia are a typical case of an ecosystem with low resilience to disturbance by fire, which kills most trees and seeds. These forests, which have been burned to a large extent, cover an area of almost 1 million ha (6. 8 % of Chilean native forests). The aim of this doctoral thesis was to study fire-disturbed and undisturbed old-growth P. uviferum bog forests in North Patagonia in arder to develop the scientific ecological basis for conservation and restoration strategies. Therefore the work focussed on three important aspects of restoration: a) understanding the processes occurring in undisturbed old-growth forests, b) analysing the natural rate of recovery of fire-disturbed forests, ande) exploring sorne options for restoration. Using a multi-scaled approach, this study started analysing diameter and age structure, foliar and soil nutrient levels and the light environment in old-growth and fire-disturbed P. uviferum stands on Ch iloé lsland (43 º 5) in North Patagonia. Secondly, the seed dissemination potential and effective seedling recruitment distance from seed trees of the species were quantified, the suitability of substrates for the germination of P. uviferum seedlings was assessed, and the spatial distribution of seed trees of the species at the landscape level was analyzed. Finally, restoration plantings were established in disturbed upland and bog forests, to evaluate growth and mortality as well as performance (foliar nutrients and photosynthesis) of P. uviferum seedlings in relation to different site conditions characterized by variations in microtopography and canopy cover. According to the findings of this doctoral thesis, longevity (> 880 years), extremely slow growth ( 880 years),extremely slow growth (< 1 mm diameter per year) and tolerance to shade and stressare the main mechanisms of P. uviferum to persist in an extreme environment shapedby low nutrient availability and frequently waterlogged conditions. Therefore, in contrast to propositions made in previous studies, old-growth P. uviferum forests are not a transitional phase in forest succession and may be maintained in the landscape for many centuries or millennia. However, although extremely stress-tolerant, thespecies is very sensitive to fire and recovery from this type of disturbance is very slow. Seventy years after high-severity fires in the study area, seed trees were extremely infrequent at the landscape level (0. 3 trees/ha) and were aggregated at scales up to 30 m. Seed dissemination potential and effective seedling recruitment distance from individual P. uviferum seed trees was limited to 20 m, and seeds germinated best on moist Sphagnum or mineral soil substrate. This finding showed that high-severity firescan practically eliminate the species from parts of the landscape, where neither propagules nor seed trees survive. At the same time it points to the importance of biological legacies such as seed trees for the recovery of disturbed sites. Natural regeneration from seed trees can assist the recovery of P. uviferum populations following fire disturbance, but their effect is spatially limited at a landscape level. Therefore, restoration planting to complement existing seed trees may assist natural recovery of P. uviferum in disturbed bog forests and add to genetic diversity. To examine conditions for successful restoration planting, trials wereestablished in bogs and upland forest to assess whether manipulation of potentially limiting conditions may assist establishment of seedlings. Seedlings were planted on mounds or in depressions on bog sites to examine the effect drainage or beneath a canopy or in the open on upland sites to examine the effect of light. In bogs, there wasno significant effect of micro-topography on growth and survival of P. uviferumplantings. However, fluorescence measurements indicated lower stress in seedlings established on mounds. Seedlings in upland areas established beneath a nurse canopy had lower mortality and higher relative shoot growth, higher foliar nutrients, higherphotosynthetic light use efficiency and higher fluorescence values than those planted in the open. This indicates that seedlings of the slow growing P. uviferum may tolerate extremely wet conditions, yet suffer from stress when grown in the open. These results may improve restoration plantings of the species in disturbed bog forests. The mixed passive-active restoration approach, relying on naturallyregenerated parent trees complemented through low-density planting, which issuggested here, could be the most effective and efficient option to restare disturbed southern bog forests dominated by P. uviferum in North Patagonia. This low-cost approach may help managers of forest land to restare the species in the future. Furthermore, the multi-scale approach used in the present doctoral thesis studied the underlying ecological and physiological processes occurring in disturbed and undisturbed sites prior to planning a restoration program. In this context, it may be adopted for other ecosystems with low resilience and high degradation, where restoration is likely to be extremely expensive and the outcome uncertain. At the same time this study, which was inevitably limited in scope, showed that there are still verylarge knowledge gaps that should be filled to base management and restoration of these unique forests on a sound scientific basis...|$|E
