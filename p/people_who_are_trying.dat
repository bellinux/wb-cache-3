File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names. At the time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to their impact on artists that are dependent on record sales to continue their careers.

500|$|On 3 December 1976, {{two days}} before [...] "Smile Jamaica", a free concert {{organised}} by the Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley {{in an attempt to}} ease tension between two warring political groups, Marley, his wife, and manager Don Taylor were wounded in an assault by unknown gunmen inside Marley's home. Taylor and Marley's wife sustained serious injuries, but later made full recoveries. Bob Marley received minor wounds in the chest and arm. The attempt on his life was thought to have been politically motivated, as many felt the concert was really a support rally for Manley. Nonetheless, the concert proceeded, and an injured Marley performed as scheduled, two days after the attempt. When asked why, Marley responded, [...] "The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to make this world worse aren't taking a day off. How can I?" [...] The members of the group Zap Pow played as Bob Marley's backup band before a festival crowd of 80,000 while members of The Wailers were still missing or in hiding.|$|E

50|$|Military {{commissions}} {{were created}} October 9, 1792. There were five judges {{which consisted of}} everyday people or soldiers. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>tried</b> <b>were</b> sentenced to death. These military commissions were initially created to put emigres on trial, but by March 19, 1793 the law changed. Rebels who had weapons or other political counter-revolutionaries were put on trial under the military commissions {{which is similar to}} a criminal court today. However, since the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>tried</b> <b>were</b> considered to be political radicals and a threat to the French Revolution, they <b>were</b> <b>tried</b> quickly and few were actually put in prison; {{the majority of the people}} <b>tried</b> <b>were</b> killed.|$|R

2500|$|Schmitt's view {{on climate}} change diverges from the {{frequently}} reported scientific consensus, as he emphasizes natural over human factors as driving climate. [...] Schmitt has expressed {{the view that the}} risks posed by climate change are overrated, and suggests instead that climate change is a tool for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to increase the size of government. He resigned his membership in the Planetary Society because of its stance on the subject, writing in his resignation letter that the [...] "global warming scare is being used as a political tool to increase government control over American lives, incomes and decision-making." [...] He spoke at the March 2009 International Conference on Climate Change sponsored by the Heartland Institute. He appeared in December that year on the Fox Business Network, saying [...] "he CO2 scare is a red herring".|$|E
2500|$|On March 28, 2009, a Spanish court, {{headed by}} Baltasar Garzón, {{the judge who}} ordered the arrest of former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, {{announced}} it would begin an investigation into whether or not Gonzales, and five other former Bush Justice and Defense officials violated international law by providing the Bush Administration a legal framework and basis for the torture of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Garzón {{said that it was}} [...] "highly probable" [...] the matter would go to court and that arrest warrants would be issued. Also named in the Spanish court's investigation are John Yoo, Douglas Feith, William Haynes II, Jay Bybee, and David Addington. In April 2010, on the advice of the Spanish Attorney General Cándido Conde-Pumpido, who believes that an American tribunal should judge the case (or dismiss it) before a Spanish Court ever thinks about becoming involved, prosecutors recommended that Judge Garzon should drop his investigation. [...] As CNN reported, Mr. Conde-Pumpido told reporters that Judge Garzon's plan threatened to turn the court [...] "into a toy in the hands of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to do a political action".|$|E

2500|$|Lateralus emerged after a {{four-year}} legal dispute with Tool's label, Volcano Entertainment. In January 2001, the band announced that their new album's title would be Systema Encéphale {{and provided a}} 12-song track list with titles such as [...] "Riverchrist", [...] "Numbereft", [...] "Encephatalis", [...] "Musick", and [...] "Coeliacus".

The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to write songs." [...] A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus (supposedly a portmanteau of the leg muscle Vastus lateralis and the term lateral thinking) and that the name Systema Encéphale and the track list had been a ruse.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2007, still {{campaigning for}} the Republican presidential nomination, Romney summed up his general {{position}} {{on gun control}} at that time as: [...] "we should check on the backgrounds of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to purchase guns. We also should keep weapons of unusual lethality from being on the street. And finally, we should go after people who use guns in the commission of crimes or illegally, {{but we should not}} interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose." [...] He also said that, had it come before him as president, he would have signed a renewal of the federal assault weapons ban that had expired. The following month, during a presidential primary debate, he noted that the federal assault weapons ban that he would have signed as president had failed in Congress, and he insisted that he would not support any new gun control legislation: [...] "I do not believe we need new legislation. I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons. I instead believe that we have laws in place that if they're implemented and enforced, will provide the protection and the safety of the American people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Proponents of {{the laws}} note that public {{documentation}} of factory farming practices will result in negative consequences for the industry. [...] "State Sen. David Hinkins (R), who sponsored Utah's law, said it was aimed at the 'vegetarian <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to kill the animal industry.'" [...] When investigators publicize documentation of factory farms, the company generally loses business. For instance, in 2007, an undercover investigator from The Humane Society of the United States visited the Hallmark/Westland slaughterhouse in Chino, California and filmed downed cows, too sick to stand up, being [...] "dragged by chains and pushed by forklifts to the kill floor". A large amount of the meat from this slaughterhouse had been consumed through the National School Lunch Program, and the footage compelled [...] "the U.S. Department of Agriculture to announce what {{was at the time}} the largest meat recall in U.S. history". Similarly, a Mercy for Animals investigation at Sparboe Farms resulted in McDonald's, Target, Sam's Club, and Supervalu all dropping Sparboe as an egg supplier. The investigation revealed cages full of dead hens rotting alongside living hens who were still laying eggs for human consumption. The investigator documented standard practices such as painful debeaking without painkillers and tossing live birds into plastic bags to suffocate, along with other behaviour deemed [...] "sadistic" [...] and [...] "malicious".|$|E

2500|$|In a 2013 {{interview}} with Martha Raddatz of ABC News, Greenwald said {{that members of}} Congress are being [...] "blocked" [...] from getting [...] "the most basic information about what NSA is doing... and what the FISA court has been doing....", and specifically referenced Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying to do now is to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question. So anyone who says that Congress is somehow being stonewalled is just wrong and [...] is generally, I think, raised by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> {{to make a name for}} themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2006, US Vice President Dick Cheney {{referred}} {{to himself as}} the Darth Vader of the Bush administration.

That's not a pleasant business. It's a very serious business. And I suppose, sometimes, people look at my demeanor and say, 'Well, he's the Darth Vader of the administration.'" [...] Jon Stewart put on a Darth Vader helmet to address Dick Cheney as a [...] "kindred spirit" [...] on The Daily Show on January 25, 2007. Cheney's wife, Lynne, presented Stewart with a Darth Vader action figure on her appearance on the show on October 10, 2007. Both Stewart and Stephen Colbert have occasionally {{referred to}} Cheney as [...] "Darth Cheney". In the satirical cartoon show Lil' Bush, Dick Cheney's father is portrayed as being Darth Vader. At her presidential campaign event on September 19, 2007, Hillary Clinton also referred to Cheney as Darth Vader. At the 2008 Washington Radio and Television Correspondents' Association Dinner, Cheney joked that his wife Lynne told him that the Vader comparison [...] "humanizes" [...] him. George Lucas told The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, however, that Cheney is more akin to Emperor Palpatine, and that a better stand-in for Vader would be George W. Bush. An issue of Newsweek referenced this quote, and compared Bush and Cheney to Vader and Palpatine, respectively, in a satirical article comparing politicians to various Star Wars and Star Trek characters.|$|E

They had made several expeditions though none of any length. It was worth coming if only {{for the sake of the}} flowering trees which grew wild quite near the house, and the amazing colours of sea and earth. The earth, instead of being brown, was red, purple, green. [...] "You won't believe me," [...] she added, [...] "there is no colour like it in England." [...] She adopted, indeed, a condescending tone towards that poor island, which was now advancing chilly crocuses and nipped violets in nooks, in copses, in cosy corners, tended by rosy old gardeners in mufflers, who were always touching their hats and bobbing obsequiously. She went on to deride the islanders themselves. Rumours of London all in a ferment over a General Election had reached them even out here. [...] "It seems incredible," [...] she went on, [...] "that people should care whether Asquith is in or Austen Chamberlin out, and while you scream yourselves hoarse about politics you let the only <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> for something good starve or simply laugh at them.
