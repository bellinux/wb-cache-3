5|$|On May 1, 2004, a 53-year-old, 5' 2", 230lb (104.5kg) {{man from}} Bloomfield, Connecticut, {{fell out of}} his coaster seat during the last turn and was killed. Reports show that the ride {{attendant}} had not checked that the guest's ride restraint was secure as his girth was too large for the T-bar-shaped ride restraint to close properly. The victim's family said that due to his various medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, he shouldn't {{have been allowed to}} ride. The park stated that the federal Americans with Disabilities Act forbids them from denying a ride to a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>disability</b> as long as the person can get on the ride by themselves.|$|E

25|$|Freedom from abuse, neglect, and {{violations}} of a person's rights {{are also important}} goals of the disability rights movement. Abuse and neglect includes inappropriate seclusion and restraint, inappropriate use of force by staff and/or providers, threats, harassment and/or retaliation by staff or providers, failure to provide adequate nutrition, clothing, and/or medical and mental health care, and/or failure to provide a clean and safe living environment, {{as well as other}} issues which pose a serious threat to the physical and psychological well-being of a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>disability.</b> Violations of patients' rights include failure to obtain informed consent for treatment, failure to maintain the confidentiality of treatment records, and inappropriate restriction of the right to communicate and associate with others, as well as other restrictions of rights.|$|E

25|$|The ADA {{provides}} explicit {{coverage for}} service animals. Guidelines {{have been developed}} not only to protect persons with disabilities, but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, {{but they are not}} allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They can not ask what the person's disabilities are. A <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>disability</b> can not be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner can not get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animal would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety so {{it would not be a}} valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premise. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to use the bathroom. Lastly, people that require service dogs can not be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly. For example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities can not be treated less than other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Nowadays, {{more and}} more {{employers}} are willing to employ <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>disability</b> after learning about their working capacity. However, some employers who wish to offer them employment opportunities might have concern over their accommodation in workplace and have reservation about employing them. In fact, there are various services offered by different organisations <b>with</b> <b>a</b> view to facilitating open employment of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>disability</b> {{so that they could}} fit in to their work and integrate into society. This handbook is published by the Selective Placement Division of the Labour Department in order to enhance the confidence of employers who have already employed disabled staff or those who wish to employ <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>disability</b> by introducing <b>a</b> range of support services and the means through which these services could be acquired. We hope that by introducing these support services to employers and disabled employees, the working relationship between them will be enhanced...|$|R
2500|$|The Supreme Court decided under Title II of the ADA {{that mental}} illness {{is a form}} of {{disability}} and therefore covered under the ADA, and that unjustified institutional isolation of a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>disability</b> {{is a form of}} discrimination because it [...] "...perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life."

2500|$|Discrimination {{against people}} with disabilities in favor {{of people who are}} not is called ableism or disablism. Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled {{individuals}} as the standard of ‘normal living’, results in public and private places and services, education, and social work that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities. Studies have shown, employment is needed to not only provide a living but to sustain mental health and well-being. Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as collective purpose, social contact, status, and activity. [...] A <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>disability</b> is often found to be socially isolated and work is one way to reduce isolation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{priest is}} bound under the severest {{penalties}} {{to maintain the}} [...] "seal of confession", absolute secrecy about any sins revealed to him in confession. This strict confidentiality {{is known as the}} Seal of the Confessional. According to 983 §1 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, [...] "The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason." [...] Priests, and anyone who witnesses or overhears the confession (say, an interpreter, caregiver, or aide of a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>disability)</b> may not reveal what they have learned during confession to anyone, even under the threat of their own death or that of others. This is unique to the Seal of the Confessional. Many other forms of confidentiality, including in most states attorney-client privilege, allow ethical breaches of the confidence {{to save the life of}} another. But a priest, or anyone else who witnesses or overhears any part of the confession, who breaks that confidentiality incurs latae sententiae (automatic) excommunication reserved to the Holy See. In a criminal matter, a priest may encourage the penitent to surrender to authorities, however, this is the extent of the leverage he wields: he cannot make this a condition of the absolution and he may not directly or indirectly disclose the matter to civil authorities himself.|$|E
