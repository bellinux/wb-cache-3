5|$|The <b>privilege</b> of peerage {{extends to}} all {{temporal}} peers and peeresses {{regardless of their}} position {{in relation to the}} House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the <b>privilege,</b> and is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the <b>privilege</b> of peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the <b>privilege</b> of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their <b>privilege</b> of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage. The <b>privilege</b> of peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses the <b>privilege</b> upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the <b>privilege</b> of peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.|$|E

5|$|All {{of these}} {{decisions}} were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or {{representative of the}} pope, {{as well as many}} bishops and abbots. Thomas then made a written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to AlexanderII, attempting to get a written papal <b>privilege</b> of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal <b>privilege</b> could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope GregoryVII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the matter of the papal <b>privilege</b> for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest.|$|E
