Ross R. Allen, David Beard, Mark T. Smith, and Barclay J. Tullis were awarded US Patents 5,578,813 (1996) and 5,644,139 (1997) for 2-dimensional optical navigational (i.e., position measurement) principles based on detecting and correlating microscopic, inherent features of the surface over which the navigation sensor travelled, and using position measurements of each end of a linear (document) image sensor to reconstruct an image of the document. This is the freehand scanning concept used in the HP CapShare 920 handheld scanner. By describing an optical means that explicitly overcame the limitations of wheels, balls, and rollers used in contemporary computer mice, the optical mouse was anticipated. These patents formed the basis for US Patent 5,729,008 (1998) awarded to Travis N. Blalock, Richard A. Baumgartner, Thomas Hornak, Mark T. Smith, and Barclay J.

50|$|There is a {{misconception}} {{that once a}} scan line is complete, a CRT display in effect suddenly jumps internally, by analogy with a typewriter or printer's <b>paper</b> <b>advance</b> or line feed, before creating the next scan line. As discussed above, this does not exactly happen: the vertical sweep continues at a steady rate over a scan line, creating a small tilt. Steady-rate sweep is done, instead of a stairstep of advancing every row, because steps are hard to implement technically, while steady-rate is much easier. The resulting tilt is compensated in most CRTs by the tilt and parallelogram adjustments, which impose a small vertical deflection as the beam sweeps across the screen. When properly adjusted, this deflection exactly cancels the downward slope of the scanlines. The horizontal retrace, in turn, slants smoothly downward as the tilt deflection is removed; there's no jump {{at either end of}} the retrace. In detail, scanning of CRTs is performed by magnetic deflection, by changing the current in the coils of the deflection yoke. Rapidly changing the deflection (a jump) requires a voltage spike to be applied to the yoke, and the deflection can only react as fast as the inductance and spike magnitude permit. Electronically, the inductance of the deflection yoke's vertical windings is relatively high, and thus the current in the yoke, and therefore the vertical part of the magnetic deflection field, can change only slowly.|$|E

We consider both random and constrained edge-weight labeling, and refer to the former as the unconstrained non-binary protograph-based LDPC codes (U-NBPB codes) and the latter as the constrained non-binary protograph-based LDPC codes (C-NBPB codes). Equipped with combinatorial definitions extended to the non-binary domain, ensemble enumerators of codewords, trapping sets, stopping sets, and pseudocodewords are calculated. The exact enumerators are presented in the finite-length regime, and the corresponding growth rates are calculated in the asymptotic regime. We then present an EXIT chat tool for computing the iterative decoding thresholds of protograph-based LDPC codes followed by several examples of finite-length U-NBPB and C-NBPB codes with high performance. Throughout the paper, we provide accompanying examples which demonstrate the advantage of non-binary protograph-based LDPC codes over their binary counterparts and over random constructions.

He then applies the framework to examine the process of policy making in Argentina during the nineties, where a period of rapid reform {{was followed by a}} boom, in which reform and policies weakened, and then by a deep crisis.

In this pa-per, we study the network lifetime problem by considering not only maximizing the time until the first node fails, but also maxi-mizing the lifetimes for all the nodes in the network, which we define as the Lexicographic Max-Min (LMM) node lifetime prob-lem. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm to derive the LMM-optimal node lifetime vector, which effectively circumvents the computational complexity problem associated with an existing state-of-the-art approach, which is exponential. The main ideas in our approach include: (1) a link-based problem formulation, which signifi-cantly reduces the problem size in comparison with a flow-based formulation, and (2) an intelligent exploitation of parametric anal-ysis technique, which in most cases determines the minimum set of nodes that use up their energy at each stage using very sim-ple computations. Second, we present a simple (also polynomial-time) algorithm to calculate the flow routing schedule such that the LMM-optimal node lifetime vector can be achieved.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the role of}} imaging system design in developing an instrumentation technique to aid the validation of air–fuel mixing design hypotheses for use in next-generation internal combustion engines. In {{order to meet the}} challenge of extracting information from a research engine, the instrumentation system design was considered holistically through the application of ‘scene constraint ’ principles. The objective is to obtain a two-dimensional map of fuel concentration in the cylinder, {{in order to be able}} to study the mixing process of air and fuel. To meet forthcoming emission regulations, a detailed understanding of this process is critical to the design of next generation (direct injection) gasoline engines.

If this degree is four or higher, then the decay is precisely as dictated by the linear part. This improves results from [A. Stefanov and P. G.
