The practices on dealing with <b>provisional</b> <b>sums</b> have exposed the contracting parties {{to a number of}} risks. Therefore, this research aimed at identifying such risks and mitigation measures to limit such risks in using <b>provisional</b> <b>sums</b> in the UAE. The research started with a comprehensive literature review followed by a questionnaire survey among the UAE construction industry professionals. Based on the survey findings, six semi-structured interviews were conducted with expertise in the construction industry to verify the survey findings and close any gaps in the data. The study found that <b>provisional</b> <b>sums</b> are mainly used in the FIDIC (Red Book) forms of contract in the UAE for special works, contingencies, the works which can be only defined in the site, facilitating the appointment of nominated subcontractors and overlapping design and construction. The most common risks of using <b>provisional</b> <b>sums</b> are related to claims, variations and conflicts among the contracting parties. Defining the scope of <b>provisional</b> <b>sums</b> before tendering, incorporating the <b>provisional</b> <b>sums</b> into the project programme and limit the value of <b>provisional</b> <b>sums</b> in the contract are suggested as the key measures to minimize the risk of provisional measures...|$|R

40|$|Various {{attempts}} have been taken {{in order to achieve}} the objective of environmental soundness in road construction activities. Effectiveness of allocating the funds and the due payment for the contractor can create a great influence in achieving such an objective. Thus, this study aims to identify what is the optimum payment evaluation method of contractor’s due payment for controlling environmental defilement in road construction projects. The aforesaid research problem was approached through a multiple case study including three road construction projects in Sri Lanka. Different environmental hazards occurred due to different road construction activities, related hazard mitigation methods, fund allocation for environmental hazard controlling and the associated existing payment methods for contractors could be identified through the data collected by means of semi-structured interviews conducted with the professionals who are involved in the projects having knowledge on both environmental and monetary aspects. Further, direct observations and documentary survey strengthened these findings. Quantitative data was collected from each case through a questionnaire survey and prioritized the payment method under each specific hazard controlling method using Relative Importance Index in terms of effectiveness to identify the optimum payment method to the contractor for controlling environmental hazard. Findings revealed that there are four types of such payment methods available including; payments by unit rate, payments where a <b>provisional</b> <b>sum</b> established in the contract; payments where fixed amounts are assigned in the contract and payments made along with some main work item in the contract which were identified being the optimum method under different hazard controlling methods. These findings would be useful for bidders and estimators at the pre-construction stages to develop more effective modes of payment evaluation and to improve effectiveness in estimation.

40|$|Estimating {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} functions of a successful project. Accurate estimates optimise good contracting as well as the process of calculating and analysing all the costs that will enter into a particular job to arrive at a set total. The estimator is responsible for these estimates which serve to ensure the project will have a successful financial outcome and these estimates also influence the decisions made for budgeting and assist in clients’ decisions for contractor selection. This research will determine the current practice of a case study company’s accuracy in estimation and will also identify the associated issues with the preparation of the estimates which can lead to inaccuracy. The methodology for this research has been a triangulation from an extensive literature survey review and analysis, then followed by a document analysis of the case study company’s project accuracy over the last 5 years and then analysis which is an interpretation of the author’s understanding. The findings have indicated that there are inaccuracies which can be from a range of factors identified in the literature as crucial indicators for deviations from the intended budget. This includes for the selection of <b>provisional</b> <b>sum</b> expenditures, historical data validity, factors affecting the accuracy of the estimate and model house base rate. The conclusions that have been drawn are that there is only one method of estimation being used in the case study company and when a house becomes an architecturally design house, the model house base rate seems to become invalid completely. The historical data is not being regularly updated with feedback processes and the learning curve of the estimator reviewing each project after completion seems to be limited as the inaccuracies are being carried forward onto the new projects. The estimator’s judgement is identified in the literature as one of the most important factors to estimation; however, the data collected indicated that an inexperienced estimator has made decisions that have resulted in ramifications...|$|E

30|$|Imagine, again, {{adding a}} long series of single digit numbers, however, this time, the numbers do not {{configure}} a static visual presentation, but rather adorn the face of wooden tokens creating a malleable physical configuration which participants can modify as they work on the problem. The calculation unfolds along a spatiotemporal itinerary wrought by the agent’s actions. These actions modify the problem presentation and in doing so the problem is restructured: added numbers can be physically demarcated so they no longer exert attentional pull, and congenial interim totals (for example, 8 [*]+[*] 7) are identified and physically segregated, which shifts the affordances of what to do next and guides the agent to identify complementary subtotals (for example, 9 [*]+[*] 6) that interlock to create easy-to-remember <b>provisional</b> <b>sums</b> (for example, 30), to improve efficiency and reduce error. The reconfiguration of the problem guides, in part, the allocation of attentional resources and strategy selection (Vallée-Tourangeau, 2013); dynamic changes in the problem’s appearance may actually perform some of the necessary computations, above and beyond the computations performed mentally by the agent (see Rumelhart, Smolensky, McClelland, & Hinton, 1986). Interactivity creates an agent-environment system. On the one hand, interactivity reduces the demands on the agent’s working memory resources, but on the other, the system’s overall working memory resources are augmented.|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{concerns}} identified on {{the inadequacy of}} the BQ for utilisation by the contractors. These as contractors are constantly baffling to relate the BQ to the project development process thus resulting to the great loss of its utility during the construction process. In the midst of these concerns, information has been perceived to characterise issues concerning its use to the contracting organisations. This prompted a research to be conducted with the ultimate aim to develop a conceptual framework that indicates the important BQ information requirements and significant issues to be considered as the basis to improve the uses of the BQ. In relation to the research that has been carried out, this paper reports {{an excerpt from the}} research and is focused to highlight findings on determining the BQ information requirements to the identified usage of the BQ. Accordingly, nine information has been considered important to the uses of BQ. These are ranked as: (1) Quantities; (2) Time/duration; (3) Work descriptions; (4) Quantity units; (5) Unit rates; (6) Material specifications; (7) Working methods; (8) Preliminaries and (9) <b>Provisional</b> <b>sums.</b> The results suggest that ‘quantities’ has an important position to the overall uses of the BQ. This implies that more effort should be expanded to study about ‘quantities’ given its substantial contribution to the management of construction works...|$|R
40|$|A {{construction}} estimator {{is responsible}} for estimating {{the cost of a}} construction project. The process itself has many risks involved and has always been an important area of research. Numerous studies have been carried out in the past which only looked at risks in construction project in general; very little research has been done on the topic of ‘pricing risks’ from the construction estimators’ perspective and certainly in New Zealand residential construction context. The aim of this research is to examine the question –What are the perceived pricing risks and practical management strategy amongst construction estimators in the Auckland residential construction sector? Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with questionnaire to collect survey data includes demographic information about the estimator and its company; perception of pricing risks in terms of their level of importance and frequency of occurrence; number, level of details, sources, reliability and purposes of cost data. The result showed that overall, the top pricing risks were ‘site related issues’, ‘project complexity’ and ‘change in scope of work’ and the most common method used to deal with the risks is use of <b>Provisional</b> <b>Sum.</b> Furthermore, it is concluded that the estimators interviewed had low number of cost data because many of the cost items are quoted. This is confirmed by the estimators that the most frequently used cost data is the ‘subcontractors’ / suppliers’ quote’. The result also showed that the most reliable source of cost data is the ‘in-house rate buildups’ and the biggest problem when collecting or applying cost data originate from the subcontractors. Methods such as back costing; ask the subcontractors to include specific items; understand and raise questions on quotation received or make arrangements with the subcontractors to fix the price {{for a period of time}} are used to manage those risks. Possible areas for further researches include whether the number of cost items relates to a company’s annual turnover and vice versa; how do large, medium and small construction companies or how do construction companies that specialise in different types of project compared in respond to risk and management of cost data...|$|E
40|$|An {{agreement}} cannot {{generally be}} varied or changed unilaterally by {{either one of}} the contracting parties unless there is an express variation provision in the contract. A significant feature of a construction contract is {{the inclusion of a}} variation order (VO) provision. A VO may be an addition, omission or substitution of the work. A VO must also be valid to be tenable at law. Employers often abused the VO term by issuing invalid omissions causing contractors to incur losses in terms of profit and overhead expenses. Ultimately, the first step that contractors shall do is to verify whether instructions omitting works are valid VOs. However, provisions in standard forms of contract do not set limits on the permissible extent of omissions of work that an employer may issue. Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} identify valid and invalid omission of works issued under VO clauses. The research methodology undertaken is by documentary analysis of law cases reported in law journals. The cases identified are from five jurisdictions: United States of America, Australia, United Kingdom, South Africa and Malaysia. The research identified twelve cases related to the invalid variation omissions. There is no case law reported on valid omission. The findings of the analysis are: one, it is invalid for employers to omit works and award them to third parties contractors for commercial reasons, or dissatisfaction with the contractors’ performance; it appears that any omission of works provided under <b>provisional</b> <b>sum,</b> is also invalid. Two, a magnitude of omission that substantially or fundamentally alters the scope of work is also invalid. Three, omissions that amount to a virtual cancellation of the contract is similarly invalid. This study also found that all the courts in the five jurisdictions had used five principles in holding the omissions invalid; they are: the omission must first be bona fide; second, it must not hinder the contractor’s right to perform the work and earn his profit; third, it cannot be used to terminate the contractor’s employment; and fourth, it cannot virtually lead to total cancellation of the contract. In conclusion, it is suggested that these limitations to variation omission are expressly stated in the standard forms of contract to reduce disputes...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to formulate a guideline for preparing Bill of Quantities (BQ) for building conservation works. The justifications for {{this research}} are derived from both the practical and the academic angle. Anecdotal feedback from the conservation industry claims that the variance between tender prices of conservation projects is very high and this issue poses difficulty in the awarding of contracts. In any tender pricing, BQ is {{the most important part of}} the tendering process. Thus, the issue of tender pricing requires research on the BQ document itself. While the subject pertaining to BQs has been researched since the 1960 s covering various areas such as type, use, format, pricing, reliability and relevance of the BQs; all these studies focused on new building works and not conservation works. Thus the reason for the high variance in conservation tenders is still unknown yet the rising interest in conservation works in this country has created the need to improve the area of tender pricing for the conservation industry. Qualitative research approach is used in this study and the reason is due to the situation and character of the conservation industry where data are still scarce and there are still many unknowns pertaining to tender pricing for conservation works. In order to uncover and probe deeper into the issues faced by these tenderers, semi-structured interviews are conducted with conservation contractors. Data from the interviews are analysed using the thematic analysis method. The findings revealed that hidden works, inexperience in the conservation industry, various issues with the BQ preparation, as well as labour and material costs are the major reasons for the variance in tenders for conservation projects. The interviews also revealed the inadequacies of the current tender documents which were then categorised into three categories namely BQ, Specification and Documents other than BQ. The data also identified items that had no effect on pricing. Suggestions from the interviews formed the basis for the proposed guidelines which were then validated under four sections namely Guidelines for Preliminaries Bill, Measured Work Bill, P. C. & <b>Provisional</b> <b>Sum</b> Bill and Documents other than BQ. Considering the impossibility of testing the guidelines in the industry during the research period yet the proposed guidelines needed validation, this study used the 2 -round Delphi survey method to obtain feedback from industry experts on the feasibility and viability of the guidelines. Feedback from the 2 -round Delphi survey are then used to revise and improve the proposed guidelines to derive to its final version proposed in this research. It is hoped that the proposed guidelines will be used by quantity surveyors as reference in the preparation of tender documents for building conservation projects in the immediate future...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of contractors when submitting bids under different institutional arrangements. Construction projects under {{the private and public}} sectors in Hong Kong operate under two distinct contractual and bidding arrangements giving different degrees of risk and uncertainty to the contractors. First, private sector projects in Hong Kong invariably adopt conditions of contracts that shift more risk to the contractor. A typical example is private sector projects do not normally allow fluctuation adjustments, thereby shifting the risks of future increase in prices of construction resources to the contractor. Public sector construction projects include fluctuation clauses for projects of duration over 21 months (Later extended to all contracts via Circular DEVB(PS) 107 / 3 dated 18 July 2008). Second, it is common practice for private sector clients to negotiate with the contractors after they have submitted their bids. Although in some cases, private sector clients may also simply accept the lowest tender, bidders would normally anticipate that they are likely to negotiate with them after the bids are opened. This practice, however, is not allowed in public sector projects. For reasons of public accountability, Government tendering procedures do not allow changes to the bid price after the tenders have been submitted and the time for return lapsed (except for specifically approved cases). This requirement basically bars any price negotiation {{as in the case of}} private projects. We conjecture that these two differences in institutional arrangements have significant impact on bidders’ behavior, which would be characterized by the distribution and pattern of the submitted bid prices. Based on records of bid prices for 105 contracts tendered during the period 1997 and 2007, we found that public sector bids are more skewed to the left (or have a longer tail towards the left) than private sector bids, ceteris paribus. This means that low bids for public sector projects are more scattered than those of private sector projects. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that bidders attempt to hide their true bid prices by submitting higher bids when the client is not bound to accept the lowest tender. The empirical results also suggest that the bid-spread, as defined by the percentage difference between the lowest and second lowest bid, is higher when post tender negotiation is prohibited. Bidders would tend to submit more aggressive bids for public sector projects, knowing that they would not have a second chance to adjust their bid prices at a later stage. This suggests a higher probability of winner’s curse for public sector projects. For private sector projects that do not include fluctuation clauses, the bid-spread is also affected by the expected risk of future increase in the prices of construction resources. When such risk is high, bidders will become more cautious when submitting their bids and thus resulting in a lower bid-spread. The bid distributions for public sector project have thicker tails on both ends compared to those of private sector projects due to its prequalification system and the practice of acceptance of the lowest bid. The empirical evidence in this study confirms this. In addition, market conditions, number of bidders, contract size and the proportion of prime cost and <b>provisional</b> <b>sum</b> as a percentage of the contract sum are also important determining factors of biding behavior. The results of this study show that institutional arrangements matters in determining bidding behavior. Previous studies that attempt to estimate the distribution of bid prices for construction projects have largely ignored the importance of institutional arrangements, which may therefore lead to biased results. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of bidder’s behavior when bidding for construction projects under different institutional arrangements. The understanding will be useful in handling bidding exercises for new construction projects and the advancement of studies on bidding strategy models. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
