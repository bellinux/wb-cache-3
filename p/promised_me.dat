500|$|Saban {{was named}} {{head coach of}} the Bills for a second time in late 1971. When he arrived, Buffalo was coming off a 1–13 season, {{although}} the team had players including running back O.J. Simpson, who had run for 742 yards and five touchdowns that year. While the Bills had a 4–9–1 record, Simpson led the NFL in rushing yards in 1972. Under Saban, Simpson continued to improve in 1973, setting a single-game rushing record with 250 yards in the season opener against the New England Patriots. He surpassed the single-season rushing record later in the year with more than 2,000 yards. Before Saban's arrival, Simpson had never rushed for more than 742 yards in a season. Simpson credited Saban with helping him reach his potential. [...] "He saved my career", Simpson said in 1973, when he was named the NFL's most valuable player. [...] "He <b>promised</b> <b>me</b> he'd give me the football and give me an offensive line, and he sure kept his word." [...] The Bills had a 9–5 record that year but came in second in the AFC East and missed the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} some early {{supporters}} of Joyce's work, such as Ezra Pound and the author's brother Stanislaus Joyce, had grown increasingly unsympathetic {{to his new}} writing. In {{order to create a}} more favourable critical climate, a group of Joyce's supporters (including Samuel Beckett, William Carlos Williams, Rebecca West and others) put together a collection of critical essays on the new work. It was published in 1929 under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress. In July 1929, increasingly demoralised by the poor reception his new work was receiving, Joyce approached his friend James Stephens about the possibility of his completing the book. Joyce wrote to Weaver in late 1929 that he had [...] "explained to [...] all about the book, at least a great deal, and he <b>promised</b> <b>me</b> that if I found it madness to continue, in my condition, and saw no other way out, that he would devote himself heart and soul to the completion of it, that is the second part and the epilogue or fourth." [...] Apparently Joyce chose Stephens on superstitious grounds, as he had been born in the same hospital as Joyce, exactly one week later, and shared both the first names of Joyce himself and his fictional alter-ego Stephen Dedalus. In the end, Stephens was not asked to finish the book.|$|E

2500|$|... "One of {{the chief}} objects of my {{expedition}} was to diffuse knowledge tending towards emigration, and whether driving over the fjelds, scaling mountains, resting at stations, or coasting along the shore in steamers, I everywhere preached an immigration crusade to the laborer's paradise in the New World. I spoke of our homestead law— the fertility of our soil— the length of our summer— the richness of our immense mining districts, but I found nothing so telling as the simple description of the condition and prospects of the working man in the United States of America. Of fifty odd postillions I had along the road, all <b>promised</b> <b>me</b> to immigrate to the United States next Spring, save one; he, I ascertained, had been in England for nine months, and, judging all foreign countries by {{the one he had}} visited, concluded, perhaps wisely according to his light, to remain at home. (...) Sometimes some Norwegian proprietors, not liking perhaps the tendency of things, would commence a discussion in presence of the deck-passengers. I found it very easy to refute all their arguments. When driven from every other point they invariably took refuge under the palladium of patriotism— love for Gamle Norge (Old Norway). To this I replied, that I recognized no love of country, not connected with love for our countrymen; if then, as they had been constrained to admit, the Norwegian laborer bettered his condition by immigrating into the United States, true patriotism should assist him to go, not hinder him from going. I however always treated these Norwegian gentlemen personally with the greatest respect. In no case did one discussion descend to altercation, and no unfriendly words were ever used." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Ağca [...] {{published}} his memoir in 2013, his story changed completely. The original {{edition of the}} book in Italian (“Mi avevano promesso il paradiso: La mia vita e la verità sull'attentato al papa”, i.e. “They <b>promised</b> <b>me</b> the paradise: My life and {{the truth about the}} assassination attempt on the pope”) is available in electronic version for the Nook; there is a French translation under the name “Je devais tuer le pape” (“I had to kill the pope”), version for Kindle. According to this new version of the events, Ağca received instructions and training in weapons and explosives in Iran, from Mohsen Rezai, under the orders of Ayatollah Jaffar Subhani and Ayatollah Khomeiny. In his book, Ağca acknowledges that he lied previously about the Bulgarian and Soviet connection. He stayed in Sofia for about a month, but he was not in contact with any Bulgarian or other intelligence officers, he was in transit from Turkey to Western Europe, and was delayed in Sofia because his fake Indian passport was of such poor quality that on several occasions he had to bribe officials who became suspicious. So, he waited to receive a much better quality Turkish passport from the Grey Wolves: a genuine passport issued by the Turkish government to another person, Faruk Faruk Özgün, only the photo of Özgün was replaced by a photo of Ağca. According to his memoir, when Pope John Paul II visited him in prison in Italy, on 27 December 1983 (two and a half years after the assassination attempt), Ağca kissed the hand of the pope, having kissed three years earlier the hand of Khomeiny in Iran, and when asked, he told John Paul II “Khomeiny and the Iranian government gave me the order to kill you”.|$|E
2500|$|Brando starred as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He plays {{a highly}} {{decorated}} U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military {{as much as}} the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as Eleanor Coppola's documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself. Coppola: [...] "He was already heavy when I hired him and he <b>promised</b> <b>me</b> {{that he was going to}} get in shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was so fat, he was very, very shy about it... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way." [...] Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, Heart of Darkness, as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer Fred Roos: [...] "The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon's urging—and yet he's getting paid for it." ...|$|E
