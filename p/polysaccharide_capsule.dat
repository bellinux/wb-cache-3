2500|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a {{component}} of the outer membrane of N. meningitidis. This acts as an endotoxin and is responsible for septic shock and hemorrhage due to the destruction of red blood cells.

[...] It infects the cell by sticking to it mainly with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc. Meningococci produce an IgA protease, an enzyme that cleaves IgA class antibodies and thus allows the bacteria to evade a subclass of the humoral immune system.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the production of selected virulence factors by potential pathogenic microorganisms isolated in workplaces. The influence of technical material present at the workplaces on strains virulence was also determined. Material and methods. 11 bacteria and yeast strains isolated from the air (impact method) or surface (RODAC method) in work environments. Identification was performed by API tests and molecular methods. The selected factors were analyzed: production of <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsules,</b> proteinase, gelatinase, lipase, coagulase, deoxyribonuclease, enterotoxins and hemolytic abilities. Apart from standard microbiological media, minerals media with addition of cellulose, wet blue leather, compost extract were used. Results. 8 from 11 tested strains produced hemolysis, including 4 bacterial strains (Bacillus cereus two strains, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus) – β-hemolysis. <b>Polysaccharide</b> <b>capsules</b> were detected for yeast Cryptococcus albidus. Bacteria, mainly from the genus Bacillus, produced protease and gelatinase. Moreover, B. cereus strains from composting plants and tanneries produced enterotoxins (NHE and HBL). The presence of leather or compost in the medium can stimulate or inhibit toxin production, depending on the bacteria species and toxin type. S. haemolyticus from the museum produced lipase and deoxyribonuclease. It was found that Corynebacterium lubricantis and Candida parapsilosis did not produce any of the tested virulence factors. Conclusions. In the work environment in composting, tanneries, museums with high frequency (56 – 100...|$|R

40|$|<b>Polysaccharide</b> <b>capsules</b> are {{important}} virulence factors for many microbial pathogens including the opportunistic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. In the present study, we demonstrate an unusual role for a secreted lactonohydrolase of C. neoformans, LHC 1 in capsular higher order structure. Analysis of extracted capsular polysaccharide from wild-type and lhc 1 D strains by dynamic and static light scattering suggested {{a role for}} the LHC 1 locus in altering the capsular polysaccharide, both reducing dimensions and altering its branching, density and solvation. These changes in the capsular structure resulted in LHC 1 -dependent alterations of antibody binding patterns, reductions in human and mouse complement binding and phagocytosis by the macrophage-like cell line J 774, as well as increased virulence in mice.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsules</b> of Pasteurella multocida types A, D, and F {{are composed}} of hyaluronan, N-acetylheparosan (heparosan or unsulfated, unepimerized heparin), and unsulfated chondroitin, respectively.

Here, a ∼ 73 % identical gene product that is encoded outside of the capsule biosynthesis locus was also {{shown to be a}} functional heparosan synthase. Unlike PmHS 1, the PmHS 2 enzyme was not stimulated greatly by the addition of an exogenous polymer acceptor and yielded smaller- molecular-weight-product size distributions.

50|$|S. pneumoniae {{has several}} {{virulence}} factors, including the <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsule</b> mentioned earlier, that help it evade a host's immune system.

50|$|<b>Polysaccharide</b> <b>capsule.</b> N. meningitidis has a <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsule</b> that {{surrounds}} the outer membrane of the bacterium and protects against soluble immune effector mechanisms within the serum. It {{is considered to be}} an essential virulence factor for the bacteria. N. gonorrhea possesses no such capsule. Instead of having the usual lipopolysaccharide (LPS), this bacterium, whether a pathogenic or commensal species, has a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) which consists of a core polysaccharide and lipid A. It functions as an endotoxin, protects against antimicrobial peptides, and adheres to the asialoglycoprotein receptor on urethral cells. LOS is highly stimulatory to the human immune system. LOS sialylation (by the enzyme's Lst) prevents complement deposition and phagocytosis by neutrophils. LOS modification by phosphoethanolamine (by the enzyme LptA) provides resistance to antimicrobial peptides and complement. Strains of the same species have the ability to produce different LOS glycoforms.|$|E
50|$|Streptococcus agalactiae is {{the species}} {{designation}} for streptococci belonging to group B of the Lancefield classification.

In laboratory culture, the S-layer and capsule are often lost by reductive evolution (the loss of a trait in absence of positive selection).|$|R
40|$|The uptake of {{chlorine}} by mixed bacterial cultures of varying polysaccharide content was studied in a homogeneous reaction system. The destructive effects of hypochlorite oxidation were noted by measuring decreases in solids concentrations of bacterial cultures and by measuring changes in molecular size distributions of polysaccharides extracted from those cultures. The bactericidal {{effects of a}} given concentration {{of chlorine}} were observed for bacteria with and bacteria without <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsules.</b> The uptake of chlorine by bacterial cultures {{was found to be}} significantly faster and greater for cultures grown at a higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (larger production of polysaccharides) as opposed to cultures grown at a lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, (smaller production of polysaccharides). Greater destruction of solids occurred in bacterial cultures with a higher polysaccharide-to-totalsolids-ratio for equal chlorine concentration applied. The molecular size distribution of bacterial polysaccharide molecules was shifted to a smaller average molecular size by the hypochlorite oxidation reactions. At the chlorine concentration used (50 mg/ 1), no added bactericidal protection was observed in bacteria with larger capsules...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of biomimetic microenvironments with specific chemical and physical cues {{for the organization}} and modulation {{of a variety of}} cell populations is of key importance in tissue engineering. We show that a range of human cell types, including promyoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, adenovirally transduced osteoprogenitors, immunoselected mesenchymal stem cells, and the osteogenic factor, rhBMP- 2 (BMP: bone morphogenic protein), can be successfully encapsulated within mineralized <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsules</b> without loss of function in vivo. By controlling the extent of mineralization within the alginate/chitosan shell membrane, degradation of the shell wall and release of cells or rhBMP- 2 into the surrounding medium can be regulated. In addition, we describe {{for the first time the}} ability to generate bead-in-bead capsules consisting of spatially separated cell populations and temporally separated biomolecule release, entrapped within alginate/chitosan shells of variable thickness, mineralization, and stability. Such materials offer significant potential as multifunctional scaffolds and delivery vehicles in tissue regeneration of hard and soft tissues...|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} yeast are {{opportunistic}} pathogens {{that can cause}} infection in people with compromised immune systems. Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are significant pathogens of immunocompromised people. They are the species primarily responsible for cryptococcosis, a fungal disease that occurs in about one million HIV/AIDS patients, causing over 600,000 deaths annually. The cells of these yeast are surrounded by a rigid <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsule,</b> which helps {{to prevent them from}} being recognised and engulfed by white blood cells in the human body.|$|E
5000|$|In 1900 it was {{recognized}} that different serovars of pneumococci exist and that immunization with a given serovar did not protect against infection with other serovars. Since then over ninety serovars {{have been discovered}} each with a unique <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsule</b> that can be identified by the quellung reaction. Because some of these serovars cause disease more commonly than others {{it is possible to}} provide reasonable protection by immunizing with less than 90 serovars; current vaccines contain up to 23 serovars (i.e., it is [...] "23-valent").|$|E
50|$|Many virulent {{bacteria}} possess {{the ability to}} generate a protective capsule around each individual cell. This capsule, made of long chains of sugars, provides an extra physical barrier between antibiotics, antibodies, and complement. The association of increased virulence with presence of a capsule was classically demonstrated in Griffith's experiment. A gene cluster responsible for secretion of the <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsule</b> has been identified and shown to inhibit the antibiotic effect of complement when grown on ascites fluid. A decrease in killing associated with loss of capsule production was then demonstrated using a rat virulence model.|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae {{isolates}} typically express one of over 90 immunologically distinguishable <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsules</b> (serotypes), {{which can}} be classified into "serogroups" based on cross-reactivity with certain antibodies. Pneumococci can alter their serotype through recombinations affecting the <b>capsule</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> synthesis (cps) locus. Twenty such "serotype switching" events were fully characterised using a collection of 616 whole genome sequences from systematic surveys of pneumococcal carriage. Eleven of these were within-serogroup switches, representing a highly significant (p < 0. 0001) enrichment based on the observed serotype distribution. Whereas the recombinations resulting in between-serogroup switches all spanned the entire cps locus, some of those that caused within-serogroup switches did not. However, higher rates of within-serogroup switching could not be fully explained by either more frequent, shorter recombinations, nor by genetic linkage to genes involved in β-lactam resistance. This suggested the observed pattern was a consequence of selection for preserving serogroup. Phenotyping of strains constructed to express different serotypes in common genetic backgrounds {{was used to test}} whether genotypes were physiologically adapted to particular serogroups. These data were consistent with epistatic interactions between the cps locus {{and the rest of the}} genome that were specific to serotype, but not serogroup, meaning they were unlikely to account for the observed distribution of capsule types. Exclusion of these genetic and physiological hypotheses suggested future work should focus on alternative mechanisms, such as host immunity spanning multiple serotypes within the same serogroup, which might explain the observed pattern...|$|R
40|$|Antibody binding to {{polysaccharide}} antigens {{has been}} {{thought to be}} based upon recognition ofa relatively simple oligosaccharide epitope consisting ofno more than six or seven sugar residues (1 - 3). The existence of more complex conformational epitopes has been postulated, {{but there has been}} little experimental evidence for conformational immunodeterminants in polysaccharide antigens. Recently, however, we have found evidence of a conformational epitope recognized by antibodies directed against the capsular polysaccharide of type III group B Streptococcus, and others have reported similar findings with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the a(2 [...] , 8) linked sialic acid <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsules</b> of Neisseria meningitides group B and Escherichia coli K 1 (4 - 6). In each case, the affinity of antibody binding to derivative oligosaccharides increased as the chain length ofthe antigen increased, up to hundreds of sugar residues in the case ofthe groupB streptococcal polysaccharide and up to at least 16 residues for the group B meningococcal/E. tote K 1 system, supporting the hypothesis that anticapsular antibodies recognized a conformational epitope fully expressed only in high molecular weight forms of the saccharide...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli {{produces}} <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>capsules</b> that, {{based on}} their mechanisms of synthesis and assembly, have been classified into four groups. The group 4 capsule (G 4 C) polysaccharide is frequently identical {{to that of the}} cognate lipopolysaccharide O side chain and has, therefore, also been termed the O-antigen capsule. The genes involved in the assembly of the group 1, 2, and 3 capsules have been described, but those required for G 4 C assembly remained obscure. We found that enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) produces G 4 C, and we identified an operon containing seven genes, ymcD, ymcC, ymcB, ymcA, yccZ, etp, and etk, which are required for formation of the capsule. The encoded proteins appear to constitute a polysaccharide secretion system. The G 4 C operon is absent from the genomes of enteroaggregative E. coli and uropathogenic E. coli. E. coli K- 12 contains the G 4 C operon but does not express it, {{because of the presence of}} IS 1 at its promoter region. In contrast, EPEC, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and Shigella species possess an intact G 4 C operon...|$|R
