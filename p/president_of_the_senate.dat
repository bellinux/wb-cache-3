He yielded the Senate presidency in 2000 to Franklin Drilon.|$|E

5|$|A solicitor, {{businessman}} and citizen soldier before his entry into politics, Gould {{was a member}} of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1882 to 1898, during which time he served as Minister for Justice in two Free Trade governments. He later served two years in the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1899 to 1901 until his election to the Australian Senate. Gould's interest in parliamentary procedure saw him become involved with the relevant standing committee and he was elected unopposed as the second <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1907. His tenure is remembered as more traditionalist and Anglophilic than his predecessor's.|$|E
5|$|Francis William Reitz, Jr. (Swellendam, 5 October 1844 – Cape Town, 27 March 1934) was a South African lawyer, politician, statesman, publicist, {{and poet}} {{who was a}} member of {{parliament}} of the Cape Colony, Chief Justice and fifth State President of the Orange Free State, State Secretary of the South African Republic at the time of the Second Boer War, and the first <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> of the Union of South Africa.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, {{after the}} old Boer republics {{received}} self-government, {{and in the}} run-up to the formation of the Union of South Africa, leading Afrikaner politicians J.C. Smuts and L. Botha asked Reitz to return to South Africa and play a role in politics again. Together with his wife, he established himself in Sea Point, Cape Town. In 1910, already sixty-six years old, he was appointed <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> of the newly formed Union of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the formal}} {{ceremony}} of granting assent in parliament {{has not been}} regularly used since the early 20th century. Now, the bill {{is sent to the}} governor-general's residence by the house in which it originated. The governor-general then signs the bill, sending messages to the <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and the speaker of the House of Representatives, who notify their respective houses of the governor-general's action. A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the Royal Assent in person in parliament since 1875.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{president}} of the state senate acted as governor should that office be vacant. The 1865 and 1868 constitutions created the office of lieutenant governor, who would similarly act as governor. This office was abolished in 1885, with the <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> again taking on that duty. The 1968 constitution recreated the office of lieutenant governor, who now becomes governor {{in the absence of the}} governor. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5|$|The 1776 {{constitution}} {{provided that}} the vice-president of the Legislative Council would act as governor (who {{was president of the}} Council) should that office be vacant. The 1844 constitution placed the <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> first in the line of succession, as did the subsequent 1947 constitution. A constitutional amendment in 2006 created the office of lieutenant governor, to be elected on the same ticket for the same term as the governor, and if the office of governor is vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. This office was first filled in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 {{constitution}} {{establishes a}} second house of parliament, the 100-seat Senate, {{was established in}} April 2013 and is headed by a <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> who is the constitutional successor in case of untimely vacancy of the Presidency of the Republic. The government recognises the authority of traditional chiefs, fons, and lamibe to govern {{at the local level}} and to resolve disputes as long as such rulings do not conflict with national law.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Constitution {{does not}} make {{provision}} for a Vice-President. However, separate insignia for the <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> in exercise of duties as acting head of state under Article 86, was created in 1986. This has a white square on the blue field, charged with {{the arms of the}} Republic in silver. Distinguishing insignia for former Presidents of the Republic was created in 2001; a tricolour {{in the style of the}} Presidential standard, it is emblazoned with the Cypher of Honour of the President of the Republic.|$|E

5|$|The {{president}} Cristina Fernández de Kirchner {{was out of}} {{the country}} at the moment, and although she arranged an early return, she could not return to the country in time for the funeral. As a result, the vice president Julio Cobos arranged the state funeral of Alfonsín, alongside Eduardo Fellner (president of the Chamber of deputies) and José Pampuro (acting <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate).</b> His widow, former First Lady of Argentina María Lorenza Barreneche, was unable to attend her husband's public state funeral due to her own declining health.|$|E
5|$|These were no easy years, again, {{as former}} Afrikaner compatriots {{found each other}} on {{two sides of the}} {{political}} fence, in a rapidly changing world. As in his earlier life, Reitz remained a man of outspoken convictions, which he aired freely. As such, he came into conflict with the Smuts government, and in 1920 he was not re-appointed as <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> He did remain a member of that House until 1929, however.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{session of}} the Senate begins with a call to order by the <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> After the call to order, the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At {{the discretion of the}} presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.|$|E

Jennings of the 7th District, which covers parts of Baltimore and Harford counties, was elected as the minority leader by the Senate's Republican Caucus following the 2014 elections.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge's {{speech was}} well received, and he {{attracted}} some admirers on its account; {{towards the end}} of the term, many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected unanimously to be <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus Frank Stearns, encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor. Stearns, an executive with the Boston department store R. H. Stearns, became another key ally, and began a publicity campaign on Coolidge's behalf before he announced his candidacy at the end of the 1915 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Dame Doris Sands Johnson DBE (19 June 192121 June 1983) was a Bahamian teacher, suffragette, and politician.
