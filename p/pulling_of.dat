5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E

5|$|According to {{industry}} sources, Capcom's reversal on GameCube exclusivity, particularly with Resident Evil 4, was a betrayal that soured relations between Capcom and Nintendo for several years. After this early <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> Capcom support, the GameCube {{went on to}} sell 22 million units, less than the Nintendo 64's 33 million units and {{only a fraction of}} the PlayStation 2's 155 million units. Though Resident Evil 4 was eventually ported to Nintendo's Wii in 2007, it also received a high-definition re-release for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. The 2002 GameCube remake of Resident Evil and Resident Evil Zero also received remasters for newer consoles in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Super Smash Bros. Brawl was released in 2008, featuring third party characters like Solid Snake from Konami and Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega as a selling point. Kotaku reported on a rumor that Nintendo refused to include a character from Capcom as a direct result of Resident Evil 4s multi-platform release. Years later, Capcom's own Mega Man appeared as a playable character in the next game in the series, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E

5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E
5|$|The room to {{the east}} of the Oak Bedroom is known as The Great Room. The room was {{established}} in the mid 17th century as part of a reception suite, and was used by George John, the Second Earl for important political conferences during his period as First Lord of the Admiralty and Home Secretary. The Great Room, predominantly red and gold in design like many of the first floor rooms, contains a table and chairs with a large gilded mirror with three urns in front of it. The long mirror, designed by James Stuart, who was noted for his Athenian designs, features a tableaux at the top with the Spencer coat of arms and the <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> chariots by cherubs, representing the love between John and Georgiana. The Great Room contains an extensive collection of miniature portraits, including a very rare Lucas de Heere portrait of Lady Jane Grey as a teenage girl at her family residence in Bradgate, Leicestershire. The Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa is mentioned in the 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana as hanging in one of the bedrooms at Althorp. It was sold in 1924 to art merchant Joseph Duveen, who sold it the following year to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.|$|E

25|$|P. tarminiana is {{controlled}} by land management agencies {{in some areas of}} New Zealand. Control is either by physical control (for example hand <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> seedlings) or using herbicides. Biological control research is underway in New Zealand.

500|$|The duel {{began at}} dawn on July 11, 1804, {{along the west}} bank of the Hudson River on a rocky ledge in Weehawken, New Jersey. Coincidentally, the duel took place {{relatively}} close to the location of the duel that ended the life of Hamilton's eldest son, Philip, three years earlier. After the seconds measured the paces, Hamilton, according to both William P.

Hamilton also refused the hairspring set of dueling pistols (that would make the <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> the trigger lighter) offered by Nathaniel Pendleton.|$|E

The album's title, also conceived by Love, references this as well, with the <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> the trigger-pin in a hand grenade functioning as a symbol for a body being decapitated. The album received mixed to positive critical reception, with critics addressing the strengths of individual tracks but noting a lack of cohesion. In the United Kingdom, the album peaked at #9 on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
500|$|The censors {{ended up}} pulling [...] "I'll See You in Court", {{preventing}} it from airing in the United States during the series' original run. Terry Rakolta, a political activist from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, had launched a letter-writing {{campaign against the}} program after viewing the Season 3 episode [...] "Her Cups Runneth Over" [...] in January 1989. Offended by the episode's content, she urged advertisers to boycott the show, several of whom did or pledged to more carefully screen the episodes for which they provided advertising. The campaign garnered more media attention than she had expected and the advertisers' more careful scrutiny of the individual episodes that they supported was a significant factor {{that led to the}} <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> [...] "I'll See You in Court".

500|$|Reviews of {{the film}} were mostly positive, but there was some {{confusion}} of critics which {{did not know how}} to respond to the film. Some critics took it for a historical film instead of a historical fiction. The New York Dramatic Mirror was one such outlet, which stated that they could not verify the authenticity of the story, but found the picture was excellent and artistic. Ever the one to highlight technical faults, the Mirror highlighted the original paintings error in the use of the flag as well as the film's omission of snow. The Morning Telegraph understood the historical fiction being presented and praised the production though they also highlighted technical issues in the splitting of the troops on the landing and the poor <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> a prop cannon. The Billboard praised the film's acting and photography, but did not specifically refer to whether the film was fictional when it stated, [...] "An incident from history at the period of the Revolution is the makeup of this picture." [...] Some of the highest praise was given by the reviewer of The Moving Picture World which stated, [...] "The story is so well told that the audience is held almost spellbound in places as the reel moves through the changing scenes. It is admirably done, staging, acting and photography combining to make an exceptionally attractive picture of this patriotic subject." ...|$|E
