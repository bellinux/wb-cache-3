5|$|In {{the final}} months of 1894, Robey {{returned}} to London to honour {{a contract for}} Augustus Harris at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the details of which are unknown. In September he starred {{in a series of}} stand-up comedy shows that he would <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> September between 1894 and 1899. These short performances, in English seaside resorts including Scarborough and Bournemouth, were designed chiefly to enhance his name among provincial audiences. For the 1895 and 1896 Christmas pantomimes, he appeared in Manchester and Birmingham, respectively, in the title role of Dick Whittington, for which he received favourable reviews and praise from audiences. Despite the show's success, Robey and his co-stars disliked the experience. The actress Ada Reeve felt that the production had a bad back-stage atmosphere and was thankful when the season ended, while the comedian Barry Lupino was dismayed at having his role, Muffins, considerably reduced.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral is {{the seat}} of the Church of England Diocese of Bath and Wells. Wells has been an ecclesiastical city of {{importance}} since at least the early 8th century. Parts of the building date back to the tenth century, and it is a grade I listed building. It is known for its fine fan vaulted ceilings, Lady Chapel and windows, and the scissor arches which support the central tower. The west front {{is said to be the}} finest collection of statuary in Europe, retaining almost 300 of its original medieval statues, carved from the cathedral's warm, yellow Doulting stone. The Chapter House, at the top of a flight of stone stairs, leading out from the north transept is an octagonal building with a fan-vaulted ceiling. It is here that the business of running the cathedral is still conducted by the members of the Chapter, the cathedral's ruling body. Wells Cathedral clock is famous for its 24-hour astronomical dial and set of jousting knights that <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> quarter-hour. The cathedral has the heaviest ring of ten bells in the world. The tenor bell weighs just over 56CWT (6,272lb, 2,844kg).|$|E

25|$|Educational {{outreach}} at the Folger {{began in}} the early 1970s; today, the Folger Education department continues those early efforts with a variety of programs for K–12 students and teachers that emphasize an active learning approach to Shakespeare. Teachers gather at the Folger for day-long and month-long programs to work to incorporate Shakespeare and performance in the classroom. The department also publishes a variety of materials for classroom use. Student programs include workshops, local residency initiatives, and a high school fellowship program during which students study Shakespeare at the Folger. The Emily Jordan Folger Children's Shakespeare Festival, founded in 1980, allows elementary students to <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> spring. The Secondary School Shakespeare Festival, founded the following year, brings students from grades 7–12 to perform half-hour collections of Shakespeare scenes in the Folger theater.|$|E
25|$|Second, it {{is assumed}} that while faster than light starships produce prodigious amounts of energy just for the needs of propulsion, there is not enough energy {{available}} to <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> possible function simultaneously. Therefore, each ship has to fill out an Energy Allocation form {{at the beginning of a}} turn, and 'pay' for all the functions (such as movement, shields and weapons) that it can then use during the turn. This procedure forces players to plan their actions for the following game turn, because systems left unpowered during the Energy Allocation Phase cannot be used during the turn (there is a rule for Reserve Power which a player can use to power up a ship system mid-turn, but this power comes from the ship's batteries which are few).|$|E

500|$|... "The General Operation" [...] ("L'Opération Générale") : Established by Antoine in 1910, {{it begins}} and ends with three strokes of bell. It is briefly {{announced}} by a dressed member. After meditating in a room {{on the back of}} the temple, a desservant climb to the highest platform, and the dressed follower goes to the other platform. Both are standing and pray for a few minutes to transmit the fluid to the churchgoers. Then, if the reading of the sacred texts is scheduled just after, as it is the case in France, the desservant whispers to the dressed follower to perform the reading. Originally Antoine practiced this form of worship only on holidays (except Sundays) and on the 1st and 15th days of each month, before extending it to the first four days of the week. It was in 1932 that the General Operation was performed in all Antoinist temples, and no longer only in the one of Jemeppe; furthermore, on 3 December 1933, Catherine decided that the ritual would be also <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> Sunday.|$|E

2500|$|Kuk Harrell, {{one of the}} {{producers}} of Talk That Talk, spoke on the recording of the album saying: [...] "In addition to touring, we are recording Rihanna's new album. We have a portable studio that we set up at the different hotels that we are staying at. We set up shop anywhere in the hotel. Before {{we went on the}} European leg of Rihanna's Loud tour, we started recording the album in Los Angeles. Rihanna likes to work late hours, so she would come into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am." [...] Continuing Harrell stated [...] "The show was the priority, and then the album. That's how the day was broken up." [...] Expanding on this Harrell stated that Rihanna would <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> night, finish her meet [...] and greet by 1 a.m. Then go to the studio for around two or three a.m. During these session Harrell stated [...] "I’d make the decision based off where I felt her voice was. Knowing she just did two hours of a show and meet-and-greets, I would suggest capturing the stuff that was easier to get like the lower-range stuff so we wouldn’t hurt or damage her voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Monolithic kernels, {{which have}} {{traditionally}} been used by Unix-like operating systems, contain all the operating system core functions and the device drivers. This is the traditional design of UNIX systems. A monolithic kernel is one single program that contains all of the code necessary to <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> kernel related task. Every part {{which is to be}} accessed by most programs which cannot be put in a library is in the kernel space: Device drivers, Scheduler, Memory handling, File systems, Network stacks. Many system calls are provided to applications, to allow them to access all those services. A monolithic kernel, while initially loaded with subsystems that may not be needed, can be tuned to a point where it is as fast as or faster than the one that was specifically designed for the hardware, although more relevant in a general sense. Modern monolithic kernels, such as those of Linux and FreeBSD, both of which fall into the category of Unix-like operating systems, feature the ability to load modules at runtime, thereby allowing easy extension of the kernel's capabilities as required, while helping to minimize the amount of code running in kernel space. In the monolithic kernel, some advantages hinge on these points: ...|$|E

6000|$|Vance Corliss {{proceeded}} at a fair rate {{to adapt}} {{himself to the}} Northland life, and he found that many adjustments came easy. While his own tongue was alien to the brimstone of the Lord, he became quite used to strong language {{on the part of}} other men, even in the most genial conversation. Carthey, a little Texan who went to work for him for a while, opened or closed every second sentence, on an average, with the mild expletive, [...] "By damn!" [...] It was also his invariable way of expressing surprise, disappointment, consternation, or {{all the rest of the}} tribe of sudden emotions. By pitch and stress and intonation, the protean oath was made to <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> function of ordinary speech. At first it was a constant source of irritation and disgust to Corliss, but erelong he grew not only to tolerate it, but to like it, and to wait for it eagerly. Once, Carthey's wheel-dog lost an ear in a hasty contention with a dog of the Hudson Bay, and when the young fellow bent over the animal and discovered the loss, the blended endearment and pathos of the [...] "by damn" [...] which fell from his lips was a relation to Corliss. All was not evil out of Nazareth, he concluded sagely, and, like Jacob Welse of old, revised his philosophy of life accordingly.|$|E
60|$|But the {{development}} of his manufacture of rubber was an entirely different business, {{and for a time}} profoundly interesting. It took him into a new astonishing world, the world of large-scale manufacture and industrial organization. The actual planning of the works was not in itself anything essentially new to him. So far as all that went it was scarcely more than the problem of arranging an experiment upon a huge and permanent scale, and all that quick ingenuity, that freshness and directness of mind that had made his purely scientific work so admirable had ample and agreeable scope. Even the importance of cost and economy at every point in the process involved no system of considerations that was altogether novel to him. The British investigator knows only too well the necessity for husbanded material and inexpensive substitutes. But strange factors came in, a new region of interest was opened with the fact that instead of one experimenter working with the alert responsive assistance of Durgan, a multitude of human beings--even in the first drafts of his project they numbered already two hundred, before the handling and packing could be considered--had to watch, control, assist or <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> stage in a long elaborate synthesis.

6000|$|Observe first, {{that the}} {{localisation}} {{is almost entirely}} dependent upon human art. You must at least take a stone and set it up for a pillar, if you are to mark the place, so as to know it again, where a vision appeared. A persecuted people, needing to conceal their places of worship, may <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> religious ceremony first under one crag of the hill-side, and then under another, without invalidating the sacredness of the rites or sacraments thus administered. It is, therefore, we all acknowledge, inessential, that a particular spot should be surrounded with a ring of stones, or enclosed within walls of a certain style of architecture, and so set apart as {{the only place where}} such ceremonies may be properly performed; and it is thus less by any direct appeal to experience or to reason, but in consequence of the effect upon our senses produced by the architecture, that we receive the first strong impressions of what we afterwards contend for as absolute truth. I particularly wish you to notice how it is always by help of human art that such a result is attained, because, remember always, I am neither disputing nor asserting the truth of any theological doctrine;--that is not my province;--I am only questioning the expediency of enforcing that doctrine by the help of architecture. Put a rough stone for an altar under the hawthorn on a village green;--separate a portion of the green itself with an ordinary paling from the rest;--then consecrate, with whatever form you choose, the space of grass you have enclosed, and meet within the wooden fence as often as you desire to pray or preach; yet you will not easily fasten an impression {{in the minds of the}} villagers, that God inhabits the space of grass inside the fence, and does not extend His presence to the common beyond it: and that the daisies and violets on one side of the railing are holy,--on the other, profane. But, instead of a wooden fence, build a wall, pave the interior space; roof it over, so as to make it comparatively dark;--and you may persuade the villagers with ease that you have built a house which Deity inhabits, or that you have become, in the old French phrase, a [...] "logeur du Bon Dieu." ...|$|E
