40|$|Recent {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} {{the fragmentation of}} primordial molecular clouds in hierarchical cosmogonies {{have suggested that the}} very first stars (the so–called Population III) may have been rather massive. Here we point out that a numerous population of massive black holes (MBHs) – with masses intermediate between those of stellar and supermassive holes – may be the endproduct of such an episode of <b>pregalactic</b> <b>star</b> formation. If only one MBH with m • ∼> 150 M ⊙ formed in each of the ‘minihalos’ collapsing at z ≈ 20 from 3 –σ fluctuations, then the mass density of Pop III MBHs would be comparable to that of the supermassive variety observed in the nuclei of galaxies. Since they form in high–σ rare density peaks, relic MBHs are predicted to cluster in the bulges of present–day galaxies as they become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger systems. Dynamical friction would cause> 50 (m•/ 150 M⊙) 1 / 2 such objects to sink towards the center. The presence of a small cluster of MBHs in galaxy nuclei may have several interesting consequences associated with tidal captures of ordinary stars (likely followed by disruption), MBH capture by the central supermassive black hole, gravitational wave radiation from such coalescences. Accreting pregalactic MBHs may be detectable as ultra–luminous, off–nuclear X–ray sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that the whole microwave background can be produced by a bright population of <b>pregalactic</b> <b>stars</b> at a redshift {{of a few hundred}} is explored. The radiation is thermalized by a combination of amorphous silicate, amorphous carbon, graphite, and needle-shaped conducting grains which give rise to the opacity needed at wavelengths greater than 3 cm. The occurrence of distortion in a primordial microwave background spectrum due to its interaction with Population III stars and dust is investigated. The possibility of producing deviations small enough to be consistent with the best available observations, but still detectable by COBE, is considered...|$|R

Several observational programs are described: (1) studies of very high redshift objects and their absorption spectra, and what they reveal about pregalactic gas and galaxy formation; (2) a large high-redshift galaxy survey for studying the evolution of galaxy clustering at z about 1 to 2; (3) generating a statistically complete catalog of several hundred gravitational lens systems; and (4) studies of the spectrum and anisotropy of the far-infrared background and what it reveals about the nature and distribution of <b>pregalactic</b> <b>stars,</b> gas, and dust...|$|R
40|$|The first {{generation}} of stars was formed from primordial gas. Numerical simulations suggest that the first stars were predominantly very massive, with typical masses M > 100 Mo. These stars {{were responsible for the}} reionization of the universe, the initial enrichment of the intergalactic medium with heavy elements, and other cosmological consequences. In this work, we study the structure of Zero Age Main Sequence stars for a wide mass and metallicity range and the evolution of 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 Mo galactic and pregalactic Pop III very massive stars without mass loss, with metallicity Z= 10 E- 6 and 10 E- 9, respectively. Using a stellar evolution code, a system of 10 equations together with boundary conditions are solved simultaneously. For the change of chemical composition, which determines the evolution of a star, a diffusion treatment for convection and semiconvection is used. A set of 30 nuclear reactions are solved simultaneously with the stellar structure and evolution equations. Several results on the main sequence, and during the hydrogen and helium burning phases, are described. Low metallicity massive stars are hotter and more compact and luminous than their metal enriched counterparts. Due to their high temperatures, <b>pregalactic</b> <b>stars</b> activate sooner the triple alpha reaction self-producing their own heavy elements. Both galactic and <b>pregalactic</b> <b>stars</b> are radiation pressure dominated and evolve below the Eddington luminosity limit with short lifetimes. The physical characteristics of the first stars have an important influence in predictions of the ionizing photon yields from the first luminous objects; also they develop large convective cores with important helium core masses which are important for explosion calculations.

40|$|If the {{luminosity}} per mass of {{the universe}} at redshifts z = 5 - 1000 were at least comparable to its present luminosity, then a conspicuous cosmological infrared radiation background would be produced. A number of situations where this could arise are surveyed, {{and the intensity of}} the background is evaluated for specific types of sources (protogalaxies, <b>pregalactic</b> <b>stars,</b> quasars, black holes, and decaying relict particles) in several candidate scenarios, which are also discussed in terms of metal enrichment, dark matter, and formation of large-scale structure. The spectrum of the background radiation is estimated, both with and without dust obscuration. General features of cosmological radiative transfer with dust are discussed. It is argued that dust is expected to degrade the background to the far-infrared, 100 - 1000 microns, where the wavelength of the spectral peak can be predicted from the total present-day background flux and depends only weakly on properties of the dust or the redshift of emission. The statistical properties of the anisotropy expected in the radiation and its relationship to the distribution of dust at the time the dust is formed or the radiation is produced are estimated. Intensity fluctuations at the few percent level on arc minute scales are typical in current galaxy-formation scenarios...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} a possible nucleosynthetic signature of highly energetic explosions of C-O cores ("hypernovae," HNe) {{which might be}} associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We note that the direct impact of C- and O-enriched hypernova ejecta on the ambient hydrogen and helium leads to spallation reactions which can produce large amounts of the light nuclides lithium, beryllium, and boron (LiBeB). Using analytic velocity spectra of the hypernova ejecta, we calculate the LiBeB yields of different exploding C-O cores associated with observed hypernovae. The deduced yields are ∼ 10 ^ 3 times higher than those produced by similar (direct) means in normal Type II supernovae, and are higher than the commonly used ones arising from shock wave acceleration induced by Type II supernova (SN) explosions. To avoid overproduction of these elements in our Galaxy, hypernovae should be rare events, with 10 ^- 3 hypernovae per supernova, assuming a constant HN/SN ratio over time. This rate is in good agreement with that of long duration GRBs {{if we assume that}} the gamma-ray emission is focussed with a beaming factor Ω/ 4 π 10 ^- 2. This encouraging result supports the possible HN-GRB association. Thus, Galactic LiBeB abundance measurements offer a promising way to probe the HN rate history and the possible HN-GRB correlation. On the other hand, if hypernovae are associated to very massive <b>pregalactic</b> <b>stars</b> (Population III) they would produce a LiBeB pre-enrichment in proto-galactic gas, which could show up as a plateau in the lowest metallicities of the Be-Fe relation in halo stars.

40|$|We {{describe}} how thermally produced anti-electron neutrinos (¯νe) from the homologously collapsing {{core of a}} supermassive star (M ∼> 5 × 104 M⊙) can lead to significant deuterium enrichment in the ejected envelope of such a star. Deuterium-enriched material at high redshift might then serve as {{a clue to the}} existence of <b>pregalactic</b> supermassive <b>stars.</b> Conceivably, the ejected deuterium-enriched material could intercept the line of sight to a distant QSO and mimic a Lyman limit absorber. In such a case, the deuterium abundance inferred from absorption lines might not reflect the true primordial abundance of deuterium. We discuss relevant theoretical uncertainties in supermassive star physics as well as potential observational signatures in Lyman α absorber clouds for processing by stars of this kind.

40|$|Abstract. Cosmological {{nucleosynthesis}} calculations {{imply that}} many of the baryons in the Universe must be dark.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{dust in the}} early {{universe}} on the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background are considered, taking into account the effects of a <b>pregalactic</b> generation of <b>stars.</b> It is shown that observed distortions of the background spectrum from that of a black body at 3 K could be due to emission by silicate dust grains at a metal abundance of 0. 00001 by mass and with a substantial energy input, which represent the remnants of population III stars. Attempts to fit the microwave background spectrum to the model of Rees (1978) in which the entire cosmic background is accounted for by grain emission are shown to require an implausible value for the metal abundance at early epochs, and not to agree with the millimeter and submillimeter spectrum observed by Woody and Richards (1979) ...|$|R

40|$|The first {{stars are}} assumed to be {{predominantly}} massive. Although, due to the low initial abundances of heavy elements the line-driven stellar winds are supposed to be inefficient in the first stars, these stars may loose a significant amount of their initial mass by other mechanisms. In this work, we study the evolution with a prescribed mass loss rate of very massive, galactic and <b>pregalactic,</b> Population III <b>stars,</b> with initial metallicities Z= 10 ^- 6 and Z= 10 ^- 9, respectively, and initial masses 100, 120, 150, 200, and 250 M_ during the hydrogen and helium burning phases. The evolution of these stars depends on their initial mass, metallicity and the mass loss rate. Low metallicity stars are hotter, compact and luminous, and they are shifted to the blue upper part in the Hertzprung-Russell diagram. With mass loss these stars provide an efficient mixing of nucleosynthetic products, and depending on the He-core mass their final fate could be either pair-instability supernovae or energetic hypernovae. These stars contributed to the reionization of the universe and its enrichment with heavy elements, which influences the subsequent star formation properties.

40|$|Abstract. Population III Stars (PopIII) are {{the first}} {{generation}} of stars formed from the collapse of the very first structures in the Universe. Their peculiar chemical composition (metalfree, resembling the Primordial Nucleosynthesis yields) affects their formation and evolution and makes them unusually big and hot stars. They are good candidates for the engines of Reionization of the Universe although their direct observation is extremely difficult. Here we summarize a study of their expected diffuse low-energy neutrino background flux at Earth. PopIII are the <b>pregalactic</b> generation of <b>stars</b> which formed from the pristine metal-free gas left from Primordial Nucleosynthesis. The dust- and metal-free gas from which they originated made them unusually heavy (O(200 M⊙)), extremely short lived (O(10 6) yrs), and with a high rate of Pair Instability Supernovae (PISNe). Their peculiarities make them extremely difficult to observe directly and so far no unambiguous observation has been reported. Such massive stars should have a high Supernova rate, and it is therefore reasonable to expect a huge ν emission associated with the PopIII phenomenon. We study their MeV-energy neutrino flux to understand if it can be considered as a direct observable for such a generation of stars, motivated also by the recent interest in modeling the diffuse fluxes due to different cosmic sources. Our simple model...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} {{detection}} by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe of a large optical depth to Thomson scattering, implying a very early reionization epoch, we assess a scenario where the universe was reionized by "miniquasars" powered by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), {{the remnants of the}} first generation of massive <b>stars.</b> <b>Pregalactic</b> IMBHs form within minihalos above the cosmological Jeans mass collapsing at z > 20, get incorporated through mergers into larger and larger systems, sink to the center as a result of dynamical friction, and accrete cold material. The merger history of dark halos and associated IMBHs is followed by Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in a CDM cosmology. Our model is based on the assumptions that quasar activity is driven by major mergers and nuclear IMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant. The long dynamical frictional timescales leave many IMBHs "wandering" in galaxy halos after a minor merger. While seed IMBHs that are as rare as the 3. 5 peaks of the primordial density field evolve largely in isolation, a significant number of BH binary systems will form if IMBHs populate the more numerous 3 peaks instead. In the case of rapid binary coalescence a fraction of IMBHs will be displaced from galaxy centers and ejected into the intergalactic medium (IGM) by the "gravitational rocket" effect, rather than accrete and shine as miniquasars. We show that, under a number of plausible assumptions for the amount of gas accreted onto IMBHs and their emission spectrum, miniquasars powered by IMBHs, and not their stellar progenitors, may be responsible for cosmological reionization at z 15. Reionization by miniquasars with a hard spectrum may be more "economical" than stellar reionization, as soft X-rays escape more easily from the dense sites of star formation and travel farther than EUV radiation. Energetic photons will permeate the universe more uniformly, make the low-density diffuse IGM warm and weakly ionized prior to the epoch of reionization breakthrough, set an entropy floor, and reduce gas clumping. Future 21 cm observations may detect a preheated, weakly ionized IGM in emission against the cosmic microwave background...|$|R
