5|$|Where it was {{necessary}} for the pipeline to curve to fit the route, the steel pipes were bent, using either a cold-bending approach, in which tractors would <b>pull</b> <b>and</b> <b>push</b> the pipelines into position, or a hot-bending method, with the pipe heated up by blow-torches and pulled into place using a jig. A new, specialized piece of equipment for bending pipes, the Cummings bending jig, was invented during the Big Inch build, and used on the construction of the Little Big Inch pipeline. To protect the pipeline from corrosion, its outside was then cleaned by machine, and painted in first a layer of coal tar enamel, and then hot coal tar coating, before being wrapped in asbestos felt. Finally the pipeline was lowered into position, taking care not to damage the ends of the pipes; the larger pipes were so heavy that they required a D-8 caterpillar tractor equipped with counter-weights to lift them. The trench was then back-filled, completing the process.|$|E

Technical accessories include cyclocomputers for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include lights, reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers, bags, water bottles and cages, and bell. Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high visibility clothing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{northern}} and Christian Europe during this period, financial competition developed between {{the authority of}} the Pope in Rome and nascent states and empires. This dynamic, with the Great Schism, recurrent fervid religious Crusades, Episcopal Inquisition and later protestations and wars between Christians themselves, caused repeated periods and occurrences of persecution against the established Jewish minority in [...] "Ashkenaz" [...] in modern Hebrew means Germanic Jews and with Ancient Hebrew it included the areas that are now northern France, Germany and Switzerland—masses of Jews began to move further to the east. There, they were welcomed by the king of Poland, and with Lithuania, grew greatly, and relatively flourished {{to the end of the}} 18th century. In western Europe, the conditions for Jewry differed between the communities within the various countries and over time, depending on background conditions. With both <b>pull</b> <b>and</b> <b>push</b> factors operating, Ashkenazi emigration to the Americas would increase in the early 18th century with German-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, and end with a tidal wave between 1880 and the early 20th century with Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazim, as conditions in the east deteriorated under the failing Russian Empire. With the Holocaust and the destruction of most European Jewry, North America would hold the majority of world Jewry.|$|E

Two separate tests were used (a timed <b>push</b> up test <b>and</b> a modified <b>pull</b> up test performed to exhaustion) and the ratio between <b>pulling</b> <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> strength was ranging between 1.5 and 2.7, according to gender.

6000|$|I {{must make}} a confession, even if it be humiliating. I {{have never been able}} to form the {{slightest}} conception of those [...] "forces" [...] which the Materialists talk about, as if they had samples of them many years in bottle. They tell me that matter consists of atoms, which are separated by mere space devoid of contents; and that, through this void, radiate the attractive and repulsive forces whereby the atoms affect one another. If anybody can clearly conceive the nature of these things which not only exist in nothingness, but <b>pull</b> <b>and</b> <b>push</b> there with great vigour, I envy him for the possession of an intellect of larger grasp, not only than mine, but than that of Leibnitz or of Newton.[61] To me the [...] "chimæra, bombinans in vacuo quia comedit secundas intentiones" [...] of the schoolmen is a familiar and domestic creature compared with such [...] "forces." [...] Besides, by the hypothesis, the forces are not matter; and thus all that is of any particular consequence in the world turns out to be not matter on the Materialist's own showing. Let it not be supposed that I am casting {223} a doubt upon the propriety of the employment of the terms [...] "atom" [...] and [...] "force," [...] as they stand among the working hypotheses of physical science. As formulæ which can be applied, with perfect precision and great convenience, in the interpretation of nature, their value is incalculable; but, as real entities, having an objective existence, an indivisible particle which nevertheless occupies space is surely inconceivable; and with respect to the operation of that atom, where it is not, by the aid of a [...] "force" [...] resident in nothingness, I am as little able to imagine it as I fancy any one else is.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results and}} analyses of an experimental study into {{the effects of}} geometric parameters on the propulsive characteristics of <b>puller</b> <b>and</b> <b>pusher</b> podded propulsors in straight course open water conditions. Five geometric parameters were chosen for the current study and a design of experiment technique was used to design a series of 16 pods that combined the parameters. Tests on the 16 different pod-strut-propeller combinations in <b>puller</b> <b>and</b> <b>pusher</b> configurations were completed using a custom designed podded propeller test rig. The dynamometry consisted of a sixcomponent global dynamometer and a three-component pod dynamometer. The test rig {{was used to measure}} the thrust and torque of the propellers, and forces and moments on the whole unit in the three orthogonal directions. The design of experiment analysis technique was then used to identify the most significant geometric parameters and interaction of parameters that affect propeller thrust, torque and efficiency as well as unit thrust and efficiency in both the <b>puller</b> <b>and</b> <b>pusher</b> configurations. An uncertainty analysis of the measurements is also presented. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
