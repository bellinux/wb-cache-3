40|$|Thin Þlm etching and {{deposition}} using {{low pressure}} <b>plasma</b> <b>reactors</b> {{is an integral}} part of the fabrication of Very-Large-Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. Standard operation of <b>plasma</b> <b>reactors</b> uses an RF power source with constant average power to excite a plasma in the vacuum chamber. Recently, several researchers have shown empirically that operation of <b>plasma</b> <b>reactors</b> with a periodic power input has the promise to increase the ßexibility of plasma processing, in the sense that a greater range of operating conditions are achievable. This paper presents a numerical analysis of a global model for an argon plasma with the aim of answering the following questions: First, can a periodic input achieve effective operating conditions that cannot be achieved using steady state inputs?

30|$|As microelectronic devices {{continue}} to shrink and process requirements become ever more stringent, plasma {{modeling and simulation}} becomes increasingly more attractive {{as a tool for}} design, control, and optimization of <b>plasma</b> <b>reactors</b> [15]. Several techniques are used to simulate the behavior of plasma processes based on the disparity in length and time scales. One of the simulation techniques, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), is widely used to predict the flow fields for engineering design features and to extrapolate experimental limitations. Its modeling has been applied to investigate the flow-mixing phenomena [16], but rare study in etching process. Therefore, this study proposed to characterize in detail thermal flow field of <b>plasma</b> <b>reactors</b> for etching process, and then to deduce numerical parameters that can be beneficial to experiments.|$|R

The nanometric powders produced are usually collected by porous filters, which are installed away from the <b>plasma</b> <b>reactor</b> section.

40|$|Beside {{negative}} affect of high voltage, such as electromagnetic wave radiation from SUTET tower that is believed effect the public health, existence of corona losses, {{radio and television}} interference, and audible noise, now high voltage is widely utilized to environtmental friendly aplication. Such as high voltage utilization to generate plasma, {{which is used to}} kill germs on Air Conditioner (AC) up to waste purification treatment. One of the method to generate plasma is by using the utilization of high voltage corona discharge on an electrode configuration in a chamber of <b>plasma</b> <b>reactor.</b> There are several electrode configuration methods to generate corona discharge. Corona discharge occurs between the electrode and ionizes gas surrounding the electrode, then generates corona dishcarge plasma. The number of plasma generated depends on the amount of high voltage, configuration and material of electrode used, and the disctance between the high voltage electrode. In this final research will be held a comparative of the electrode configuration in the corona discharge <b>plasma</b> <b>reactor</b> using high voltage impulse source, which are electrode configuration of wire to cylinder, spiral to cylinder, wire to cylinder with DBD, and spiral to cylinder with DBD. By setting the geometry electrode configuration on the <b>plasma</b> <b>reactor,</b> will be expected to obtain more corona discharge thus more plasma generated. The number of plasma generated in the reactor will be applied to softdrink industrial wastewater treatment. High voltage corona discharge plasma generated in each <b>plasma</b> <b>reactor</b> will be propotional to the number of process circulation held to softdrink industrial wastewater, where more process circulation held, so there will be more plasma generated, and the value of COD, TSS, and color level in wastewater will be more decreased. And so as the high voltage supplied, that more the number of high voltage applied, so there will be more plasma generated, and the lower value of COD, TSS, and color lever in wastewater will be obtained. As the effect of process circulation number (0 - 6 th circulation) held, <b>plasma</b> <b>reactor</b> that able to decrease lowest value of COD is <b>plasma</b> <b>reactor</b> with spiral to cylinder electrode configuration, <b>plasma</b> <b>reactor</b> that able to decrease lowest TSS value is <b>plasma</b> <b>reactor</b> with wire to cylinder electrode configuration, and the lowest value of color level is obtained in <b>plasma</b> <b>reactor</b> with electrode configuration of spiral to cylinder with DBD.
