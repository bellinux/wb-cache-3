40|$|Net Zero Energy Building {{design is}} a very {{important}} issue, since to reach the 2020 goal, an effective combination of envelope energy efficiency and integrated renewable systems is required. This paper investigates the case of a house located in northern Italy, in a temperate climate with warm summer. Starting from the actual energyefficient design of the house, parametric analyses are developed with the aim of understanding the effects of alternative / additional strategies that may lead to the "nearly zero energy" performance. The variables considered in the parametrical analysis are related to the building envelope. On the energy demand side, passive solar design techniques such as <b>passive</b> solar <b>heating,</b> <b>insulation</b> and air tightness, solar control windows, shading and interior layout were taken into account to reduce the energy demand of the building. Innovative materials in the design and construction of the vertical and horizontal envelope were considered as well. Energy modeling was performed with the TRNSYS software in order to assess the energy transient behaviour of the house...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, energy {{consumption}} growth has closely paralleled economic activity. In {{addition to this}} growing demand for energy, consumers are demanding increasingly flexible, convenient, and clean energy forms. The focus of a sustainable energy future has been towards the energy demand sector. The building sector particularly consumes one third of total U. S. energy. As a result, reduced consumption in this sector {{has the potential for}} high impact. Zero net energy buildings provide a technically feasible approach to reducing energy consumption in buildings. These buildings are designed and constructed to generate all of the energy they require through a combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy generation technologies. Viable renewable energy sources consist of photovoltaic cells, solar water heaters, and geothermal heat pumps. On the energy demand side, passive solar design techniques such as <b>passive</b> solar <b>heating,</b> <b>insulation</b> and air tightness, solar control windows, shading, interior space planning, and landscaping reduce the energy demand of buildings. The use of high efficiency lighting and appliances also contributes to energy efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In conclusion, the <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> by {{radiation}} sheet packages or laminated foams is {{a complex}} problem, which only can be understood {{with the help of}} analytical simulations: On the one hand, the <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> is determined by the thermal conductivity. On the other hand, the reflectivity of the surfaces plays an important role. In particular the reflectivity of non laminated foams as well as the reflectivity of laminated foams has not been investigated until now. In principle, the benefit of the usage of open celled foams as <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> is twofold: Firstly, to the mass of the heat shields is reduced considerably and thus the production costs are expected to decrease. Secondly, it is expected, that better <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> capability may result in lower energy consumption of the furnaces. In conclusion, the project shows that open celled foams out of molybdenum are a potent substitute for conventional radiation sheet <b>heat</b> <b>insulation.</b> Since the masses of the Mo-foams is distinctly lower than that one of the radiation sheets, it is expected, that the use of foams as <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> will noticeably reduce production costs...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{standard}} semitransparent photovoltaic (PV) modules can largely replace architectural glass {{installed in}} the windows, skylights, and facade of a building. Their main features are power generation and transparency, as well as possessing a heat insulating effect. Through <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> solar glass (HISG) encapsulation technology, this study improved {{the structure of a}} typical semitransparent PV module and explored the use of three types of high-reflectivity <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> films to form the HISG building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) systems.

The experimental results indicated that the <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> performance and power generation of HISGs were both improved. Selecting an appropriate <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> film so that a larger amount of reflective solar radiation is absorbed by the back side of the HISG can yield greater enhancement of power generation.

40|$|In {{the time}} when {{sustainable}} construction as well as cost saving on heating and cooling of buildings {{is one of the}} most important construction trends, it is important to acknowledge the possibilities of application of construction materials with high <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> parameters and the ways in which these parameters can be obtained. Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a load bearing construction material, which has high <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> parameters, although it has one significant disadvantage. If the AAC masonry construction has high moisture content, it loses its <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> properties. This is the reason why it is important to detect the humidity distribution throughout the cross section of the masonry elements in order to conduct the drying process of the AAC construction. Therefore, the question about non-destructive detection of humidity distribution throughout the cross section of the material arises. Humidity distribution throughout the cross section of AAC masonry constructions has a significant impact on its heat resistivity properties. Application of electrical impedance spectrometry (EIS) method for determination of humidity distribution throughout the cross section of AAC constructions has been a subject of research recently. The EIS method is an easily applicable non-destructive testing method for detection of the humidity distribution throughout the cross section of a construction. Research on the impact of the external <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> layer on the speed of humidity distribution changes is described in this paper...|$|R

The drawback of heat-insulation materials made of diatomite is their low temperature of prolonged service in heating equipment (ordinarily no higher than 950  °C).
