40|$|Four {{detailed}} intercomparisons {{were made}} {{for a number of}} models of cavity-type self-calibrating radiometers (<b>pyrheliometers).</b> Each intercomparison consisted of simultaneous readings of <b>pyrheliometers</b> at 30 -second intervals in runs of 10 minutes, with at least 15 runs per intercomparison. Twenty-seven instruments were in at least one intercomparison, and five were in all four. Summarized results and all raw data are provided from the intercomparisons...|$|R

A disparity is noted among total irradiance values obtained in near-simultaneous measurements with absolute <b>pyrheliometers</b> of similar design and operational modes which (1) indicates the uncertainty associated with currently available instruments, and (2) recommends intercalibration of electrically self-calibrating <b>pyrheliometers</b> from spacecraft...|$|R
50|$|A <b>pyrheliometer</b> is an {{instrument}} for measurement of direct beam solar irradiance. Sunlight enters the instrument through a window and is directed onto a thermopile which converts heat to an electrical signal that can be recorded. The signal voltage is converted via a formula to measure watts per square metre. It is used with a solar tracking system to keep the instrument aimed at the sun. A <b>pyrheliometer</b> is often {{used in the same}} setup with a pyranometer.|$|E
50|$|Typical <b>pyrheliometer</b> {{measurement}} applications include scientific meteorological {{and climate}} observations, material testing research, {{and assessment of}} the efficiency of solar collectors and photovoltaic devices.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyrheliometer</b> {{measurement}} specifications {{are subject}} to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards.Comparisons between pyrheliometers for intercalibration are carried out regularly to measure the amount of solar energy received.The aim of the International <b>Pyrheliometer</b> Comparisons, which take place every 5 years at the World Radiation Centre in Davos, is to ensure the world-wide transfer of the World Radiometric Reference.During this event, all participants bring their instruments, solar-tracking and data acquisition systems to Davos to conduct simultaneous solar radiation measurements with the World Standard Group.|$|E
40|$|A decisive {{influence}} on the overall uncertainty of common field <b>pyrheliometers</b> is caused by their laboratory calibration using artificial light sources and instruments {{of the same kind}} as references. Alternative outdoor calibrations allow the use of an absolute cavity radiometer as a more accurate reference. As the sun is used as light source for these calibrations actual sky conditions can influence the outdoor calibration and have to be monitored. If test and reference instruments have different angular acceptance functions circumsolar radiation can have a crucial effect on the calibration accuracy. With outdoor calibrations carried out by DLR the calibration uncertainty of K&Z <b>pyrheliometers</b> could be reduced from 0. 9...|$|R
30|$|The DNI {{data can}} be {{measured}} by <b>pyrheliometers</b> which are mounted on an instrument that tracks the sun or by rotating shadow band pyranometers [6]. The <b>pyrheliometers</b> and tracking systems have a high investment cost and require daily monitoring to ensure {{the accuracy of the}} data. Unfortunately, DNI ground-based measurements are rarely available at the location of interest because the reasons of high cost and maintenance problems especially for developing countries like Algeria. This lack of DNI data contrasts with the availability of global and diffuse horizontal irradiance data (GHI, DHI), which are easy to find or measure, cause the instrumentation used for collection of GHI and DHI {{data can be}} an order of magnitude less expensive, and are not as labor intensive [7].|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{radiometer}} intercomparison experiment, {{different combinations}} of pyranometer and <b>pyrheliometers</b> were used to estimate diffuse solar irradiance on a horizontal surface. Sixteen combinations were possible with four pyranometers and four <b>pyrheliometers.</b> The values were intercompared and then compared to the measured values, obtained with a solar tracking/occulting disc system. The difference in estimated values using different radiometer combinations varied from 1 to 21 W/m 2. It was found that uncertainty in measuring the global irradiance accounted {{for most of the}} difference in estimated values. In the worst case, a 2. 1 per cent difference in the global irradiance as measured by two different pyranometers caused a 12 per cent difference in estimates of the diffuse irradiance. It is shown that, if the estimated and measured values are analyzed statistically, agreement to within 1 per cent is possible...|$|R

50|$|Pyrheliometers are {{typically}} {{mounted on a}} solar tracker. As the <b>pyrheliometer</b> only 'sees' the solar disk, {{it needs to be}} placed on a device that follows the path of the sun.|$|E

40|$|Issue {{is taken}} with the ascription of the 2 % {{discrepancy}} in values of solar irradiance at {{the surface of the}} earth, found between the measurements performed by the absolute radiometers of Kendall and Wilson and those obtained by Eppley-Angstrom <b>pyrheliometers,</b> to the possibility that the two types of instruments might collect different amounts of circumsolar radiation.

50|$|He {{developed}} a <b>pyrheliometer</b> and made, between 1837 and 1838, the first quantitative {{measurements of the}} solar constant. His estimate was 1228 W/m2, {{very close to the}} current estimate of 1367 W/m2. Using the Dulong-Petit law inappropriately, he estimated the temperature of the Sun's surface to be around 1800 °C. This value was corrected in 1879 to 5430 °C by Jožef Stefan (1835-1893).|$|E
50|$|The 3000 <b>pyrheliometer</b> {{measurements}} of solar irradiance made at Brukkaros nonetheless proved useful. These measurements were {{made available to}} the South African Weather Bureau when it started its country-wide radiation survey in 1952. At that time they represented the longest series of {{measurements of}} the solar radiation incident on the central plateau of southern Africa. The measurements were used for two purposes. First, to calculate the solar irradiance available at various times during the day and year, for possible industrial applications. Second, to estimate the amount of total (sun plus sky) radiation for climatological purposes.|$|E
50|$|An Abbot silver-disk <b>pyrheliometer</b> {{was placed}} on the {{platform}} outside the observatory tunnel to measure the solar irradiance.The instrument was on an equatorial mount, so that the sun could be followed by adjusting a single screw. Exposures needed to be accurately timed, for which purpose a pendulum beating half seconds was used. The altitude of the sun at the time of each observation was measured with a theodolite, so that the amount of air through which the radiation had passed could be calculated. A pyranometer was used to measure irradiance from a circular region of sky around the sun, excluding the sun itself. It was on the same mount as the <b>pyrheliometer,</b> so that it would automatically point in the same direction. The stone platform also contained a coelostat, consisting of two flat mirrors, one of which was driven by clockwork and mounted so as to keep the sun's rays reflected continuously through an opening in the northern wall of the tunnel. The mirrors were made of stellite, a hard cobalt alloy that does not form tarnish easily. Inside the tunnel a well dispersed spectrum of the sun was slowly passed over the sensitive strip of a bolometer. The resulting bolograph displayed the relative amounts of energy at each wavelength in the visible and infrared region of the spectrum, which could be used to determine atmospheric absorption at various wavelengths. After various corrections, the value of the solar constant could be calculated.|$|E
40|$|Current {{knowledge}} of the total solar flux (the solar constant) and its spectral distribution {{at the top of}} the earth's atmosphere is reviewed. The development of <b>pyrheliometers</b> and radiation scales is traced, noting that active cavity <b>pyrheliometers</b> have been developed to reduce measurement uncertainty to within 0. 1 /%. The weighted mean solar constant from ground-based, aircraft, balloon, spacecraft and sounding rocket observations has been calculated to be 1369 W/sq m. Future observations are planned in order to reduce uncertainty to the 0. 1 % level required for climatological studies. A comparison of the measurement and models of solar spectral irradiance obtained by Thekaekara (1969, 1974), Arvesen (1969) and Labs and Neckel (1968, 1975) shows that the spectrum of Labs and Neckel is most accurate in the 0. 4 to 1. 25 micron range, that of Arvesen is best in the 0. 3 to 0. 4 abd 1. 25 to 2. 5 micron ranges and the model of Labs and Neckel is best at wavelengths greater than 2. 5 microns...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years {{continuous}} measurements of direct solar irradiance have been taken in Modena (37 m. a. s. l.) using <b>pyrheliometers</b> with three filters (quartz filters, OG 51, RG 61). The apparent atmospheric transmission calculated using the so-called rationing technique can be utilised as a useful parameter to monitor the atmosphere. Preliminary results suggest that the atmospheric transmission seems be able to highlight meteorological events such as the transport of dust...|$|R
40|$|Depending on {{the present}} {{atmospheric}} conditions a considerable part of the direct solar radiation can be scattered into the circumsolar region closely surrounding the solar disk. This forward scattered radiation, the circumsolar radiation, is widely detected by <b>pyrheliometers,</b> while concentrating solar collectors can only use a concentrator specific fraction of it. This lower response to circumsoalr radiation can lead to systematic overestimations of the collector performance. when thin clouds mask the sun, this overestimation can be greater than 10...|$|R
50|$|Orest, son of {{the noted}} Orientalist Daniel Chwolson, {{graduated}} from St.Petersburg University in 1873. He began teaching at his alma mater in 1876 and would become a professor in 1891. Orest Khvolson authored a number of works on electricity, magnetism, photometry, and actinometry. He proposed the designs of actinometer and <b>pyrheliometer,</b> which would {{be used by the}} Russian weather stations for a long time. After 1896, Khvolson was mainly engaged in compiling the five-volume Physics Course (Курс физики), which would improve immensely the teaching of physics throughout the country and remain a principal textbook in universities for years to come. It was even translated into the German, French, and Spanish languages.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers {{can measure}} the {{intensity}} of sunlight using a sunshine recorder, pyranometer, or <b>pyrheliometer.</b> To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, both Earth's elliptical orbit and the attenuation by Earth's atmosphere {{have to be taken}} into account. The extraterrestrial solar illuminance (...) , corrected for the elliptical orbit by using the day number of the year (dn), is given to a good approximation by where dn=1 on January 1st; dn=32 on February 1st; dn=59 on March 1 (except on leap years, where dn=60), etc. In this formula dn-3 is used, because in modern times Earth's perihelion, the closest approach to the Sun and, therefore, the maximum [...] occurs around January 3 each year. The value of 0.033412 is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion (0.98328989 AU) squared and the aphelion (1.01671033 AU) squared should be approximately 0.935338.|$|E
5000|$|The program uses various inputs that {{describe}} the atmospheric conditions {{for which the}} irradiance spectra are to be calculated. Ideal conditions, based on various possible model atmospheres and aerosol models, can be selected by the user. Alternatively, realistic conditions can also be specified as inputs, based for example on aerosol and water vapor data provided by a sunphotometer. In turn, these realistic conditions are necessary to compare the modeled spectra to those measured by a spectroradiometer. Reciprocally, since the model is well validated, this comparative method {{can be used as}} guidance to detect malfunction or miscalibration of instruments. The original spectral resolution of the model is 0.5 nm in the UV, 1 nm in the visible and near-infrared, and 5 nm above 1700 nm. To facilitate comparisons between the modeled spectra and actual measurements at a different spectral resolution, the SMARTS post-processor may be used to smooth the modeled spectra and adapt them to simulate the optical characteristics of a specific spectroradiometer. Additionally, the model provides the spectrally-integrated (or [...] "broadband") irradiance values, which can then be compared to measurements from a <b>pyrheliometer</b> (for direct radiation) or pyranometer (for diffuse or global radiation) at any instant. Besides the atmospheric conditions, another important input is the solar geometry, which can be defined by the sun position (zenith angle and azimuth), the air mass, or by specifying the date, time and location.|$|E

After matriculation he studied at Stellenbosch University and graduated cum laude in 1927 and went on to obtain his M.Sc. in 1929, winning the Van der Horst Prize. In 1930 he joined the Solar Research Station run by the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution at Brukkaros, the caldera of an extinct volcano in South West Africa. American researcher William H. Hoover and his colleague Frederick Atwood Greeley, ran an observatory on the mountain from 1926 to December 1931, collecting solar radiation data so as to find a correlation with the earth’s weather. To this end detailed observations were made of the Solar Constant. High-altitude observatories were set up at various locations - Mount Montezuma in Chile, initially at Mount Harqua Hala in Arizona (later moved to Table Mountain in California) and lastly Mount Brukkaros, a site selected by Charles Greeley Abbot, and later moved to Mount St. Katherine on the Sinai peninsula. The Brukkaros observatory consisted of a 10m deep tunnel in the flank of the mountain. A solar telescope or coelostat {{at the mouth of the}} tunnel passed sunlight to a spectrograph, an Ångström compensation <b>pyrheliometer</b> and a bolometer further in.In 1932 Bleksley was appointed as Junior Lecturer in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Witwatersrand, eventually becoming head of the department. Whilst there he worked on and completed his doctoral thesis A Statistical and Analytical Study of the Phenomenon of Long-period Stellar Variability. During this period he took sabbatical leave and studied under Sir Arthur Eddington at Cambridge, Professor Hans Ludendorff of the Astrophysical Observatory at Potsdam and Ejnar Hertzsprung at Leiden. He was President of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 1948/49 and one of about 100 people who attended the founding of the SA Institute of Physics on 7 July 1955.|$|E

40|$|At present, solar total {{irradiance}} {{measurements are}} made from four satellites using electrically self calibrating <b>pyrheliometers,</b> {{as a part of}} the earth radiation budget measurement programs. The Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) mission onboard Nimbus- 7 spacecraft (Nimbus/ERB) started solar total irradiance measurements in November 1978, and is still obtaining irradiance data on every orbit, daily. The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) solar monitors onboard Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), NOAA- 9 and NOAA- 10 started solar total irradiance measurements in October 1984, January 1985, and October 1986, respectively. Our knowledge of solar total irradiance and its variability has grown remarkably during the past few years, as a result of the above measurements, and the high precision data obtained from Solar Maximum Mission/Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor- 1 (SMM/ACRIM- 1). The results from a comparative study of the solar constant data available from the above missions are presented. The solar constant value derived from the sensors agree within the uncertainty associated with absolute <b>pyrheliometers</b> available at present. An attempt will be made to correlate the solar irradiance variability with other solar parameters. The measurements from Nimbus- 7 /ERB started November 1978, as the solar cycle 21 was increasing in activity. The solar luminosity reached a maximum in the spring of 1979. The irradiance then decreased slowly to a minimum which lasted from 1984 through 1986. The irradiance is presently increasing towards a new maximum.
