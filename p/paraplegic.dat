5|$|The Commonwealth <b>Paraplegic</b> Games were an international, multi-sport event {{involving}} {{athletes with}} a disability from the Commonwealth countries. The event was {{sometimes referred to as}} the <b>Paraplegic</b> Empire Games and British Commonwealth <b>Paraplegic</b> Games. Athletes were generally those with spinal injuries or polio. The event was first held in 1962 and disestablished in 1974. The Games were held in the country hosting the Commonwealth Games for able-bodied athletes. The countries that had hosted the Commonwealth <b>Paraplegic</b> Games were Australia, Jamaica, Scotland and New Zealand in 1962, 1966, 1970 and 1974 respectively. Six countries — Australia, England, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales — had been represented at all Commonwealth <b>Paraplegic</b> Games. Australia and England had been the top-ranking nation two times each: 1962, 1974 and 1966, 1970 respectively.|$|E

5|$|It {{was decided}} to hold the games in Perth because the city was to host the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and Royal Perth Hospital had a well {{developed}} spinal unit that could support <b>paraplegic</b> athletes. The Commonwealth <b>Paraplegic</b> Games were held before the main Games as to not impact on this event and provide the opportunity for athletes to stay on for the main Games.|$|E
5|$|The First Commonwealth <b>Paraplegic</b> Games {{were held}} in Perth, Western Australia from 10 to 17 November 1962. These Games preceded the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games which {{were held in}} Perth from 22 November to 1 December of that year. The Commonwealth <b>Paraplegic</b> Games were {{conceived}} by Dr George Bedbrook after Perth {{won the right to}} host the Commonwealth Games. Great support was received from the Royal Perth Hospital, a leading spinal rehabilitation centre in Australia.|$|E

With Dr. Crick in custody, Walter learns that the man had worked in aerospace to find an alloy for fighter craft. He happened upon the combination of the osmium-lutetium alloy that generated a material lighter than air, and sought to refine a permanent solution to give his own <b>paraplegic</b> son the ability to walk, having promised the same to those that had died from earlier, lethal doses of the alloy.|$|E
5|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of <b>paraplegic</b> (spinal cord and polio) athletes in Australia, {{particularly}} Western Australia. The spectator attendance amazed leading officials such as Dr Ludwig Guttmann, {{the founder of the}} Stoke Mandeville Games. He commented that the attendance was the best he had seen at any <b>paraplegic</b> sports event in the world. The Games highlighted the versatility of the athletes with many winning medals in different sports. It was noted that generally the standard of performance was below that of the Stoke Mandeville Games; however there were several outstanding performers including Vic Renalson, Bill Mather-Brown, Lorraine Dodd, M. Bazeley, Lynne Gilchrist and R. Scott who broke records in their events. A film of the Games was made.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{review the}} state of the art of {{multi-channel}} electrical stimulation (ES) systems with surface electrodes for assistance in the standing and walking of <b>paraplegics</b> and hemiplegics. For the group of complete <b>paraplegics,</b> walking achieved with available ES systems is below their expectations, especially since these systems cannot compete with mobility provided to them by a wheelchair. However, standing and walking with ES systems are beneficial because they contribute to the improvement of physiological functions. For individuals who can stand with some arm support (e. g., <b>paraplegics</b> with incomplete injury and hemiplegics), the current ES systems are an effective augmentation of walking. We suggest that an ES system for walking of incomplete <b>paraplegics</b> and hemiplegics will be better accepted if the stimulation is regulated by a rulebased control, that is, a preprogrammed, sensor-triggered activation of several muscles resulting in normal walking. We present a method to obtain muscle activity profiles from simulation of a customized model of the patient that can be used for the synthesis of rules for control.
