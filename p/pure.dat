Another method is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode.|$|E

5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25%anhydrous ethanol, or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels. <b>Pure</b> gasoline is no longer sold in the country because these high ethanol blends are mandatory since 1993.

5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not <b>pure,</b> but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of <b>pure</b> states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for <b>pure</b> states.|$|E
