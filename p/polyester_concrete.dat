Investigation included mode of failure, moment-curvature response, variation of neutral axis depth with moments {{and the effect of}} tensile and compression steel reinforcement on the strength and ductility of the beams. This evaluation is not only important from the standpoint that resins based on recycled PET were used, but also because very few investigations have been done in this area with steel-reinforced PC using virgin resins.

"December, 2012 "Performance under static and fatigue loads are evaluated for two different wearing surfaces for possible use on the steel orthotropic deck of San Mateo Hayward Bridge in the bay area of California. The two wearing surface materials studied include a 2 " thick (nominal) premixed <b>polyester</b> <b>concrete</b> (PC) and a 2 " thick (nominal) epoxy asphalt concrete (EAC). Flexural specimens that comprise a “steel-plate - wearing surface” composite simulating the surfacing system and geometry specific to the orthotropic steel deck of the San Mateo Hayward Bridge are used for the static and fatigue tests. Flexural tests were conducted at different dynamic loading frequencies (0. 0167, 1. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0 and 15. 0 Hz) and at several different temperatures (20 ˚F- 120 ˚F) to study the temperature dependency and loading rate effects. Following these tests, the fatigue tests were conducted on replicate EAC and PC composite specimens at each of room (70 °F), cold (32 °F) and hot (120 °F) temperatures. Both wearing surface systems performed well at the cold temperatures, surviving 10 million fatigue cycles. Both wearing surfaces experienced cracking at the room and hot temperatures prior to 10 million cycles and these cracks did not result in wearing surface delamination or local debonding. The comparative study in this exhaustive laboratory investigation has shown that the 2 " thick PC material could perform equally well as the original EAC wearing surface existing on San Mateo Hayward Bridge...|$|E

The study herein proposes strain monitoring the recycling of foundry sand with organic pollutants, as inert, in the manufacturing process of polymer concrete using optical fiber sensors. This work also analyzes the compressive strength of <b>polyester</b> polymer <b>concrete</b> made with foundry waste, i. e., recycled foundry sand and <b>polyester</b> polymer <b>concrete</b> made with fresh sand. The foundry sands are contaminated with Sodium Silicate from the mould-making process. Polymer Concrete (PC) is a composite material in which the binder consists entirely of a synthetic organic polymer. Optical fiber sensors present {{a great deal of}} potential in monitoring the structural health condition of materials. Experimental results show that the use of the embedded FBG sensor can accurately measure strain, providing information to the operator that the structure is subjected to failure.

The method applied {{in this study was}} retrofitting by applying <b>polyester</b> resin <b>concrete.</b> In order to know the effect of <b>polyester</b> resin <b>concrete</b> against axial load capacity, stiffness, ductility and the damage pattern of columns by eccentrically loaded, an experimental laboratory was carried out. In this study, three column specimens are tested. The dimension of the specimen is 150 mm x 150 mm and the high of the column are 1200 mm with the effective high is 600 mm and 600 mm for corbel. The column specimens have a fixed eccentricity of 50 mm. First, initial column tested before yield point of reinforcing bar reached and concrete crack limited to 0, 4 mm. Further, retrofitting applied to each initial column specimen using normal <b>concrete</b> and <b>polyester</b> resin <b>concrete</b> with the level of resin 15 % and 20 %, respectively. Retrofitting column tested again with the same loading of initial column until it reaches the collapse load. The result of experiment compares to analysis method by Nawy and Whitney which represent the analysis of normal concrete column capacity. The result showed that levels of resin to be used is 20 % because of better workability compared to 15 % resin. Further, compressive test on resin concrete cylinder showed that the resin level at 15 % and 20 % are 82. 82 MPa and 76. 65 MPa, respectively. The strength of KR-ii decreased about 33. 523 %. The strength of KR- 15 ii and KR- 20 ii increased 5. 08 % and 24. 827 % respectively compared to initial column. Specimen column stiffness KR-ii. KR- 15 ii and KR- 20 ii decreased about 76. 22 %, 24. 50 % and 37. 65 %, respectively from the initial column. Furthermore, ductility of KR-ii, KR- 15 ii and KR- 20 ii decreased about 1. 512, 1. 250 and 2. 50, respectively. The changes of the ultimate capacity load of KR-ii, KR- 15 ii and KR- 20 ii by Nawy Method respectively - 26. 54 %, 12. 66 %, and 13. 83 %, whereas the method of Whitney respectively - 17. 68 %, 26. 25 %, and 27. 56 %.

40|$|Abstract. The {{addition}} of fiber into concrete {{can not only}} suppress the interior shrinkage strain and decrease the thermal dilation coefficient (TDC) of concrete, but also it can lessen the width of shrinkage crack, especially reduce the appearance of interconnected pore, thus {{the reduction of the}} water content of capillary pore will make the TDC of paste matrix lessen. In this paper, an experiment was designed to study the TDC from the 5 th day to the 29 th day after the concrete was poured. The results show that the {{addition of}} fiber can effectively reduce the TDC of concrete. When the addition is the same, high-modulus carbon fiber reinforced concrete has a lower TDC than low-modulus <b>polyester</b> fiber <b>concrete...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the study of a highly durable <b>polyester</b> polymer <b>concrete</b> {{reinforced}} with glass fibre reinforced polymer rebars. The paper describes the properties of this specific concrete, which were tested using different experimental techniques such as porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy and petrography. Likewise, characterisation in a macro-scale was carried out to define the mechanical properties of the material (modulus of elasticity, stress-strain curve, ultimate strength and bond). Based on the latter properties, the paper presents a relatively simple method to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity of beams under bending load. The calculation method has been verified by testing beams and full-scale elements. At the end, and due to the viscoelastic nature of the polymer, several considerations will be made in order identify safety factors dependent on the loads nature: permanent loads (deferred deformations) and live loads.

50|$|Her 2013 {{exhibition}} at the Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in New York, called Transparent Things, took its title from a 1972 novel by Vladimir Nabakov and explored themes of temporality and urban spaces. The exhibition combined sculptural pieces, mimicking industrial urban objects and made out of materials like <b>concrete,</b> <b>polyester,</b> and aluminum, with photographs depicting run-down spaces in modern Berlin. Both the structures and the photographs subvert viewers’ visual understanding of the objects and the physical space. Nearly all of the photographs are captured through windows, {{in a manner that}} compresses and distorts depth perception and sense of place, throwing viewers off-balance and creating spatial confusion that is characteristic of Hornig’s work. The artist herself has said that she communicates a sense of abstraction, “placelessness,” and “indistictness” in her work, to encourage critical thought in her viewers.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to characterise and refine the physical properties of glass fibre reinforced <b>polyester</b> polymer <b>concrete.</b> This material is currently being employed by AV Mouldings (Pty) Ltd. to manufacture manhole and drain components according to specifications existing for cast iron covers. No specification exists for polymer concrete. In particular {{it has been found}} that there is a large market for Type 2 A replacement manhole covers and frames due to the current problem in South Africa of the cast iron versions being stolen and sold for scrap metal. It has been found that polymer concrete covers manufactured to replace stolen cast iron covers (in existing cast iron frames) fail occasionally in service. The investigation thus focuses on the characterisation of glass fibre reinforced polymer concrete and analysis of the current standards with a view to establishing a new South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) specification for polymer concrete manhole components. The main testing procedure involved flexural testing of beam specimens. Preliminary tests were carried out to measure strength, toughness, strain rate sensitivity, and the effect of different reinforcing materials. Accelerated degradation tests were then conducted to establish the materials resistance to UV radiation, acids, alkalis, and various solvents. Different resins were evaluated, and experiments were conducted using graded aggregates, in an attempt {{to reduce the number of}} voids in the material. Vibratory moulding techniques and postcuring methods were also evaluated. The viability of employing silane coupling agents in polymer concrete was investigated in detail towards the end of the research. Redesign of the Type 2 A replacement cover was then undertaken...|$|R

40|$|Petroleum based epoxy and {{polyester}} based thermoset resins {{can be used}} {{to produce}} high-quality polymer concrete. However, petroleum based resources are finite and this has necessitated the development of thermoset bioresins to be used as polymer concrete. Furfuryl alcohol (FA), a thermoset bioresin, is derived from lignocellulosic biomass and it can be polymerized into polyfurfuryl alcohol (PFA) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The highly exothermic polymerization reactions involving conversion of FA to PFA {{can be used to}} fabricate PFA based concrete with rock-like structure. The PFA based polymer concrete offers the broadest range of chemical resistance against acid and alkali over all other types of polymer concrete which are based upon different thermoset polymeric systems.

40|$|Since the {{earliest}} times, wrought iron cramps and dowels {{were used in}} the traditional masonry structures to secure stones which might be prone to movement or displacement. In the period between the late 19 th century and the early 20 th century, masonry-clad buildings are exploded to use. However, due to the porous nature of the mortar and the inconsistent fill around the steel members, the protective oxide film is lost over time, resulting in corrosion of the steel framing and other embedded metals. The metals which are used for historical construction are cast iron, steel and wrought iron. The causes of metal deterioration are corrosion, mechanical breakdown, weathering and connection failure. The traditional restorations are repair, replacement and jointing method. And new, a new method, cathodic protection, is also applied on historical building restoration. New materials began to be used for replacing the original materials, The most common have been aluminum, epoxies, reinforced <b>polyester,</b> glass fiber-reinforced <b>concrete</b> and titanium. The first cathodic protection system for stone clad steel framing was installed in 1991. Cathodic protection (CP) prevents corrosion by converting all of the anodic sites on the metal surface to cathodic sites by supplying electrical current from an alternate source. Different from the traditional way, CP method does not to remove the masonry and install new masonry back. According to Roberto Pane, the extreme variety of cases and the need for safeguarding a large amount of monuments shows that restoration can not be constrained within stiff limits. As a conclusion of this studying, due to the former experience, the Barcelona Cathedral’s façade can be considered to use the CP method for restoration blend with the old with regard to size, scale and appearance...|$|R
