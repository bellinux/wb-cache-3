5|$|The myth {{influenced}} popular {{religion as}} well. One {{example is the}} magical healing spells based on Horus's childhood. Another {{is the use of}} the Eye of Horus as a protective emblem in personal apotropaic amulets. Its mythological restoration made it appropriate for this <b>purpose,</b> <b>as</b> a general symbol of well-being.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little <b>purpose,</b> <b>as</b> the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools entered {{development}} in August 2005 under the code name White Engine. It {{was intended for}} the then PlayStation 3-exclusive role-playing game Final Fantasy XIII. The decision to expand Crystal Tools' compatibility to other game projects and systems marked the official project start for a company-wide engine. Development {{was carried out by}} the Research and Development Division headed by Taku Murata, which was specifically established for this <b>purpose.</b> <b>As</b> Square Enix's biggest project to date, the creation of Crystal Tools caused substantial problems in the simultaneous production of several flagship titles; various critics cited the engine as the primary cause of significant delays in the release of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E

5|$|For {{those with}} {{recurrent}} infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs {{is associated with}} the lowest antibiotic use. A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective. Medications frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Methenamine is another agent used for this <b>purpose</b> <b>as</b> in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop. Some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns of antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|McQuaid Hall– Built around 1900, it {{was named}} for Bishop Bernard J. McQuaid, Seton Hall’s first President from 1856–1857 and 1859–1867. McQuaid Hall was both a {{boarding}} house for students and a convent for nuns before serving its present <b>purpose</b> <b>as</b> {{the home of the}} School of Diplomacy and International Relations as well as the Seton Hall University School of Health and Medical Sciences.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 1891, the {{lighthouse}} {{ceased to be}} used for its original <b>purpose,</b> <b>as</b> a new lighthouse was built nearer sea level on the same southern point. The Old Point Loma Lighthouse is now partially open to the public and has been refurbished to its historic 1880s interior. It is located within the Cabrillo National Monument, named after Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, the first European explorer to see San Diego Bay. The lighthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|Some {{invertebrates}} have lung-like {{structures that}} serve a similar respiratory <b>purpose</b> <b>as,</b> {{but are not}} evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs. Some arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange. Some species of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two pairs. Scorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book lungs.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades {{also led}} to the {{introduction}} of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed the same <b>purpose</b> <b>as</b> the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as {{the first half of the}} 8thcentury in Syria.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of occupational debris like ceramic sherds over the bones was {{not unique to}} the site but common in chambered tombs from southern England.

5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{considered}} a product of creolization, combining the African magical perspective of Macandal with the Catholic realism of Henri Christophe. A key aspect {{of the novel is}} that the main character is of interest not because of his skin colour, but rather for his human attributes that allow universal reflection beyond the realm of race. In this sense, magic realism is a necessary tool of expression and the technique serves to confront the novel's hero, better develop his <b>purpose</b> <b>as</b> a man, and advance a simultaneously profound and straightforward understanding of the human experience.|$|E
5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this <b>purpose,</b> <b>as</b> they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), {{and perhaps even}} earlier, the {{drinking}} of tea (Camellia sinensis) became popular in southern China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological <b>purpose</b> <b>as</b> well. During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790–835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise {{on the art of}} drinking tea, called The Classic of Tea. Although wrapping paper had been used in China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves. Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices. The keyboard {{can also be used}} instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the same <b>purpose</b> <b>as</b> clicking. The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the player}} starts {{out with a}} Dungeon Heart and some Imps. The Dungeon Heart has the same <b>purpose</b> <b>as</b> the {{original}} game: it serves as the dungeon's life force. If destroyed, the player loses. In Dungeon Keeper 2, the heart has additional functions: regenerating mana (used to cast spells), doubling as a gold-storage area, producing Imps, and sending certain creatures to investigate threats it detects. Gold is the currency used to construct rooms, traps, and doors, and pay minions. Gold is obtained primarily by digging gold and gem seams, the latter providing an unlimited supply. This is performed by the Imps, the main workforce of the dungeon, who dig and claim tiles for the player to control. Another main task Imps perform is the fortification of walls adjacent to tiles owned by the player, although this no longer makes them impenetrable to enemies, but merely makes digging take longer.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its usual <b>purpose</b> <b>as</b> an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically as a medicinal herb {{for a variety of}} purported health benefits. For example, the Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative, and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments used to help bruises heal. In De Agri Cultura (On Agriculture), Cato the Elder suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten cabbage. The ancient Roman nobleman Pliny the Elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable, recommending it for drunkenness—both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol and to cure hangovers. Similarly, the Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine. This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.|$|E

5|$|Prior to her death, Bellette bequeathed the Hill End cottage to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (which {{manages the}} Hill End {{historic}} site), {{on condition that}} it {{be used as an}} artists' retreat.

A large number of her works are held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales; other galleries that hold examples include the Art Gallery of South Australia, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Bendigo Art Gallery, Geelong Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. In 2004–05, a major retrospective exhibition was held at Bathurst Regional Art Gallery, the S. H. Ervin Gallery in Sydney, the University of Queensland Art Museum, Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery and the Drill Hall Gallery in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Testing of the Disney bombs {{began in}} early 1945. Bombs were {{initially}} dropped on a bombing range near Southampton to photographically record their trajectory and calibrate bombsights. This was necessary as the flight-path of a rocket-accelerated bomb differed considerably {{from that of}} a free–falling bomb. Test drops were then conducted on the Watten bunker, German codename Kraftwerk Nord West (now known as the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques), a large German concrete bunker near Watten in northern France. This was ideal for the <b>purpose</b> <b>as</b> the area had been captured by Allied forces in September 1944, so damage to the structure could be inspected after bomb tests. Four bombs, carried by two B-17s, were used and two hits scored on the target. The resultant damage was considered satisfactory by Royal Navy observers on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The M19 MGMC {{served in}} Europe in World War II with the U.S. Army. By {{the time the}} M19 arrived, the Luftwaffe had been driven from the skies by Allied air power, so the M19 found use as an assault gun, which was a role it {{performed}} very well. It was never delivered to other countries for Lend-Lease or the Military Aid Program (though a few examples were transferred to the newly established JGSDF in 1954). It also served in the Korean War, for the same <b>purpose</b> <b>as</b> it was used in World War II. It {{was used in the}} defense against the North Korean forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting and later fighting in Korea. The 40mm guns were especially effective against Chinese mass infantry charges in North Korea.|$|E
