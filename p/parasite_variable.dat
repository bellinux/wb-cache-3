40|$|The event {{communication}} has for objective to give {{another dimension}} to the company or to the brand, by bringing it out of its daily life and by developing relations with its target public, around their centers of interests. It may be by sharing the same passions, by making live feelings to a group, by federating and by creating links; because today we need a more emotional and more real component. Since a few years, the event communication seems to be "revisited" by companies and appears to stand out {{as an alternative to}} media or other more traditional tools. For the upholders of the relationship marketing, this communication delivers “a social message which affects the spectator or the auditor in its inhalation {{to be a part of}} a social, sports or artistic community” (Perlstein and Picket, 1985). Therefore, we are going to expose our researches and would try to answer the following problem: "what is the impact of the event communication on the Moroccan large company, independently of any different <b>parasite</b> <b>variable?</b> ". The objective of our research is to try to make notions understand around the event communication, and especially the evaluation of its added value on the efficiency of the Moroccan large company. To try to answer these questions derived of our problem, our research will concentrate on: a first theoretical part around a set of concepts, a second part will be the object of an empirical study...|$|E

40|$|Background: Trichomoniasis is an {{extremely}} common infection worldwide and is associated with important public health problems, including amplification of HIV transmission. This disease is in forms of symptomatic and asymptomatic in women and may depend on host as well as <b>parasite</b> <b>variables.</b> Thus {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the patients attend-ing gynecology clinic with different symptoms and checked them for Trichomonas vaginalis infection. Methods: The vaginal secretion and urine samples of the patients attending gynecology clinic, Imam Reza Hospital, Amol City, were checked by direct smear and cultured in TYI-S- 33 culture media. Results: Out of 853 samples collected, 8 (0. 9 %) were positive for T. vaginalis and the number of asymptomatic patients for trichomoniasis were 1. 3 times more than infected samples belong to symptomatic ones. Per speculum examination revealed that 75 % of T. vaginalis positive subjects had normal appearance of vagina and cervix. Conclusion: According to the epidemiological aspects, these asymptomatic patients are very important as healthy carriers, and T. vaginalis infections are commonly associated with other STDs and are a marker of high-risk sexual behavior. Thus laboratories could play important role for diagnosis of infection and help the physicians for properly treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Research {{suggested}} that negative affective-laden sounds act as environmental stressors that elicit negative affect (Bradley and Lang, 2000 a). Aims: We tried {{to test for}} the role of an interaction between predisposition to hallucinatory experiences and exposure to negative affective laden sounds for the presence of paranoid ideation. Method: We used an experimental design that followed the vulnerability × stress model. We defined three groups from a sample of students: paranoia group vs. social anxiety group vs. control group. Their psychological characteristics were measured through self-reports of paranoia, anxiety, predisposition to hallucinations and depressive symptoms at Time 1 (before the experiment). Participants had to listen to either negative affective laden sounds (e. g. screaming) or positive affective laden sounds (e. g. sound of ocean waves). Their paranoid ideation and positive vs. negative emotional reactions to sounds were measured through self-reports at Time 2 (after the experiment). Results: Data showed that the paranoia group presented more serious psychological vulnerabilities than the social anxiety group. A MANCOVA also showed that the independent variables ("group" and "experimental sound conditions") had statistically significant main effects on general paranoia ideation at Time 2. Furthermore, there was a significant three-way interaction between group x predisposition to hallucinatory experiences × experimental condition of sounds for the presence of general paranoid ideation at Time 2. Limitations included the small sample size and the effects of <b>parasite</b> <b>variables,</b> e. g. noise. Conclusions: Individuals' predisposition for hallucinatory experiences increases the probability of possessing paranoid ideation. This tendency is a characteristic of paranoid non-clinical individuals. Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia - FCT Portuga...|$|R

Our model accounts for the basic in-host processes: (i) production and depletion of red blood cells (RBC); (ii) immune-modulated parasite growth/ replication, (iii) immune stimulation and clearing of parasite. Besides we introduce multiple <b>parasite</b> strains with <b>variable</b> levels of virulence, and allow random mutations during replication process.

40|$|Malaria parasites vary in virulence, but {{the effects}} of {{mosquito}} transmission on virulence phenotypes have not been systematically analysed. Using six lines of malaria parasite that varied widely in virulence, three {{of which had been}} serially blood-stage passaged many times, we found that mosquito transmission led to a general reduction in malaria virulence. Despite that, the between-line variation in virulence remained. Forcing serially passaged lines through extreme population bottlenecks (< 5 parasites) reduced virulence in only one of two lines. That reduction was to a level intermediate between that of the virulent parental and avirulent ancestral line. Mosquito transmission did not reverse the increased parasite replication rates that had accrued during serial passage, but it did increase rosetting frequencies. Re-setting of asexual stage genes during the sexual stages of the life cycle, coupled with stochastic sampling of <b>parasites</b> with <b>variable</b> virulence during population bottlenecks, could account for the virulence reductions and increased rosetting induced by mosquito transmission...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} Anopheles gambiae {{mosquitoes}} to transmit Plasmodium <b>parasites</b> is highly <b>variable</b> between individuals. However, the genetic {{basis of this}} variability has remained unknown. We combined genome-wide mapping and reciprocal allele-specific RNA interference (rasRNAi) to identify the genomic locus that confers resistance to malaria parasites and demonstrated that polymorphisms in a single gene encoding the antiparasitic thioester-containing protein 1 (TEPl) explain {{a substantial part of}} the variability in parasite killing. The link between TEP 1 alleles and resistance to malaria may offer new tools for controlling malaria transmission. The successful application of rasRNAi in Anopheles suggests that it could also be applied to other organisms where RNAi is feasible to dissect complex phenotypes to the level of individual quantitative trait alleles...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} among gene regulatory mechanisms in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum throughout its asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) remain poorly understood. To investigate {{the level and}} nature of transcriptional activity {{and its role in}} controlling gene expression during the IDC, we performed nuclear run-on on whole-transcriptome samples from time points throughout the IDC and found a peak in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional activity related to both the number of nuclei per <b>parasite</b> and <b>variable</b> transcriptional activity per nucleus over time. These differential total transcriptional activity levels allowed the calculation of the absolute transcriptional activities of individual genes from gene-specific nuclear run-on hybridization data. For half of the genes analyzed, sense-strand transcriptional activity peaked at the same time point as total activity. The antisense strands of several genes were substantially transcribed. Comparison of the transcriptional activity of the sense strand of each gene to its steady-state RNA abundance across the time points assayed revealed both correlations and discrepancies, implying transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, respectively. Our results demonstrate that such comparisons can effectively indicate gene regulatory mechanisms in P. falciparum and suggest that genes with diverse transcriptional activity levels and patterns combine to produce total transcriptional activity levels tied to parasite development during the IDC...|$|R
40|$|Studies in the Baltic Sea have {{identified}} over 30 parasite taxa infecting the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814). In this study, we aimed at comparing parasite assemblages and infection rates (prevalence and intensity) in different populations across the invasive {{range in the}} Baltic Sea (Denmark, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland). Infection rates were 56 - 60 % across all locations except Lithuania (28 %). However, the parasite assemblages in the sampled populations were dissimilar, each location having unique parasites. In addition, many of the parasites were generalists commonly infecting native fish species. Based {{on the results of}} this study and those previously conducted in the Baltic Sea, the round goby has not retained parasites from its area of origin, but instead has been successively colonized by native generalist <b>parasites.</b> Although <b>variable,</b> overall <b>parasite</b> richness is still quite low around the Baltic compared to the native areas (34 vs 71 taxa, respectively). Also, prevalence and mean infection intensities in the Baltic Sea are significantly lower than in the native areas. Therefore, the invasion success of the round goby in the Baltic Sea can at least partly be attributed to enemy release, in this case shedding a significant proportion of their native parasite load...|$|R

Objectives This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of intestinal parasites in HIV-positive patients who referred to Ahvaz health centers, Ahvaz, Iran in 2012. Patients and Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 HIV-positive patients of the Ahvaz health centers who selected by convenient sampling. Patients’ demographics were recorded by a researcher-made questionnaire. Then, their fecal samples were collected and tested by using direct and concentrated formalin-ether and modified acid-fast staining. Data were analyzed by SPSS 19 software using Chi-square and ANOVA (analysis of variance) tests. Results The prevalence of intestinal parasites was 48. 8 %, which shows a high prevalence in HIV-positive patients. There was a significant relationship between prevalence of <b>parasite</b> and <b>variables</b> of job, kind of health centers, history of diarrhea (P = 0. 0001), education (P = 0. 001), and age (P = 0. 005), but there was no relationship with variables of CD 4 + count (P = 0. 293) and dyspepsia (P = 0. 103). Conclusions Given the prevalence of most gastrointestinal parasites, the HIV-positive patients show a weak immune system and higher sensitivity for infection particularly for opportunistic parasites.

We selected sera with high inhibitory activity and carried out partial analytical characterization by anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) to identify the chemical nature of the inhibitory factor(s).

Since, Trichosomoides infections in rat colonies can interfere with research protocols it is important to know rate of infection and pathology of the infection in the animals used in experimental studies. 275 rats were eviscerated and urinary bladders were collected. The numbers of collected nematodes from each of the urinary bladders were counted under a stereomicroscope and identified on the basis of morphological criteria. Tissue sections were collected and processed routinely for histopathological studies. Out of 275 urinary bladder of adult laboratory Wistar rats examined, 156 (56. 72 %) were infected with the nematode, Trichosomoides crassicauda. There was significant difference (P< 0. 05) in infection in female and male rats, with rate of 47. 73 % and 80. 26 %, respectively. The number of nematodes collected from each infected rats ranged from one to fourteen with an average of three nematodes per animal.

The objective {{of this study was to}} analyse the size and epidemiological characteristics of foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Catalonia, a region in the northeast of Spain. Methods In all reported outbreaks of gastroenteritis associated with food consumption, faecal samples of persons affected were analysed for bacteria and viruses and selectively for <b>parasites.</b> Study <b>variables</b> included the setting, the number of people exposed, age, sex, clinical signs and hospital admissions. The study was carried out from October 2004 to October 2005. Results Of the 181 outbreaks reported during the study period, 72 were caused by Salmonella and 30 by norovirus (NoV); the incidence rates were 14. 5 and 9. 9 per 100, 000 person-years, respectively. In 50 % of the NoV outbreaks and 27 % of the bacterial outbreaks (p = 0. 03) the number of persons affected was ≥ 10; 66. 7 % of NoV outbreaks occurred in restaurants; no differences in the attack rates were observed according to the etiology. Hospitalizations were more common (p = 0. 03) in bacterial outbreaks (8. 6 %) than in NoV outbreaks (0. 15 %). Secondary cases accounted for 4 % of cases in NoV outbreaks compared with 0. 3 % of cases in bacterial outbreaks (p Conclusion Norovirus outbreaks were larger but less frequent than bacterial outbreaks, suggesting that underreporting is greater for NoV outbreaks.

40|$|Although Rhipicephalus microplus mainly parasitizes bovines, {{different}} breeds {{can have}} <b>variable</b> <b>parasite</b> burdens, with indian breeds being {{less susceptible to}} tick infestation than european breeds. These ticks use pasture questing to seek out their hosts in the open spaces of their grassland habitats. Using an olfactometer bioassay, where the larva could express questing, the authors aimed to answer whether R. microplus exhibit different behaviors depending on the bovine breed. Sixteen larvae were individually exposed to the odors of five holstein friesian cattle, five nelore cattle, hexane (negative control) and 2 -nitrophenol (positive control). The highest questing responses were observed to 2 -nitrophenol and holstein odors. The lowest response was observed to the solvent and was statistically similar to nelore odors. It is possible to conclude that R. microplus express different questing behaviors depending on the odor of the breed perceived. This behavior can help R. microplus to avoid parasitizing nelore bovines and is biologically advantageous for the tick because {{it is known that}} ticks that feed on this host have impaired developmen...|$|R
40|$|As malaria {{is being}} pushed back on many frontiers and global case numbers are declining, {{accurate}} measurement and prediction of transmission becomes increasingly difficult. Low transmission settings are characterised by {{high levels of}} spatial heterogeneity, which stands {{in stark contrast to}} the widely used assumption of spatially homogeneous transmission used in mathematical transmission models for malaria. In the present study an individual-based mathematical malaria transmission model that incorporates multiple <b>parasite</b> clones, <b>variable</b> human exposure and duration of infection, limited mosquito flight distance and most importantly geographically heterogeneous human and mosquito population densities was used to illustrate the differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous transmission assumptions when aiming to predict surrogate indicators of transmission intensity such as population parasite prevalence or multiplicity of infection (MOI). In traditionally highly malaria endemic regions where most of the population harbours malaria parasites, humans are often infected with multiple parasite clones. However, studies have shown also in areas with low overall parasite prevalence, infection with multiple parasite clones is a common occurrence. Mathematical models assuming homogeneous transmission between humans and mosquitoes cannot explain these observations. Heterogeneity of transmission can arise from many factors including acquired immunity, body size and occupational exposure. In this study, we show that spatial heterogeneity has a profound effect on predictions of MOI and parasite prevalence. We illustrate, that models assuming homogeneous transmission underestimate average MOI in low transmission settings when compared to field data and that spatially heterogeneous models predict stable transmission at much lower overall parasite prevalence. Therefore it is very important that models used to guide malaria surveillance and control strategies in low transmission and elimination settings take into account the spatial features of the specific target area, including human and mosquito vector distribution...|$|R

Potential differences in size and/or egg production between C. parvum individuals according to amphipod host species were also investigated. Results show that C. parvum life strategy was not influenced by host species. In contrast, host size significantly affected C. parvum strategy, size and egg production. Since intra-host interactions between co-infecting parasites also influenced C. parvum strategy, size and fecundity, it is highly likely that within-host resource limitations affect C. parvum life strategy and overall fitness regardless of host species...|$|R

All animals were killed and examined for endoparasites (acanthocephalans, cestodes, coccidia, and nematodes). The present report focuses on 3 endoparasite groups, cestodes, coccidia, and nematodes. Specific analyses address how prevalence changes were related to abiotic factors such as habitat, season, or precipitation, and how prevalence of each parasite species in each host species differed in relation to host age, host sex, host reproductive status, host body mass, host density, parasite-parasite interactions, and host specificity.

Yet by measuring parasite life-history traits at one or few moments during infection, studies have overlooked the impact of <b>variable</b> <b>parasite</b> growth trajectories on disease evolution. Here we show that infection-age-specific estimates of host and parasite fitness components can reveal new insight into the evolution of parasites. We do so by characterizing the within-host dynamics over an entire infection period for five genotypes of the castrating bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa infecting the crustacean Daphnia magna. Our results reveal that genetic variation for parasite-induced gigantism, host castration and parasite spore loads increases with the age of infection. Driving these patterns appears to be variation in how well the parasite maintains control of host reproduction late in the infection process. We discuss the evolutionary consequences of this finding with regard to natural selection acting on different ages of infection and the mechanism underlying the maintenance of castration efficiency. Our results highlight how elucidating within-host dynamics can shed light on the selective forces that shape infection strategies and the evolution of virulence...|$|R

40|$|Parasitic weeds of {{the genus}} Striga cause high yield losses in cereal crops across Africa. Host-plant defence against Striga spp. can be an {{effective}} control strategy. It ideally consists of resistance, to reduce infection, complemented with tolerance, to mitigate the effects of infection. As resistance against Striga spp. can both minimise yield losses and reduce future infestation levels in infested fields, current breeding efforts are mainly directed towards this trait. Because it is nearly impossible to screen for tolerance on highly resistant genetic lines, tolerance is often neglected. Here, we argue reconsidering the role of tolerance, as recent findings regarding the physiological expression of tolerance offer a promising track for identifying the genetic background of tolerance. Identification of quantitative trait loci for tolerance would facilitate the inclusion of this trait in adapted cultivars with high levels of resistance, where its main role would be to function as a safety net in case the genetically highly <b>variable</b> <b>parasite</b> populations overcome host-plant resistance. Because Striga spp. are mainly prevalent in subsistence farming systems, we consider this an important addition and {{it is for this reason}} that we make a plea for a more prominent role of tolerance in present-day integrated management of this weed...|$|R

40|$|Antagonistic {{coevolution}} between {{hosts and}} parasites {{has been proposed}} as a mechanism maintaining genetic diversity in both host and parasite populations. In particular, {{the high level of}} genetic diversity usually observed at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is generally thought to be maintained by parasite-driven selection. Among the possible ways through which parasites can maintain MHC diversity, diversifying selection has received relatively less attention. This hypothesis is {{based on the idea that}} <b>parasites</b> exert spatially <b>variable</b> selection pressures because of heterogeneity in parasite genetic structure, abundance or virulence. Variable selection pressures should select for different host allelic lineages resulting in population-specific associations between MHC alleles and risk of infection. In this study, we took advantage of a large survey of avian malaria in 13 populations of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) to test this hypothesis. We found that (i) several MHC alleles were either associated with increased or decreased risk to be infected with Plasmodium relictum, (ii) the effects were population specific, and (iii) some alleles had antagonistic effects across populations. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that diversifying selection in space can maintain MHC variation and suggest a pattern of local adaptation where MHC alleles are selected at the local host population level...|$|R

Yet, very {{little is known about the}} ecological mechanisms that drive the evolution of female mating preferences. We studied fitness correlates of male nuptial coloration in a member of a diverse Lake Victoria cichlid lineage, Pundamilia nyererei. In this species, male red coloration is subject to intraspecific sexual selection by female mate choice. Male nuptial coloration plays a critical role also in reproductive isolation between this species and the closely related sympatric species P. pundamilia. Here, we show that P. nyererei male coloration is carotenoid based, illustrating the potential for honest signaling of individual quality. In a wild population, we found that variation in male coloration was not associated with variation in a set of strongly intercorrelated indicators of male dominance: male size, territory size, and territory location. Instead, the 2 male characters that predominantly determine female choice, territory size and red coloration, may be independent predictors of male quality: males with bright red coloration and large territories had lower parasite infestation rates. As a result, female preferences tended to select against heavily parasitized males. Consistent with parasite-mediated sexual selection, males had higher and more <b>variable</b> <b>parasite</b> loads than female...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Parasite {{prevalence}} is {{an important}} variable in many evolutionary and ecological studies. In birds, haemosporidian blood parasites have been in focus of many comparative analyses. Because low prevalence is difficult to estimate precisely and that studies finding low prevalence {{are more likely to}} remain unpublished, our knowledge of parasite prevalence is biased towards highly infected taxa. Species with naturally low levels of infection are nonetheless interesting as they may provide models for studying the evolution of pathogen resistance. In the present study we show that the prevalence of Haemoproteus parasites is markedly lower in several taxa within the widely distributed chiffchaff species-complex compared to other species within the genus Phylloscopus. Since chiffchaffs, P. collybita, commonly coexists in the same habitat as congeners frequently infected with Haemoproteus <b>parasites,</b> immediate ecological <b>variables</b> like abundance of vectors can hardly explain this difference. Some of the parasites infecting coexisting congeners are broad host generalists leaving it enigmatic why chiffchaffs are almost free of Haemoproteus infections. We propose that detailed infection experiments are needed to illuminate whether chiffchaffs possess a genetic immunity against Haemoproteus parasites or if other more subtle ecological processes, like anti-vector behaviour, play a role in its generally low level of infestation...|$|R
40|$|Parasites {{represent}} {{a major threat}} to all organisms which has led to the evolution of an array of complex and effective defence mechanisms. Common to both vertebrates and invertebrates are innate immune mechanisms that can be either constitutively expressed or induced on exposure to infection. In nature, we find that a combination of both induced and constitutive responses are employed by vertebrates, invertebrates and, to an extent, plants when they are exposed to a parasite. Here we use a simple within-host model motivated by the insect immune system, consisting of both constitutive and induced responses, to address the question of why both types of response are maintained so ubiquitously. Generally, induced responses are thought to be advantageous because they are only used when required but are too costly to maintain constantly, while constitutive responses are advantageous because they are always ready to act. However, using a simple cost function but with no a priori assumptions about relative costs, we show that variability in parasite growth rates selects for a strategy that combines both constitutive and induced defences. Differential costs are therefore not necessary to explain the adoption of both forms of defence. Clearly, hosts are likely to be challenged by <b>variable</b> <b>parasites</b> in nature and this is sufficient to explain why it is optimal to deploy both arms of the innate immune system...|$|R

These tapeworms infect ruminant and humans as intermediate hosts and domestic/wild carnivores as the definitive hosts. Molecular tools using hypervariable microsatellite regions might provide more information about <b>parasite</b> variation. Highly <b>variable</b> and specific tools are needed for transmission tracking studies of canine echinococcosis as an essential element for implementation of hydatid control programs.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the microsatellite variability of EmsB as well as six other microsatellites in major taeniid species infecting dogs in Iran. Methods: Twenty isolates of each of the four Taeniidae tapeworms were collected from sheep during routine veterinary inspection in Tehran, Alborz and Kerman provinces from October 2010 to May 2011. After DNA extraction, PCR was set up with optimum conditions using specific primers for each individual microsatellite marker. All the PCR products were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. We used SDS-PAGE for evaluating patterns of PCR products in the tapeworms. Results: E. granulosus as well as Taenia species could be differentiated based on EmsB microsatellite patterns. The electrophoresis patterns of two taeniid genera were readily distinguishable. EmsB could be specifically used in epidemiological studies of canine echinococcosis.

Anti-Leishmania-specific IgG 1 antibodies (anti-NH 36) increased in untreated animals. IgG 2 a response, high levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and lower levels of IL- 10 were detected in mice treated with the immucillins and Glucantime. Immucillins permitted normal weight gain, prevented hepato-splenomegaly and cleared the parasite infection (85 – 89 %) without renal and hepatic toxicity. Immucillins promoted 35 % lower secretion of IFN-γ in uninfected controls than in infected mice. IA and IH increased the CD 4 + T and CD 19 + B cell frequencies. SMIH increased only the proportion of CD- 19 B cells. IA and IH also cured infected hamsters with lower toxicity than Glucantime...|$|R
40|$|Trypanosomes are {{blood-borne}} parasites {{that can}} cause severe disease in both humans and animals, resulting in very large economic losses worldwide. In contrast to the wealth of information on pathogenic species such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei, little is known of the pathogenicity, prevalence and life-cycles of trypanosomes in native Australian mammals. The aim of this thesis was to characterise trypanosomes and other protozoans from the critically endangered Gilbert’s potoroo (Potorous gilbertii) and the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) from Western Australia using morphological and molecular analysis. A novel Trypanosoma species, Trypanosoma copemani was identified in Gilbert’s potoroos and quokkas using molecular and morphological analysis. Further molecular characterisation of T. copemani in quokkas at both the 18 S rRNA and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) loci identified multiple T. copemani genotypes revealing that the <b>parasite</b> is genetically <b>variable.</b> Given the phylogenetic grouping of T. copemani as a stercorarian (requiring faecal transmission by vector), the fact that ticks are common ectoparasites of Gilbert’s potoroos and quokkas and the previous identification of trypanosomes in ticks, ticks were examined as potential vectors of T. copemani. Motile trypanosomes were detected in both the haemolymph and midgut sections of Ixodes australiensis ticks removed from quokkas and Gilbert’s potoroos and stained trypanosomes were detected within a faecal smear. Morphologically, the tick trypanosomes resembled in vitro forms of T. copemani, representing epimastigotes and slender trypomastigote stages, with dividing stages detected within the midgut region. Molecular analysis of the tick isolates, showed 100...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review of 50 titles including nearly all relevant publications ensures adequate basis {{on the present}} level of knowledge. The proposal includes (a) {{the determination of the}} biozoenosis and selected environmental factors, and (b) of fishery and stock data of the main fish and shellfish species. The ecological research studies physical and chemical variables of the estuarine waters (flow velocity and direction, water temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, nutrients such as ammonium, nitrite, phosphate, silicate, pollutants such as hybrocarbons, pesticides and heavy metals, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand), plankton (bacterio-phyto-and zooplankton), benthos, sediment. The fishery biological and fishery investigations include: number of villages and fishermen, number of boats and gears by type, length and weight data of the main fishery objects with concentration on the shrimps, species and numbers of fish <b>parasites.</b> The ecological <b>variables</b> were monitored at fixed stations on sections in the Cross-River Estuary, Calabar and Great Kwara Rivers two times per month during spring and neap tides. The fishery biological and fishery variables were obtained during spring and neap tide too. For the determination of the detailed methodology the ecological and fishery part of the progeamme should be started with frame surveys based on a larger number of stations. These frame surveys should be repeated from time to time. Both parts of the programme are based on three years duration. It seems already appropriate to continue the work with selected representative stations, villages and variables in form of a long-term data chai...|$|R
40|$|Competition between {{parasite}} genotypes in genetically diverse infections is widespread. However, {{experimental evidence}} on how genetic diversity influences total <b>parasite</b> load is <b>variable.</b> Here we use an additive partition equation {{to quantify the}} negative effect of inter-genotypic competition on total parasite load in diverse infections. Our approach controls for extreme-genotype effects, a process that can potentially neutralise, or even reverse, the negative effect of competition on total parasite load. A single extreme-genotype can have a disproportionate effect on total parasite load if it causes the highest parasite load in its single-infection, while increasing its performance in diverse relative to single infections. We show that in theory such disproportionate effects of extreme-genotypes {{can lead to a}} higher total parasite load in diverse infections than expected, even if competition reduces individual parasite performance on average. Controlling for the extreme-genotype effect is only possible if the competition effect on total parasite load is measured appropriately as the average difference between the realised number of each parasite genotype in mixed infections and the expected number based on single infection parasite loads. We apply this approach to sticklebacks that were experimentally infected with different trematode genotypes. On average, genetically diverse infections had lower parasite loads than expected from single-infection results. For the first time we demonstrate that competition between co-infecting genotypes per se caused the parasite load reduction, while extreme-genotype effects were not significant. We thus suggest that to correctly quantify the effect of competition alone on total parasite load in genetically diverse infections, the extreme-genotype effect has to be controlled for...|$|R
40|$|Helminth parasites {{have the}} {{potential}} to significantly affect the dynamics of their hosts. As a consequence, they can dramatically threaten the persistence of endangered species, such as rock partridge (Alectoris graeca saxatilis) in the Province of Trento (northern Italy). The aim of this work was to understand the effect of helminth parasites on rock partridge fitness, informing on their potential effects on host population dynamics. In particular, we investigated the hypothesis that infections from Ascaridia compar induce the rock partridge population cycles observed in Trentino. In order to support this hypothesis, we compared the predictions obtained from a host-parasite interaction model including <b>variable</b> <b>parasite</b> aggregation with multi-annual empirical data of A. compar infection in natural host populations. We estimated host demographic parameters from rock partridge census data in Trentino, and the parasitological parameters from a series of experimental infections in a rock partridge captive population. The host-parasite model predicts higher A. compar abundance in rock partridge populations exhibiting cyclic dynamics compared to non cyclic ones. In addition, for cyclic host populations, the model predicts an increase in mean parasite burden with the length of cycle period. Model predictions are well-supported by field data: significant differences in parasite infection between cyclic and non cyclic populations and among cyclic populations with different oscillation periods were observed. On the basis of these results, we conclude that helminth parasites {{can not be ruled out}} as drivers of rock partridge population dynamics in Trentino and must be considered when planning conservation strategies of this threatened species...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of seasonal variation in parasites infracommunities of Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus and Hoplias malabaricus from a tributary of Amazon River. For H. unitaeniatus and H. malabaricus, 11 parasite species were similar, and greatest parasite richness occurred during the rainy season. Ichthyophthirius multifiliis was the dominant parasite species for both hosts. In H. unitaeniatus, infection by Whittingtonocotyle caetei, Whittingtonocotyle jeju, Urocleidoides sp. and Anacanthorus sp. was higher during rainy season. Contracaecum sp., Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus, Nomimoscolex matogrossensis and Gorytocephalus spectabilis showed no seasonal pattern. For H. unitaeniatus, P. pillulare, Clinostomum marginatum and Argulus pestifer occurred only during dry season, while Trichodina sp., Dolops geayi, undetermined metacercariae and Posthodiplostomum sp. occurred only during the rainy season. In H. malabaricus, the prevalence of Urocleidoides eremitus was similar during the two seasons, but abundance was higher during the rainy season. Tetrahymena sp., C. marginatum, Dendrorchis neivai, undetermined metacercariae, Posthodiplostomum sp., Genarchella genarchella, Cystidicoloides sp., G. spectabilis, D. geayi, A. pestifer and Glossiphonidae gen. sp. occurred only during the dry season. However, Contracaecum sp. and P. (S.) inopinatus occurred during both seasons, but the prevalence of P. (S.) inopinatus was higher during the rainy season. Seasonal variation in this infection levels {{was due to the}} host?s feeding behavior and habits and the availability of infectious forms of parasites with heteroxenic life cycles. The non-seasonal fluctuation detected are likely a result of the <b>parasites</b> biology, highly <b>variable</b> nature of this tributary of Amazon River and low abundance of parasites. 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the occurrence of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) protozoa and associated risk factors in free range pigs in Busia District, Kenya. A total of 306 pigs from 135 farms in 6 Divisions were sampled for feces, which were analysed for parasites using direct smear and McMaster floatation methods. Associations between the occurrence of the <b>parasites</b> and explanatory <b>variables</b> (sex, age, division of origin and rainfall) were undertaken using ANOVA, chi-square and Pearson’s correlation statistics. The following gastrointestinal protozoan parasites were identified: Entamoeba spp. (87 %), Balantidium coli (64 %), Tritrichomonas suis (42 %) and Coccidia spp (33 %). The mean coccidial oocysts per gram (OPG) of all the sampled pigs was 1, 276 (range = 0 - 28, 000 OPG) and the proportions of the species included: Eimeria debliecki (40 %), E. suis (26 %), E. porci (16 %), E. scabra (13 %) and E. polita (5 %). There was negative correlation {{between the amount of}} rainfall in the division of pig origin and prevalence of Eimeria spp, Tt. suis, and Entamoeba spp, but a positive correlation with prevalence of B. coli. The prevalences of Eimeria spp., Entamoeba spp. and Tt. suis were higher in males than females; but it was only the sex-differences for Tt. suis which were statistically significant (p < 0. 05). The prevalences of Tt. suis in sows were significantly (p < 0. 05) lower than that of growers and piglets. It was concluded that GIT protozoan parasites of economic and zoonotic significance occur in pigs in the study area and effective control strategies should be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Immucillins ImmA (IA), ImmH (IH) and SerMe-ImmH (SMIH) are {{synthetic}} deazapurine nucleoside analogues that inhibit Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi and Leishmania (L.) amazonensis multiplication {{in vitro}} without macrophage toxicity. Immucillins are {{compared to the}} Glucantime standard drug in the chemotherapy of Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi infection in mice and hamsters. These agents are tested for toxicity and immune system response. BALB/c mice were infected with 107 amastigotes, treated with IA, IH, SMIH or Glucantime (2. 5 mg/kg/day) and monitored for clinical <b>variables,</b> <b>parasite</b> load, antibody levels and splenocyte IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL- 10 expression. Cytokines and CD 4 +, CD 8 + and CD 19 + lymphocyte frequencies were assessed in uninfected controls {{and in response to}} immucillins. Urea, creatinine, GOT and GPT levels were monitored in sera. Anti-Leishmania-specific IgG 1 antibodies (anti-NH 36) increased in untreated animals. IgG 2 a response, high levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and lower levels of IL- 10 were detected in mice treated with the immucillins and Glucantime. Immucillins permitted normal weight gain, prevented hepato-splenomegaly and cleared the parasite infection (85 - 89 %) without renal and hepatic toxicity. Immucillins promoted 35 % lower secretion of IFN-γ in uninfected controls than in infected mice. IA and IH increased the CD 4 + T and CD 19 + B cell frequencies. SMIH increased only the proportion of CD- 19 B cells. IA and IH also cured infected hamsters with lower toxicity than Glucantime. Immucillins IA, IH and SMIH were effective in treating leishmaniasis in mice. In hamsters, IA and IH were also effective. The highest therapeutic efficacy was obtained with IA, possibly due to its induction of a TH 1 immune response. Low immucillin doses were required and showed no toxicity. Our results disclose the potential use of IA and IH in the therapy of visceral leishmaniasis...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{different}} ecological and evolutionary processes influence {{the distribution of}} pathogens within the environment is important from many perspectives including wildlife epidemiology, evolutionary ecology and conservation. The simultaneous use of ecological and evolutionary frameworks can enhance our conceptual understanding of host-parasite interactions, however such studies are rare in the wild. Using samples from 12 bird species caught across all habitats existing on an oceanic island, we evaluated how environmental <b>variables,</b> <b>parasite</b> host specificity and parasite phylogenetic relationships determine the distribution and prevalence of haemosporidians (Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon) in the wild living avifauna. Differences {{were found in the}} prevalence of Plasmodium, but not Leucocytozoon, strains between habitats. The warmest temperature best predicted Plasmodium prevalence in the low altitude habitats, which had the highest incidence of Plasmodium. The prevalence of Leucocytozoon lineages was associated with natural factors, i. e. rainfall, temperature and habitat, but the two most important predictors (from model averaging) for models of Leucocytozoon were anthropogenic: poultry farms and distance to a water reservoir. We found no relationship between local (Tenerife, Canary Islands) versus global host range indices (which assess the diversity of hosts that a parasite is observed to infect), thus global generalist lineages do not behave in the same way on Tenerife (i. e. they infected less avian hosts than was expected). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the most abundant haemosporidians on Tenerife grouped with lineages found in African host species. Our data indicate that climatic and anthropogenic factors, plus proximity to the African mainland, are the main factors influencing the presence and distribution of avian haemosporidians on Tenerife. Future climate projections for the archipelago foresee significant temperature increases which would, given our results, increase rates of Plasmodium infection in bird species in all habitats. Such patterns could be of concern if those increase mortality rates in the unique avifauna of these islands...|$|R
