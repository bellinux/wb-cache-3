40|$|An overall {{platelet}} function test in whole blood, which simulates conditions under arterial pressure, {{is useful in}} measuring the effect of polymer materials on blood hemostatic function. We performed biocompatibility tests with materials or <b>plasma</b> <b>substitutes</b> by interaction of blood from healthy volunteers and then subjected these blood samples to {{platelet function}} analysis (Thrombostat). We tested also the capacity of locally applied hemostatic agents for bleeding control by direct application of these agents onto the Thrombostat measuring cell. The biocompatibility tests with materials exposed to blood appeared very discriminating between compatible and noncompatible materials. The hemostatic capacity of blood exposed to noncompatible materials (assessed by binding of active thrombin) reduced markedly after one hour incubation of the material. The <b>plasma</b> <b>substitutes</b> did not affect hemostasis significantly. However, a blood dilution of 40 %, as in cardiopulmonary bypass, increased the time required for closure of the measuring cell by a platelet plug exponentially. Local hemostatic agents could be selected according to their capacity to enhance platelet plug formation. In addition, ADP mixed with the hemostatic agent was most effective in improving capacity. We conclude that platelet function analysis contributes importantly to screening of materials and <b>plasma</b> <b>substitutes</b> {{with regard to their}} interaction with primary hemostasis...|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} any <b>plasma</b> <b>substitute</b> {{the problem}} of finding a high molecular weight compound which can temporarily {{take the place of}} the plasma proteins is the major one, since the electrolyte com-position involves no fundamental difficulties. The function of this high molecular weight compound is to exert an osmotic pressure across the blood capillary walls and, hence, assist in controlling the fluid balance in patients in whom there has been a loss of plasma protein. Provided any given poly-mer is pharmacologically inert and shows no toxicity either immediate, due to allergic reactions, or long-term, due to permanent storage of the foreign body in the tissue, its value in a <b>plasma</b> <b>substitute</b> will depend largely upon the persistence of the osmotic pressure which it exerts across the capillary wall. This will depend upon the rate of elimination of the polymer from the body and the rate at which it passes through the capillary walls into the tissue fluid. The elimination mechanisms will, in general, involve excretion of unchanged polymer by the kidney or by other means, and its degradation to smaller molecules. The passage of polymer molecules through both the kidney and the capillarv wall will depend upon the shape, structure, charge, and molecular weight of the molecules present. The importance of molecular weight in selecting a polymer for use in a <b>plasma</b> <b>substitute</b> has recently been emphasized by Boyd, Fletcher, and Ratcliffe (1953), but not enough attention appears to be given to the effect that the shape and structure of a molecule can have on its passage through a membrane. Consequently, the molecular weight most suitable for use in a <b>plasma</b> <b>substitute</b> will vary with the type of polymer. The molecular weight distribution of a polymer does not necessarily remain constant after its infusion into the body, since it is unlikely that all the eliminatio...|$|R

40|$|Ten {{per cent}} low {{molecular}} weight hydroxyethyl starch is a <b>plasma</b> <b>substitute</b> only recently used as priming solution in an extracorporeal circuit, in contrast to human albumin and gelatin. To evaluate the effect of priming solutions on haemodynamics and colloid osmotic pressure, we studied 36 patients elected for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). They {{were randomly assigned to}} 2. 5 % hydroxyethyl starch, 3 % gelatin or 4 % human albumin priming solution. Total blood loss (perioperative + intensive care unit period) was higher in the gelatin group than in the albumin and hydroxyethyl starch groups. During CPB, the colloid osmotic pressure was best preserved in the gelatin group, although no excessively low colloid osmotic pressures were measured in the other two groups. Due to the extended half-life and the additional postoperative colloid administration, the hydroxyethyl starch group had a higher colloid osmotic pressure in the postoperative phase.

The CKGM solution had a high volume-expanding efficacy and was evaluated as a <b>plasma</b> <b>substitute</b> in the present study. Ameliorative hemorrhagic shock rabbits were used as the model animals. The in vivo hemodynamic and hemorheologic properties, including blood pressure, blood viscosity, hematocrit, erythrocyte deformation index and erythrocyte aggregation index, were measured in animals treated in the CKGM solution. The in vitro colloid osmotic pressure (COP) of the CKGM solution was measured to estimate its plasma-expanding efficacy. These parameters of the CKGM-treated group were compared with groups exposed to four other treatments: human serum albumin (HSA), hydroxyethyl starch (HES), polygeline and normal saline. The CKGM solution showed an exceptionally higher COP than other therapy solutions. For example, the COP of 1 % (weight in volume [w/v]) CKGM solution is comparable to those of 6 % (w/v) HES solution and 5 % (w/v) HSA solution. Accordingly, the CKGM solution can be transfused in a much lower dosage while maintaining its plasma-expanding efficacy. The CKGM-treated group showed an improved intravascular persistence and good hemodynamic and hemorheological properties. Biopsy analysis suggested no organ dysfunction in the group treated in CKGM solution. Moreover, the high plasma-expanding efficacy and inexpensive availability of the CKGM solution may facilitate its clinical application as a potential <b>plasma</b> <b>substitute...</b>|$|R

30|$|Resuscitation fluids {{are given}} to correct an {{intravascular}} volume deficit {{in the case of}} absolute or relative hypovolemia. In theory, the choice between colloids and crystalloids should take into account the revised Starling equation and the glycocalyx model of transvascular fluid exchange [17]. When capillary pressure (or transendothelial pressure difference) is low, as in hypovolemia or sepsis and especially septic shock, or during hypotension (after induction and anaesthesia), albumin or <b>plasma</b> <b>substitutes</b> have no advantage over crystalloid infusions, since they all remain intravascular. However, the glycocalyx layer is a fragile structure and is disrupted by surgical trauma-induced systemic inflammation or sepsis, but also by rapid infusion of fluids (especially saline). Under these circumstances, transcapillary flow (albumin leakage and risk of tissue oedema) is increased, as is the risk to evolve to a state of global increased permeability syndrome (GIPS) [17].|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of a gelatin-based plasma expander on blood coagulation and haemostasis in human subjects. Six healthy men were studied in a randomised, controlled cross-over study to investigate the effects of a 60 min intravenous infusion of either 1 l gelatin-based <b>plasma</b> <b>substitute</b> (Gelofusine) or 0. 9 % NaCl (control). The infusion of gelatin resulted in a 1. 7 fold increase in bleeding time at 60 min and a 1. 4 fold increase at 120 min, while saline had no effect (p < 0. 05). Aggregation studies revealed a significant impairment of ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (p < 0. 05), associated with a substantial decrease of vWF:ag (- 32 % vs. - 5 %, p < 0. 05) and ristocetin co-factor (- 29 % vs. + 1 %, p < 0. 05) and without in vitro impairment of the platelet glycoprotein 1 b receptor. Gelatin caused a decrease in thrombin-antithrombin complexes (- 45 % vs. - 4 %, p < 0. 05) and F 1 + 2 (- 40 % vs. + 1 %, p < 0. 05). The decrease in circulating levels of vWF:ag, vWF R:Co, thrombin-antithrombin complexes and F 1 + 2 was more than could be expected by the calculated plasma-dilution generated by Gelofusine. Our results demonstrated that the administration of a gelatin-based <b>plasma</b> <b>substitute</b> results in a significant impairment of primary haemostasis and thrombin generation.

On the other hand, when anaphylactoid reactions occurred following propanidid injection histamine release was so massive as to explain the severe clinical signs and symptoms observed. In this study no reactions occurred following thiopentone injection.

Polyvinyl alcohol produces similar changes but is not stored. Starch and dextrin are very rapidly hydrolyzed in the blood stream and exert little water retaining effect. Isinglass was found to be the most suitable since, though it remained in the blood stream a shorter time than gum acacia, it did not produce pathological changes in the blood or tissues, and was excreted 100 % without kidney damage.

However, a paucity of well-designed clinical trials, a lack of a clear cut survival benefit, and frequent case reports of adverse drug reaction (ADR) make the use of HSA controversial. This study aims to review and {{to comment on the}} reported ADRs of HSA in People&# 39;s Republic of China, so as to provide the basis for rational HSA use in clinical settings. Data on the ADR case reports from HSA administration between January 1990 and December 2012 available from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Wanfang data (WF), and Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) were reviewed. The reasons for using HSA, the types of ADRs, the causality of ADRs and the rationality for HSA administration were extracted and analyzed. In total, 61 cases of ADR reports were identified of which the primary disease of patients using HSA was malignant tumor (34. 42 %). The primary ADR was anaphylaxis (59. 02 %). Of the 61 cases, 30 were caused by irrational use of HSA. The most common irrational use was off-label use (56. 67 %), followed by inappropriate infusion rate. Therefore, we conclude that to avoid the occurrence of ADRs, guidelines for using HSA are needed to guarantee its rational use and HSA should be used strictly according to these guidelines.

30|$|Pullulan is {{a linear}} {{water-soluble}} polysaccharide mainly consisting of maltotriose units connected by α- 1, 6 glycosidic units. Pullulan was first reported by Bauer (1938) and is {{obtained from the}} fermentation broth of Aureobasidium pullulans. Pullulan is produced by a simple fermentation process using a number of feedstocks containing simple sugars (Bernier 1958; Catley 1971; Sena et al. 2006). Pullulan can be chemically modified to produce a polymer that is either less soluble or completely insoluble in water. The unique properties of this polysaccharide are due to its characteristic glycosidic linking. Pullulan is easily chemically modified to reduce the water solubility or to develop pH sensitivity, by introducing functional reactive groups, etc. Due to its high water solubility and low viscosity, pullulan has numerous commercial applications including use as a food additive, a flocculant, a blood <b>plasma</b> <b>substitute,</b> an adhesive, and a film (Zajic and LeDuy 1973; Singh et al. 2008; Cheng et al. 2011).
