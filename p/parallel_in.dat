5|$|Between 1991 and 1995, the 102d {{deployed}} to Panama {{as part of}} Operation Coronet Nighthawk, which was a drug interdiction operation.

In 1998, the wing's members also trained and {{deployed to}} Iceland, Canada, Korea, and Europe. The next year, the 102d participated in Operation Northern Watch and was deployed to Turkey in order to enforce the no-fly zone over Iraq north of the 36th <b>Parallel.</b> <b>In</b> 2000, personnel were deployed to the Middle East and Europe in order to participate in Operation Southern Watch.|$|E

In 1961, the wing deployed to France during the Berlin Crisis. Twenty eight years later, the wing deployed to Panama during Operation Coronet Nighthawk. It also participated in Operation Northern Watch, helping to patrol the No-Fly Zone north of the 36th <b>parallel</b> <b>in</b> Iraq. During the 11 September attacks, the 102d Fighter Wing deployed the first Air Force aircraft toward New York City, but they arrived too late to stop the attacks.|$|E
5|$|During the war, 10 {{soldiers}} of the division were awarded the Medal of Honor. They were William F. Dean, George D. Libby, Melvin O. Handrich, Mitchell Red Cloud, Jr., Carl H. Dodd, Nelson V.

The 24th Infantry Division suffered 3,735 killed and 7,395 wounded during the Korean War. It remained on front-line duty after the armistice until October 1957, patrolling the 38th <b>parallel</b> <b>in</b> the event that combat would resume.

5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword.

The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E

5|$|The {{war began}} with the Libyan {{occupation}} of northern Chad in 1983, when Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi, refusing to recognize {{the legitimacy of the}} Chadian President Hissène Habré, militarily supported the attempt by the opposition Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) to overthrow Habré. The plan was foiled by the intervention of France which, first with Operation Manta and later with Operation Epervier, limited Libyan expansion to north of the 16th <b>parallel,</b> <b>in</b> the most arid and sparsely inhabited part of Chad.|$|E
5|$|After Zhou and Lin {{negotiated}} Stalin's approval, Peng {{attended a}} conference in Beijing with Mao, Zhou, and Gao Gang on October 18, and they ordered {{the first wave of}} Chinese soldiers—in total more than 260,000 men—to cross into Korea on the night of October 19. On October 25 the PVA had its first confrontation with UN troops at Onjong and Unsan, and pushed the UN forces south of the Chongchon River by November 4 in the aftermath of First Phase Campaign. From November 24 to December 24, Peng directed 380,000 PVA troops to confront UN forces in the Second Phase Campaign, and he successfully recovered the area north of the thirty-eighth parallel. Despite his personal reservations, Peng then began an ambitious campaign to take the area south of the 38th <b>parallel</b> <b>in</b> order to fulfill Mao's political objectives for the war. About 230,000 Chinese soldiers crossed into South Korean territory on December 31 and captured Seoul as part of the Third Phase Campaign, but were forced to evacuate it with heavy losses on March 14, 1951 as the UN forces counterattacked during the course of Fourth Phase Campaign. Peng launched a final Fifth Phase Campaign from April 22 – June 10 to retake Seoul with 548,000 Chinese troops, but it failed, and the Korean War came to a standstill just above the 38th <b>parallel.</b> <b>In</b> the evaluation of Korean War historian Roy Edger Appleman, Peng's performances in the war were unremarkable in terms of military talents despite his aggressiveness and leadership skills. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards claimed that Peng's successful campaigns, from October–December 1950, were fought under Mao's direction, but that his unsuccessful campaigns, from January–May 1951, were organized by Peng against Mao's instructions. Modern scholars reject this interpretation, and credit Peng with both the successes and failures of the war.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Greek and Roman writers, who {{described}} Egyptian religion late in its history, recorded {{much of the}} Osiris myth. Herodotus, in the 5th century BCE, mentioned parts of the myth in his description of Egypt in The Histories, and four centuries later, Diodorus Siculus provided {{a summary of the}} myth in his Bibliotheca historica. In the early 2nd century AD, Plutarch wrote the most complete ancient account of the myth in De Iside et Osiride, an analysis of Egyptian religious beliefs. Plutarch's account of the myth is the version that modern popular writings most frequently retell. The writings of these classical authors may give a distorted view of Egyptian beliefs. For instance, De Iside et Osiride includes many interpretations of Egyptian belief that are influenced by various Greek philosophies, and its account of the myth contains portions with no known <b>parallel</b> <b>in</b> Egyptian tradition. Griffiths concluded that several elements of this account were taken from Greek mythology, and that the work as a whole was not based directly on Egyptian sources. His colleague John Baines, on the other hand, says that temples may have kept written accounts of myths, which later were lost, and that Plutarch could have drawn on such sources to write his narrative.|$|E
