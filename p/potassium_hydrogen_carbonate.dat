Two distinct synthetic routes were explored. The first method {{is based on}} the free-radical polymerization (FRP) of 1 -vinyl- 3 -alkylimidazolium monomers featuring a hydrogen carbonate counter anion (HCO 3 -), denoted as VRImHCO(3). The latter monomers were readily synthesized by alkylation of 1 -vinylimidazole (VIm), followed by direct anion exchange of 1 -vinyl- 3 -alkylimidazolium bromide monomers (VRImBr), using <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonate</b> (KHCO 3) in methanol at room temperature.

They could serve as polymer-supported precatalysts to generate polymer-supported N-heterocyclic carbenes, referred to as poly(NHC) s, formally by a loss of H 2 CO 3 (H 2 O +CO 2) in solution. This was demonstrated through selected organocatalyzed reactions of molecular chemistry, known as being efficiently mediated by molecular NHC catalysts, including benzoin condensation, transesterification and cyanosilylation of aldehyde.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{swelling}} of n-butylammonium vermiculite in water was investigated {{as a function}} of the sol concentration (r), the salt concentration (c) and the temperature (T). The interlayer spacing in the gel phase was investigated {{as a function of}} r and c by neutron diffraction and by laboratory experiments which measured how many times its own volume a crystal would absorb. The salt concentration was found to be the stronger variable with the interlayer spacing decreasing proportional to c ~ which is consistent with previous results and with the Coulombic attraction theory. The sol concentration was found to affect he swelling for two reasons, the salt fractionation effect and the trapped salt effect. Both of these cause the salt concentration i the supernatant fluid to be greater than that originally added to the crystals and so reduce the swelling.

Protons {{are found in}} small planar centrosymmetric dimer entities, (HCO− 3) 2, linked by moderately strong hydrogen bonds and well separated by the stacking of potassium atoms. There is no disordering at low temperature and rods of diffuse scattering in (a∗, c∗) planes, not observed for KDCO 3, reveal macroscopic entanglement. We propose a theoretical framework for the degenerate lattice of indistinguishable protons, treated as fermions. Entangled centrosymmetric pairs are superpositions of singlet-like and triplet-like pseudoproton states and the sublattice is a superposition of nonlocal macroscopic single-pseudoproton states, adiabatically separated from the lattice of heavy atoms. The sublattice has no internal dynamics (super-rigidity) and is decoherence free. The energy-free quantum entanglement {{is a consequence of}} the crystal structure, irrespective of proton–proton interaction. The differential cross-section calculated for the super-rigid lattice accounts for the observed rods of intensity.

Quantum entanglement, still observed at 300 K, indicates that proton transfer is a thermally activated coherent superposition of macroscopic tunnelling states.
