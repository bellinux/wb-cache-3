Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Brookfield viscometry were utilized for characterizing the prepared urethane prepolymers. In addition, the adhesion strength of the cured prepolymers was determined by tensile shear strength test according to the DIN EN (Deutsches Institut für Normung, the German Institute for Standardization) 1465 standard. Especially, the role of different types of linear (butanediol, <b>pentanediol)</b> and branched chain extenders (dipropyleneglycol (di-PPG), tripropyleneglycol (tri-PPG) and the influence of their dosage on the degree of microphase separation between hard segments (HS) and soft segments (SS) in urethane prepolymers were studied. Furthermore, the benefits of utilizing either a one-step versus a two-step polymerization process were investigated. The results revealed that the extent of phase separation of different urethane prepolymers was dependent on the extent of hydrogen bonding interactions which was extensively studied by attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The incorporation of branched chain extenders (di-PPG and tri-PPG) did not result in notable phase separation between hard segments and soft segments, while linear chain extenders (<b>pentanediol</b> and butanediol) readily promoted phase separation. The degree of phase separation was particularly pronounced for butanediol, and when the linear chain extender ratio was higher than or equal to 0. 74. Compared with a two-stage process, one-stage process produced more randomly distributed polymer chains with highly dispersed hard segments.

40|$|Currently, much {{attention}} {{is being paid}} {{to the development of}} efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for the sustainable production of energy, fuels and chemicals [1]. In this context, lignocellulosic biomass appears as a renewable alternative feedstock to fossil resources. Thus, dehydration of C 5 carbohydrates leads to furfural (FUR), a versatile platform molecule for the synthesis of a large spectrum of chemicals. Among them, the most important is furfuryl alcohol (FOL), accounting for 65 % of FUR production, which finds application in the preparation of resins used as high-quality cores and molds for metal casting, reactive solvent for phenolic resins in the refractory industry, chemical building block for the synthesis of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and pharmaceuticals and manufacture of fragrances [2, 3]. FOL is prepared industrially by the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural, which can be carried out in vapor or liquid-phases, being the former in the presence of copper chromite the preferred industrial route. However, other products such as 2 -methylfuran, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and 2 -methyl tetrahydrofuran can result from furfural hydrogenation, besides furan and THF, different <b>pentanediols,</b> 2 -pentanone and 2 -pentanol, cyclopentanone and cyclopentanol. The selectivity pattern depends strongly on reaction conditions and {{on the nature of the}} catalyst used. Nevertheless, a synthetic approach based on the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), based on the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of an aldehyde (or ketone) coupled to the oxidation of a secondary alcohol, has been also proposed, which does not require supply of external hydrogen and the alcohol can be chosen in order to produce an aldehyde or ketone with industrial applications [4, 5]. The present contribution deals with the production of FOL from furfural by CTH, using different commercial aluminas as catalysts and a secondary alcohol as hydrogen donor, in liquid phase. The results have demonstrated that the formation of other by-products is minimized and FOL is produced in high yield, at temperatures ranging between 90 and 150 ºC, by using 2 -propanol. Thus, full conversion of furfural and a FOL selectivity higher than 90 mol% are attained after only 2 h, at 150 ºC, a FUR concentration of 0. 25 M in 2 -propanol and a catalyst/FUR weight ratio of 1 : 1 (Fig. 1). A reaction mechanism, involving Lewis acid sites present on the alumina surface in the activation of FUR and 2 -propanol, has been put forward. Different experimental parameters (FUR concentration, reaction temperature, catalyst loading, type of alumina and nature of alcohol) have been optimized in order to achieve suitable FOL yields. Moreover, reutilization has been evaluated to support the advantage of the heterogeneous catalytic process which allows the reuse of the solid catalyst. Finally, and considering that dehydration of xylose to furfural is accomplished in the presence of solid acid catalysts, the one-pot synthesis of FOL from xylose has been undertaken by tuning selected experimental variables.

30|$|In {{this study}} the process used to prepare zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} and subsequent hybrid materials is a polyol process [24, 26, 27, 28, 29]. The polyol synthesis designates the liquid-phase synthesis in high-boiling, multivalent alcohols and is mainly directed to nanoparticles. Chemically, the polyol family starts with ethylene glycol (EG) as its simplest representative. Based on EG, the polyols comprise two main series of molecules: (1) diethylene glycol (DEG), triethylene glycol (TrEG), tetraethylene glycol (TEG), {{and so on}} up to polyethylene glycol (PEG), with the latter containing more than 2000 ethylene groups, (2) propanediol (PDO), butanediol (BD), <b>pentanediol</b> (PD), and so on. Moreover, glycerol (GLY), pentaerythritol (PE), and carbohydrates chemically belong to the polyols [24, 26]. In a typical polyol process, the solid precursor is suspended in the liquid polyol, and then the solution or the suspension is stirred and heated to a given temperature which can reach the boiling point of the polyol. Polyol is an excellent capping reagent {{as well as a}} good dispersive medium, which plays a critical role in the nucleation and growth of the crystalline nanoparticles. For the polyol-mediated synthesis of metal oxides a defined amount of water has to be added into the polyol and the relative concentration of water versus the metal concentration, i.e., the hydrolysis ratio, is a critical parameter to tune the size of the nanoparticles obtained through spontaneous nucleation [26]. The growth mechanism of ZnO coating on the surface of MWCNTs is purposed as follow [27].|$|E
40|$|Plasticizers are {{ubiquitous}} environmental contaminants. Biodegradation of some {{of these}} chemicals, such as di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP or DOP), has been shown to lead to the accumulation of toxic metabolic breakdown products. As a result there is a desire to produce new, fully biodegradable, "green" plasticizers. With this goal in mind, a series of tests were developed to be used to measure the plasticizing efficiency of potential green plasticizers. The base resin selected for the study was poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the plasticized polymer was measured by temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC). Tensile tests were carried out on samples of the material from which the tensile strength and the strain at break of the material were measured. The aforementionned properties were measured for PVC plasticized with the commercial plasticizers DEHP, diethylene glycol dibenzoate (DEGDB) and dipropylene glycol dibenzoate (DPGDB) at several plasticizer concentrations. 1, 5 <b>pentanediol</b> dibenzoate (PDDB) was synthesized and evaluated as a plasticizer by comparing results for this compound with those for the commercial plasticizers using the developed tests.

PDDB was subjected to biodegradation unsing co-metabolism by the common soil bacterium Rhodococcus rhodocrous (ATCC 13808).

Eight adenosine- 5 '- O -phosphorylated polyols (derivatives of glycerol, erythritol and pentaerythritol) and 11 adenosine- 5 '- O -phosphorothioylated polyols (derivatives of glycerol, erythritol, pentaerythritol, butanediol and <b>pentanediol)</b> have been tested as inhibitors of specific diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap(4) A) hydrolases. Of these two groups of novel nucleotides, the adenosine- 5 '- O -phosphorothioylated polyols were generally stronger inhibitors than their adenosine- 5 '- O -phosphorylated counterparts. 1, 4 -Di(adenosine- 5 '- O -phosphorothio) erythritol appeared to be the strongest inhibitor of (asymmetrical) Ap(4) A hydrolases (EC 3. 6. 1. 17) from both lupin and human, with K (i) values of 0. 15 microM and 1. 5 microM respectively. Of eight adenosine- 5 '- O -phosphorylated polyols, 1, 4 -di(adenosine- 5 '- O -phospho) erythritol was the only compound that inhibited the lupin enzyme. Two derivatives of pentaerythritol, di(adenosine- 5 '- O -phosphorothio) -di(phosphorothio) pentaerythritol and tri(adenosine- 5 '- O -phosphorothio) -phosphorothio-pentaerythritol, proved to be the strongest inhibitors of the prokaryotic (symmetrical) Ap(4) A hydrolase (EC 3. 6. 1. 41) so far reported.

HPC demonstrated a unique behaviour within aqueous solutions therefore the effect of commonly used pharmaceutical solvents on the conformation of HPC in solution was investigated. Diol solvents decreased the critical concentration of HPC and increased its thermal stability in solution. Ethanol, DMSO and Ethylene glycol co-solvent systems on the contrary increased the critical concentration of HPC. In a related study HPC-solvent gel systems were investigated as potential drug delivery systems. All HPC-solvent systems provided gel networks with {{rheological properties}} dependant upon polymer concentration. Diol solvents increased the elastic nature of the HPC formulations which may aid in the retention of the device and its resistance to erosion.

The formulations possessed suitable rheological behaviour to allow for easy application and retention at the site of application.

In this poster {{we would like to}} discuss the features of ribosome crystallization. Ribosomes were purified from the thermophilic bacteria Thermus thermophilus by centrifugation (3). Three types of crystals (needle, flat tetragonal and tetragonal-like pyramid) can be grown from the same solution; furthermore, in the same drop using 10 - 15 % 2 -methyl- 2, 4 - <b>pentanediol</b> as a precipitant. The crystals appeared in 5 - 48 hours. The crystals were stable and can co-exist in solution over long period of time. The kinetics of appearance of different crystal forms was different: first the needle crystals were grown, then the tetragonal, and finally the tetragonal pyramids. Later studies of the process of ribosome crystal growth depending on supersaturation showed that low supersaturation results in the appearance of tetragonal plates or tetragonal-like pyramids. An electron microscopy study, together with computer modeling, has shown that crystals of different forms have a high probability of having the same unit cell parameters. According to these experiments the following conclusion can be dranvn: the level of supersaturation of the macromolecule in a crystallizing solution {{is one of the major}} factors for forming three-dimensional crystals convenient for X-rays diffraction analysis. From the same macromolecule solution, crystals of different forms can be grown at approximately the same conditions by varying the concentration of macromolecule in the solution.

The problem in question was a 'gassy' runaway reaction system: decomposition of 40 % w/w dicumyl peroxide in 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 3 - <b>pentanediol</b> diisobutyrate. The objective of the Round Robin exercise was to highlight the disparities in the participant's approaches and identify barriers and research needs. Two broad methods were used: one was the implementation of the DIERS method; the other was to follow a similarity or scale-up approach. The scale-up approach consists experimentally determining a minimum safe vent area and scaling up maintaining the vent area/volume ratio. This approach is similar to the one adopted by the UN committee on the Transport of Dangerous Goods for vent sizing of peroxide tankers using a 10 litre vessel. Very different results in terms of vent area were obtained from the seven participants. Analysis of the vent sizing calculations based on calorimetric data showed that the experimental conditions and their interpretation can significantly influence the estimated gas production rate and therefore the final vent area. However, the calculation of the vented mass flux stays largely responsible for the differences in calculated vent area. The critical factor lies in the assumption of single-phase (gas only) venting or two-phase (liquid and gas) venting. The reasons for assuming single-phase venting, which gives a lower vent area, are unclear and may not be justified. The comparison showed that the calorimetric and the similarity approaches diverged significantly when two-phase only venting was assumed. The Round Robin test highlighted the need for more experimental and modelling work towards predicting the nature of the vented fluid at large scale, and in the use of adiabatic calorimetry to determine the maximum gas production rate. Large-scale tests would allow the comparison, the validation and the improvement of the calorimetric and similarity approaches...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Avermectins are a {{group of}} potent {{anthelmintic}} agents produced by Streptomyces avermitilis. They are active at extremely low dosages and are now in commercial use. In this study, the synthesis of two segments of avermectin B[subscript 1 a] are described. The synthesis of the hexahydrobenzofuran subunit (segment A) began with the Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 3 -methyl- 1 -[(trimethylsilyl) oxyl- 113 -butadiene which gave the synthon 79. Cleavage of the silyl protecting group of 79 afforded the acid-lactone 81 which was resolved using (R) -(+) -methylbenzylamine. The absolute configuration of the resolved acid was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis of its salt. Conversion of 81 to diazoketone 86, followed by acid catalyzed cyclization, then gave the key hexahydrobenzofuran building block 88. Stereoselective epoxidation of the C- 617 olefin of 88 furnished the β-epoxide 94. Opening of the epoxide moiety of 94 to form the required C- 5, 6 olefin was attempted using several methods. Hydroiodic acid, followed by further manipulations, led to the undesired, conjugated isomer 104. The problem was solved {{by the use of}} triethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, which afforded a mixture of endo and exo olefins 118 and 119 with concomitant formation of the silyl ether of the ketone. Regioselective epoxidation of this mixture furnished two alcohols, the major product being the exo isomer 120. Attempted epimerization at C- 4 of 94 with sodium methoxide gave epoxy lactone 126 which, upon treatment with triethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, afforded exclusively the endo olefin 127. Acidic hydrolysis of 127 gave 133 with the desired (natural) configuration at C- 4. However, introduction of an angular hydroxyl group into 133 using the same methodology as before was unsuccessful in this case. The synthesis of segment B was initiated with the enantioselective epoxidation of allylic alcohol 141. Cuprate-mediated methylation of 142 gave exclusively the (2 S, 3 S) <b>pentanediol</b> 143. Subsequent oxidation of the primary alcohol, followed by Wittig olefination with (carbomethoxymethyl) triphenylphosphorane, provided the required carbon skeleton. Reduction of the ester function of 149 furnished the allylic alcohol 150 which was transformed to the corresponding phosphonium salt. An attempted Wittig reaction of the ylid derived from 152 with 120 failed to give the desired product, presumably due to steric hindrance of the ketone function...|$|E
40|$|My {{research}} {{focuses on}} understanding the mechanisms of eukaryotic inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir), which are responsible for creating membrane potential stability. N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of inwardly rectifying K (Kir) channels control the ion- permeation pathway through diverse interactions with small molecules and protein ligands in the cytoplasm. Two crystal structures of the cytoplasmic domains of Kir 2. 1 (Kir 2. 1 L) and the G protein-sensitive Kir 3. 1 (Kir 3. 1 S) channels {{in the absence of}} PIP 2 show the cytoplasmic ion- permeation pathways occluded by four cytoplasmic loops that form a girdle around the central pore (G-loop). Significant flexibility of the pore-facing G-loop of Kir 2. 1 L and Kir 3. 1 S suggest a possible role as a diffusion barrier between cytoplasmic and transmembrane pores. Consistent with this, mutations of the G-loop disrupted gating or inward rectification. Structure comparison reveals a di-aspartate cluster on the distal end of the cytoplasmic pore of Kir 2. 1 L that is important for modulating inward rectification. The Kir 2. 1 L structural allows us the first structural look at the potential causes of Andersen's Syndrome, which is caused by defects in the inwardly rectifying potassium channel 2. 1 (Kir 2. 1). We have characterized individual Andersen's Syndrome mutants R 218 Q, G 300 V, E 303 K, and [delta] 314 - 315 and have shown that they have multiple affects on the ability of Kir 2. 1 channel's cytoplasmic domains to assemble into proper tetrameric assemblies. The 2. 0 Å x-ray crystal structure of the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of Kir 2. 1 R 218 Q combined with T 309 K, reveals the G-loop and CD loop disruptions by the R 218 Q mutation. We show that E 303 {{plays an important role in}} gating. Moreover, we demonstrate a novel DE loop stabilizing 2 -methyl- 2, 4 - <b>pentanediol</b> binding site, and cytoplasmic bound potassium ion, the first identified for this class of K channels. We have also conducted NMR studies on the last 58 residues of Kir 2. 1 to show the flexibility of this region and binding footprint of PSD 95 PDZ domains, which tethers the channels to the cell's cytoskeleton. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cytoplasmic domains of Kir channels are structurally significant components of the channel and undergo structural changes to modulate gating and inward rectificatio...|$|E
40|$|Properties of {{polymers}} in {{thin films}} are distinct {{from those in}} the bulk due to the significant effects of free or substrate surfaces. The presence of a free surface allows an increased mobility of polymer chains in the near surface region, therefore, a lower glass transition temperature (T g). With this lower surface T g, a surface-specific crystallization phenomenon occurring at temperatures much lower than the bulk crystallization temperature (T c) in polymers including PET, PEN and PVOH has previously been observed. However, whether or not this surface-specific crystallization is a phenomenon observable in all crystallizable polymers is still a question. Similarly, due to this greater mobility, phase separation may also be able to take place in the near-surface region of a polymer blend at a temperature much lower than the bulk phase separation temperature. Yet, no such investigation on polymer blends has been carried out. In addition, it is interesting to study the thin-film behaviours of a block copolymer that undergoes both phase separation and crystallization and compare these with corresponding bulk behaviour. In this thesis, the thin-film crystallization behaviour of polyamide 12 (PA 12) in spin-cast films is presented together with some investigation of crystallization of polyamide 6 (PA 6) and polystyrene. Polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS/PMMA) systems are used to illustrate the phase behaviours specific to the near-surface region. Finally, the microstructural evolution in high hard block content thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) thin films on annealing has also been investigated. These TPUs have hard segments (HS) extended by 2 methyl 1, 3 propanediol (2 M 13 PD) or 1, 5 <b>pentanediol</b> (15 PD). With its flexible chains, PA 12 crystallizes during spin coating forming as-spin-cast crystals with morphology that varies with solvent evaporation rate and film thickness. Despite the as spin-cast crystals, the free surface allows secondary surface crystallization of PA 12 at an annealing temperature (T a) roughly 20 °C below the bulk T c. The secondary surface crystals were indicated to exist in the most stable crystalline phase of PA 12. Similar secondary surface crystallization has also been observed in the PA 6 films but at a higher T a due to the higher T g of PA 6. In addition, surface-specific crystals have been observed in PS (semicrystalline, likely due to some stereoregularity of composition), a polymer with bulky side groups. The PS surface crystals are, however, flat-on oriented showing the important effect of side groups on the morphology or growth shape of surface crystals. The discovery of these surface crystals supports the universality of surface specific crystallization. Using fast solvent quenching, it is possible to "freeze in" a structure containing both PS and PMMA in the near surface region. On annealing, surface-specific phase behaviours (observable as pits, undulations and aggregations) confined to the near-surface region take place first at temperatures around or just below the bulk polymer T g, while bulk vertical phase separation and dewetting of PS to PMMA, forming holes, network structures and islands, occur at temperatures well above T g. This surface specific phenomenon, being a result of the free surface, should be applicable to other phase separation systems with a free surface as well. An increase in the crystallinity of PS was found to promote the phase separation process, but the free surface effect is independent of the interplay between the crystallization and phase separation. Rather than having a two-phase morphology, as was previously observed in melt-quenched bulk samples, 2 M 13 PD extended TPU spin-cast films showed a single-phase morphology as-spin-cast. However, the HS ordering, the formation of mesophase, the melting of HS ordered regions, and microphase mixing observed in thin films are consistent with the bulk results but with slightly different transition temperatures due to spatial confinement. With a more flexible chain extender, e. g. 15 PD, the hard and soft phase separation is more limited. The thin film investigations have allowed {{a better understanding of the}} microstructural evolution in these high hard block content TPUs on annealing by imaging the morphology directly. A thin-film specific phenomenon: formation of large multilayer flat-on crystals, was also observed in these TPU thin films. These crystals are initially developed from preformed aggregations and are believed to be induced by the significant substrate effect in thin films and the free surface effect.
