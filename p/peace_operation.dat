40|$|Most <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> (60 %), {{deployed}} from 1978 to 2009 {{by international}} organizations (IOs), were deployed in conflicts in which other international organizations??? <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> were active {{at the same}} time. Multiple simultaneous <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> increased from around 10 % of all <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> in 1992 to almost 60 % of all <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> in 2007. I define two or more <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> deployed by international organizations at the same time, in the same conflicts as multiple simultaneous <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> (MSPOs). This continuous increase in multiple simultaneous <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> has not been paralleled {{by an increase in}} scholarly analysis of this phenomenon. We have little understanding of why we observe international organizations (IOs) deployed at the same time, in the same conflicts, and increasingly cooperating with each other to address these conflicts. This study asks the question: What factors determine cooperation between international organizations in <b>peace</b> <b>operations?</b> I test several rational and social constructivist explanations introducing an innovative collective principals-multiple agents framework. There are three rational-interest explanations for inter-organizational cooperation tested: resources, complementarity, and conflict complexity. I also tested three social-constructivist arguments for inter-organizational cooperation provided by the scholarly literature: social learning, security cultures similarity, and personnel nationality similarity. This study provides the first systematic analysis of EU???s <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> and cooperation between the EU and other international organizations. The research design is a multi-method approach, using statistical analysis from my new dataset on multiple simultaneous <b>peace</b> <b>operations,</b> data from interviews with EU officials, and case studies. There are two stages for the initiation of inter-organizational cooperation: the member-states??? acquiescence and the international organizations??? cooperation. At the first stage of cooperation, the member-states??? acquiescence is required, and the evidence provided by this study shows that member-states are acquiescent to inter-organizational cooperation. At the second stage, the findings show that international organizations cooperate with each other, when deploying <b>peace</b> <b>operations,</b> because they want to share the financial and human resources costs, and second, because they want to complement each other???s work...|$|R
40|$|<b>Peace</b> <b>operations</b> {{have had}} {{difficulty}} in being {{accepted by the}} US Army, have not been institutionalized, and continue to challenge the Army as an institution. Insight from the sociological perspective known as social construction {{was used to examine}} doctrinal development and institutionalization. Social constructionism predicts that until a new mission is accepted by the individual and the group, it will continue to cause disequilibrium. The constant reconceptualization and changing terminology within <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> reflected the inability of the Army to accept <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> as a primary mission. The national security strategy of the US is the primary, {{the first step in the}} social construction of <b>peace</b> <b>operations.</b> When <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> were considered to serve national interests, the Army began to develop appropriate doctrine for these missions. Army professional literature highlighted how the Army leadership conceptualized <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> and the amount of attention that they believed should be dedicated to the mission. Doctrinal development was traced from post-World War II, demonstrating the inability of the Army to accept <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> as a primary mission.

40|$|Japan’s {{commitments}} to the UN-authorized <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> in East Timor were the largest contribution {{the country has}} made {{in the history of}} its international <b>peace</b> <b>operations.</b> Notably, Japan’s participation in the peacebuilding operations in East Timor was based on “human security” as one of the pillars of its diplomatic policy. Moreover, Japan’s participation in the <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> in East Timor was a touchstone issue for its human security policy. Yet, one simple but important question arises. How consistent were Japan’s {{commitments to}} the <b>peace</b> <b>operations?</b> In an attempt to answer to this question, this paper systematically examines Japan’s contributions to the international <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> for East Timor. In order to investigate long-term and complicated activities in the <b>peace</b> <b>operations,</b> this paper employs timeline “sequence analysis” as a research method which combines and simplifies analytical models suggested in earlier scholarship. Through the application of sequence analysis, this paper investigates four stages of Japan’s contributions to the <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> in East Timor: 1) preventive deployment (UNAMET), 2) peace-enforcement (INTERFET), 3) peacekeeping (UNTAET), and 4) peacebuilding (e. g.

However, in his 2009 report on implementing the RtoP, the UN Secretary-General noted that more work was needed to understand the measures that states might take to exercise their RtoP.

40|$|The {{response}} to many on-going or emerging conflicts {{since the beginning}} of the 21 st century has been different forms of multinational complex <b>peace</b> <b>operations.</b> Civil-military relations are a commonly studied field that traditionally has its focus on nations. This study intends, in the context of organisations, to test the correlation between a civil-military approach and outcome in complex <b>peace</b> <b>operations.</b> A hypothesis has been deduced from researcher Robert Egnell’s theory on complex <b>peace</b> <b>operations,</b> that states that: UN <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> with an integrated civil-military approach are more successful in achieving their goals than <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> with a divided approach. This hypothesis is tested by comparing the outcome of two different complex <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> with diverse approaches to civil-military relations. The cases were selected by a comparative design and thereafter thoroughly analysed in relation to their respective goals. The analysis revealed that the integrated UN approach in Sierra Leone through UNAMSIL was far more successful in achieving its goals, than the divided UN approach applied in Afghanistan via UNAMA and ISAF. In regard to the result, the hypothesis was not falsified which indicates that there is a correlation between a civil-military approach and outcome in organizations. More specifically, an integrated approach to complex <b>peace</b> <b>operations</b> is more successful in achieving its goals than a divided one...|$|R

The paper conclusion is that the European states are developing a preference for selective engagement (i. e. minilateralism) in <b>peace</b> <b>operations,</b> and the EU is capable of playing both as multilateral and minilateral security provider...|$|R
