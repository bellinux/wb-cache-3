In {{the present day}} scenario of electricity generation, it is fast becoming an important industrial product. Presently the PV market is dominated by wafer based crystalline Si cells, but is hampered by high cost. Nanotechnology is worldwide regarded as a key technology for innovations and technological progress in almost all branches of economy. The paper presents the designing of PV system for a commercial organization to meet its load demand with conventional solar cell and nano solar cell. Moreover, the cost comparison of conventional PV system and nano PV system carried out in this paper shows the superiority of nano solar cells over others in terms of cost and efficiency. different components which are selected taking into consideration individual needs, site location, climate and expectations. 2. 1 Major System Components The functional and operational requirements determine the components {{to be included in}} the PV system [3]. The major components incorporated in PV system as shown in Figure 1 are DC-AC power inverter, battery bank, system and battery controller, auxiliary energy sources and sometimes the specified electrical loads (appliances) [3].

40|$|The {{technique}} of extracellular space tracing with horseradish peroxidase is adapted for labeling the transverse tubular <b>system</b> (<b>T</b> <b>system)</b> in rat heart. In rat ventricular muscle the <b>T</b> <b>system</b> shows extensive branching and remarkable tortuosity. The <b>T</b> <b>system</b> {{can only be}} defined operationally, since it does not display specific morphological features throughout its entire structure. Owing to branching of the <b>T</b> <b>system,</b> a sizable proportion of the apposition between the <b>T</b> <b>system</b> and L system (or closed system) occurs {{at the level of}} longitudinal branches of the <b>T</b> <b>system</b> and is not restricted to the Z line region. The regions of apposition between the <b>T</b> <b>system</b> and L system are analyzed in rat ventricular muscle and skeletal muscle (diaphragm) and compared with the intercellular tight junctions (nexuses) of heart muscle by the use of a photometric method. The over-all thickness of the nexus is significantly smaller than that of T-L junctions in both cardiac and skeletal muscles. The thickness of the membranes of the <b>T</b> and L <b>systems</b> are not significantly different in the two muscles, but the gap between both membranes is larger in the heart. In atrial muscle the following two types of cells are found: (a) those cells with a well-developed <b>T</b> <b>system</b> in which the tubular diameter is quite uniform and the orientation predominantly longitudinal and, (b) cells with no <b>T</b> <b>system,</b> but with a well-developed L system.

40|$|The tubular (<b>t)</b> <b>system</b> is {{essential}} for normal function of skeletal muscle fibre, acting as a conduit for molecules and ions within the cell. However, <b>t</b> <b>system</b> accessibility and interconnectivity have been mainly assessed in fixed cells where the <b>t</b> <b>system</b> no longer fully represents that of the living cell. Here, fluorescent dyes of different diameter were allowed to equilibrate within the <b>t</b> <b>system</b> of intact fibres from toad, mechanically skinned to trap the dyes, and then imaged using confocal microscopy to investigate <b>t</b> <b>system</b> accessibility and interconnectivity. Dual imaging of rhod- 2 and a 500 kDa fluorescein dextran identified regions throughout the <b>t</b> <b>system</b> that differed in the accessibility to molecules of different molecular weight. Restrictions within the <b>t</b> <b>system</b> lumen occurred at the junctions of the longitudinal and transverse tubules and also where a transverse tubule split into two tubules to maintain their alignment with Z-lines of adjacent mis-registered sarcomeres. Thus, three types of tubule, transverse, longitudinal and Z, can be identified by their lumenal diameter in this network. The latter we define {{for the first time}} as a tubule with a narrow lumen that is responsible for the change in register. Stretch-induced <b>t</b> <b>system</b> vacuolation showed exclusive access of rhod- 2 to these structures indicating their origin was the longitudinal tubules. Exposing the sealed <b>t</b> <b>system</b> to highly hypertonic solution reversed vacuolation of longitudinal tubules and also revealed that these tubules are not collapsible. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements of t system-trapped fluo- 5 N showed interconnectivity through the <b>t</b> <b>system</b> along the axis of the fibre. However, diffusion occurred at a rate slower than expected given the known number of longitudinal tubules linking adjacent transverse tubules. This could be explained by the observed narrow opening to the longitudinal tubules from transverse tubules, reducing the effective cross-sectional area in which molecules could move within the <b>t</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

The <b>T</b> <b>system</b> volmne is regulated by the osmotic pressure difference between the lumen and external solution, as well as by constraining forces whose nature is as yet unclear. The decreased swelling tendency produced by hypotonic solutions and increased tendency produced by some hypertonic solutions are ascribed to changes in the pressure constraint from the sarcoplasm.

40|$|The linear {{electrical}} properties of skeletal muscle fibers have been analyzed using lumped circuit analogues of helicoidal <b>T</b> <b>system.</b> The geometry of a helicoid {{is assumed to}} produce two electrical effects, modeled separately.

The second model is motivated by the longitudinal continuity of a helicoid, which forms a structure similar to a cable within the fiber. The pitch or tilting of the <b>T</b> <b>system</b> plane modified the longitudinal resistance of the fiber, making it slightly frequency dependent; however, {{the magnitude of the}} change was less than 0. 1 %. The longitudinal connections between <b>T</b> <b>system</b> networks had a more complicated effect; the magnitude of the correction was again less than 0. 1 %.

Farmers 301) 葉肉細胞中， 2 天後測量接種葉的導電度，發現番茄接種葉短暫表現 xopQ 後之導電度明顯高於對照組與短暫表現 avrXccB 之接種葉，顯示 Xcc XopQ 可誘發番茄葉肉細胞的凋亡路徑 (programmed cell death) 。本研究以異源表現策略分析 4 個 Xcc T 3 Es 後得知 Xcc AvrXccB 可促進 Xcr cxsp 3 在甘藍葉片中之生長，而 Xcc XopQ 可誘發番茄葉肉細胞凋亡，故此方法應可用於分析其他功能未知的 T 3 Es 在病原細菌致病過程中對植物的影響。Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) and X. campestris pv. raphani (Xcr) are the causal agents of black rot and bacterial spot diseases on cruciferous plants. Xcc infects plants {{belonging to the}} Brassicaceae family, whereas Xcr infects plants in Brassicaceae and tomato and pepper of the Solanaceae family. Xcr is not a pathogen of cruciferous horseradish (Armoracia rusticana), {{which serves as a}} diagnostic index for differentiating Xcr from X. campestris pv. armoraciae (Xca) and reclassifies Xca 756 C to Xcr 756 C (Fargier and Manceau, 2007, Plant Pathol. 56 : 805 - 818). Plant-pathogenic xanthomonads attach to the aerial surfaces of plants with extracellular adhesins for subsequent invasion. Once residing in the apoplast, the bacteria synthesize the type III secretion <b>system</b> (<b>T</b> 3 SS) to deliver the type III <b>system</b> effectors (<b>T</b> 3 Es) into plant cells to interfere with plant defense signaling pathways and to obtain nutrients from host cells. Whole-genome comparisons of Xcc ATCC 33913 and Xcr 756 C reveal that the 2 bacteria harbor different repertoires of T 3 Es, which might be collectively involved in plant-microbe interactions to elicit various plant responses in different plants. To address the functions of T 3 Es in bacterial pathogenesis, the approaches of loss-of-function by mutation and gain-of-function by overexpression are frequently applied. Previous researchers characterized Xcc T 3 Es by genetic disruption and showed that the mutant strains exhibited wild type-like phenotypes in symptom production and bacterial multiplication in planta. In this study, the gain-of-function approach is employed to examine the functions of Xcc T 3 Es. Four of the Xcc T 3 Es, i. e. avrBs 2 Xcc 17, avrXccE 1 Xcc 100, avrXccBXcc 17, and xopQXcc 17, that are not found in the genome of Xcr 756 C are selected and heterologously expressed in Xcr cxsp 3. In comparison with Xcr harboring vector pBBR 1 MCS- 5, Xcr transformants expressing avrXccE 1, avrXccB, and xopQ show reduced biofilm formation and twitching motility, whereas avrBs 2 -expressing Xcr exhibits the opposite phenotypes, including increased biofilm formation and enhanced twitching motility. In contrast to the few clustered cells of the avrBs 2 -expressing transformant, the 3 Xcr transformants expressing avrXccE 1, avrXccB, and xopQ grow and form large clusters in NYG broth. The cellular aggregation is likely due to the synthesis of long, tangled pili that are readily seen on the bacterial surfaces under transmission electron microscope. Results of quantitative RT-PCR reveal that the transcription of pilT is reduced in the hyperpiliated transformants expressing avrXccE 1, avrXccB, and xopQ, and the transcription of pilA in avrBs 2 -expressing Xcr is greatly increased, indicating the expression of the type IV pili biogenesis genes in Xcr is affected by the ectopic expression of the 4 Xcc T 3 S effectors. The question of how the 4 Xcc T 3 Es modulate the type IV pili biogenesis in Xcr remains to be elucidated. To test if avrBs 2, avrXccE 1, avrXccB, and xopQ have virulent functions, the 4 T 3 Es-expressing Xcr transformants are infiltrated to cabbage leaves for scoring symptom development and bacterial multiplication. Our results show that wild-type Xcr harboring vector pBBR 1 -MCS 5 and the 4 transformants elicit necrotic symptom at 2 days post inoculation. Meanwhile, the population of avrXccB-expressing Xcr increases 3. 5 logs, {{and the rest of the}} strains have an increment of 2 logs in 2 days, suggesting that Xcc AvrXccB may promote bacterial growth in cabbage through an unknown mechanism. In addition, Agrobacterium- mediated transient expression of the 4 Xcc T 3 Es in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Farmers 301) leaves reveals that the expression of xopQ in tomato mesophyll cells causes ion leakage. The high conductivity of leaf disks harvested from the xopQ-infiltrated leaves reveals that Xcc XopQ could induce programmed cell death in tomato cells. Taken together, the results of ectopic-expressing Xcc T 3 Es show that AvrXccB promotes Xcr growth in cabbage, and XopQ acts as an avirulent protein in tomato. The application of heterologous expression in planta and in closely related recipient strains has a great potential to identify the roles of functionally unknown T 3 Es in the pathogenesis of bacterial diseases. 中文摘要 [...] ix 英文摘要 [...] xi 壹、前言 一、黃假單胞菌屬 (Xanthomonas) 之分類與病原生態 [...] -

The control laws are derived using the regulator equations of Byrnes and Isidori (1990), who have solved the output regulation of nonlinear systems involving neutrally stable exosystem dynamics.

40|$|Striated musclc fibers {{from the}} body and tail myotomes of a fish, the black Mollic, have been {{examined}} with {{particular attention to the}} sarcoplasmic rcticulum (SR) and transverse tubular (or <b>T)</b> <b>system.</b> The material was fixed in osmium tetroxidc and in glutaraldehyde, and thc images provided by the two kinds of fixatives wcre comparcd. Glutaraldehydc fixes a fine structure that is broadly comparable with that prcservcd by osmium tetroxide alone but differs in some significant details. Especially significant improvements were obtained in the prcscrvation of thc <b>T</b> <b>system,</b> that is, thc system of small tubules that pervades the fiber at every Z line or A-I junction level. As a result of this improved glutaraldehydc fixation, the <b>T</b> <b>system</b> is now clearly defined as an entity of fine structure distinct from the SK but uniquely associated with the SR and myofibrils. Glutaraldehyde fixation also reveals that the <b>T</b> <b>system</b> is a sarcolemmal derivative that retains its continuity with the sarcolemma and limits a space that is in direct communication with the extraccllular environment. These structural features favor the conclusion that the <b>T</b> <b>system</b> plays a prominent role in the fast intracellular conduction of the excitatory impulse. The preservation of other elements of muscle fine structure, including the myofibrils, seems for reasons discussed, to be substantially improved by glutaraldehyde...|$|R

The surface and volume densities of the <b>T</b> <b>system</b> in dystrophic muscle fibers showed large increases compared with normal muscle fibers; the surface and volume densities of the SR showed large decreases. In addition, the SR and <b>T</b> <b>system</b> in dystrophic fibers undergo changes in shape. The tubules of the free SR become much narrower; the <b>T</b> <b>system</b> becomes dilated and vesiculated. Dystrophic fibers, on the average, are much larger than normal but maintain the same sarcolemmal surface/fiber volume ratio as normal fibers. Alterations in the surface and volume densities of the dystrophic sarcotubular system may account for some of the altered contractile properties of these muscles...|$|R
3000|$|In general, {{the optimal}} {{operation}} of a CCHP microgrid is associated with uncertainties from cooling, thermal and electrical load, and the PV output. The randomness of cooling and thermal load {{is affected by the}} weather surrounding the buildings; the electrical load in the buildings are influenced by the level of consumer activities, and the power output of a PV unit can be impacted by the radiation of the sun and the ambient weather. Because of these factors, it is difficult to precisely characterise their power value. In this paper, we assume that these power values fall within the intervals of Q [...] c,u [...] t [...] ∈ [Q [...] c [...] t [...] − Q [...] c [...] ld [...], Q [...] c [...] t [...] + Q [...] c [...] ud [...]], H [...] h,u [...] t [...] ∈ [H [...] h [...] t [...] − H [...] h [...] ld [...], H [...] h [...] t [...] + H [...] h [...] ud [...]], P [...] l,u [...] t [...] ∈ [P [...] l [...] t [...] − P [...] l [...] ld [...], P [...] l [...] t [...] + P [...] l [...] ud [...]], and P [...] pv,u [...] t [...] ∈ [P [...] <b>pv</b> [...] <b>t</b> [...] − P [...] pv [...] ld [...], P [...] <b>pv</b> [...] <b>t</b> [...] + P [...] pv [...] ud [...]], with Q [...] c [...] t [...], H [...] h [...] t [...], P [...] l [...] t [...] and P [...] <b>pv</b> [...] <b>t</b> [...] representing the predicted value in period t and Q [...] c,u [...] t [...], H [...] h,u [...] t [...], P [...] l,u [...] t [...] and P [...] pv,u [...] t [...] representing sets of possible cooling, thermal and electrical load and the output PV.
