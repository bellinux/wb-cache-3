5|$|In England, Anne {{shifted her}} {{energies}} from factional politics to <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> and constructed her own magnificent court, hosting {{one of the}} richest cultural salons in Europe. After 1612, she suffered sustained bouts of ill health and gradually withdrew from the centre of court life. Though she was reported to have been a Protestant {{at the time of her}} death, evidence suggests that she may have converted to Catholicism sometime in her life.|$|E
5|$|The Hellenistic Egyptian city of Alexandria was the stepping-stone for Greek {{anatomy and}} physiology. Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and {{books of the}} liberal arts in the world {{during the time of}} the Greeks, but was also home to many medical {{practitioners}} and philosophers. Great <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> and sciences from the Ptolemy rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.|$|E
5|$|The Crown was at {{the centre}} of {{government}} in late medieval Scotland. The unification of the kingdom, the spread of Anglo-Norman custom, {{the development of a}} European trading economy and Robert I's success in achieving independence from England, all did much to build up the prestige of the institution. However, its authority within the kingdom was not unchallenged, not least from the many semi-independent lordships and it endured a series of crisis, particularly frequent minorities and resulting regencies. All of this, in addition to the relative poverty of the kingdom and the lack of a system of regular taxation, helped to limit the scale of central administration and government. Much more than the English monarchy, the Scottish court remained a largely itinerant institution, with the king moving between royal castles, particularly Perth and Stirling, but also holding judicial sessions throughout the kingdom, with Edinburgh only beginning to emerge as the capital in the reign of James III at the cost of considerable unpopularity. Like most western European monarchies, the Scottish Crown in the 15th century adopted the example of the Burgundian court, through formality and elegance putting itself at the centre of culture and political life, defined with display, ritual and pageantry, reflected in elaborate new palaces and <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{precursor}} to Renaissance {{art can be}} seen already in the early 14th-century works of Giotto. Giotto was the first painter since antiquity to attempt the representation of a three-dimensional reality, and to endow his characters with true human emotions. The most important developments, however, came in 15th century Florence. The affluence of the merchant class allowed extensive <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts,</b> and foremost among the patrons were the Medici.|$|E

25|$|Historians have {{traditionally}} blamed Rudolf's {{preoccupation with the}} arts, occult sciences, and other personal interests {{as the reason for}} the political disasters of his reign. More recently historians have re-evaluated this view and see his <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> and occult sciences as a triumph and key part of the Renaissance, while his political failures are seen as a legitimate attempt to create a unified Christian empire, which was undermined by the realities of religious, political and intellectual disintegrations of the time.|$|E
25|$|Catherine de' Medici's <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> made a {{significant}} contribution to the French Renaissance. Catherine was inspired by the example of her father-in-law, King Francis I of France (reigned 1515–1547), who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court. As a young woman, she witnessed at first hand the artistic flowering stimulated by his patronage. As governor and regent of France, Catherine set out to imitate Francis's politics of magnificence. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display.|$|E
25|$|Malaca {{reached a}} high {{cultural}} and civic development in this period, having {{been converted into}} a federated city of the empire, and was governed by its own code of laws, the Lex Flavia Malacitana. The presence of an educated populace and their <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> had a significant bearing on this. The great Roman baths, remains of which have been found in the subsoil of the Pintor Nogales and the Cistercian Abbey, also belong to this period, as well as numerous sculptures now preserved in the Museo de Málaga.|$|E

25|$|A common trend {{throughout}} the 20th century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, {{is the use}} of smaller orchestras as a cost-cutting measure; the grand Romantic-era orchestras with huge string sections, multiple harps, extra horns, and exotic percussion instruments were no longer feasible. As government and private <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> decreased {{throughout the}} 20th century, new works were often commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and short, one-act operas. Many of Benjamin Britten's operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; Mark Adamo's two-act realization of Little Women is scored for 18 instrumentalists.|$|E
25|$|During the English Restoration period (1660–88), {{the term}} 'rake' was used glamorously: the Restoration rake is a carefree, witty, sexually irresistible aristocrat typified by CharlesII's courtiers, the Earl of Rochester and the Earl of Dorset, who {{combined}} riotous living with intellectual pursuits and <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts.</b> The Restoration rake is {{celebrated in the}} Restoration comedy of the 1660s and the 1670s. After the reign of CharlesII, and especially after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the rake was perceived negatively and became the butt of moralistic tales in which his typical fate was debtor's prison, permanent venereal disease, and, {{in the case of}} William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress, syphilis-induced insanity and internment in Bedlam.|$|E
25|$|Khanmammadov {{was born}} in Derbent (present-day Dagestan, Russia) and began {{studying}} tar at age 10.

After Khanmammadov graduated from middle school, his mother, who was struggling {{to take care of}} six children, sent him to Baku to find Uzeyir Hajibeyov, an Azerbaijani composer known for his <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts.</b> Indeed, Hajibeyov did provide lodging for the boy and, after being convinced of his musical abilities, the composer enrolled him in the Asaf Zeynally Music College.

25|$|In {{addition}} to her own efforts, the Empress sought {{to achieve this goal}} with <b>the</b> assistance <b>of</b> various foundations and advisers. Her ministry encouraged many forms of artistic expression, including traditional Iranian arts (such as weaving, singing, and poetry recital) as well as Western theatre. Her most recognized endeavour supporting <b>the</b> performing <b>arts</b> was her <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shiraz <b>Arts</b> Festival.

25|$|During the Qing Dynasty, Manchu {{emperors}} supported Buddhist {{practices for}} a range of political and personal reasons. The Shunzhi Emperor was a devotee of Chan Buddhism, while his successor, the Kangxi Emperor promoted Tibetan Buddhism, claiming to be <b>the</b> human embodiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodhisattva Manjusri. However, it was under <b>the</b> rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third Qing ruler, the Qianlong Emperor, that imperial <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buddhist <b>arts</b> reached its height in this period.

25|$|Avignon was {{the seat}} of the papacy from 1309 to 1376. With the return of the Pope to Rome in 1378, the Papal State {{developed}} into a major secular power, culminating in the morally corrupt papacy of Alexander VI. Florence grew to prominence amongst the Italian city-states through financial business, and the dominant Medici family became important promoters of the Renaissance through their <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts.</b> Other city states in northern Italy also expanded their territories and consolidated their power, primarily Milan and Venice. The War of the Sicilian Vespers had by the early 14th century divided southern Italy into an Aragon Kingdom of Sicily and an Anjou Kingdom of Naples. In 1442, the two kingdoms were effectively united under Aragonese control.|$|E
25|$|In the Russian Empire the Bagrationis {{became a}} {{prominent}} family of aristocrats.

His brother Prince Roman Bagration also became a Russian general, distinguishing himself in the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), {{and was the first}} to enter Yerevan in 1827. Roman Bagration was also known for his <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts,</b> literature and theatre. His home theater in Tbilisi was {{regarded as one of the}} finest in the Caucasus. His son Prince Pyotr Romanovich Bagration became governor of the Tver region and later governor-general of the Baltic provinces.

Prince Dmitry Petrovich Bagration was a Russian general who fought in World War I in the Brusilov Offensive and later joined the Red Army.|$|E
25|$|In 1548, Cosimo {{purchased}} Elba {{from the}} Republic of Genoa, and based his new developing navy there.

In alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, Cosimo defeated the Republic of Siena, which was allied with France, in the Battle of Marciano on August 2, 1554. On April 17, 1555, Florence and Spain occupied the territory of Siena, which, in July 1557 Philip II of Spain bestowed on Cosimo as a hereditary fiefdom. The ducal family moved into the Palazzo Pitti in 1560. Cosimo commissioned the architect Vasari to build the Uffizi, as offices for the Medici bank, continuing the Medici tradition of <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts.</b> In 1569, Cosimo was elevated to the rank of Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1569 by Pope Pius V.

5000|$|Under Yoshimitsu (active 1379-1408) {{who took}} <b>the</b> reins <b>of</b> power after <b>the</b> {{dismissal}} <b>of</b> Yoriyuki as kanrei, <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> this particular connection encouraged one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most brilliant periods in Japanese history, renowned for <b>the</b> maturation <b>of</b> architectural and cultural forms that have since characterized Japanese culture.

500|$|According to Robert A. Kann, Maria Theresa was a monarch of above-average {{qualifications}} but intellectually {{inferior to}} Joseph and Leopold. Born {{and raised in}} the late Baroque and early Rococo eras, she never felt at home in the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment and generally left <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> to her husband and Joseph.

500|$|Some {{historians have}} excused Catherine from {{blame for the}} worst {{decisions}} of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness {{can be found in}} her letters. In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the Valois monarchy on the throne at all costs, and her <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline. Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power. The years in which they reigned have been called [...] "the age of Catherine de' Medici". According to Mark Strage, one of her biographers, Catherine was the most powerful woman in sixteenth-century Europe.|$|E

40|$|During the dukedoom in Ferrara, Ercole I uses several {{strategies}} to communicate <b>the</b> sacredness <b>of</b> his power. While the prince increases <b>the</b> <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual <b>arts,</b> he finds in sacred representation {{a new and}} effective instrument to convey to his subjects <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> "religiosissimo principe", as Sabadino degli Arienti says in The Triumphis religionis. A common culture of representation informs both pictorial and theatrical figurations. The images are useful to show the prince's religiouseness which undertakes <b>the</b> shapes <b>of</b> popular devotion to Eucharistic piety and Christ's Passion and recomposes them in a celebratory vein.

40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of European artists who worked for short periods <b>of</b> time in <b>the</b> American Colonies during the eighteenth century. Perhaps Cosmo Alexander was typical of other artists who came to America seeking greater {{opportunity}} than in their homeland, only to leave several years later, perhaps disillusioned and no wealthier. Artists who are better known stayed in America long enough to build up clientele in a broad area and produced enough works to have many survive {{long enough to be}} documented by later sources. As the subjects in many of Alexander 2 ̆ 7 s portraits show, there was a large prosperous middle-class <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> portraiture. Considering <b>the</b> social conventions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, personal references and letters of recommendation would have facilitated travel and introduction to prospective clients. <b>The</b> emphasis <b>of</b> this research is the patronage which Cosmo Alexander found in the American Colonies as evidenced by portraits executed between 1765 and 1771. Family connections, Scottish ancestry and communities having large Scottish populations have played a part in determining probable routes. In 1961 Gavin L. M. Goodfellow submitted a thesis to Oberlin College on Cosmo Alexander. This was the first and (to date) the only extensive monograph on the artist. The thesis was general in nature, covering Alexander 2 ̆ 7 s life and listing all paintings known at that time, only sixteen of which were believed to have been painted in America. Because he dealt in detail with Alexander 2 ̆ 7 s total biography and stylistic characteristics, only one chapter was devoted to American works. Since Goodfellow 2 ̆ 7 s research <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> American paintings signed by or attributed to Alexander has increased from sixteen to twenty-six. With greater documentary evidence available, patterns can be established and generalizations made which possibly are typical of other artists in similar circumstances...|$|R
