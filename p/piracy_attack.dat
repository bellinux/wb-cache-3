In Otuzco existed a chapel dedicated to Immaculate Conception, Patroness of Otuzco in that time. When the news became known that the northern cities Guayaquil and Zaña had been attacked by pirates and believing that Trujillo would be the next city to be attacked, from Trujillo were sent messages to the nearby villages so they could take their preventive measures. Residents of Otuzco placed an image of the Virgin of the Conception in the entrance of the village as a symbol of prayer and protection of piracy attacks. Miraculously Trujillo was not attacked by pirates dangerous, and since then born worship and faith to Virgin of La Puerta which spans the north of Peru.|$|E

Piracy, being one of the must known crime in the {{maritime}} industry {{has not been able to}} control its activities. Piracy was known to have a great presence during early 1500, up to this day the number of piracy activity is still significantly large. From the beginning of the twentieth century, the number of <b>piracy</b> <b>attack</b> have been found to be cyclical in nature, taking its high points in 2003 and 2010. In spite of this high point, several organization against anti-piracy such as the Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  {{have been able to}} disrupt pirates attacks protecting vessel and their crew member along with their cargo.  As a safety measure, the U.S Coast Guard encourage the ships' captain to know his crew, deliver a detailed plan of his sea trip to a trusted friend, final check before departing, notify Coast Guard of any suspicious activity, and finally consider clearing local customs before departing on a foreign cruise. Taking these protective measures will lessen the possibility of piracy or high jacking.|$|E

40|$|Part 4 : Network Security and Security ProtocolsInternational audienceIn {{this paper}} we study content {{protection}} techniques {{to defend against}} piracy for streaming content in home networks where multiple digital devices are connected into a peer-based cluster and seamlessly work together. We are {{particularly interested in the}} anonymous rebroadcasting attack where pirates re-distribute the per-content encrypting key or the decrypted plain content. In literature, to defend against an anonymous attack, content is usually built with different variations. For example, content is divided into multiple segments, each segment comes with multiple variations (e. g., watermarks), and each variation is differently encrypted. Each device only has the key to decrypt and play back one variation per segment through the content. The re-distributed keys can be linked back and used to identify the original devices (terms as traitors) who were given those keys and involved in the piracy. This technology works well for prerecorded content scenarios in which a trusted party outside the device pool can deliberately author the content with multiple variations. However it cannot be applied to a peer-based home network when the streaming content is brought into the home network via a peer device who is not a special trust party and who is not allowed to know the secret keys of other peer devices. On the other hand, the trend of the consumer appetite for digital content is increasingly switching from physical media to streaming and internet consumption. In this paper we have designed the first content protection system that allows a recording device inside the home network to bring the streaming content into the home network in a secure way that devices and only devices in the same home network can playback the recording. More importantly, the recorded content without variations can still be used to obtain forensic information, when anonymous piracy attacks occurs, to identify the source devices that participated in the <b>piracy</b> <b>attack.</b> The identified traitorous devices can be revoked for future content access. The technology described in this paper is used to enable the secure sharing of premium quality High Definition content across a consumer’s all audio-video devices at its home networks...|$|E
