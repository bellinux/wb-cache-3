5|$|Quebec's {{transmission}} system contains {{a variety of}} electrical <b>pylons</b> depending on era and voltage level. Older pylon designs tend to consume more material than the newer <b>pylons</b> and the higher the voltage level, the larger the tower.|$|E
5|$|Unlike early models, {{the current}} {{structures}} {{are made up}} of six sections attached together by zippers and Velcro to allow quick replacement if damaged by a plane. Prior to May 2008, the races had used more than eight tons of fabric for the various <b>pylons,</b> and the average life of each pylon was 15 races. Thirty-five <b>pylons</b> are transported to each race, and at each race's completion, the <b>pylons</b> are sent to Innsbruck, Austria to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie uses a {{combination}} of double-circuit three-level <b>pylons</b> and single-circuit delta <b>pylons</b> to suspend electrical conductors of other voltages, such as 315kV. The ±450kV high-voltage direct current line in Hydro-Québec's power grid uses a T-shaped tower, lattice or pole, to support two bundles of three conductors on each side. The direct current power line sometimes uses two poles or a wider, pyramidal, self-supporting lattice structure for angle towers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pylon</b> {{trailing}} edge blowing was investigated {{as a means}} of alleviating the effects of the <b>pylon</b> wake on a pusher arrangement of an advanced single-rotation turboprop. Measurements were made of steady-state propeller thrust and <b>pylon</b> wake pressures and turbulence levels with and without blowing. Results show that the <b>pylon</b> {{trailing edge}} blowing practically eliminated the <b>pylon</b> wake, significantly reduced the <b>pylon</b> wake turbulence, and had a relatively small effect on the steady-state propeller thrust. The data are presented with a minimum of analysis...|$|R
50|$|A branch <b>pylon</b> is used {{to start}} a line branch. The branch <b>pylon</b> is {{responsible}} for holding up both the main line {{and the start of}} the branch line. This makes a branch <b>pylon</b> also an anchor <b>pylon</b> since it must resist forces from both lines.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called <b>Pylons.</b> <b>Pylons</b> are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon {{is to provide a}} space in which the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. <b>Pylons</b> typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based <b>Pylons</b> also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term pylon derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar International had {{the unusual}} {{optional}} provision for overwing <b>pylons,</b> used for short-range air-to-air missiles, {{such as the}} Matra R550 Magic or the AIM-9 Sidewinder. This option frees up the under-wing <b>pylons</b> for other weapons and stores. RAF Jaguars gained overwing <b>pylons</b> in the buildup to Operation Granby in 1990, but French Jaguars were not modified. The RAF's Jaguar 97s were intended to be wired for the carriage of ASRAAMs on the overwing launchers, but clearance of this weapon was never completed because of funding cuts.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began {{to inspect the}} missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the <b>pylons</b> and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or cleared for removal. The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours to attach the <b>pylons,</b> the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|Following {{initiation}} {{into the}} Temple, a Setian can proceed along {{a series of}} six degrees, each of which requires greater responsibilities to the group; as a result, most members remain {{in the first two}} degrees. Governed by a high priest or high priestess and a wider Council of Nine, the Temple is also divided into groups known as <b>pylons,</b> through which Setians can meet or correspond in order to advance their magical work in a particular area. <b>Pylons</b> of the Temple are now present in the United States, Australia, and Europe, with estimates placing the Temple's membership between 200 and 500.|$|E
5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a solid rocket booster to get it up to speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing <b>pylons</b> that replaced the smaller <b>pylons</b> used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the <b>pylons.</b> The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E
5|$|Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie uses several {{different}} types of electricity <b>pylons</b> to support their 735kV power lines. All of them are single-circuit, meaning that each pylon carries one power line with three bundles of four electrical subconductors separated by spacers, with each bundle transmitting one phase of current.|$|E
40|$|Reconstructing {{three-dimensional}} {{model of the}} <b>pylon</b> from LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) point clouds automatically {{is one of the}} key techniques for facilities management GIS system of high-voltage nationwide transmission smart grid. This paper presents a model-driven three-dimensional <b>pylon</b> modeling (MD 3 DM) method using airborne LiDAR data. We start with constructing a parametric model of <b>pylon,</b> based on its actual structure and the characteristics of point clouds data. In this model, a <b>pylon</b> is divided into three parts: <b>pylon</b> legs, <b>pylon</b> body and <b>pylon</b> head. The modeling approach mainly consists of four steps. Firstly, point clouds of individual <b>pylon</b> are detected and segmented from massive high-voltage transmission corridor point clouds automatically. Secondly, an individual <b>pylon</b> is divided into three relatively simple parts in order to reconstruct different parts with different strategies. Its position and direction are extracted by contour analysis of the <b>pylon</b> body in this stage. Thirdly, the geometric features of the <b>pylon</b> head are extracted, from which the head type is derived with a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier. After that, the head is constructed by seeking corresponding model from pre-build model library. Finally, the body is modeled by fitting the point cloud to planes. Experiment results on several point clouds data sets from China Southern high-voltage nationwide transmission grid from Yunnan Province to Guangdong Province show that the proposed approach can achieve the goal of automatic {{three-dimensional model}}ing of the <b>pylon</b> effectively...|$|R

5|$|Supersonic {{short-range}} nuclear missiles: G and H {{models were}} modified {{to carry up}} to 20 SRAM missiles replacing existing gravity bombs. Eight SRAMs were carried internally on a special rotary launcher and 12 SRAMs were mounted on two wing <b>pylons.</b> With SRAM, the B-52s could strike heavily defended targets without entering the terminal defenses.|$|E
5|$|The twin <b>pylons</b> rise to {{a height}} 30metres above the memorial's stone platform; one bears the maple leaf for Canada and the other the fleur-de-lis for France, and both symbolize the unity and {{sacrifice}} of the two countries. At {{the top of the}} <b>pylons</b> is a grouping of figures known collectively as the Chorus. The most senior figures represent Justice and Peace; Peace stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. The pair is in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of Truth and Justice, located outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. The remainder of the Chorus is located directly below the senior figures: Faith, Hope and Truth on the eastern pylon; and Honour, Charity and Knowledge on the western pylon. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada's war dead in both French and English are located {{at the base of the}} <b>pylons.</b> The Spirit of Sacrifice is located at the base between the two <b>pylons.</b> In the display, a young dying soldier is gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. In a lightly veiled reference to the poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.|$|E
5|$|Those B-52Gs not {{converted}} as {{cruise missile}} carriers underwent {{a series of}} modifications to improve conventional bombing. They were fitted with a new Integrated Conventional Stores Management System (ICSMS) and new underwing <b>pylons</b> that could hold larger bombs or other stores than could the external <b>pylons.</b> Thirty B-52Gs were further modified to carry up to 12 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles each, while 12 B-52Gs were fitted to carry the AGM-142 Have Nap stand-off air-to-ground missile. When the B-52G was retired in 1994, an urgent scheme was launched to restore an interim Harpoon and Have Nap capability, the four aircraft being modified to carry Harpoon and four to carry Have Nap under the Rapid Eight program.|$|E

5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 on external <b>pylons</b> was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb's casing. WE.177A {{was limited to}} a maximum carriage time of five minutes at Mach 1.15 at low level on TSR-2, otherwise the bomb's temperature would rise above its permitted maximum. This would impose a severe operational restriction on TSR-2, as the aircraft was designed for M=1+ cruise at this height.|$|E
5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid. Examples include the strengthening of electrical <b>pylons</b> and power poles, and increasing the power supply. This was done to enable the utility to restore power more rapidly {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E
500|$|If a <b>pylon</b> is {{hit by the}} plane, it is {{designed}} to break apart, preventing it from harming the plane and pilot. The damaged parts of the <b>pylon</b> are replaced by course personnel nicknamed [...] "Air Gators". It usually takes a few minutes to replace a <b>pylon.</b> The record for the setup of a replacement <b>pylon</b> is 1 minute 30 seconds, set in 2007.|$|R
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the <b>pylon</b> attachment points revealed damage to the wing's <b>pylon</b> mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the <b>pylon</b> attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the <b>pylon</b> fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the <b>pylon</b> to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear <b>pylon</b> mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|R

5|$|Another modern {{development}} (in {{use in the}} Netherlands) is {{the creation}} of housing communities at the edges of wetlands with floating structures, restrained in position by vertical <b>pylons.</b> Such wetlands can then be used to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations, provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Temple had {{thirteen}} <b>pylons,</b> {{which were}} {{operating in the}} United States, Australia, Germany, and across Sweden and Finland.
