40|$|With radical {{roots in}} the 1980 s, women’s {{empowerment}} is now a mainstream development concern. Much of the narrative focuses on instrumental gains—what women can do for development rather than what development can do for women.

40|$|Background: Research {{ethics review}} {{practices}} vary considerably across countries and this variability poses {{a challenge for}} international research programmes. Although published guidelines exist, which describe underlying principles {{that should be considered}} and pragmatic approaches that could be followed in seeking ethics approval, most have roots in biomedical and clinical research. The result is that there is generally less clarity around institutional and/or country-level structures for ethics review of health policy and social sciences research. This is an important gap {{that needs to be addressed}} in order to ensure ethical practices in <b>multi-country</b> research <b>programmes.</b> Context and purpose: This paper explores research ethics requirements for a multicountry health policy research programme and provides recommendations based on experiences in seeking ethics approval. The context for this paper is a five-year, cross-country, European Commission-funded international programme: Research into Policy to enhance Physical Activity (REPOPA). Results: Ethics requirements and review processes for health policy and social sciences research varied considerably across the seven REPOPA countries. Specifically, requirements and infrastructure for ethics approval have been influenced by how the purpose and domain of health research are defined in legislation, what types of research have been most prominently funded, and international requirements for ethics approval by external funders and journal editors. Significance: <b>Multi-country</b> research <b>programmes</b> provide an opportunity to enhance and build transparent ethics review practices and to strengthen ethics review structures at all levels. Such programmes also enable reciprocal learning about relevant practices and processes for the ethical conduct of research.

40|$|Chagas disease, {{named after}} Carlos Chagas, who first {{described}} it in 1909, exists {{only on the}} American Continent. It {{is caused by a}} parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted to humans by blood-sucking triatomine bugs and via blood transfusion. Chagas disease has two successive phases: acute and chronic. The acute phase lasts six-eight weeks. Several years after entering the chronic phase, 20 - 35 % of infected individuals, depending on the geographical area, will develop irreversible lesions of the autonomous nervous system in the heart, oesophagus and colon, and of the peripheral nervous system. Data on the prevalence and distribution of Chagas disease improved in quality during the 1980 s {{as a result of the}} demographically representative cross-sectional studies in countries where accurate information was not previously available. A group of experts met in Brasilia in 1979 and devised standard protocols to carry out countrywide prevalence studies on human T. cruzi infection and triatomine house infestation. Thanks to a coordinated <b>multi-country</b> <b>programme</b> in the Southern Cone countries, the transmission of Chagas disease by vectors and via blood transfusion was interrupted in Uruguay in 1997, in Chile in 1999 and in Brazil in 2006; thus, the incidence of new infections by T. cruzi across the South American continent has decreased by 70 %. Similar multi-country initiatives have been launched in the Andean countries and in Central America and rapid progress has been reported towards the goal of interrupting the transmission of Chagas disease, as requested by a 1998 Resolution of the World Health Assembly. The cost-benefit analysis of investment in the vector control programme in Brazil indicates that there are savings of US$ 17 in medical care and disabilities for each dollar spent on prevention, showing that the programme is a health investment with very high return. Many well-known research institutions in Latin America were key elements of a worldwide network of laboratories that carried out basic and applied research supporting the planning and evaluation of national Chagas disease control programmes. The present article reviews the current epidemiological trends for Chagas disease in Latin America and the future challenges in terms of epidemiology, surveillance and health policy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{critically}} examines whether {{change to}} World Bank {{policy and practice}} under James Wolfensohn’s Presidency (1995 - 2005) is both substantive and real. The paper uses the Bank’s seminal HIV/AIDS project – the <b>Multi-Country</b> AIDS <b>Programme</b> (MAP) – {{as a case study}} in which to explore this issue. Based upon extensive PhD fieldwork into the MAP in East Africa, the paper utilises key elements of the Wolfensohn change agenda: government ownership, civil society organisation engagement and multi-agency working, to assess whether change is real or mere rhetoric. The paper explores these issues in the following ways. First, it provides a brief background to change in the Bank, before discussing what is meant by change in this context and the research basis of the paper. Second, the paper explores the evidence for change, focusing on civil society organisation engagement, government ownership and multi agency working in turn. Third, evidence to suggest that such change is not substantive and cannot be verified is discussed. The paper then draws such evidence together and offers some conclusions as to whether change is substantive, and why this matters. In so doing, the paper argues that despite efforts to the contrary, the complexities of change and the institutional mechanisms within both the Bank and borrower countries make change unsubstantive and unreal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Since the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, development assistance for HIV/AIDS has increasingly been provided through Global Health Initiatives, specifically the United States Presidential Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Global Fund to Fight HIV, TB and Malaria and the World Bank <b>Multi-country</b> AIDS <b>Programme.</b> Zambia, like many of the countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS in southern Africa, also faces a shortage of human resources for health. The country receives significant amounts of funding from GHIs for the large-scale provision of antiretroviral treatment through the public and private sector. This paper examines the impact of GHIs on human resources for ART roll-out in Zambia, at national level, in one province and two districts. Methods It is a qualitative policy analysis relying on in-depth interviews with more than 90 policy-makers and implementers at all levels. Results Findings show that while GHIs do not provide significant funding for additional human resources, their interventions have significant impact on human resources for health at all levels. While GHIs successfully retrain a large number of health workers, evidence suggests that GHIs actively deplete the pool of skilled human resources for health by recruiting public sector staff to work for GHI-funded nongovernmental implementing agencies. The secondment of GHI staff into public sector facilities may help alleviate immediate staff shortages, but this practice risks undermining sustainability of programmes. GHI-supported programmes and initiatives add significantly to the workload of existing public sector staff at all levels, while incentives including salary top-ups and overtime payments mean that ART programmes are more popular among staff than services for non-focal diseases. Conclusion Research findings suggest that GHIs need to actively mediate against the potentially negative consequences of their funding on human resources for health. Evidence presented highlights the need for new strategies that integrate retraining of existing staff with longer-term staff development to ensure staff retention. The study results show that GHIs must provide significant new and longer-term funding for additional human resources to avoid negative consequences on the overall provision of health care services and to ensure sustainability and quality of programmes they support. </p...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 118 - 127). In {{the face}} of rising morbidity and mortality due to HIV / AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, {{there has been an}} increasing pressure to provide life sustaining antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to countries in most urgent need of them. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) has been identified by policy-makers in Uganda as a potential programme aimed at mitigating the pervasive effect of HIV / AIDS on the social and economic life of the country. Since 2000, the country has shifted its focus from primarily HIV prevention to paying equal attention to care and treatment including ART. Provision of the ART programmes have been made possible through concerted efforts of international and national organizations such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), the World Bank, <b>Multi-country</b> AIDS <b>Programme</b> (MAP), Great Lakes Initiative on AIDS (GLIA), the USA President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), UN agencies, Bi-lateral and Government of Uganda inputs (UAC 2004). New and increased funding notwithstanding, the Ugandan population has continued to grow exponentially at a rate of 3. 5 % and even though the economy has been growing at a rate of 6 % per annum, there is a widening disparity in incomes attributed largely to high levels of unemployment in the country (Ministry of Finance 2002). These income disparities have also greatly contributed to health inequities in Uganda, thus affecting the equitable allocation of the limited health resources including ART. The main aim {{of the study was to}} establish the socioeconomic status of those individuals who benefit most from the provision of free ARV drugs and to explore factors that influence the distribution of such benefits. The study was carried out in Kampala district (Uganda's capital city) and Masaka district. The study employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. Facility-exit interviews with patients accessing free ARVs formed the quantitative method, while Focus Group discussions with community representatives and in-depth interviews with key informants formed the qualitative part of the study. Quantitative data was obtained by use of a questionnaire, which was structured to obtain information on socioeconomic characteristics, including asset possession as a measure of wealth. A principal component analysis was run for both the Uganda Demographic Health Survey (UDHS) and facility-exit asset data to determine utilization of ARV by wealth quintiles. A benefit incidence costing model was also employed to determine monetary benefit of free ARVs in Uganda...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} two objectives. The {{first is to}} discuss the {{experience}} of carrying out research in a village in Mali {{as part of a}} <b>multi-country,</b> comparative research <b>programme</b> on the theme of Sustainable Livelihoods. The second is to place that field-level experience in the broader context of the relationship between research and policy, particularly in terms of the exchange and flow of information between different stakeholders in the development policy process. The process of using the Sustainable Livelihoods framework for planning and implementing an enquiry, and analysing the information this generated, raised a range of questions. On one hand, there were methodological lessons and practical issues: {{what is the best way}} to represent complexity? how can the multiple views of different actor groups be incorporated into such a representation? how can such a learning process be effectively managed within the boundaries of available resources? On the other, there were more abstract considerations: what, and who, is this research for? How could this process of research best be transformed into something which usefully serves the needs of the poor, or supports environmentally sustainable practices? These reflections on how a particular piece of research was carried out resonated with some of the current debates about methodological complimentarity, incorporating the needs and perceptions of the poor into anti-poverty policies, and the centrality of institutions, both to livelihoods and policymaking. There is in turn a common thread in many of these debates: how to best occupy the space between top-down and bottom-up, between macro and micro. The framework for research and analysis described here provided opportunities to bridge this gap. 2 PART ONE...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MPhil) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A {{number of}} {{countries}} in sub-Saharan Africa are recipients of major international investments for HIV. Funding has required that different governance structures be established, {{with the creation of}} independent Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCM) for the oversight of Global Fund grants in country, and National AIDS Commissions (NAC) have been established as part of the World Bank <b>Multi-country</b> AIDS <b>Programme</b> (MAP) for coordination of national HIV efforts. In addition UNAIDS and SADC have endorsed the concept of one national coordinating authority. The NAC in Lesotho reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and its structure and function is governed by statute. The CCM has broad stakeholder representation and functioning is determined by Global Fund guidelines. The Global Fund is by far the largest donor to HIV programmes in Lesotho, with current potential funding amounting to USD 100 million. This study seeks to determine perceptions of members of the two HIV governance structures in Lesotho on their respective roles, reporting lines, responsibilities, levels of tension and integration of HIV in developmental agendas, through the administration of a pre-tested questionnaire to CCM members and NAC management in Lesotho. Lack of clarity on the roles and functions exists for both CCM and NAC, with each group more likely to consider their own body as being more representative and having a clear and defined mandate. Strong disagreement exists on the extent of NAC functions beyond the classic coordination, advocacy and communication role, with NAC viewing their role as extending into direct programme implementation and management of funds. While the National Composite Policy Index for Lesotho indicates inclusion of HIV in broad developmental and health agendas, there is little tangible evidence of this being practically implemented. The structure and functioning of both NAC and CCM largely limits the inclusion of HIV into national developmental programmes. While the status quo of NAC reporting to the Office of the Prime Minister is supported, NAC members were significantly more likely than their CCM counterparts to want CCM to report to them. Not surprisingly, levels of tension between these two bodies is demonstrated in this study. In spite of one-third of respondents desiring the creation of a single oversight body for HIV, this study argues for the maintenance of two structures but that NAC should limit itself to its original intended mandate of coordination, that practical interpretation of the universal NAC role of ”coordination” be developed, and that internal NAC performance measures be adopted which are subject to periodic external review. Furthermore CCMs should be formally established by Ministerial decree or proclamation, and each body should have formal representation of the other in their membership. Membership of both NAC and CCM should include non-HIV developmental role players in the country. CCMs must also systematically report on Global Fund activities to NAC, so that NAC can fulfil its coordination function. Improved reporting to the public by both bodies on summarised indicators via the media is also recommended.

40|$|Louk Box et. al. (2003) Review of Science and Technology {{plans in}} ACP countries, University of Maastricht, Maastricht. Chapter 4 & 5 : Discussion and Conclusions Discussion The {{present study was}} a first attempt to review both the {{national}} and regional plans of ACP countries and reports compiled by international and bilateral agencies with regard to S&T policies, particularly those related to agricultural development in ACP countries. Most bilateral donor agencies, such as DFID (UK), AFD (France), DGIS (the Netherlands) and USAID, have supported substantial S&T programmes in the past, particularly in agriculture (see reviews by Gaillard (2000)). It appears that no central data are being kept at this moment (as {{was done in the}} past by SPAAR or the FAO). Policy changes in the late 1990 s do not appear to have had an impact on policies in ACP countries in the period 2000 - 2002. It is also difficult to assess previous trends, because papers published before 2000 {{were not included in the}} present review. Based on the work by Idachaba (1991) it appears that funding for S&T programmes in the 1980 s declined in most ACP countries. Despite some notable exceptions - Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, and Trinidad and Tobago - the general picture appears one of continued government withdrawal of support for S&T, in particular in the agricultural sector. The rather naïve optimism of the international financial institutions in the 1980 s that the private sector would take over has not materialized in most ACP countries. Regional coordination and donor coordination do not appear to have improved. The reports examined date from 1998 to 2003 (with one exception). Most of them deal with technological innovation systems for agricultural development. Policy plans for ACP countries were reviewed on the basis of the Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) prepared under the Cotonou Agreement. Special attention was paid to studies on agricultural development compiled by agencies such as FARA and the CGIAR. Agriculture plays a minor role in S&T (mentioned in only 8 % of the CSPs), and in the national indicative plans (NIPs) (7 %). This means that agriculture is accorded fairly low priority in most ACP countries, despite its substantial contribution to these countries´ GDP. It was not possible to assess the extent of participation of representatives of the sector, particularly of farmers´ organizations, in the formulation of the policy documents. In some cases, this has occurred (when national policy dialogues have taken place), but it is not clear to what extent farmers´ priorities were transformed into national priorities. The participation of donors in the various plans and policies has been substantial, especially the following cases: The European Commission in the Cape Town Plan of Action: The Commission and the South African Ministry of Science and technology took the initiative in forging a consensus among the participants. Agriculture and agro-industry are key strategic areas. The European Commission through INCO: agriculture is included as one of the main themes, possibly to correct the low priority given to it by ACP governments. The World Bank has for a long time financed various organizations and programmes dealing with agricultural technology. FARA´s <b>Multi-Country</b> Agricultural Productivity <b>Programme</b> (MAPP) focuses on NARS, SROs, IARS and the CGIAR. NEPAD supports biotechnology through NGO cooperation and the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP). Country and regional plans, policies and studies: UNESCO Science Report: Africa (2002) : No specific reference to agriculture. Mugabe (2003) states that R&D in general has a low priority, but is increasing by means of funding. South Africa, Egypt and Zimbabwe are now encouraging biotechnology research. South Africa: role of agriculture in strategic S&T policy is decreasing. Ivory Coast: no agricultural policy indicated. Nigeria: no scientific policy so far. Tanzania has had an agricultural policy since 1989, including agricultural research and technology transfer. Cameroon has a stable research system, but it is defined by external relations and is facing practical problems. Burkina Faso has a well-elaborated science plan, but the system suffers from weak human and material resources. The UNESCO Science Report on Latin America and the Caribbean notes that LAC programmes such as CABBIO, CSST, INCO, COLCYT, and IICA have suffered a period of relative stagnation. CSST: in the strategy papers for the region, agriculture plays an important role. Guyana: agriculture is crucial in the national development plan. Vietnam: Agriculture plays a focal role in S&T policy plans. The participation of the S&T or agriculture sector in the preparation of the Cotonou Agreement varied considerable. In some cases, like Mauritius, the participation of the private sector has been structured. The CSPs generally do not include discussion of participatory methodologies. In a previous study (Demanding Innovation) the policy dialogues in the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Senegal, Uganda and Vietnam were rather uneven. Earlier inventories of S&T plans of ACP countries undertaken by relevant international agencies were as follows: Gaillard and Waast, funded by the European Commission and the French government. Idachaba through ISNAR and the African Academy of Sciences UNESCO Science Reports on Africa and on Latin America and the Caribbean. Policies and plans on biotechnology in Africa by Mugabe (2002 and 2003). Conclusions The main conclusions to be drawn from this survey of S&T policies in ACP countries are as follows: The Country Strategy Papers indicate that in the ACP countries themselves there is little or no priority for S&T. Agriculture and agricultural S&T do not have the priority that could be expected in view of the importance of agriculture in the economies of ACP countries. Agricultural research and technology development appears to have steadily declined over the 1980 s and 1990 s, reflecting the decreasing donor interest in this subsector. One may therefore wonder to what extent agricultural research and technology development is surviving as a global public good. Multilateral organizations and bilateral donor agencies were probably unable to maintain support for the subsector over the 1990 s, even though many initiatives have been launched. Major donors like the European Union and financial institutions such as the World Bank are likely to become ever more important in the rescue of agricultural research, through programmes like the 6 th Framework Programme (to support agricultural research) and FARA (to coordinate technology development in Africa). The implications for CTA can be summarized as follows: ACP countries themselves do not give priority to agricultural S&T. Any initiative designed to support S&T will need to address this reality. The EU is in a rapid process of change. The earlier emphasis on S&T for development has given way to other priorities, especially in DG Development. DG Research has made a valiant effort to rescue the INCO programme, although since 2000 funding has apparently not kept up with previous levels of support for ACP countries. In addition, development-oriented policies, such as those focusing on institutional capacity building, will need constant support in order to survive. In interviews for this study (not reported here), CTA was seen as a likely agency to take the initiative in this field, especially with regard to ACP interests. This means that CTA could assist in rebuilding constituencies for agricultural S&T, or for S&T policies in general, in ACP countries and in Europe. South Africa could be a good starting point; NEPAD might prove to be a good partner for Africa. The Caribbean Council for Science and Technology might be the partner in the Caribbean region; no suggestions can be made for the Pacific. Louk Box et. al.

Chapter 3. 2 : S&T and {{international}} development organizations European Commission In 2001, the Commission acknowledged {{the importance of}} Agricultural Research for Development (ARD), and adopted a strategy to promote the European Initiative for Agricultural Research for Development (EIARD) and the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), as well as regional research networks such as CORAF, ASARECA, SACCAR, CIRDES and ICIMOD (Vialatte, 2001). In 2002, {{this was followed by}} a strategy document ´Support to ARD at sub-regional level´ (Vialatte, 2002), which focused on NARS and on regional and international systems as well as research implementation. Organizations assumed to participate in this initiative are FARA, GFAR and the CGIAR. The CGIAR plays an important role due to its expertise and partnerships at regional and national levels (EC, 2000 a,b). In preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg in 2002, the ACP-EU Forum on Research for Sustainable development was held in Cape Town (EC, 2002 c; EU, 2002). The ministers discussed agriculture as one aspect of general environmental issues. Although no formal decision was taken, the conclusions of the Forum were included in the Cape Town Declaration (EC, 2002 a). Moreover, the ´Competitive Grant Scheme for Agricultural Research for Development in Sub-Saharan Africa´ identifies major challenges for the new Framework Programme (2002 - 2006) to establish an integrated European research area. At the end of the Forum, ACP and Commission officials issued the Cape Town Plan of Action (Bellemin, 2002; EC, 2002 b). This was a first step towards establishing an S&T dialogue within ACP countries, and to the further internationalization of European research aimed at global sustainable development. The Plan of Action defines strategic areas in the agricultural and agro-industrial sectors, with special attention to the relation between biotechnology, agro-industrial technologies and ICTs. The plan can be regarded as an interesting first attempt to formulate a coherent S&T policy {{within the framework of the}} Cotonou Agreement. No formal government commitments have yet been made, however. Such commitments are needed before effective research strategies can be developed at the ACP or EU levels. Such strategies could be linked to the activities undertaken under the Commission´s 6 th Framework Programme (EC, 2002 d, 2003). The linkage with the Framework Programme could help to improve coordination within the Commission. As long ago as 1996, the RAWOO (Advisory Council for Development Research) suggested that the Commission could build on the former INCO programme. It also stressed the need for closer coordination in the fields of agriculture and health, since the issues involved need to be dealt with in a multidisciplinary approach. The conclusion to be drawn from the various reports is that the Commission does have an instrument for S&T cooperation with ACP countries. Even though limited reference is made to S&T in the Country Strategy Papers, agricultural research programmes could undoubtedly benefit from support under the Framework Programme coordinated by DG Research. However, its procedures differ substantially from those under the Cotonou Agreement. World Bank Over the past 20 years the World Bank has financed many S&T projects, including support and loans to CGIAR, SPAAR, UN organizations, SIDA, IDRC, sub-Saharan agriculture and S&T capacity building (especially in agriculture; see Daly, 1999, 2000). Crawford and Brezenhoff (2001), however, concluded that over this period the World Bank has had no consistent approach or strategy in developing the scientific and technological capacities in client countries. They called for projects that would encourage greater cooperation among client countries. A first step should be to promote interaction among the Bank staff working on S&T issues. In 2002, however, the Bank issued a strategy paper that signified a change in its approach to S&T and development (World Bank, 2002). It established an internal S&T thematic group (which included representatives of the CGIAR) to raise awareness of S&T and its role in development, and to foster collaboration with a wide range of international partners such as OECD, UNESCO, and the Third World Academy of Sciences. The World Bank is currently redefining its strategy regarding S&T, aiming at better integration of the various actors. OECD The OECD has been at the forefront of S&T studies, although few of these documents were located. One exception was the ´OECD/DAC Donor-Developing Country Dialogues on National Strategies for Sustainable Development´, which deals with capacity building, planning and management in Tanzania, highlighting the role of village communities (OECD, 2001). However, neither S&T nor agriculture are referred to explicitly in the study. FARA The Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) is the successor to the World Bank´s Special Programme for African Agricultural Research (SPAAR). In 2002 FARA launched a <b>Multi-country</b> Agricultural Productivity <b>Programme</b> (MAPP) for Africa for the period 2003 - 2012 (FARA, 2002 b). The programme, developed by FARA and NEPAD, shows the need for national agricultural technology delivery systems (NATDS). The paper, however, focuses on programme development in countries that meet certain eligibility criteria, such as satisfactory macroeconomic conditions and sector policy support, an operational agricultural technology generation with transfer, and government commitment. FARA´s 2002 strategy document highlights the Forum´s support to NARS, SROs, IARS, the CGIAR and the private sector. FARA´s budget has been extended to 2012, and the forum is recruiting new staff (FARA, 2002 a). As one of the major coordinating bodies for agricultural research in Africa, FARA is a key agency. Through its relation with NEPAD, a link between agricultural S&T policies and general development policies could be made. NEPAD In its medium-term programme for 2003 - 2005, the New Partnership for Africa´s Development (NEPAD) intends to strengthen cooperation among NGOs, especially those focusing on biotechnology, ICTs and national innovation systems (NEPAD, 2002 b). This emphasis on NGO cooperation is novel for African governments and could represent an interesting opening for organizations such as CTA. NEPAD also stressed the benefits of voluntary participation and the corresponding contribution of governments. In 2003, NEPAD established the African Forum on Science and Technology for Development (AFSTD) to promote the application of S&T for economic growth and poverty reduction. The Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), launched by FAO and NEPAD (2002) for the period 2002 - 2015, identifies three areas for improvement (budget US$ 204. 5 billion) and, in the long term, agricultural research, technology dissemination and adoption, with a budget of US$ 136. 2 billion (NEPAD, 2002 a). Whereas NEPAD´s medium-term programme stresses voluntary participation, this could become an overall programme with significant budgets for agriculture and agricultural research. At a time when the funds for agricultural research are declining, the programme offers a sign of hope. UN According to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the UN is interested in setting up a global programme or New Partnership for Science and Technology and Society for Sustainable Development (UN, 2002). After the publication of the UNDP´s Human Development Report 2001, the UN´s emphasis on S&T indicates acceptance of this issue at the global level. As always, however, the issue of funding will first have to be resolved. Regional studies and plans AFRICA - General After decades of minimal interest, investment in S&T programmes appears to be increasing. UNESCO´s Science Report 2002 : Africa (Gaillard et al., 2002), for example, notes that during the 1990 s donors and developing country governments showed little interest in S&T for development, but the situation is now changing. The authors emphasize that Africa must devise long-term strategies to build the capacity of the continent´s scientific infrastructure, and to improve the conditions for scientists, such as by offering adequate salaries and reasonable career opportunities. In an unpublished document (2002), ISNAR describes the poor performance of the agricultural sector in Africa. This casts serious doubts on the effectiveness of African NARS, which need to become more demand-driven, responsive and client-oriented (Chema et al., 2002). In an exhaustive inventory of the biotechnology sector in Africa, Mugabe (2002) notes that activities are ongoing in only a few countries: Countries using third-generation techniques: Egypt, South Africa, Zimbabwe; Countries using third-generation techniques but that have not yet developed products/processes: Ghana, Kenya, Uganda; Countries engaged in second-generation technology: Tanzania, Zambia. South Africa is leading biotechnology research and development in Africa; Zimbabwe has made significant efforts to define targets for its biotechnology sector. Mugabe´s proposed research agenda has rekindled NEPAD´s interest in biotechnology. In the biotechnology sector, programmes and national policies in some countries appear to be improving. Sub-Saharan Africa More than a decade ago, in a study for the African Academy of Science, Idachaba (1991) urged producer and consumer groups to support the NARS in sub-Saharan Africa. While welcoming the World Bank´s SPAAR programme, he noted that it should not focus exclusively on governments, but also on the private sector. Donor agencies are evidently suffering from aid fatigue in their home countries, so that other sources of funding also need to be tapped. Idachaba´s report may reflect the|$|R
