500|$|The Eldredge and Gould {{paper was}} <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Annual</b> <b>Meeting</b> of the Geological Society of America in 1971. The {{symposium}} focused its attention on how modern microevolutionary studies could revitalize {{various aspects of}} paleontology and macroevolution. Tom Schopf, who organized that year's meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that [...] "Eldredge's 1971 publication [...] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly." [...] According to Gould [...] "the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term punctuated equilibrium and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould." [...] In his book Time Frames Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair [...] "each wrote roughly half. Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould's snails. Other parts are harder to reconstruct. Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency. We sent it in, and Schopf reacted strongly against it—thus signaling {{the tenor of the}} reaction it has engendered, though for shifting reasons, down to the present day." ...|$|E

In a regional nuclear conflict scenario where two opposing nations in the subtropics would each use 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear weapons (about 15 kiloton each) on major population centers, the researchers estimated as much as five million tons of soot would be released, which would produce a cooling of several degrees over large areas of North America and Eurasia, including most of the grain-growing regions. The cooling would last for years, and, according to the research, could be [...] "catastrophic".|$|E
