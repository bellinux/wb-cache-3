40|$|Concern {{regarding}} {{the potential for}} developmental health risks associated with certain chemicals (e. g., phthalates, antibacterials) used in personal care products is well documented; however, current exposure data for pregnant women are limited. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the pattern of <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> use in pregnancy and the post-partum period. Usage patterns of personal care products were collected at six different time points during pregnancy and once in the postpartum period for a cohort of 80 pregnant women in Ottawa, Canada. The pattern of use was then described and groups of <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> groups commonly used together were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis. The results showed that product use varied by income and country of birth. General hygiene products were the most commonly used products and were consistently used over time while cosmetic product use declined with advancing pregnancy and post-delivery. Hand soaps and baby products were reported as used more frequently after birth. This study is the first to track <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> use across pregnancy and into the postpartum period, and suggests that pregnant populations may be a unique group of <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> users.

40|$|Parabens, benzophenone- 3 and {{triclosan}} {{are common}} ingredients used as preservatives, ultraviolet radiation filters and antimicrobial agents, respectively. Human exposure occurs through consumption of processed food {{and use of}} cosmetics and consumer products. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide a preliminary characterisation of exposure to selected <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> chemicals in the general Australian population. De-identified urine specimens stratified by age and sex were obtained from a community-based pathology laboratory and pooled (n= 24 pools of 100). Concentrations of free and total (sum of free plus conjugated) species of methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl paraben, benzophenone- 3 and triclosan were quantified using isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry; with geometric means 232, 33. 5, 60. 6, 4. 32, 61. 5 and 87. 7 ng/mL, respectively. Age was inversely associated with paraben concentration, and females had concentrations approximately two times higher than males. Total paraben and benzophenone- 3 concentrations are significantly higher than reported worldwide, and the average triclosan concentration was more than one order of magnitude higher than in many other populations. This study provides the first data on exposure of the general Australian population to a range of common <b>personal</b> <b>care</b> <b>product</b> chemical ingredients, which appears to be prevalent and warrants further investigation.
