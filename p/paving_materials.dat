50|$|In France, Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet {{is widely}} {{credited}} with establishing the first scientific approach to road building {{about the year}} 1764. It involved a layer of large rocks, covered by a layer of smaller gravel. John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836) designed the first modern highways, and developed an inexpensive <b>paving</b> <b>material</b> of soil and stone aggregate known as macadam.|$|R

50|$|Kawasaki {{has also}} been {{developing}} systems that enable {{a wide range of}} municipal and industrial waste to be recovered, recycled and put to new use. Such systems include refuse paper and plastic fuel production facilities that convert wastepaper/plastics into an easy-to-handle solid fuel, equipment that converts old tires into highway <b>paving</b> <b>materials</b> and tiles, and machinery that sorts glass bottles by size and color.|$|E
50|$|Although some porous <b>paving</b> <b>materials</b> appear nearly {{indistinguishable from}} nonporous materials, their {{environmental}} effects are qualitatively different. Whether it is pervious concrete, porous asphalt, paving stones or concrete or plastic-based pavers, all these pervious materials allow stormwater to percolate and infiltrate the surface areas, traditionally {{impervious to the}} soil below. The goal is to control stormwater at the source, reduce runoff and improve water quality by filtering pollutants in the substrata layers.|$|E
5000|$|Asphaltenes are {{molecular}} {{substances that}} are found in crude oil, along with resins, aromatic hydrocarbons, and saturates (i.e. saturated hydrocarbons such as alkanes). The word [...] "asphaltene" [...] was coined by Boussingault in 1837 when {{he noticed that the}} distillation residue of some bitumens had asphalt-like properties. Asphaltenes in the form of asphalt or bitumen products from oil refineries are used as <b>paving</b> <b>materials</b> on roads, shingles for roofs, and waterproof coatings on building foundations.|$|E
40|$|In many {{tropical}} {{countries the}} temperate zone specification {{has been adopted}} for the selection of highway materials. However, in some tropical countries, many lateritic gravels have been successfully used in road pavements {{despite the fact that}} they do not comply with the temperate zone specification requirements for particle size distribution, plasticity characteristics, and sometimes CBR. A specification for the use of tropical soils in road pavements needs to be developed, based on the genesis of the soils and the climatic environment. The laboratory characteristics and performance as a <b>paving</b> <b>material,</b> of a lateritic soil developed on sandstone in south-east Queensland, Australia, has been investigated. Based on the important features of the lateritic soil and its good performance as a road pavement, a criterion suitable for the selection of lateritic soil developed on sandstone as a <b>paving</b> <b>material,</b> under similar climatic conditions to those prevailing in south-east Queensland, has been proposed...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first product}} {{introduced}} was a truck-bumper mounted permanent magnetic sweeper (trade name Power Bar) at Norton AFB in California. The product replaced its less efficient predecessor, the gas-powered electromagnetic sweeper, at over 90% of military airfields and many civilian airports. [...] The firm’s military customers requested help in clearing their airfields {{of more than}} just ferrous metal material. Sand, rocks, broken <b>paving</b> <b>materials</b> and non-ferrous work generated hardware presented a problem that conventional truck mounted vacuum sweepers and FOD walks were not thoroughly handling.|$|E

A variety of <b>paving</b> <b>materials</b> are used, including bricks, concrete slabs and concrete [...] "crazy paving." [...] Retaining walls reflect this pattern: log retaining walls and concrete stone pitching in southern parts give way to block walls in northern areas.|$|E
