40|$|Here, {{we present}} the synthesis, {{characterization}} and magnetic separation of magnetic polyorganosiloxane nanoparticles. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with average <b>particle</b> <b>radii</b> of 3. 2 nm had been synthesized {{by a simple}} coprecipitation process of iron(II) and iron(III) salt in basic solution. Afterwards, the particles were successfully incorporated into a polyorganosiloxane network via a polycondensation reaction of trimethoxymethylsilane (T), diethoxydimethylsilane (D) and the functional monomer (chloromethylphenyl) trimethoxysilane (ClBz-T) in aqueous dispersion. A coreshell system was chosen to increase {{the flexibility of the}} system concerning size, composition and functionalization possibilities. The magnetic nanocapsules with <b>particle</b> <b>radii</b> below 60 nm were separated from non-magnetic material with a high effectiveness by the use of commercially available separation columns which are commonly used for isolation of microbeads and subsequently characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF-FFF), superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and Mossbauer spectroscopy.

40|$|Abstract: The {{measurement}} of particle size using multiple, megahertz range acoustic frequencies {{has been focused}} on <b>particles</b> with <b>radii</b> of 50 μm- 150 μm. The present study seeks to extend the applicability of the technique to <b>particles</b> with <b>radii</b> ranging from 50 μm- 425 μm. A single acoustic transducer, transmitting a waveform with three peak frequencies, was used to measure backscatter from natural sand particles entrained in a turbulent jet. An approach similar to that taken by Sheng (1991) was used in the data processing, where particle size estimates were created by comparing theoretical ratios of the backscatter form factor and size density to measured ratios. It was found that the method produces 0. 1 %- 36 % error for <b>particles</b> with <b>radii</b> of 150 μm- 425 μm and 24 %- 160 % error for <b>particles</b> with <b>radii</b> of 75 μm- 150 μm, depending on the concentration of the suspended particles.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} model developed by McKay et al. (1989) {{to characterize the}} size distribution, thermal structure, and chemical composition of the stratospheric haze of Titan is applied to new 220 - 335 -nm albedo measurements obtained with the long-wavelength prime camera of the IUE during August 1987. Data and model predictions are presented in extensive graphs and discussed in detail. It is shown that a simple model with particles of one size at a given altitude does not accurately reproduce the observed features in all spectral regions, but that good general agreement is obtained using a model with a uniformly mixed layer at 150 - 600 km and a bimodal distribution of small 'polymer' haze <b>particles</b> (<b>radius</b> less than 20 nm) and larger haze <b>particles</b> (<b>radius</b> 100 - 500 nm). The number densities implied by this model require, however, a mechanism such as electrostatic charging or reaction kinetics to inhibit coagulation of the smaller particles...|$|R
40|$|Two laser {{diagnostic}} {{techniques were}} used to measure soot volume fractions, number densities and soot <b>particle</b> <b>radii</b> in premixed propane/oxygen flat flames. The two techniques used were two wavelength extinction, using 514. 5 nm to 632. 8 nm and 457. 9 nm to 632. 8 nm wavelength combinations, and extinction/scattering using 514. 5 nm light. The flames were fuel-rich (equivalence ratios from 2. 1 to 2. 8) and had cold gas velocities varying from 3. 4 to 5. 5 cm/s. Measurements were made at various heights above the sintered-bronze, water-cooled flat flame burner with the equivalence ratio and cold gas velocity fixed. Also, measurements were made at a fixed height above the burner and fixed cold gas velocity while varying the equivalence ratio. Both laser techniques {{are based on the}} same underlying assumptions of particle size distribution and soot optical properties. Full Mie theory was used to determine the extinction coefficients K sub ext, and the scattering efficiencies, Q sub vv. Temperature measurements in the flames were made using infrared radiometry. Good agreement between the two techniques in terms of soot <b>particle</b> <b>radii,</b> number density and volume fraction was found for intensity ratios (I/I sub o) between 0. 1 and 0. 8. For intensity ratios higher or lower than this range, the differences in extinction coefficients at the wavelengths chosen for the two-wavelength method are too small to give accurate results for comparing <b>particle</b> <b>radii</b> and number densities. However, when comparing only soot volume fractions, the agreement between the two techniques continued to be good for intensity ratios up to 0. 95...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} recent data on graphitic cloud {{particles}} in the atmosphere of Titan to compute the electrical charging of the <b>particles</b> (<b>radii</b> ranging from 0. 01 microns to 0. 26 microns). The charging on the nightside was rather similar to that obtained earlier except that charge distributions on the particles are now computed and recently obtained cloud particle sizes and density distributions were employed. The negative charge on particles of 0. 26 microns peaked at 9 at 150 km altitude. The computations were repeated for the dayside {{with the addition of}} photoelectron emission by the particles {{as a result of the}} absorption of solar UV radiation. Particles (except the very smallest) now became positively charged with <b>particles</b> of <b>radius</b> 0. 26 microns being charged up to + 47. Next, very small <b>particles</b> (<b>radii</b> approx. 3 x 10 (sup - 4) microns) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were introduced and treated as sources of negative ions since they could be either neutral or carry one negative charge. Moreover, they are mobile so that they had to be treated like molecular size negative ions although much more massive. They had the effect of substantially reducing the electron densities in the altitude range 190 to 310 km to values less than the negative PAH densities and increasing the peak electron charge on the larger <b>particles.</b> <b>Particles</b> of <b>radius</b> 0. 26 microns bore peak charges of approx. + 47 at altitudes of approx. 250 km.
