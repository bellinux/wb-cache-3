5|$|The U.S. had granted full de jure {{recognition}} to all three Baltic states by July 1922. The recognitions were granted during the shift from the Democratic administration of Woodrow Wilson to the Republican administration of Warren Harding. While the U.S. did not sponsor any meaningful <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> initiatives in the region during the interwar period, and its administrations did not consider the states strategically important, it maintained normal diplomatic relations with the states.|$|E
5|$|In Algeria, the Muslims {{were not}} {{considered}} French and did not share the same <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, {{they were required to}} renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.|$|E

5|$|Poison was {{discovered}} in ancient times, and was used by ancient tribes and civilizations as a hunting tool to quicken and ensure {{the death of their}} prey or enemies. This use of poison grew more advanced, and many of these ancient peoples began forging weapons designed specifically for poison enhancement. Later in history, particularly {{at the time of the}} Roman Empire, one of the more prevalent uses was assassination. As early as 331 BC, poisonings executed at the dinner table or in drinks were reported, and the practice became a common occurrence. The use of fatal substances was seen among every social class; even the nobility would often use it to dispose of unwanted <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> opponents.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} viewed {{events in}} Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in the Soviet Union as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the democratic reform that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country {{could lead to}} the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well. Economically, the Soviet Union heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic,</b> in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets {{for such a long time}} that breaking away completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{diplomatic}} efforts removed the extermination of political groups from the United Nations Convention on Genocide.

Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the coins}} issued by any state have always {{reflected}} the current <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> situation. Many ancient and pre-modern coins certainly commemorate events in contemporary times. For instance, Roman coins often have references to military campaigns and {{the defeat of}} foreign powers. These reverse types often symbolically represent the subordination of recently conquered territories to Roman authority. Such coins are examples of ancient political propaganda. The Roman Empire may be represented by a proud warrior 'raising' an undersized figure, representing the defeated enemy.|$|E
25|$|Though Hitler hated Jewish {{people and}} wanted them {{expelled}} from Germany, in 1933 the Nazis were {{not willing to}} let {{a large number of}} Jewish refugees flee to the surrounding nations. This was because Reich officials were concerned that fleeing Jewish refugees would lend large numbers to a growing international movement for the economic boycott of Germany. Adding to Hitler's worries, German financial advisers warned the Nazi government that a mass exodus of Jewish laborers from the German workforce would badly damage Germany's economic stability. The Nazis needed a convenient solution to rid themselves of Jews without a <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> backlash.|$|E
25|$|Surrey {{had little}} <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> {{significance}} in the Middle Ages. It was not the main power-base of any important aristocratic family, nor the seat of a bishopric. Its agricultural wealth was limited by the infertility of most of its soils, while urban development, excepting the London suburb of Southwark, was sapped by the overshadowing predominance of London and {{by the lack of}} direct access to the sea. Population pressure in the 12th and 13th centuries initiated the gradual clearing of the Weald, the forest spanning the borders of Surrey, Sussex and Kent, which had hitherto been left undeveloped due to the difficulty of farming on its heavy clay soil.|$|E

25|$|Whilst some Australians {{view the}} Eureka Flag {{as a symbol}} of {{nationality}} (see Australian flag debate), it is more often employed by historical societies and re-enactors and by political radicals as a general purpose symbol of protest {{for a wide variety of}} anti-establishment non-conformist causes. The flag has been used {{as a symbol of}} rebellion by groups on both sides of the political spectrum, from left-wing trade unions such as the CFMEU and ETU to white nationalist group National Action and other neo-Nazis, who began to use it in the 1980s. Depending on their political persuasion, they see it as representative of the efforts of the miners to free themselves from <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> oppression, and by white supremacists at flashpoints for racial confrontation. Along these lines, some also believe that the flag used during the Lambing Flat riots was a derivative of the Eureka Flag.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of his {{philosophy}} is a view of humanity as greater than the contexts in which it is placed. He sees each individual possessed of the capability to rise to a greater life. At the root of his social thought is the conviction that the world is made and imagined. His work begins from the premise that no natural social, <b>political,</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> arrangements underlie individual or social activity. Property rights, liberal democracy, wage labor—for Unger, these are all historical artifacts that have no necessary relation to the goals of free and prosperous human activity. For Unger, the market, the state, and human social organization should not be set in predetermined institutional arrangements, but need to be left open to experimentation and revision according to what works for the project of individual and collective empowerment. Doing so, he holds, will enable human liberation.|$|E
25|$|In {{occupied}} Poland, {{there was}} no official collaboration at either the <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> level. At {{an early stage of}} the war, the imprisoned former prime minister of Poland, Wincenty Witos, was offered by the Germans to lead a collaborationist government, but declined; and so did Prince Janusz Radziwiłł. Andrzej Świetlicki of the National Radical Camp Falanga and Professor Władysław Studnicki unsuccessfully sought official collaboration; they were rebuffed by Nazi German leaders. The occupying powers intended permanent elimination of Polish governing structures and ruling elites and therefore did not seek this kind of cooperation. The Poles were not given positions of authority. The vast majority of the prewar citizenry collaborating with the Nazis came from the German minority in Poland, the members of which were offered several classes of the German Volksdeutsche ID. During the war, there were about 3 million former Polish citizens of German origin who signed the official Deutsche Volksliste.|$|E

25|$|The {{risk for}} supply interruptions {{aimed at the}} states of the Former Soviet Union is present today. Depending on {{bilateral}} relations and the present context, the risk for partial and/or short-duration cut-offs is high. Since 1991, the energy lever has been used for putting <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> pressure on Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia that subsequently affected most of Europe. The number of incidents, i.e. cut-offs, take-overs, coercive price policy, blackmail or threats, is over fifty in total (of which about forty are cut-offs). Incidents appear to be equally divided between the Yeltsin and Putin eras, but the number of cut-offs has decreased by half during Putin. The immediate reasons for Russia’s coercive policy appear to be political concession in ongoing negotiations, infrastructure take-over, and execution of economically favorable deals or to make political statements. There are economic underpinnings in the majority of the cases and Russian demands for payments of debts are legitimate. However, there are also political underpinnings in {{more than half of the}} incidents, and in a few cases explicit political demands are evident.|$|E
500|$|In 1836 Balzac {{took the}} helm of the Chronique de Paris, a weekly {{magazine}} of society and politics. He tried to enforce strict impartiality in its pages and a reasoned assessment of various ideologies. As Rogers notes, [...] "Balzac was interested in any social, <b>political,</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> theory, whether from the right or the left." [...] The magazine failed, but in July 1840 he founded another publication, the Revue Parisienne. It produced three issues.|$|E
500|$|While {{some of the}} {{ideologies}} of self-government espoused by the comuneros seem to prefigure later democratic uprisings against Spanish colonial rule, especially among the rural branch of the revolt, historians Adalberto López and James Schofield Saeger caution that giving this apparent resemblance too much weight would be a mistake. [...] According to Saegar, the revolt was much closer to traditions of the 16th and 17th centuries and [...] "was principally a local uprising led by local vested interest groups and unrelated to the important changes in the Spanish empire beginning in the 18th century." [...] It had {{little in common with}} the Revolt of the Comuneros of New Granada or the Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II that occurred in the 1780s. [...] López agrees that the Revolt of the Comuneros was not a [...] "true revolution" [...] that aimed at fundamental change in Paraguay; most of the Paraguayans saw themselves as loyal servants of the Crown and were not attempting to fundamentally change the <b>political</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> structure of the province. [...] Rather, they were attempting to assert control over the Jesuits, who were seen as undermining the province and exacerbating its poverty.|$|E
