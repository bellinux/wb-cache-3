5|$|The History of British Political <b>Parties</b> <b>is</b> a {{comprehensive}} work which lists and describes over 250 {{political parties in}} the United Kingdom that have participated in parliamentary elections since 1832. Entries are organised alphabetically, and most descriptions of the political parties span a few paragraphs or pages. Space is allotted to each entry based on the individual party's history and influence; 34 pages are devoted to the Conservative Party, whereas only two paragraphs are given to the Captain Beany's New Millennium Bean Party.|$|E
5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even {{if he or she is}} not an elected member of parliament. The leader of the party with the second-most seats in the House becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition, and debate (formally called Oral Questions) between the <b>parties</b> <b>is</b> presided over by the Speaker of the House. When the party with the most seats has less than half of the total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by the other parties. The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa. The current assembly is the first session of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, since the confederation of Canada in 1867.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the <b>parties</b> <b>is</b> crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E

5|$|The History of British Political Parties, also {{referred}} to as Politico's Guide to the History of British Political <b>Parties,</b> <b>is</b> a reference book about political parties in the United Kingdom. Written by David Boothroyd, it was published in 2001 by Politico's Publishing Ltd and distributed in the United States by International Specialized Book Services (ISBS). At the time of the book's publication, Boothroyd worked as a researcher with Parliamentary Monitoring Services. The book contains entries on over 250 UK political parties that have participated in parliamentary elections. It is structured alphabetically by entry, with the size of each entry relative to the history and influence of the individual political party. Boothroyd includes information about the history and election statistics of each party, as well as a brief narrative. He focuses on the Conservative, Liberal, and Labour parties; the parties with the most significant histories in British politics.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these <b>parties</b> <b>is</b> very difficult. It is almost certain that this account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, in another place in that account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Châteauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was really one of their leaders, then his relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio {{is also likely to}} have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial party, on the contrary, could not have had more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E

5000|$|For connection-oriented {{communication}}s, communication parties {{usually have}} different roles. One <b>party</b> <b>is</b> usually waiting for incoming connections; this <b>party</b> <b>is</b> usually {{referred to as}} [...] "server". Another <b>party</b> <b>is</b> the one which initiates connection; this <b>party</b> <b>is</b> usually referred to as [...] "client".|$|R

25|$|Two {{days later}} at the CIA headquarters, Palmer Smith, Osbourne's former superior, and his {{director}} learn that information from Osbourne {{has been given to}} the Russian Embassy.

25|$|In October 2006, it was {{announced}} that the issue was scheduled to be presented to the parliament for a vote in spring 2007.

25|$|An {{interesting}} feature, {{compared to}} other Danish <b>parties,</b> <b>is</b> that the Danish People's Party is usually underrepresented by about 1-1.5% in opinion polls. Election researchers {{have suggested that the}} party's voters may be less interested in politics, and therefore declining to talk to pollsters, or that voters are reluctant to reveal their support for the party to pollsters.|$|E

25|$|A thought {{experiment}} {{about public}} policy, on national radio, {{should not have}} received the condemnations it has. Anyone paying attention to this debate should be offended {{by those who have}} selectively quoted me, distorted my meaning, and taken out of context the dialog I engaged in this week. Such distortions from 'leaders' of organizations and <b>parties</b> <b>is</b> a disgrace not only to the organizations and institutions they serve, but to the First Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Specialized {{types of}} {{trademark}} include certification marks, collective trademarks and defensive trademarks. A trademark which is popularly {{used to describe}} a product or service (rather than to distinguish the product or services from those of third <b>parties)</b> <b>is</b> sometimes known as a genericized trademark. If such a mark becomes synonymous with that product or service {{to the extent that}} the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights, the mark becomes generic.|$|E
25|$|Since 1979, {{when the}} drive to {{establish}} a functioning legal system began, more than 300 laws and regulations, {{most of them in}} the economic area, have been promulgated. The use of mediation committees, informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the <b>parties,</b> <b>is</b> one innovative device. More than 800,000 such committees operate - in both rural and urban areas.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} period {{permitted by}} law {{runs from the}} date of nomination day until polling day. Campaigning amongst opposition <b>parties</b> <b>is</b> often hampered {{by a lack of}} access to government-controlled media. Prior to the 1999 general election, opposition parties were given a brief period of airtime on the public Radio Television Malaysia (RTM) radio stations to broadcast their manifestoes. However, the government announced a change of policy in 1999, insisting that as RTM was government-owned, preference would be given to government parties.|$|E
25|$|Sign {{language}} {{interpretation services}} via VRS or by VRI {{are useful in}} the present-day {{where one of the}} <b>parties</b> <b>is</b> deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired (mute). In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as French Sign Language (LSF) to spoken French, Spanish Sign Language (LSE) to spoken Spanish, British Sign Language (BSL) to spoken English, and American Sign Language (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct to each other), and so on.|$|E
25|$|Several {{parties and}} {{organizations}} in Indonesia are linked {{or at least}} inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood, although none has a formal relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood. One of the Muslim Brotherhood linked <b>Parties</b> <b>is</b> PKS (Prosperous Justice Party) with 6.79% of votes based on the Indonesian legislative election, 2014, down from 7.88% in the Indonesian legislative election, 2009. The PKS relationship with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood was confirmed by Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent Muslim Brotherhood leader.
