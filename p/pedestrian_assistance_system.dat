40|$|Pedestrians are {{vulnerable}} to accidents and are at risk whenever they share road space with vehicular traffic. The risk to pedestrians is especially high in countries like India where {{a large number of}} pedestrians are seen on roads with vehicular traffic not yielding to their needs. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} many of the victims of road accidents in India, particularly in urban areas, are pedestrians. One of the primary reasons for accidents at pedestrian crossing (when drivers do not yield to pedestrians) lies in the inability of pedestrians to judge the safe gap while crossing a road. Often pedestrians are in a state of confusion/dilemma while making a decision on whether to accept or reject a gap. Under these circumstances, decision making for pedestrians during road crossing is a tough task. This paper aims at analyzing and quantifying the dilemma zone for crossing pedestrians at high-speed uncontrolled midblock crossings. A field study was undertaken in which crossing pedestrians and through-moving vehicles were recorded by placing video cameras at selected midblock road sections, having marked pedestrian crossing. Total of 1107 pedestrian lags/gaps were extracted and studied with consideration of both temporal and spatial lags/gaps for analysis. Dilemma zone was determined by using different methods such as the gap cumulative distribution method, the binary logit method, the support vector machine and the probabilistic method. For the selected midblock sections, dilemma zone started at 49 m and ended at 62 m upstream from the marked pedestrian crossing. The upper and lower boundaries of dilemma zone can be further used to develop a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> at midblock crossing for the safe movement of pedestrian.

40|$|Driver {{drowsiness}} is {{a common}} cause of fatal traffic accidents. In this study, a driver <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> with a dual control scheme is developed; it attempts to perform simultaneously the safety control of the vehicle and identification of the driver 2 ̆ 7 s state. The <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> implements partial control {{in the event of}} lane departure and gives the driver the chance to voluntarily take the action needed. If the driver fails to implement the steering action needed within a limited time, the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> judges that “the driver 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the given situation is incorrect” and executes the remaining control. We used a driving simulator equipped with the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> to investigate the effectiveness of identifying driver drowsiness and preventing lane departure accidents. Twenty students participated in three trials on a straight expressway, and they were required to implement only lateral control. We hypothesized that a participant cannot implement the action needed to maintain safety when he/she falls asleep, and that in such a case, the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> will implement the safety control repeatedly. The <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> assisted the participants only when almost really needed, such as when their eyelids were closed. The results validated the hypothesis, showing that the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> implemented the safety control repeatedly when a participant fell asleep. In addition, the algorithms used by the <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> to determine whether the driver can continue driving were evaluated through a leave-one-out cross-validation, and they were proven to be effective for identifying driver drowsiness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Advanced driver <b>assistance</b> <b>systems</b> are {{designed}} to make driving easier that is, to alleviate the driver’s workload, and to increase traffic safety. However, traffic safety is affected by negative behavioral adaptation, meaning that drivers tend to increase speed and pay less attention to driving when supported by an advanced <b>assistance</b> <b>system.</b> We relate behavioral adaptation to reinforcement learning at a subconscious level, and propose that driver assistance is dynamically varied within predetermined safety limits. The aim of employing a dynamic assistance policy is to prevent the driver from noticing a constant improvement in vehicle handling. We conclude by describing ongoing work for empirically evaluating an improved lane departure warning system that uses a dynamic assistance policy.

40|$|In recent years, ITS {{projects}} in Japan, Europe and the US have {{been characterized by}} {{a strong emphasis on}} safe driver <b>assistance</b> <b>systems</b> designed to prevent traffic accidents. As it has become clear that eradicating accidents will be impossible by means of vehicle passive safety and single-vehicle active safety efforts alone, research and development of systems for preventing accidents through road-vehicle cooperation and vehicle-vehicle cooperation have been promoted in Japan (ASV, AHS), Europe (PReVENT, SAFESPOT) and the US (VII). The key to such technology is road-to-vehicle communications and inter-vehicle communications. On the other hand, a number of driver <b>assistance</b> <b>systems</b> have been brought to market, including lidar-based forward collision warnings, ACC, lane keeping support and drowsiness warnings, but their penetration rates in Japan are extremely low.
