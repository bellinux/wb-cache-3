Site staff did not have control over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning {{that they did not have}} enough information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of <b>process</b> <b>safety.</b>|$|E

25|$|Product {{and process}} design can be largely {{improved}} using modern modeling, simulation and optimization techniques. The key question in optimal design {{is the measure}} of what is good or desirable about a design. Before looking for optimal designs {{it is important to}} identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. A good design typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, <b>process</b> <b>safety,</b> operation time etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.|$|E

2500|$|Citing {{conditions}} {{similar to}} those that resulted in the 2005 Texas City Refinery explosion, on 25 April 2006, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined BP more than $2.4 million for unsafe operations at the company's Oregon, Ohio refinery. [...] An OSHA inspection resulted in 32 per-instance willful citations including locating people in vulnerable buildings among the processing units, failing to correct de-pressurization deficiencies and deficiencies with gas monitors, and failing to prevent the use of non-approved electrical equipment in locations in which hazardous concentrations of flammable gases or vapors may exist. [...] BP was further fined for neglecting to develop shutdown procedures and designate responsibilities and to establish a system to promptly address and resolve recommendations made after an incident when a large feed pump failed three years prior to 2006. [...] Penalties were also issued for five serious violations, including failure to develop operating procedures for a unit that removes sulfur compound; failure to ensure that operating procedures reflect current operating practice in the Isocracker Unit; failure to resolve process hazard analysis recommendations; failure to resolve <b>process</b> <b>safety</b> management compliance audit items in a timely manner; and failure to periodically inspect pressure piping systems.|$|E

40|$|As safety professionals, we {{strive to}} {{implement}} a robust <b>safety</b> <b>process</b> in our organizations to maximize worker protection. We sell our philosophy and ideas to senior management, and then work with line management and the work force {{to develop and implement}} the <b>safety</b> <b>process.</b> Through this effort, we are likely to accomplish two major objectives. First, we obtain buy-in from line management and the workers, maybe even ownership for the <b>safety</b> <b>process</b> we implement. Second, we increase the likelihood that the hazards (and necessary controls) associated with the work activities performed by our workforce are identified and addressed by the <b>safety</b> <b>process</b> we implement. Our ambition is to maximize safety and health in the work place, and prevent injuries. Realizing this goal improves overall business operations. Petersen suggests an accident is an indication of something wrong in the management system (Petersen, pg 15). Successful organizations operate with the <b>safety</b> <b>process</b> fully integrated into the management system. If the management system fails, the <b>safety</b> <b>process</b> has failed the worker. As safety professionals, we must ask ourselves whether we did our job adequately. The better organizations strive for continuous improvement. The overall success of <b>safety</b> <b>processes,</b> in terms of accident and injury prevention has improved since safety professionals have learned to involve line management and the workers in the process. Although we maintain the label of 'safety expert', our role has shifted somewhat to that of a 'facilitator' in the process. The role of the safety professional is to advise and counsel line management (Kohn & Ferry, pg 28). Line management owns safety! If you subscribe to this philosophy, our role of advisor to line management makes perfect sense. Most safety professionals no longer operate as the 'safety cop'. That role belongs to line management. Instead, our role falls into the category of 'oversight' or facilitator. We observe systems, processes and work activities, and then convey our findings and observations to line management. We advise them with regard to what they need to do, and then we help them find workable methods to implement those solutions. Line management owns the responsibility to implement the process and to monitor safety on a daily basis. Safety professionals advocate <b>safety</b> and facilitate <b>process</b> implementation. We help line management meet their responsibilities with regard to safety. Maximizing safety performance is achieved by maximizing the <b>safety</b> <b>process.</b> Robust <b>safety</b> <b>processes</b> serve as the model and are earmarked by vigorous support of both labor and management. Where a robust <b>safety</b> <b>process</b> exists, the <b>safety</b> professional enjoys interest and support on the part of management and workers. People are motivated to achieve success and willingly accept their roles and responsibilities. Work activities are appropriately planned. Hazards are identified and controlled to safeguard the worker. Work activities are reviewed on a regular basis to avoid the process becoming stale. Goals are established and communicated and serve as a basis on which performance can be measured. People throughout the organization understand their role and responsibilities and are accountable for meeting them...|$|R
