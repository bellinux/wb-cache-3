2500|$|General {{medicine}} {{education in}} Iran takes 7 to 7.5 years. Students enter the university after high school. Students study basic medical science (such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, histology, biophysics, embryology, etc.) for 2.5 years. At {{the end of}} this period they should pass a [...] "basic science" [...] exam. Those who passed the exam will move on to study <b>physiopathology</b> of different organs in the next 1.5 years. The organ-based learning approach emphasizes critical thinking and clinical application. In the next period of education students enter clinics and educational hospitals for two years. During this period, they will also learn practical skills such as history taking and physical examination. Students should then pass the [...] "pre-internship" [...] exam to enter the last 1.5 years of education in which medical students function as interns. During this period, medical students participate in all aspects of medical care of the patients and they take night calls. At the end of these 7.5 years students are awarded an M.D degree. M.D doctors can continue their educations through residency and fellowship.|$|E

50|$|Pathophysiology or <b>physiopathology</b> is a {{convergence}} of pathology with physiology. Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state, whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Pathology describes the abnormal or undesired condition, whereas pathophysiology seeks to explain the physiological processes or mechanisms whereby such condition develops and progresses.|$|E

50|$|According {{to studies}} HAIR-AN {{is to be}} found in 1% to 3% women {{possessing}} hyperandrogenism. It is an established concept in <b>physiopathology</b> that the androgen in the female body is produced by the stromal ovarian cells, when stimulated by the LH and HCG. The observed activity of these cells was elevated by insulin, and later was found to be used as a determining element to find how severe the hirsutism was. Physicians must look for obesity, as it is also a diagnostic factor in many possible cases.|$|E
50|$|As a physician, Kuczborski was a {{pulmonary}} and physiatric consultant. His {{career was}} mainly associated with Łódź; only after from 1952 to 1955, did he reside in Warsaw {{serving as the}} deputy director of the Tuberculosis Institute in Warsaw. Kuczborski held posts as director of several hospitals in Łódź. He also established a laboratory of <b>physiopathology</b> of breathing, the first in the Łódź region {{and one of the first}} in Poland. He also was the director of the Lung Disease Hospital in Łagiewniki until he retired in 1977.|$|E
5000|$|A {{first step}} in the {{understanding}} of the <b>physiopathology</b> of Pasqualini syndrome was the absence of Lutheinizing Hormone (LH) in plasma and urine of patients. The second breakthrough was the functional and genetic studies that validated the hypothesis of a functional deficit of LH in these men. Inactivating LH mutations will then also be described in some women. Different groups [...] demonstrated in these cases a LH with varying degrees of immunological activity but biologically inactive in most of the patients, due to one or more inactivating mutations in the LHB gene. Finally, the full comprehension of Pasqualini syndrome allowed to reverse the hypoandrogenic phenotype and to restore fertility in these patients through the use of chorionic gonadotropin and the modern in-vitro fertility techniques ...|$|E

A third area of research covers topics in immunity and infection. The IFR on Cell Communication & Regulation on the [...] "Cordeliers" [...] campus specializes in the field of cell biology, nutrition and immunology. Finally, an IFR for integrated biology on the Jussieu campus focuses on the integrated study of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in development, reproduction, and the major physiological functions of animal and plant organisms, and their evolution.|$|E
5000|$|... (The {{authors of}} this {{exceptional}} book have dedicated {{a significant part of}} their medical life to the study of circulation and of venous pressure. The notion that veins do not behave as rigid tubes but as eminently collapsible tubes suffering from the process of collapse in different situations depending on local conditions and on the position of the body, although perceived by LOWER in 1669 and studied by HOLT in 1941, needed to be categorically demonstrated so that it could establish itself definitely. (...) Conclusively, this book is an outstanding contribution to the rational knowledge of venous pressure physiology and <b>physiopathology</b> and an indispensable contribution to an adequate understanding of semiological findings in normal and sick humans. For this reason, its conclusions are of eminent clinical application and they will allow the physician a correct evaluation of his findings, many times, even without making use of any specific instruments.) ...|$|E

Prevention is a primary goal (see ICTweb pages). Since {{the creation of the}} ICT, its members (more than 110 from 46 countries) have regularly gathered and worked together during meetings held every 4 years : the International Conferences on Trichinellosis. These conferences were held in Warsaw in 1960, in Wrocław in 1964, in Miami beach in 1972, in Poznań in 1976, in Noordwijk aan Zee, Netherlands in 1980, in Val Morin in 1984, in Alicante in 1988, in Orvieto in 1993, in Mexico City in 1996, in Fontainebleau in 2000, in San Diego in 2004 and in the Plitvice national Park in 2007.

5000|$|An AF-Nest or Atrial Fibrillation Nest (AFN) is a locus or {{cluster in}} the atrial wall with {{distinct}} electrical features and properties originated by fibrillar myocardium. It plays as an [...] "electrical multiplier" [...] re-feeding the atrial fibrillation. One of the currently existing techniques to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) {{is based on}} thermo-coagulation of AFN. They are typically numerous at the pulmonary veins antrum. Several evidences {{have shown that the}} AFNs represent the true substrate of the AF. A large number of congenital and acquired conditions may cause this type of myocardium. The higher the number of AFNs the easer the initiation and the longer the AF maintenance. Despite being fundamental in the AF <b>physiopathology</b> the long-lasting AF depends on additional factors. The most important is the [...] "Background Tachycardia" [...] (BKT) which is a focal reentrant tachycardia caused by “Fractal Micro-Reentry”. This special tachycardia exists even during AF, keeping the AFNs in a high frequency activation. This tachycardia has a unique mechanism of [...] "protection" [...] that prevents it from being reverted by the large amount of surrounding stimuli generated by the AF itself.|$|E
50|$|Artificial liver {{support systems}} are aimed to {{temporally}} replace native liver detoxification functions {{and they use}} albumin as scavenger molecule to clear the toxins involved in the <b>physiopathology</b> of the failing liver. Most of the toxins that accumulate in the plasma of patients with liver insufficiency are protein bound, and therefore conventional renal dialysis techniques, such as hemofiltration, hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration {{are not able to}} adequately eliminate them.Between the different albumin dialysis modalities, single pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) has shown some positive results at a very high cost; it has been proposed that lowering the concentration of albumin in the dialysate does not seem to affect the detoxification capability of the procedure. Nevertheless, the most widely used systems today are based on hemodialysis and adsorption. These systems use conventional dialysis methods with an albumin containing dialysate that is latter regenerate by means of adsorption columns, filled with activated charcoal and ion exchange resins. At present, there are two artificial extracorporeal liver support systems: the Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS)10 from Gambro and Fractionated Plasma Separation and Adsorption (FPSA), commercialised as Prometheus (PROM) from Fresenius Medical Care.13 Of the two therapies, MARS is the most frequently studied, and clinically used system to date.|$|E
