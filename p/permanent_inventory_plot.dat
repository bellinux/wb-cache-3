40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{reaction}} of soil environment to a violent deforestation resulting from a wind storm. As a material, <b>permanent</b> <b>inventory</b> <b>plot</b> located in Training Forest Enterprise Masaryk Forest Křtiny was selected. The plot represents beech high forest, where soil was sampled from four types of sample plots: (1) maternal forest representing situation before the storm; (2) zone of transition from the maternal forest to the open area; (3) reafforested clearing; (4) natural evolution. From each sample plot type, 6 mixed samples of Ah horizon were analysed to assess N-ammonium (N-NH 4 +) and N-nitrates (NO 3 −) content and respiration activity. The results show {{a significant difference between}} the respiration activities of the particular sample plots, as well as a significant difference in the content of N-ammonium and N-nitrate forms, the maternal forest representing a site of the lowest biological (and respiration) activity on the one hand, and, on the other hand, site of high N-ammonium and low N-nitrate content, respectively. From the results, intensive nitrification caused by the deforestation is evident. The results are to be used as a starting level for a long-term observation of reaction of the forest beech ecosystem to deforestation and selected types of forest management...|$|E
40|$|Bioclimate {{envelope}} {{models have}} been widely used to illustrate the discrepancy between current species distributions and their potential habitat under climate change. However, the realism and correct interpretation of such projections {{has been the subject of}} considerable discussion. Here, we investigate whether climate suitability predictions correlate to tree growth, measured in <b>permanent</b> <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> and inferred from tree-ring records. We use the ensemble classifier RandomForest and species occurrence data from ~ 200, 000 <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> to build species distribution models for four important European forestry species: Norway spruce, Scots pine, European beech, and pedunculate oak. We then correlate climate-based habitat suitability with volume measurements from ~ 50 -year-old stands, available from ~ 11, 000 <b>inventory</b> <b>plots.</b> Secondly, habitat projections based on annual historical climate are compared with ring width from ~ 300 tree-ring chronologies. Our working hypothesis is that habitat suitability projections from species distribution models should to some degree be associated with temporal or spatial variation in these growth records. We find that the habitat projections are uncorrelated with spatial growth records (<b>inventory</b> <b>plot</b> data), but they do predict interannual variation in tree-ring width, with an average correlation of. 22. Correlation coefficients for individual chronologies range from values as high as. 82 or as low as −. 31. We conclude that tree responses to projected climate change are highly site-specific and that local suitability of a species for reforestation is difficult to predict. That said, projected increase or decrease in climatic suitability may be interpreted as an average expectation of increased or reduced growth over larger geographic scales. <br/...|$|R

Ten-year increments of diameter and basal area were calculated from measurements in 1977 - 1987. Severity of dwarf mistletoe was scored using the six-class system. Severity and duration of defoliation were determined from aerial maps drawn over a 20 -yr period. Dwarf mistletoe significantly decreased 10 -yr diameter increment. Western spruce budworm significantly reduced diameter increment and basal area increment. No significant interactions between defoliation and dwarf mistletoe were found. Ten-year mortality of Douglas-fir due to dwarf mistletoe averaged 5 % and 2 % of the infected trees and basal area, respectively, for stands with moderate dwarf mistletoe severity and 4 % and 3 % of the infected trees and basal area, respectively, for stands with severe dwarf mistletoe infestation. Mortality was highest in stands with the most dwarf mistletoe and in stands with the most severe defoliation. There {{were no significant differences}} in diameters of dead trees among severity classes for dwarf mistletoe.

40|$|Dead {{standing}} trees (“stags ” in Australia) {{are critical}} for wildlife in forests throughout the world. Dynamics of stag recruitment and retention are an interaction of tree mortality, size, deterioration rate, human intervention, and variables related to the structure and physiognomy of the forest. Historically in Australia and elsewhere, timber management involved the removal of stags and resulted in additional stags being lost to fire and wind at greater rates than under “natural ” conditions. The current status of stags and {{the relative importance of}} live versus dead trees to arboreal mammals were investigated on <b>permanent</b> <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> throughout southeast Queensland, Australia. Hollow development was correlated with rates of wood decay and time since death. Density of hollow-bearing trees was 10. 2 + 0. 2 stems per hectare (mean + SE); approximately 50 percent of the hollow-bearing trees were stags. Proportion of standing dead versus live trees was about 1 : 30. However, dead versus live tree use by arboreals was difficult to determine. Longevity of all stags was estimated to be 50 to 100 years. Although live hollow-bearing trees are more important to hollow-using wildlife in Australia, stags may provide a significant additional hollow resource in managed stands. Adequate densities and distribution of both live hollow-bearing trees and stags are extremely important to forest wildlife communities in both Australia and North America...|$|R
40|$|Hawaiian hardwood, Acacia koa. Stocking {{relationships}} {{are an important}} tool for foresters because they provide a means for evaluating how effectively the trees in a stand use available growing space. While stocking guidelines are not available for many tropical tree species, readily obtained measurements of stem and crown diameters {{can be used to}} develop preliminary stocking guidelines for most tree species. We demonstrate this approach for the endemic Hawaiian hardwood, Acacia koa, a species of major ecological and economic value in Hawaii. Using data from repeated censuses of multiple sites, we evaluated the influence of site quality and stand age on stocking guidelines for A. koa. Our results demonstrated that A. koa required less canopy space for a given dbh on moist windward sites than on drier leeward sites. In addition, we showed that on the windward sites A. koa required relatively less crown space with increasing tree size, whereas on the leeward site the opposite pattern was found. Size-density data from <b>permanent</b> <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> at the leeward study site showed excellent correspondence with the stocking guideline derived from the stem-crown diameter allometry. These stocking guidelines can be used to guide the establishment of new A. koa stands or to develop thinning regimes where information from spacing and thinning trials is not available and until better information is available.

40|$|We {{developed}} an individual-based stochastic-empirical model {{to simulate the}} carbon dynamics of live and dead trees in a Central Amazon forest near Manaus, Brazil. The model is based on analyses of extensive field studies carried out on <b>permanent</b> forest <b>inventory</b> <b>plots,</b> and syntheses of published studies. New analyses included: (1) growth suppression of small trees, (2) maximum size (trunk base diameter) for 220 tree species, (3) the relationship between growth rate and wood density, and (4) the growth response of surviving trees to catastrophic mortality (from logging). The model simulates a forest <b>inventory</b> <b>plot,</b> and tracks recruitment, growth, and mortality of live trees, decomposition of dead trees (coarse litter), and how these processes vary with changing environmental conditions. Model predictions were tested against aggregated field data, and also compared with independent measurements including maximum tree age and coarse litter standing stocks. Spatial analyses demonstrated that a plot size of ∼ 10 ha was required to accurately measure wood (live and dead) carbon balance. With the model accurately predicting relevant pools and fluxes, a number of model experiments were performed to predict forest carbon balance response to perturbations including: (1) increased productivity due to CO 2 fertilization, (2) a single semi-catastrophic (10 %) mortality event, (3) increased recruitment and mortality (turnover) rates, and (4) the combined effects of increased turnover, increased tree growth rates, and decreased mean wood density of new recruits. Results demonstrated that carbon accumulation {{over the past few}} decades observed on tropical forest <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> (∼ 0. 5 Mg C ha - 1 year - 1) is not likely caused by CO 2 fertilization. A maximum 25 % increase in woody tissue productivity with a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 only resulted in an accumulation rate of 0. 05 Mg C ha - 1 year - 1 for the period 1980 - 2020 for a Central Amazon forest, or an order of magnitude less than observed on the <b>inventory</b> <b>plots.</b> In contrast, model parameterization based on extensive data from a logging experiment demonstrated a rapid increase in tree growth following disturbance, which could be misinterpreted as carbon sequestration if changes in coarse litter stocks were not considered. Combined results demonstrated that predictions of changes in forest carbon balance during the twenty-first century are highly dependent on assumptions of tree response to various perturbations, and underscores the importance of a close coupling of model and field investigations. © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R

Do soil conditions and land-use history explain the variation in vegetation dynamics? Is there evidence for alternative stable states? Location: NOrholm hede, a 350 -ha heathland in southwest Denmark that was abandoned in 1895 and left to develop naturally via succession. Methods: <b>Permanent</b> vegetation <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> were established and have been revisited 11 times between 1921 and 2012. Soil conditions were recorded in 2012. We used clustering, linear mixed models, linear models, ANOVA and multivariate techniques (redundancy analysis and principal response curves) to investigate changes in the plant community and how differences in plant community composition related to soil conditions and disturbance history. Results: Ericaceous dwarf shrubs dominated most of the heathland initially. A dominance shift from dwarf shrubs to grasses occurred on about half of the plots. The other half of the plots remained dominated by dwarf shrubs, although Empetrum nigrum expanded at the expense of Calluna vulgaris. Lichen cover decreased dramatically across all plots. The divergent successional pattern was not explained by nutrient concentrations. Grasses mainly expanded in areas where they already had a substantial presence, and this initial presence was largely correlated with historical soil disturbance. Plots where dwarf shrubs remained dominant had a relatively thick O-horizon. Conclusions: Vegetation dynamics during heathland succession were not deterministically determined by soil conditions. Grass and tree expansion occurred slowly and dwarf shrub dominance was stable for more than 100 yr on large parts of the heath, even {{in the absence of}} management.

All the effects of grazing on grazed grasslands are not elucidated yet. This thesis focused mainly on the contribution of zoochory to restoration of species rich grasslands on stands cleared from Robinia pseudoacacia and stands cleared from Prunus spinosa brushwood.

Germinating experiments proved soil seed bank being mainly the image of aboveground vegetation with minor importance to restoration of species rich grasslands.

Comparing monocultures to the two-species mixed stands showed lower productivity for the two-species plots, as explained by others (Binkley 1984; Chen and Klinka 2003), possibly due to the more efficient use of resources by the highly productive monocultures. For more than two tree species, a positive biodiversity–productivity relationship appeared.

It is well documented that the pre-European inhabitants of Amazonia actively transformed and modified the forest in many regions before their population collapse around 1491 AD; however, the impacts of these ancient disturbances remain entirely unaccounted for in the many highly influential studies using Amazonian forest plots. Here we examine whether Amazonian forest <b>inventory</b> <b>plot</b> locations are spatially biased toward areas with high probability of ancient human impacts.

Furthermore, regions of the Amazon that are relatively oversampled with <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> also contain the highest values of predicted ancient human impacts. Given the long lifespan of Amazonian trees, many forest inventory and recensus sites may still be recovering from past disturbances, potentially skewing our interpretations of forest dynamics and our understanding of how these forests are responding to global change.

Tree communities of white-sand forests show a higher floristic similarity and lower diversity than those of terra-firme forests.

Through a combination of variable topography and a complex disturbance history (Trofymow et al. 2008), the EC flux-tower sites possess fine-scale spatial variation in forest structure, thus presenting {{a challenge to the}} interpretation of EC flux data (Schmid and Lloyd 1999; Göckede et al. 2004).

By excluding plots that a) were without merchantable timber {{at the time of}} NFI 2002, b) experienced a change in land use (e.g. plot covered by forest at NFI 2002 but converted into urban or agricultural land at NFI 2012), and c) that were not accessible at both <b>inventory</b> dates, 12.918 <b>plots</b> or 98.6 % of all sampled forest plots remained for this analysis.|$|R
30|$|This {{paper is}} entirely {{concerned}} with sampling {{at a fixed}} point in time. The need to measure changes over time, for example to estimate growth rates, requires a sample {{which is designed to}} be efficient for this purpose. In most population surveys changes over time are best estimated by keeping the sampling units constant or at least maximising the degree of overlap between successive surveys (see for example Cochran 1977). However, some degree of rotation is usually required to remove sampling units that are no longer representative, or for other reasons (such as harvesting). In repeated surveys {{it will be necessary to}} replace some of the initial plots when management or environmental changes have had an adverse impact on the <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> and/or changes occur within the plantation such as the establishment of new compartments. If the initial sample was efficient in terms of estimating the initial population, then it is likely that it will also be efficient in terms of estimating changes over time, provided plot rotation is employed when it becomes necessary. It will be necessary to revisit <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> periodically, both to measure allometric changes and to recalibrate the regression models. However, the use of LiDAR data for survey design should result in a reduced number of <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> and also inform the plot selection process when older plots need to be rotated out of the survey and replaced by newer ones. It will also be necessary to obtain updated LiDAR data as the current data becomes obsolete however the exact requirements in this respect are still to be determined (see for example Junttila et al. 2010).|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} shown that site mean annual {{temperature}} and soil nitrogen fertility are important environmental drivers of variation in stem wood density of Douglas-fir in New Zealand. The new wood density model {{has been linked to}} the Forest Carbon Predictor, which uses site mean annual temperature, soil nitrogen fertility data, and tree measurements from national <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> to improve the accuracy of carbon stock estimates for New Zealand’s planted forest estate.|$|R
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple system of di®erential equations {{was used for}} predicting growth of eucalypt coppice stands. Only limited, low quality data was available, from small continuous forest <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> not originally designed for growth modelling. Therefore, biological principles and growth patterns observed elsewhere were used to constrain model form. The di®erential equations used are analytically integrable, facilitating usage and estimation. Similar models and techniques {{may be useful in}} other data-poor situations...|$|R
40|$|Quantification of the downed woody {{materials}} that comprise forest fuels has gained importance in Caribbean forest ecosystems {{due to the}} increasing incidence and severity of wildfires on island ecosystems. Because large-scale assessments of forest fuels have rarely been conducted for these ecosystems, forest fuels were assessed at 121 US Department of Agriculture forest service <b>inventory</b> <b>plots</b> on Puerto Rico, Vieques, and the US Virgin Islands. Results indicated that fuel loading...|$|R
