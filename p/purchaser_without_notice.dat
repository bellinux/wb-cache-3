50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{a package of}} reforms were made to {{register}} land in England and Wales to make conveyancing cheaper and simpler, and free land to the market. The main legislation was the Land Registration Act 1925, the Law of Property Act 1925, the Trustee Act 1925, and the Settled Land Act 1925. However, much land was to remain unregistered. Instead, for that land not yet registered, people could choose to explicitly register interests under the Land Charges Act 1925, and so get better protection than the common law might provide against a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> of any equitable interest sought to be protected. In 1972, this Act was updated into the present scheme.|$|E

5000|$|Before the {{equitable}} {{claim was}} made, bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> intervened, giving 3rd party an equitable interest in land.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{conflict}} of opinion between Lord Westbury and Lord St Leonards concerning {{the availability of the}} defence of <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> in the case of competing equitable interests. Lord St Leonards maintained that the defence was always available.|$|R
25|$|Floating charges {{take effect}} in equity only, and {{consequently}} are defeated by {{a bona fide}} <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> of any asset covered by them. In practice, as the chargor has power to dispose of assets subject to a floating charge, so this is only of consequence in relation to disposals that occur after the charge has crystallised.|$|R
50|$|If a {{life tenant}} purports to {{transfer}} the underlying 'reversionary' interest, which a life tenant never has, this constitutes an actionable breach of trust for damages and may constitute criminal fraud however may not entitle the ultimate reversioner (or substituted beneficiaries) {{to be able to}} obtain a court declaration that the property is their own if that property {{is in the hands of}} an innocent <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> (bona fide <b>purchaser).</b>|$|R
50|$|The defence of <b>purchaser</b> {{for value}} <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> of a prior {{equitable}} interest cannot be generally maintained {{but it does}} appear that it has always been allowed to prevail where the person entitled to the earlier interest required the assistance of a court of equity to remove an impediment to his title as a preliminary to asserting his interest. It is because a plaintiff in such cases will be denied the assistance of the court to remove the impediment to his title.|$|R
50|$|Mr Walker's {{claim was}} upheld {{by both the}} High Court, and the Court of Appeal of New Zealand. The Frazers appealed his claim to {{ownership}} to the farm to the Privy Council, where the earlier decisions were upheld. The Privy Council ruled that while the legal interest in the land may have been originally obtained by fraud, because Mr Walker was unaware of any fraud {{at the time of}} purchase (a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice,</b> under section 183 of the Land Transfer Act), meant that he had indefeasible title to the farm.|$|R
5000|$|Mr Caldwell owned a Jaguar. A rogue called Mr Norris {{convinced}} him to sell it for a £965 cheque and a £10 deposit. On January 13 {{when he tried to}} cash the cheque it was dishonoured. Mr Caldwell told the police and the Automobile Association straight away. Mr Norris sold the car to some dealers, who sold it on, and it was sold on again and again to Car and Universal Finance Ltd. They bought the car in good faith <b>without</b> any <b>notice.</b> The question was whether Caldwell had validly rescinded before the car was acquired by a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice?</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Formally where {{a system}} is derived from English law, the law divides into common law and {{equitable}} law [...] - [...] at their cores the formal title and further overarching rules (especially as to trust interests such as this). The latter cannot usually defeat a claim to title from a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice,</b> as such a person has reasonably researched the ownership position based upon the legal title (common law) position. As {{the owner of a}} legal interest, in the US, further embedded or legal interests consistent with the form of ownership can be created from life estates.|$|R
5000|$|BFPs {{are also}} {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "equitys darling". However, as Jeffrey Hackney has pointed out, the title is somewhat misleading; in cases where legal title is passed to a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice,</b> {{it is not so much}} that equity has any great affection for the purchaser - it is simply that equity refuses to intervene to preserve any rights held by the former beneficial owner of the property. The relationship between the courts of equity and the BFP are better characterised as benign neglect. However, equity still undoubtedly recognises the right of the beneficial owner to claim against the former legal owner where the sale was improper.|$|R
5000|$|Equitable {{principles}} {{can also}} limit {{the granting of}} equitable remedies. This includes [...] "he who comes to equity must come with clean hands" [...] (i.e. the court will not assist a claimant who is himself in the wrong or acting for improper motives), laches (equitable remedies will not be granted if the claimant has delayed unduly in seeking them), [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer" [...] (meaning that a person cannot litigate against a settlor without providing the appropriate consideration e.g. Money) and that equitable remedies will not normally be granted where damages would be an adequate remedy. The most important limitation relating to equitable remedies is that an equitable remedy will not lie against a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice.</b>|$|R
2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, negotiable instruments, uncalled shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide <b>purchasers</b> <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|R
5000|$|It may however {{be that a}} {{contractual}} document {{has failed}} to adequately reflect {{the intentions of the}} parties, in which case they can ask the court to [...] "rectify" [...] the agreement (i.e. pretend the words written down were different and give an order accordingly). Asking a court to rectify a document does not mean asking for the contract to be changed. It just asks for the recording of the document to be changed. Rectification is an equitable discretionary remedy, and therefore unavailable to claimants who delay excessively and it has no effect against a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice.</b> There is a fine line between interpretation and rectification, since evidence assisting in interpretation is also evidence which can give rise to rectification. Claimants can ask for both.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1925 {{registered}} {{titles in}} England and Wales preferably should, but mostly do not, reveal an 'interest for life', 'life estate' or 'life tenancy' {{in the form}} of a restriction on the register. Instead the registered legal owner may hold various degrees of leasehold or freehold interest, but usually absolute interest. This provides a reliable 'mirror of title' which can only be subjected to a very few overriding interests. A maxim of equity is 'Where equities are equal, the law will prevail'. Equity defers to the position at law of a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> (including any tenant or mortgagee), and as 'equity will not suffer a wrong to be without remedy,' where there is such, will be limited to in personam remedies against the settlor or life tenant where it confirms life estates, upon trust, to have been validly created: ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{bona fide}} {{purchaser}} (BFP)referred to more completely as a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> is a term used predominantly in common law jurisdictions in the law of real property and personal property to refer to an innocent party who purchases property <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> of any other partys claim to the title of that property. A BFP must purchase for value, meaning {{that he or she}} must pay for the property rather than simply be the beneficiary of a gift. Even when a party fraudulently conveys property to a BFP (for example, by selling to the BFP property that has already been conveyed to someone else), that BFP will, depending on the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, take good (valid) title to the property despite the competing claims of the other party. As such, recording ones interest protects an owner from losing that interest to a subsequent buyer who qualifies as a BFP. Moreover, some jurisdictions (so-called [...] "race-notice" [...] jurisdictions) require the BFP himself or herself to record in order to enforce his or her rights. In any case, parties with a claim to ownership in the property will retain a cause of action (a right to sue) against the party who made the fraudulent conveyance.|$|R

2500|$|Were {{the issue}} treated {{as one of}} {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation, the simple equitable principle to be applied {{would be that the}} contract is voidable unless third party rights have intervened. The defrauded party (Alice, in the example) has a right to rescind the contract, until the point where Claire's rights had intervened. Claire could be considered a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> for value <b>without</b> <b>notice</b> of any pre-existing interest, and should take full title to the property. This was essentially the approach advocated in Lewis v Averay. However, it is not the stance English law is currently taking. In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson the House of Lords by three to two decided to uphold an older line of authority which declares a contract void from the start. If there was never any contract between the seller and the fraudster, the fraudster cannot sell any property right to the third party, because they never had a good property right in the first place. This follows the Latin maxim, nemo dat quod non habet, that one cannot give what one does not have. So the present law is that if a person deals with another by distance (and not face to face, in which case there is deemed to be no [...] "mistake" [...] about identity), that person's presumed identity is recorded in a document, {{and it turns out that}} that person is in fact an uncreditworthy [...] "rogue" [...] then the third party cannot acquire good title and the good must be returned to the original person who is defrauded. The minority of the House of Lords (Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett) preferred to follow Lewis v Averay, which is in line with the law across Europe, in the United States and most of the rest of the world.|$|R
