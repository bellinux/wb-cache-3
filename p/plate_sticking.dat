50|$|In {{scientific}} literature, porous {{glass is}} a porous material containing approximately 96% silica, which {{is produced by}} an acidic extraction or a combined acidic and alkaline extraction respectively, of phase separated alkali borosilicate glasses, and features a three-dimensional interconnected porous microstructure. For commercially available porous glasses, the terms porous VYCOR-Glass (PVG) and Controlled Pore Glass (CPG) are used. The pore structure is formed by a syndetic channel system and has a specific surface from 10 to 300 m²/g. Porous glasses can be generated by an acidic extraction of phase separated alkaliborosilica glasses, or by a sol-gel-process. By regulating the manufacturing parameters, {{it is possible to}} produce a porous glass with a pore size of between 0.4 and 1000 nm in a very narrow pore size distribution. You can generate various moulds, for example, irregular particles (powder, granulate), spheres, <b>plates,</b> <b>sticks,</b> fibers, ultra thin membranes, tubes and rings.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to deal with multi-physics {{simulation}} of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based on an advanced numerical methodology. MEMS are very small devices in which electric as well as mechanical and fluid phenomena appear and interact. Because of their microscopic scale, strong coupling effects arise between the different physical fields, and some forces, which were negligible at macroscopic scale, have to be taken into account. In order to accurately design such micro-electro-mechanical systems, it is of primary importance to be able to handle the strong coupling between the electric and the mechanical fields. In this paper, the finite element method (FEM) is used to model the electro-mechanical interactions and to perform static and transient analyses. The application example considered here is a micro-bridge consisting in a clamped-clamped beam suspended over a substrate (the lower electrode). When a voltage is applied between the beam and the substrate, electrostatic forces appear which force the beam to bend. When the applied voltage increases, the electrostatic force becomes dominant and the <b>plates</b> <b>stick</b> together. The corresponding critical voltage is called the pull-in voltage.

40|$|Combining DNA origami with {{solid-state}} nanopores {{has been}} gaining an increasing amount of attention due to its potential for biosensing applications. Accordingly, origami plate dockings onto conventional solid-state silicon nitride pores with membranes of ? 20 nm thick were previously studied. Here, we examine whether graphene, with its single layer of carbon atoms, poses advantages over silicon-nitride pores. The conductance blockades due to origami plate dockings were characterized {{as a function of}} salt concentration and applied bias voltage and compared to the silicon-nitride data. As expected, it was found that conductance blockades increase with salt concentration and voltage. The relative conductance drop in graphene was however found to be similar to that for silicon nitride pores, whereas theory predicts that the blockade signal is larger in graphene pores. We have further compared the root-mean-squared noise levels of the ionic current through hybrid graphene-origami pores and bare pores, and found that the noise in the hybrid pores was slightly higher than in the bare pore current. Finally, it was tested whether the <b>plates</b> <b>stick</b> to the graphene pore in presence of EDTA. This was done by docking the plates and subjecting them to a negative ramping voltage.

40|$|MEMS {{are very}} small devices in which {{electric}} as well as mechanical dynamics phenomena appear. Because of the microscopic scale, some strong coupling effects between the different physical fields appear, and some forces, which are negligible at macroscopic scales, {{have to be taken}} into account. In order to make a good design of these micro-systems, it is important to analyse the coupling between the electrical and mechanical fields. This paper concerns the modelling of the strong electromechanical coupling appearing in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). The finite element method (FEM) is used to perform dynamical analysis taking into account large mesh displacements. Analysing the vibration of microsystems is a fundamental issues in the design of a broad range of sensors and actuators. The state of the art currently consists in using staggered procedures to compute quasi-static configurations based on the iteration between a structural model loaded by electrostatic forces and an electrostatic model defined on a domain following the deformation of the structure. Staggered iteration then leads to a static equilibrium position. Performing a perturbation analysis around the static equilibrium yields the electromechanical linearized stiffness needed for computing the eigenfrequencies. Obviously, performing the perturbation analysis to evaluate the tangent stiffness for every degree of freedom leads to very high computing costs and therefore onlythe tangent stiffness associated with presumed modes (typically some purely structural modes) are computed. Such a procedure can lead to important inaccuracies for designs where the electrostatic coupling is not quasi-uniform. In our work, we have developed a fully coupled electro-mechanical formulation that allows to find static equilibrium positions in a non-staggered way and which provides fully consistent tangent stiffness matrices for vibration analysis. The efficiency of the approach will be illustrated on modes of micro-electromechanical devices. The results obtained indicate that using this approach pull-in can be computed very accurately and at low computational cost. Also the coupled electromechanical modes obtained in the vicinity of equilibrium positions can be significantly different from the approximations obtained using a structural reduction at forehand. Numerical results are checked against analytical results where appropriate. The formulation developed for the strongly coupled electromechanical problem allows consistent vibration analysis of the system and yields more accurate vibration eigenmodes and frequencies than the classical staggered approaches. A second interest of the coupled tangent matrix is the computation of the dynamical behaviour of the coupled problem when we apply suddenly a voltage to the electrodes. Even under the pull-in voltage, the overshoot of the dynamical response may reduce the distance between the plate so that the electric force becomes dominant and the <b>plates</b> <b>stick</b> together. This phenomenon is called the dynamical pull-in. We will also treat it in this research...|$|R

A TMV mutant with a cysteine residue exposed on every coat protein (CP) subunit (TMVCys) enabled the coupling of bifunctional maleimide-polyethylene glycol (PEG) -biotin linkers (TMVCys/Bio). Its surface was equipped with two streptavidin [SA]-conjugated enzymes: glucose oxidase ([SA]-GOx) and horseradish peroxidase ([SA]-HRP). At least 50 % of the CPs were decorated with a linker molecule, and all thereof with active enzymes. Upon use as adapter scaffolds in conventional 'high-binding' microtiter <b>plates,</b> TMV <b>sticks</b> allowed the immobilization of up to 45 -fold higher catalytic activities than control samples with the same input of enzymes.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} mechanical escapement {{from about}} 1275) was the verge escapement, {{also known as}} the crown-wheel escapement. It was used in the first mechanical clocks and was originally controlled by a foliot, a horizontal bar with weights at either end. The escapement consists of an escape wheel shaped somewhat like a crown, with pointed teeth sticking axially out of the side, oriented horizontally. In front of the crown wheel is a vertical shaft, attached to the foliot at the top, and which carries two metal <b>plates</b> (pallets) <b>sticking</b> out like flags from a flag pole, oriented about ninety degrees apart, so only one engages the crown wheel teeth at a time. As the wheel turns, one tooth pushes against the upper pallet, rotating the shaft and the attached foliot. As the tooth pushes past the upper pallet, the lower pallet swings into the path of the teeth {{on the other side of}} the wheel. A tooth catches on the lower pallet, rotating the shaft back the other way, and the cycle repeats. A disadvantage of the escapement was that each time a tooth lands on a pallet, the momentum of the foliot pushes the crown wheel backwards a short distance before the force of the wheel reverses the motion. This is called [...] "recoil" [...] and was a source of wear and inaccuracy.|$|R

Much work is needed, but distilling essential characteristics from a design and collecting them in an easily accessible format that is amenable to use by inexpensive analysis tools is a significant contribution to this goal. Toward that end, four types of reduced-fidelity or degenerate geometric representations have been defined and implemented in VSP, a parametric geometry modeler. The four types are degenerate surface, degenerate <b>plate,</b> degenerate <b>stick,</b> and degenerate point, corresponding to three-, two-, one-, and zero- dimensional representations of underlying geometry, respectively. The information contained in these representations was targeted specifically at lifting line, vortex lattice, equivalent beam, and equivalent plate theories, with the idea that suitability for interface with these methods would imply suitability for use with many other analysis techniques. The ability to output this information in two plain text formats— comma separated value and Matlab script—has also been implemented in VSP, making it readily available for use. A modified Cessna 182 wing created in VSP was used to test the suitability of degenerate geometry to interface with the four target analysis techniques. All four test cases were easily completed using the information contained in the degenerate geometric types, and similar techniques utilizing different degenerate geometries produced similar results. The following work outlines the theoretical underpinnings of degenerate geometry and the fidelity-reduction process. It also describes in detail how the routines that create degenerate geometry were implemented in VSP and concludes with the analysis test cases, stating their results and comparing results among different techniques...|$|R

40|$|The {{particle}} gun {{method and}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling {{was used to}} study stickiness and deposition mechanisms of skim milk powder in an impingement jet hitting a stainless steel plate. The particular focus was {{on the effect of}} jet velocity and particle size distribution on deposition. Low jet velocities of 10. 3, 14. 8 and 19. 4 m/s were studied at fine particle size levels of 30, 51, and 61 mm, using a jet-plate height to jet diameter ratio of 4. For skim milk powder with a bulk particle size (d(0. 5) = 61 μm), lowering the air velocity from 19. 4 m/s to 10. 3 m/s increased the level of deposition and decreased the point at which deposition first occur as measured by the temperature difference between the glass transition temperature (Tg) of amorphous lactose and the air jet temperature of the particle gun. This point is called (T-Tg) critical. The critical point decreased from 39. 0 °C to 18. 6 °C as the velocity decreased from 19. 4 to 10. 3 m/s and the (T-Tg) critical obtained at the lower velocity is in closer agreement with previously reported fluid bed rig results. The (T-Tg) critical point and level of deposition was also found to be highly dependent on particle size. Increasing the average particle size from 30 μm to 61 μm increased the (T-Tg) critical from 8. 2 °C to 18. 6 °C and 14. 8 °C to 39. 0 °C for jet velocities of 10. 3 m/s and 19. 4 m/s respectively. Levels of particle deposition also dramatically decreased for both velocity ranges. Ring shaped deposit morphologies were observed with increasing particle stickiness. Beyond (T-Tg) critical powder deposits formed at the periphery of the plate creating a large round clear zone which decreased until a striped deposit ring formed and finally deposits formed only at the centre. Particles were observed to bounce radially from the centre of the <b>plate</b> before <b>sticking.</b> Milk powder deposits are therefore governed by the kinetic energy of the impinging particle in addition to particle surface stickiness. The particle gun method was modelled using Fluent CFD software as an adhesion phenomenon arising from the particle-surface contact dynamics of a particle laden impingement jet contacting a vertical collection plate. The development of a wall boundary condition for specifying the particle-surface interaction has been the focus. A particle is captured by the wall if the impinging kinetic energy is below the prescribed critical normal kinetic energy; otherwise the particle rebounds with reduced kinetic energy. The model was developed through the User Define Function option of Fluent. The CFD model confirmed that particles rebound radially from the collection plate several times before sticking. Circular deposit morphology results from such modelled contact dynamics which are similar to the observed experimental deposits. The level of deposition predicted by CFD increased with increasing levels of critical normal kinetic energy, in the same way experimental deposits increased with increasing particle stickiness. The current model did not considered the contribution from the tangential velocity component to particle stick/rebound behaviour, but it is expected the tangential velocity may also play a significant role and should be included in future CFD models. It is recommended that the particle-surface interaction needs to be studied in more detail, preferably with imaging systems such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), so that individual particle trajectory and deposition behaviour can be followed and analysed...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} finding a new purpose for plastic waste materials. Due to the great set of possibilities (strength, stiffness, density, heat resistance, electrical conductivity), the material is often used (Lower, 2009). Many plastics {{are designed to be}} used only once, being thrown away after the use. However, thrown away is not away. Plastic is the type of waste that will last forever. Currently only five to ten percent is recycled of all the produced plastics (source: [URL] As mentioned by Eriksen et al. (2014) there are around five trillion pieces of plastic floating in world’s oceans, out of which eighty percent, originates from the land (Jambeck et al., 2015). The plastic breaks down into smaller pieces by the sunlight (Moore, C., 2014) and releases toxins. All sorts of organisms living in or off the sea mistakenly take in plastic debris and microplastic for food. This results in the often toxic waste to enter our food chain (Plastic Soup Foundation, 2016). The goal of this project is to find an application for plastic waste materials that changes the perception of waste into valuable and looks at motivations for people to do something with waste. The thesis shows the design of a material application and a service around recycling Polyethylene bottle caps. The project assignment is self-formulated, in collaboration with Elvin Karana. The Material Driven Design method (Karana et al., 2015) was applied for the design of the material application in which the unique material qualities come forward. The material focus of Polyethylene was determined through talks with experts about the safety of melting the material. Insights in the material qualities of Polyethylene were generated by several tinkering experiments and user studies. These experiments showed the unique qualities of the arise of wonderful patterns that surprise people, when different colors of caps are mixed, and showed the semi-transparency of the material. The combination of both qualities give the material a magical appearance when light shines through and shows the stratification of the material. Material Benchmarking proved that the combination of the discovered material qualities was not applied by others. The associated meanings of the material, natural, unique, personal and beautiful, were evoked during the user studies. Different ways of motivating people to do something with waste were explored, by mapping existing solutions and their motivational strategies. The fun aspect of collecting, the size and availability in many different colors, encouraged to focus on Polyethylene bottle caps. The vision aimed at surprising people with the material, combined with light. Experiments with the material were done to investigate how the element of suprise can be enhanced. The Design phase is divided into the design of the service and the material application. The service implies the collecting and processing aspects of the material. For the service, several ways of collecting bottle caps were tried out. The experiences were translated into stories. The enthusiasm and dedication during the making process was tested with a workshop. People liked to create something out of plastic bottle caps. They associated the experience with baking. The processability of the material by hand was tested with a set of experiments. It was discovered that processing by hand (with an oven and some basic kitchen tools) is possible as long as the dimensions of the material are kept small. In this way mixing the material and creating patterns is possible, considering the short cooling time and thus processing time of the material. The requirement of small dimensions, encouraged to decide on a modular application, that consists out of multiple plastic plates. A creative session and brainstorm with a group of students was executed to find applications for the material with light. The ideas were translated into three concept and tested by prototypes with using artifical and natural light. Different connection methods for the material were explored. A product and a service was developed: The Plastic Bakery. The product, Tipi Table lamp, is a lamp shade that consists out of four plastic <b>plates,</b> four <b>sticks,</b> a piece of cord and an elastic band that can easily be assembled. A ledlamp is used as a lightsource. It does not become warm and has a long lifetime. The product can either be bought or made yourself during a workshop. By processing yourself, the transition can be visible from bottle cap to new material. People can select a theme, based on nature, {{with the aid of a}} menu and collect the specific caps. They can melt the material inside a mold and mix it with spatulas. People can add sprinkles and create a message with a stamp. The material can be made flat by using one’s body weight. Both concepts were evaluated. The product was evaluated during the exhibition of Future Materials and the service during a workshop. The material application surprised people and was seen as beautiful. It is managed to create something valuable out of plastic waste. People liked the activity of making during the workshop and could express themselves. The short cooling time of the material worked against the joy of making. A set of recommendations is presented that suggests further research into the cooling time and thus processing time of the material, together with the safety of melting plastic for DIY purposes.
