Our conferences now have much higher levels of participation, with a measurable increase in the quality of the papers presented. We have initiated a new series of conferences under the name Industrial Informatics and hope to have the approval of IEEE Board for the new transactions that we have proposed on the same subject. As you may be aware it was us in IEEE who started the mechatronics activities, and now {{we are going to have}} a new series of conferences in this area (please see the message below). For our chapters, we have increased our financial support and plan to provide other types of backing in the future. For students, we have been providing a considerable number of conference travel grants. I think we are one of the very few societies who organize student forums. What I have listed above are only a few items from a long list. In short, the past two years have been full of rewarding excitements and we have exciting years in front of us. This is an open invitation to you to play a more active role in our activities. This can be in our conferences, in our technical activities, in our publications, chapters, etc. Please contact the related Vice President. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you a joyous holiday season and a wonderful New Year. With my warm regards...|$|E
