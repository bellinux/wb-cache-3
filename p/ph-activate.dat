40|$|Sodium- and potassium-activated {{adenosine}} triphosphatases (Na,K-ATPase) is {{the ubiquitous}} active transport system that maintains the Na(+) and K(+) gradients across the plasma membrane by exchanging three intracellular Na(+) ions against two extracellular K(+) ions. In {{addition to the}} two cation binding sites homologous to the calcium site of sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase and which are alternatively occupied by Na(+) and K(+) ions, a third Na(+) -specific site is located close to transmembrane domains 5, 6 and 9, and mutations close to this site induce marked alterations of the voltage-dependent release of Na(+) to the extracellular side. In the absence of extracellular Na(+) and K(+), Na,K-ATPase carries an acidic <b>pH-activated,</b> ouabain-sensitive "leak" current. We investigated {{the relationship between the}} third Na(+) binding site and the <b>pH-activated</b> current. The decrease (in E 961 A, T 814 A and Y 778 F mutants) or the increase (in G 813 A mutant) of the voltage-dependent extracellular Na(+) affinity was paralleled by a decrease or an increase in the <b>pH-activated</b> current, respectively. Moreover, replacing E 961 with oxygen-containing side chain residues such as glutamine or aspartate had little effect on the voltage-dependent affinity for extracellular Na(+) and produced only small effects on the <b>pH-activated</b> current.

To establish whether VacA induces intestinal secretion, epithelial damage, or both, purified <b>pH-activated</b> VacA was added to Caco- 2 cell monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers, and electrical parameters were monitored. Mucosal addition of VacA induced an increase in short circuit current, consistent with enterotoxic effect. The effect was time- and dose-dependent and saturable. It was not found if the toxin was not <b>pH-activated,</b> added to the serosal side, or preheated. In cells preloaded with the Ca 2 + buffering compound BAPTA/AM or with the Cl- channel inhibitor 5 -nitro- 2 - 3 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid, short circuit current did not change, indicating that VacA induces activation of Ca 2 +-dependent Cl- channels.

We show that both polymers with and without grafts interact better with the membrane under conditions compatible with lower pH. The conformational states of the polymers were investigated in water and at a water–membrane interface.

Although the HAs of subtypes H 3 and H 2 show notably different degrees of activation, for both, the percentage of low <b>pH–activated</b> HA increased with higher surface density of HA, indicating positive cooperativity.

40|$|In Amphiuma {{red blood}} cells, the Na/H {{exchanger}} {{has been shown}} to {{play a central role in}} the regulation of cell volume following cell shrinkage (Cala, P. M. 1980. Journal of General Physiology. 76 : 683 - 708.) The present study was designed to evaluate the existence of pH regulatory Na/H exchange in the Amphiuma red blood cell. The data illustrate that when the intracellular pHi was decreased below the normal value of 7. 00, Na/H exchange was activated in proportion to the degree of acidification. Once activated, net Na/H exchange flux persisted until normal intracellular pH (6. 9 - 7. 0) was restored, with a half time of approximately 5 min. These observations established a pHi set point of 7. 00 for the <b>pH-activated</b> Na/H exchange of Amphiuma red blood cell. This is in contrast to the behavior of osmotically shrunken Amphiuma red blood cells in which no pHi set point could be demonstrated. That is, when activated by cell shrinkage the Na/H exchange mediated net Na flux persisted until normal volume was restored regardless of pHi. In contrast, when activated by cell acidification, the Na/H exchanger functioned until pHi was restored to normal and cell volume appeared to have no effect on <b>pH-activated</b> Na/H exchange. Studies evaluating the kinetic and inferentially, the molecular equivalence of the volume and pHi-induced Amphiuma erythrocyte Na/H exchanger(s), indicated that the apparent Na affinity of the pH activated cells is four times greater than that of shrunken cells. The apparent Vmax is also higher (two times) in the pH activated cells, suggesting the involvement of two distinct populations of the transporter in pH and volume regulation. However, when analyzed in terms of a bisubstrate model, the same data are consistent with the conclusion that both pH and volume regulatory functions are mediated by the same transport protein. Taken together, these data support the conclusion that volume and pH are regulated by the same effector (Na/H exchanger) under the control of as yet unidentified, distinct and cross inhibitory volume and pH sensing mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|The {{refolding}} of the prototypic fusogenic protein hemagglutinin (HA) at the pH of fusion {{is considered}} to be a concerted and irreversible discharge of a loaded spring, with no distinct intermediates between the initial and final conformations.

After reneutralization, low <b>pH-activated</b> HA returns from the conformations wherein both the fusion peptide and the kinked loop of the HA 2 subunit are exposed, but the HA 1 subunits have not yet dissociated, to a structure indistinguishable from the initial one in functional, biochemical and immunological characteristics. The rate of the transition from reversible conformations to irreversible refolding depends on the pH and on the presence of target membrane. Importantly, recovery of the initial conformation is blocked by the interactions between adjacent HA trimers. The existence of the identified reversible stage of refolding can be crucial for allowing multiple copies of HA to synchronize their release of conformational energy, as required for fusion...|$|R

To break this bottleneck, we attempt to develop an iron oxide nanoparticle-based multifunctional system.

Our results showed that both PCI strategies significantly improved the cytotoxicity, of free DOX on Ca 9 - 22 cells at higher concentrations. The 'light after' PCI treatment was efficient in releasing DOX from the PAMAM-hyd-DOX conjugates, resulted in more nuclear accumulation of DOX and more cell death through synergistic effects.

This analysis is based on monitoring electronic changes in the Bergman cyclization along the internal reaction coordinate (IRC) path. Insight into the relative importance and timing of a variety of bond-forming and bond-breaking processes involving both in-plane and out-of-plane ð-orbitals along the IRC path was gained using natural bond orbital (NBO) dissection. In the vicinity of the Nicolaou’s threshold (3. 20 Å) where the ð-orbitals become parallel and their interaction pattern resembles that in the TS of the symmetry-forbidden thermal [2 s + 2 s] cycloaddition, the four-electron repulsive interaction of filled in-plane ð-orbitals (ði-ði) becomes a dominant destabilizing factor without any compensation from the bond-forming, attractive two-electron interaction of the in-plane ð-orbitals (ði f ði*). The dominant role of the interplay between attractive and repulsive interactions in the in-plane ð-system is further illustrated by the observation that the reaction becomes truly spontaneous (barrierless) when the magnitude of the attractive two-electron interaction of in-plane ð-ð * orbitals becomes larger than that of the repulsive ð-ð interaction.

All simulated structures are in very good agreement with high-resolution structures. Changes in the channel caused by progressive protonation of His 37 {{provide insight into the}} mechanism of proton transport. The channel is closed at both His 37 and Trp 41 sites in the singly and doubly protonated states, but it opens at Trp 41 upon further protonation. Anions access the charged His 37 and by doing so stabilize the protonated states of the channel. The narrow opening at the His 37 site, further blocked by anions, is inconsistent with the water-wire mechanism of proton transport. Instead, conformational interconversions of His 37 correlated with hydrogen bonding to water molecules indicate that these residues shuttle protons in high-protonation states. Hydrogen bonds between charged and uncharged histidines are rare. The valve at Val 27 remains on average quite narrow in all protonation states but fluctuates sufficiently to support water and proton transport. A proton transport mechanism in which the channel, depending on pH, opens at either the histidine or valine gate is only partially supported by the simulations...|$|R

Unlike other aquaporins, AQP 6 overexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes was previously found to exhibit Hg 2 + or <b>pH-activated</b> ion conductance. AQP 6 could not be analyzed electrophysiologically in mammalian cells, however, because the protein is restricted to intracellular vesicles. Here we report that addition of a green fluorescence protein (GFP) tag to the N terminus of rat AQP 6 (GFP-AQP 6) redirects the protein to the plasma membranes of transfected mammalian cells. This permitted measurement of rapid, reversible, pH-induced anion currents by GFP-AQP 6 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells.

While a low pH conformation of HA 2 mediates the actual fusion, HA 1 establishes a specific connection between the viral and cell membranes via binding to the sialic acid-containing receptors. Here we propose that HA 1 may also be involved in modulating the kinetics of HA refolding. We hypothesized that binding of the HA 1 subunit to its receptor restricts the major refolding of the low <b>pH-activated</b> HA to a fusion-competent conformation and, {{in the absence of}} fusion, to an HA-inactivated state. Dissociation of the HA 1 -receptor connection was considered to be a slow kinetic step. To verify this hypothesis, we first analyzed a simple kinetic scheme accounting for the stages of dissociation of the HA 1 /receptor bonds, inactivation and fusion, and formulated experimentally testable predictions. Second, we verified these predictions by measuring the extent of fusion between HA-expressing cells and red blood cells. Three experimental approaches based on 1) the temporal inhibition of fusion by lysophosphatidylcholine, 2) rapid dissociation of the HA 1 -receptor connections by neuraminidase treatment, and 3) substitution of membrane-anchored receptors by a water-soluble sialyllactose all provided support for the proposed role of the release of HA 1 -receptor connections.

However, the minimal fragment required for assembly and proton transport in cellular membranes has not been defined. Therefore, the conductance properties of truncation mutants expressed in Xenopus oocytes were examined. A short fragment spanning residues 21 – 61, M 2 (21 - 61), was inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane and had specific, amantadine-sensitive proton transport activity indistinguishable from that of full-length A/M 2; an epitope-tagged version of an even shorter fragment, M 2 (21 - 51) -FLAG, had specific activity within a factor of 2 of the full-length protein. Furthermore, synthetic fragments including a peptide spanning residues 22 – 46 were found to transport protons into liposomes in an amantadine-sensitive manner. In addition, the functionally important His- 37 residue pKa values are highly perturbed in the tetrameric form of the protein, a property conserved in the TM peptide and full-length A/M 2 in both micelles and bilayers.

The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to expand its application to a tumor-targeting gene delivery systemin mice bearing tumors established from a RCC (OS-RC- 2). When the modification of the surface of the particle is optimized for the polyethyleneglycol (PEG), stability in the blood circulation is improved, and consequently tumor-selective gene expression can be achieved. Furthermore, gene expression in the tumor was increased slightly when the hydrophobic scaffold of the ssPalm was replaced from the conventionally used myristic acid (ssPalmM) to alpha-tocopherol succinate (ssPalmE). Moreover, tumor growth was significantly suppressed when the completely CpG-free pDNA encoding the solute form of VEGFR (fms-like tyrosine kinase- 1 : sFlt- 1) was used, especially when it was delivered by the LNP formed with ssPalmE(LNPssPalmE). Thus, the PEG-modified LNPssPalmE is a promising gene carrier for the cancer gene therapy of RCC. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Severe acidic <b>pH-activated</b> {{chloride}} channel (ICl,acid) {{has been}} found in various mammalian cells. In the present study, we investigate whether this channel participates in reactions of the thoracic aorta to severe acidosis and whether it plays a role in hypertension. We measured isometric contraction in thoracic aorta rings from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar rats. Severe acidosis induced contractions of both endothelium-intact and -denuded thoracic aorta rings. In Wistar rats, contractions did not differ at pH 6. 4, 5. 4 and 4. 4. However, in SHRs, contractions were higher at pH 5. 4 or 4. 4 than pH 6. 4, with no difference between contractions at pH 5. 4 and 4. 4. Nifedipine, ICl,acid blockers 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB) and 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid (DIDS) inhibited severe acidosis-induced contraction of aortas at different pH levels. When blocking ICl,acid, the remnant contraction was greater at pH 4. 4 than pH 5. 4 and 6. 4 for both SHRs and Wistar rats. With nifedipine, the remnant contraction was greatly reduced at pH 4. 4 as compared with at pH 6. 4 and 5. 4. With NPPB or DIDS, the ratio of remnant contractions at pH 4. 4 and 5. 4 (R 4. 4 / 5. 4) was lower for SHRs than Wistar rats (all 1). Furthermore, patch clamp recordings of ICl,acid and intracellular Ca(2 +) measurements in smooth muscle cells confirmed these findings. ICl,acid may protect arteries against excess vasoconstriction under extremely acidic extracellular conditions. This protective effect may be decreased in hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{treatment}} of brain neurological {{disorders such as}} Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, or tumors should be possible with drug delivery through blood–brain barrier (BBB) or blood–brain tumor barrier (BTB) and targeting specific types of brain cells with drug release into the cell cytoplasm. A polymeric nanobioconjugate drug based on biodegradable, nontoxic, and nonimmunogenic polymalic acid as a universal delivery nanoplatform was used for design and synthesis of nanomedicine drug for i. v. {{treatment of}} brain tumors. The polymeric drug passes through the BTB and tumor cell membrane using tandem monoclonal antibodies targeting the BTB and tumor cells. The next step for polymeric drug action was inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by specifically blocking the synthesis of a tumor neovascular trimer protein, laminin- 411, by attached antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). The AONs were released into the target cell cytoplasm via <b>pH-activated</b> trileucine, an endosomal escape moiety. Drug delivery to the brain tumor and the release mechanism were both studied for this nanobiopolymer. Introduction of a trileucine endosome escape unit resulted in significantly increased AON delivery to tumor cells, inhibition of laminin- 411 synthesis in vitro and in vivo, specific accumulation in brain tumors, and suppression of intracranial glioma growth compared with pH-independent leucine ester. The availability of a systemically active polymeric drug delivery system that passes through the BTB, targets tumor cells, and inhibits glioma growth gives hope for a successful strategy of glioma treatment. This delivery system with drug release into the brain-specific cell type could be useful for treatment of various brain pathologies...|$|R
40|$|Influenza A and B viruses contain proton-selective ion channels, A/M 2 and BM 2, respectively, and the A/M 2 channel {{activity}} is inhibited by the drugs amantadine and its methyl derivative rimantadine. The {{structure of the}} pore-transmembrane domain has been determined by both x-ray crystallography [Stouffer et al. (2008) Nature 451 : 596 – 599] and by NMR methods [Schnell and Chou (2008) Nature 451 : 591 – 595]. Whereas the crystal structure indicates a single amantadine molecule in the pore of the channel, the NMR data show four rimantadine molecules bound {{on the outside of}} the helices toward the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Drug binding includes interactions with residues 40 – 45 with a polar hydrogen bond between rimantadine and aspartic acid residue 44 (D 44) that appears to be important. These two distinct drug-binding sites led to two incompatible drug inhibition mechanisms. We mutagenized D 44 and R 45 to alanine as these mutations are likely to interfere with rimantadine binding and lead to a drug insensitive channel. However, the D 44 A channel was found to be sensitive to amantadine when measured by electrophysiological recordings in oocytes of Xenopus laevis and in mammalian cells, and when the D 44 and R 45 mutations were introduced into the influenza virus genome. Furthermore, transplanting A/M 2 pore residues 24 – 36 into BM 2, yielded a <b>pH-activated</b> chimeric ion channel that was partially inhibited by amantadine. Thus, taken together our functional data suggest that amantadine/rimantadine binding outside of the channel pore is not the primary site associated with the pharmacological inhibition of the A/M 2 ion channel...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{influenza}} A/M 2 {{protein is}} a homotetrameric single-pass integral membrane protein encoded by the influenza A viral genome. Its transmembrane domain represents both a crucial drug target and a minimalistic model system for transmembrane proton transport and charge stabilization. Recent structural and functional studies of M 2 {{have suggested that}} the proton transport mechanism involves sequential extraviral protonation and intraviral deprotonation of a highly conserved His 37 side chain by the transported proton, consistent with a <b>pH-activated</b> proton shuttle mechanism. Multiple tautomeric forms of His can be formed, and it is not known whether they contribute to the mechanism of proton shuttling. Here we present the thermodynamic and functional characterization of an unnatural amino acid mutant at His 37, where the imidazole side chain is substituted with a 4 -thiazolyl group that is unable to undergo tautomerization and has a significantly lower solution pKa. The mutant construct has a similar stability to the wild-type protein at pH 8 in bilayers and is virtually inactive at external pH 7. 4 in a semiquantitative liposome flux assay as expected from its lower sidechain pKa. However when the external buffer pH is lowered to 4. 9 and 2. 4, the mutant shows increasing amantadine sensitive flux of a similar magnitude to that of the wild type construct at pH 7. 4 and 4. 9 respectively. These findings are in line with mechanistic hypotheses suggesting that proton flux through M 2 is mediated by proton exchange from adjacent water molecules with the His 37 sidechain, and that tautomerization is not required for proton translocation.

40|$|Two-pore-domain K+ (K 2 P) {{channels}} sense a {{wide variety}} of stimuli such as mechanical stress, inhalational anesthetics, and changes in extracellular pH or temperature. The K 2 P channel activity forms a background K+ current and, thereby, contributes to resting membrane potentials. Six subfamilies including fifteen subtypes of K 2 P channels have been identified. Each K 2 P channel molecule with two pores consists of a homodimer of each subtype. In addition, a few heterodimers mainly within the same subfamilies have been found recently. In the present study, the possibility of heterodimerization between TASK 1 (TWIK-Related Acid-Sensitive K+ channel) and TALK 2 (TWIK-Related Alkaline <b>pH-Activated</b> K+ channel) was examined. These channels belong to separate subfamilies and show extremely different channel properties. Surprisingly, single molecular imaging analyses in this study using a total internal reflection microscope suggested the heterodimerization of TASK 1 and TALK 2 in a pancreatic cell line, QGP- 1. This heterodimer was also detected using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay in a HEK 293 heterologous expression system. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses showed that the affinity between TASK 1 and TALK 2 appeared to be close to those of homodimers. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that TASK 1 currents in HEK 293 cells were significantly attenuated by co-expression of a dominant-negative form of TALK 2 in comparison with that of wild-type TALK 2. The sensitivities of TASK 1 -TALK 2 tandem constructs to extracellular pH and halothane were characterized as a unique hybrid of TASK 1 and TALK 2. These results suggested that heterodimerization of TASK 1 and TALK 2 provides cells with the ability to make multiple responses to a variety of physiological and pharmacological stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Luminal {{membrane}} vesicles (LMV) {{were isolated}} from human and pig colonic tissues. They were characterized {{in terms of}} purity and ability to transport [14 C]butyrate. The activity of cysteine-sensitive alkaline phosphatase, and the abundance of villin, NHE 2 and NHE 3 proteins, markers of the colonic luminal membrane, were significantly enriched in the LMV compared with the original cellular homogenate. The LMV were free from contamination by other cellular organelles and basolateral membranes, as revealed by the negligible presence of either specific marker enzyme activity or characteristic immunogenic protein. The transport of butyrate into the luminal membrane vesicles was enhanced 5 -fold at pH 5. 5 compared with pH 8. 0. Butyrate transport was temperature dependent, and was stimulated {{in the presence of}} an outward-directed anion gradient in the order of butyrate > bicarbonate > propionate > chloride. Kinetic analysis of increasing substrate concentration showed saturation kinetics with an apparent Km value of 14. 8 ± 3. 6 mm and a Vmax of 54 ± 14 nmol min− 1 (mg protein) − 1. Butyrate transport was significantly reduced in the presence of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), acetate, propionate and other monocarboxylates (pyruvate and l-lactate). Butyrate uptake was inhibited by several cysteine group modifying reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzosulphonic acid (pCMBS), p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB), mersalyl acid and HgCl 2, but not by the stilbene anion exchange inhibitors, 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulphonate (DIDS) and 4, 4 ′-dinitrostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulphonate (SITS). The described properties of butyrate transport across the luminal pole of the colon suggest the involvement of a carrier protein, {{in the form of a}} <b>pH-activated</b> anion exchange process. The transporter is distinct from the erythrocyte band- 3 type anion exchanger and may belong to the monocarboxylate-type transport proteins (MCT 1) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{kinetics}} of low-pH-induced fusion between erythrocyte membranes and membranes containing influenza virus hemagglutinin by using assays based on the fluorescence dequenching of the lipophilic dye octadecylrhodamine. Stopped-flow mixing and fast data acquisition {{have been used to}} monitor the early stages of influenza virus fusion. We have compared this with the kinetics observed for fusion of an NIH 3 T 3 cell line, transformed with bovine papillomavirus, which constitutively expresses influenza virus hemagglutinin (GP 4 f cells). Virus and GP 4 f cells both display a pH-dependent time lag before the onset of fluorescence dequenching, but of an order of magnitude difference, ca. 2 s versus ca. 20 s. We have adopted two strategies to investigate whether the difference in lag time reflects the surface density of acid-activated hemagglutinin, able to undergo productive conformational change. (i) Hemagglutinin expressed on the cell surface requires proteolytic cleavage with trypsin from an inactive HAO form; we have limited the extent of proteolysis. (ii) We have used infection of CV- 1 cells with a recombinant simian virus 40 bearing the influenza virus hemagglutinin gene. The surface expression of hemagglutinin is a function of time postinfection. For low-pH-induced fusion of both types of cell with erythrocytes, the lag time decreases with increasing hemagglutinin densities. Our results do not indicate a cooperative phenomenon {{at the level of the}} principal rate-determining step. We also show in the instance of virus fusion, that the magnitude of the delay time is a function of the target membrane transbilayer lipid distribution. We conclude that for a given amount of <b>pH-activated</b> hemagglutinin per unit area of membrane, the kinetics of fusion is determined by nonspecific physical properties of the membranes involved...|$|R
40|$|The nhaA gene of Escherichia coli, which encodes a <b>pH-activated</b> Na+/H+ antiporter, {{has been}} modified; six of its eight {{histidine}} codons were mutated to arginine codons by site-directed mutagenesis, yielding the mutations H 254 R-H 257 R (a double mutant), H 226 R, H 39 R, H 244 R, and H 319 R. In addition a deletion (delta nhaA 1 - 14) lacking {{the remaining two}} histidines, His- 3 and His- 5, has been constructed. By comparing the phenotypes conferred by plasmids bearing the various mutations to the phenotype of the wild type upon transformation of strains NM 81 (delta nhaA) or EP 432 (delta nhaA, delta nhaB) we found {{that none of the}} NhaA histidines are essential for the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of the NhaA protein. However, the replacement of His- 226 by Arg markedly changes the pH dependence of the antiporter. All mutants except H 226 R confer to NM 81 and EP 432 Na+ resistance up to pH 8. 5 as well as Li+ resistance. Cells bearing H 226 R are resistant to Li+ and to Na+ at neutral pH, but they become sensitive to Na+ above pH 7. 5. Analysis of the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of membrane vesicles derived from H 226 R cells shows that the mutated protein is activated by pH to the same extent as the wild type. However, whereas the activation of the wild-type NhaA occurs between pH 7 and pH 8, that of H 226 R antiporter occurs between pH 6. 5 and pH 7. 5. Furthermore, while the wild-type antiporter remains almost fully active at least up to pH 8. 5, H 226 R is reversibly inactivated above pH 7. 5, reaching 10 - 20 % of the maximal activity at pH 8. 5. We suggest that His- 226 is part of a pH-sensitive site that regulates the activity of NhaA...|$|R
