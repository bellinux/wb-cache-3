50|$|In {{addition}} to the single wide form shown, M-Modules can be developed in double, triple and quadruple wide configurations. Because of the standard's genesis in the VME world it is sized such that 4 fit in a 6U module and 2 in a 3U module. Conveniently, {{because of the way}} other backplane standards have evolved, 4 units easily fit the front <b>panel</b> <b>space</b> in VXI and 6U cPCI/PXI while 2 will fit in the front <b>panel</b> <b>space</b> of 3U cPCI/PXI and up to 8 will fit in a 1U LXI rack mount carrier.|$|R
50|$|Models {{designed}} and {{produced in the}} late 20th century needed more <b>panel</b> <b>space</b> for the increased number of record titles they needed to present for selection, reducing the space available for decoration, leading to less ornate styling in favor of functionality and less maintenance.|$|R

50|$|Another {{well-known}} Square D {{product line}} is the Powerlink circuit breaker, created for lighting control in commercial buildings. B Line and D Line were the breaker panels in which Powerline breakers were used. Eventually, the company branded Powerline and Powerlink panels and breakers. Powerlink was a heavy duty 277-volt lighting breaker, used in large buildings with 277-volt lighting loads. These were also favored for their robust design, and functional reliability. This means less <b>panel</b> <b>space</b> and wire are needed, and why commercial buildings frequently utilize higher voltage for general task lighting.|$|R

50|$|Architects B. Vilensky and V. Yershov {{applied the}} {{aviation}} theme to this big open station, {{in what is}} seen {{as some of the}} best examples of Soviet Art Deco architecture. The most noticeable design feature is the network of intersecting ribs that fan out across the vaulted ceiling. These ribs originate from fan-shaped limestone <b>panels</b> <b>spaced</b> at regular intervals along the walls, which are red marble with shell-shaped brown marble insets. The floor is reveted with grey granite. Lighting comes from pyramidal objects which house luminescent lamps, although originally the station had chandeliers with normal tungsten bulbs.|$|R

50|$|The term Circular Connector {{applies to}} any {{electrical}} connector possessing multipin interconnects with cylindrical contact housings and circular contact interface geometries. Circular connectors are selected {{for ease of}} engagement and disengagement, their ability to conveniently house different types of contacts, their wide range of allowable contact voltages and currents, their ease of environmental sealing and their rugged mechanical performance. In military, aerospace, and other high-reliability applications, the MIL-DTL-5015 and MIL-DTL-38999 {{are among the most}} commonly specified types. The primary disadvantage of the circular design is loss of <b>panel</b> <b>space</b> when used in arrays when compared to rectangular connectors.|$|R
5000|$|Quarter-inch phone {{connectors}} {{are widely}} used to connect external processing devices to mixing consoles' insert points (see Insert (effects processing)). Two- or three-conductor phone connectors might be used in pairs as separate send and return jacks, or a single three-conductor phone jack might be employed for both send and return, {{in which case the}} signals are unbalanced. The one unbalanced combination send/return TRS insert jack saves both <b>panel</b> <b>space</b> and component complexity, but may introduce a slight buzz. Insert points on mixing consoles may also be XLR, RCA or bantam TT (tiny telephone) jacks, depending on the make and model.|$|R

Unique hermaphroditic connectors, {{commonly referred to as}} IBM Data Connectors in formal writing or colloquially as Boy George connectors were used. The connectors have the disadvantage of being quite bulky, requiring at least 3 x 3 cm <b>panel</b> <b>space,</b> and being relatively fragile. The advantages of the connectors being that they are genderless and have superior shielding over standard unshielded RJ45. Connectors at the computer were usually DE-9 female.|$|R

5000|$|Notable {{elements}} of Watterson's artistic style are his characters' diverse and often exaggerated expressions (particularly those of Calvin), elaborate and bizarre backgrounds for Calvin's flights of imagination, expressions of motion, and frequent visual jokes and metaphors. In the later {{years of the}} strip, with more <b>panel</b> <b>space</b> available for his use, Watterson experimented more freely with different panel layouts, art styles, stories without dialogue, and greater use of whitespace. He also {{makes a point of}} not showing certain things explicitly: the [...] "Noodle Incident" [...] and the children's book Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie are left to the reader's imagination, where Watterson was sure they would be [...] "more outrageous" [...] than he could portray.|$|R
50|$|Various {{avionics}} {{are present}} upon the Panther; some variants are fitted with the advanced human-machine interface (HMI) glass cockpit. It features {{the vehicle and}} engine multifunction display (VEMD), integrated electronic standby instrument (ESI), usage monitoring system (UMS), {{traffic collision avoidance system}} (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (H-TAWS), and dedicated mission display coupled with a multi-sensor processor, a 4-axis automatic flight control system (AFCS), flight management system (FMS), and an advanced search radar. The design of the cockpit and avionics systems, such as the engine management system, provides a high level of automation {{as part of an effort}} to reduce workload upon the pilots. The cockpit was deliberately designed with extra <b>panel</b> <b>space</b> to accommodate future upgrades and additional instrumentation that may be installed.|$|R

40|$|A {{multipurpose}} {{panel was}} developed to provide a flexible control and a LED display panel with easily changeable nomenclature for use in applications where <b>panel</b> <b>space</b> is limited, but where a number of similar subsystems must be controlled, or where basic panel nomenclature and functions must be changed rapidly, {{as in the case}} of between mission changes of space shuttle payloads. In the first application, panel area limitations are overcome by time sharing a central control panel among several subsystems. In the latter case, entire control panel changes are effected by simply replacing a memory module, thereby reducing the extent of installation and checkout procedures between missions. Several types of control technologies (other than LED's) which show potential in meeting criteria for overcoming limitations of the panel are assessed...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{conflicting}} demands of modern aircraft for increased systems/sensors and {{the decrease in}} cockpit panel size, weight, volume, and power, conventional discrete/dedicated methods of display and control are fast becoming obsolete.
