40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} with connective tissue diseases and 5 control subjects were studied by “wide-field” photography. A total <b>of</b> 44 <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the nailfold {{were sent to}} the second author (HRM) for “blind” diagnostic interpretation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether picture presentation influenced men’s experienced body shame or Muscle Dysmorphia symptomatology, and whether there was a relationship between body shame and Muscle Dysmorphia. Participants were 112 men attending Western Kentucky University. Participants completed the Body Shame Questionnaire and Muscle Dysmorphia Inventory. Participants were randomly assigned to either view eight <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> average men or eight <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> muscular men. After viewing the photographs, the participants completed the Objectified Body Consciousness Scale and the Muscle Appearance Satisfaction Scale. Although there was a trend, results indicate that men who view <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> muscular men do not experience more body shame than those who view <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> average men. In the sample, 63. 5 % reported that they were dissatisfied with their bodies, 69 % with their chest size, 69 % with their own body build, 65 % with their arms, and 63 % were dissatisfied with their own abdomen. Results indicate that viewing <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> muscular men does not increase one’s symptomatology of MD. However, there was a positive correlation between body shame and muscle dysmorphia symptoms for both men who viewed <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> muscular men and those who viewed <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> average men...|$|R
