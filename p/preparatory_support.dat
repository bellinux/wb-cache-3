Since its inception, more than $4 billion in federal funds have been distributed to assist 12 million students in 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Fattah sponsored H.R. 4207, American Dream Accounts Act which would authorize the Department of Education to award three-year competitive grants to support partnerships that provide financial support and preparation for low-income students as they plan for their college education. [...] The bill is co-sponsored in the U. S. Senate by Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico. Specifically the legislation creates personal online accounts for students that monitor higher education readiness and includes a college savings account. The accounts follow students from school to school and through college. Parents can grant vested stakeholders (including counselors, teachers, coaches, mentors, and others) access to the account to update student information, monitor progress, and provide college <b>preparatory</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first {{national}} study examining succession planning in New Zealand’s Deaf education leadership workforce. The sun is setting on the working tenure of baby-boomer educators, {{a large proportion of}} these people have reached school leadership positions. This research examines workforce demographics and the succession mechanisms in place for the rising future leaders of Deaf education in New Zealand. To date this has been an area that has not been investigated within the Aotearoa New Zealand context. A small but growing body of international and New Zealand educational literature indicates mainstream workforces are skewed towards ageing due to a unique demographic turning point as baby-boomers reach retirement age. In the arena of New Zealand Deaf education, workforce ageing presents a special concern. Teaching personnel in this workforce are highly specialised and leaders in this area hold exquisitely contextual knowledge. This thesis is concerned with investigating the need to ensure {{the quality and quantity of}} future leadership for Deaf students. If many seasoned leaders and experienced teachers are due to depart in the near term, and there are insufficient succession mechanisms in place, future leadership could be at risk. Three key questions concerning the need for succession planning, were analysed as part of this study. A mixed-methods approach was chosen that involved a quantitative survey of the three Deaf education providers in New Zealand. This was done alongside seven qualitative semi-structured interviews with the senior leaders drawn from across these organisations. Three levels of statistical analysis were applied to the quantitative data to reveal the first national demographic picture of the workforce. Thematic analysis of the qualitative findings revealed the workforce’s motivation to lead and leader’s perceptions of succession planning methods. Methodological triangulation of the findings from the two research tools revealed three main finding areas. Firstly, that an ageing workforce exists, secondly key factors in shaping motivation to lead were identified, and thirdly methods to develop future leaders were pinpointed. The workforce in Deaf education was found to have a more severe skew towards ageing than the mainstream education sector. Amongst a largely static workforce there was found to be a small group of highly motivated individuals who strongly aspired to leadership roles. Formal succession planning mechanisms for this workforce are needed, due to the ageing leadership. In addition to in-role development, pre-role <b>preparatory</b> <b>support</b> was required for aspirants. Specific reluctance and driving factors for leadership were uncovered and the importance of high interpersonal relational skills was emphasised to nurture aspirants and develop a leadership culture. Four recommendations for practice and one recommendation for research are made at the end of this study. The first key recommendation was that investment in leadership preparation and development in Deaf education is worthwhile at both national and organisational level. This stems from the findings that Deaf education personnel have an extremely low rate of attrition out of the profession. Once qualified, most teachers have been found to stay for their entire career. Investment is therefore not wasted. Secondly, there is a need for formal succession mechanisms. Current focus seems to be on volunteerism, self-nomination, development and replacement management. Mechanisms need to include preparation, training and encouragement pathways to identify and nurture future leadership. The third recommendation is based on schools and the Ministry of Education building their own detailed age profiles of personnel. The final practice recommendation is for increased input into building professional self-management skills. Increasingly, aspirants are being deterred from leadership due to reluctance about being able to cope with the impact of stress and workload on their lives. Such on-going professional development for neophyte leaders will assist them to gain the tools to enjoy the challenges of leadership. In terms of a recommendation for future research, gender statistics uncovered in the findings from this study revealed an opportunity for further investigation. A new line of inquiry about gender impact on Deaf students could reveal worthwhile results...|$|E

Underpinned by the principle of performing its thinking through 'showing the screen', live coding involves 'making visible' the process of its own unfolding through the public sharing of live decision-making within improvisatory performance practice. Live coding can also be conceived as the performing of 'thinking-in-action', a live and embodied navigation of various critical thresholds, affordances and restraints, where its thinking-knowing cannot be easily transmitted nor is it strictly a latent knowledge or 'know how' activated through action. Live coding involves the live negotiation between receptivity and spontaneity, between the embodied and intuitive, between an immersive flow experience and split-attention, between human and machine, the known and not yet known. Moreover, in performing 'thinking-in-action', live coding emerges as an experimental site for reflecting on different perceptions and possibilities of temporal experience within live performance: for attending to the threshold between the live and mediated, between present and future-present, proposing even a quality of atemporality or aliveness...|$|R

40|$|School {{closures}} {{have been}} the focus of educational research in the past; however, the perceived effect of this critical event on the school leader has been marginally investigated. A principal’s leadership has been proven to be influential in determining the effectiveness of the learning environment. Succession pressure on maintaining effective school leadership is increasing. Understanding the school leader’s experience of living through a closure process will help to sustain and enrich the leadership capacity that is already in place. This study examined the perceived effects of school closure on the principal’s leadership. A qualitative, narrative analysis approach was used. Six principal narratives and two superintendent narratives formed the basis of data to examine the professional, personal, and structural aspects associated with experiencing a school closure. The school closure experiences were examined using three lenses. Jürgen Habermas’ perspectives on communication style, and system and lifeworld, helped clarify the positioning of the principal in the event, to understand the positions taken, and the dialectic approaches of the Board and school community. Carl Weick’s ideas of sensemaking supported analysis of how principal’s created a perspective for working through the school closure. Albert Bandura’s ideas on self-efficacy assisted with the analysis of the principals’ leadership change. Leadership change was identified. Principals who experienced a school closure demonstrated an enhanced (a) sense of self-efficacy, (b) role awareness and craft knowledge, and (c) conflict resolution skills. The principals were aware of the tension of allegiances to both district and school community. School leaders felt that the school closure was a critical event in their life, but they continued to be professionally motivated. Principals viewed their role in school closure primarily as a caregiver for students and staff, and a facilitator of information. Advice is offered for future school closure considerations in areas such as <b>preparatory</b> knowledge, <b>support,</b> and communicative practices. With little previous research, this study generated valuable knowledge into educational leadership and professional development for school leaders, and perspectives and practice for Boards and senior managers...|$|R

40|$|M. Ed. (Educational Leadership and Management) There is {{considerable}} and growing evidence that principals {{can play a}} pivotal role in initiating school effectiveness particularly as it pertains to student academic performance. To be successful in such initiatives principals must motivate and encourage teachers, students, parents and other community members to join their effort in creating positive engaging school climate that increase the likelihood of student good performance. Educational changes in rural schools have an impact on managers and leaders in various ways. Principals are expected to lead and manage aspects such as curriculum, organizational change, resources and human resources. These challenges stem from a number of sources from within the school resources, from a community perspective and from the school setting itself. Today the administrative role and tasks of school principal are becoming increasingly complex and diverse. There is a need for principals to develop appropriate leadership skills to enable them to carry their tasks effectively. However, not all principals and teachers received proper training to execute their jobs effectively. Many rural school principals are in such unviable positions where they lack preparation programme in their leadership and management position. The researcher used a digital voice recorder and field notes to capture the data from all participants. An Individual participant interview was conducted from all participants. Raw material was sifted and the researcher managed to come out with themes and categories related to fostering effective management leadership in rural schools.

40|$|When Pieter Bruegel the Elder died in 1569, his elder son and {{principal}} continuator, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, was only {{four or five}} years old. The amazingly faithful replicas by the latter were therefore made decades later, after models that were not always the original versions, disseminated at that time; they also relied on a treasure trove of working drawings inherited from Bruegel the Elder. Reconstructing this lost preparatory material through the evidence uncovered during technical examination of the copies of his sons (especially Pieter’s but also Jan’s) is one aspect that will be illustrated in this paper through a few key case studies such as the Battle between Carnival and Lent, the Sermon of St John the Baptist and the Wedding Dance in the Open Air. The presentation will thus describe the actual methods of both the creator and his foremost copyist, based on combined results of infrared reflectography, practical reconstructions and comparisons of tracings of their respective paintings. Brueghel the Younger’s vast and successful copying enterprise required a streamlined production process, and this gradually came to light over the technical research into 60 + paintings by the artist and his workshop. The most interesting discoveries on his techniques and materials – <b>supports,</b> <b>preparatory</b> layers, underdrawings, and pigments – will be illustrated through different examples of his work. This evidence, seen in conjunction with the evidence of the transfer technique, allows us to distinguish his production from that of rival copyists. The realisation that Brueghel the Younger’s copies of the same composition are not all alike and that there are often several variants of them will be considered in relation to the organization of work within – and possibly outside – his workshop. This issue, examined alongside that of the attribution of the copies within series, gives us a more nuanced view of Brueghel the Younger’s output and working practice. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionFollowing World Health Organization {{recommendations}} {{set forth}} in the Global Framework for Immunization Monitoring and Surveillance, Costa Rica in 2009 became the first country to implement integrated vaccine-preventable disease (iVPD) surveillance, with support from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). As surveillance for diseases prevented by new vaccines is integrated into existing surveillance systems, these systems could cost more than routine surveillance for VPDs targeted by the Expanded Program on Immunization. ObjectivesWe estimate the costs associated with establishing and subsequently operating the iVPD surveillance system at a pilot site in Costa Rica. MethodsWe retrospectively collected data on costs incurred by the institutions supporting iVPD surveillance during the preparatory (January 2007 through August 2009) and implementation (September 2009 through August 2010) phases of the iVPD surveillance project in Costa Rica. These data were used to estimate costs for personnel, meetings, infrastructure, office equipment and supplies, transportation, and laboratory facilities. Costs incurred by each of the collaborating institutions were also estimated. ResultsDuring the preparatory phase, the estimated total cost was 128, 000 U. S. dollars (US$), including 64 % for personnel costs. The <b>preparatory</b> phase was <b>supported</b> by CDC and PAHO. The estimated cost for 1 year of implementation was US$ 420, 000, including 58 % for personnel costs, 28 % for laboratory costs, and 14 % for meeting, infrastructure, office, and transportation costs combined. The national reference laboratory and the PAHO Costa Rica office incurred 64 % of total costs, and other local institutions supporting iVPD surveillance incurred the remaining 36 %. ConclusionsCountries planning to implement iVPD surveillance will require adequate investments in human resources, laboratories, data management, reporting, and investigation. Our findings will be valuable for decision makers and donors planning and implementing similar strategies in other countries.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to address the problem of high school {{students}} graduating unprepared for the rigors of college and a career. This study centered on the relationships and processes needed to implement a public high school pilot internship program to offer interested students a work-based learning opportunity. A key element of the study included student perceptions to inform best practices in order to grow the pilot program in scale for the 2015 school year. As colleges, employers, and students themselves complain about readiness post-high school, and literature concerning work-based learning opportunities continues to grow, it seemed the perfect time to conduct this study. La Playa High School identified a gap in this area of education and school leadership agreed that this program would provide a great opportunity for interested students. 	The aims of the study were self-directed learning, skills development, and adult mentorship. The Partnership for 21 st Century Skills model was used to identify skills within the program as it aligned with current school language as well as with leading educational scholars who study 21 st century education approaches. The evidence supported a positive growth in skills from the students, better self-advocacy, and lessons about getting to deeper learning 	Students helped identify a different understanding of self-directed learning, one that included <b>preparatory</b> education and <b>support</b> which afforded a more effective experience at the internship site. Although most of the students performed well in school and had strong family networks, very few were truly ready to engage with adults in a real, accountable environment. A disconnect was discovered between conceptual knowledge and practical application. At-risk students were targeted, but few enrolled. The demographics of the class reinforced the dynamics of the school. 	Findings indicated definitions with relevant research, prepared guest speakers using the same language with personal experiences, small and large group discussions, modeling exercises and reflective, and directed journal prompts offered a strong combination to get at deeper learning opportunities for program students. Lastly, the evidence reinforced the role and expectations of site mentors who overwhelmingly wanted to be connected to the school’s aims yet felt not enough information was passed to them. Aligning mentors early with program goals can more quickly assist in student self-advocacy...|$|R
40|$|The {{high level}} of {{complexity}} that usually characterises extended public projects should induce local authorities to use Problem Structuring Methods (PSM) in their initial stages, during which the decision problems and processes have to be structured, the uncertainties have to be analyzed and controlled and the project feasibility has to be verified. At this early stages it is crucial not only to correctly identify the nature of uncertainties, key decision problems, priorities {{and all of the}} links between the different choices, but also to have a clear, complete and unambiguous overview of the project context which sets out the actual role and potential interests of the actors and organizations potentially affected by the project. This contribute presents a methodological advance for improving project feasibility studies based on a possible integration between the Strategic Choice Approach (SCA) [1] and the Community Impact Analysis (CIA) [2], assuming that a single methodology could be empowered by means of its integration with other complementary approaches. SCA, which is proposed by [3] as a method for complex and unstructured decision problems, is normally used to support collaborative decision makers in structuring and managing possible phases of the future decision-making process, as a sort of preliminary guidelines in the feasibility study that help to identify the key decision problems that need to be faced and to reduce uncertainties. The CIA is here proposed as a possible tool to complement SCA: the integrated application of these two tools constitutes a methodological proposal for a new way of studying the feasibility of complex regional projects, in which it is difficult or premature to involve public or private actors, but where awareness of the potential negative or positive impacts that the stakeholders might perceive is essential to structure the decision process and guarantee the project feasibility itself. Such integration of SCA and CIA methodologies is an interesting proposal, as it improves the problem structuring potentialities of SCA and makes more operational the role of CIA of riding over the difficulty of knowing the nature and the interests of a complex actor network. An application, in relation to a complex regional public project in north-west Italy, is proposed as an example of this approach and its possible use in complex decision-making contexts, where this kind of analysis represents a crucial <b>preparatory</b> stage to <b>support</b> the strategies of the regional authority concerned to correctly evaluate the project's implementation and feasibilit...|$|R
40|$|The mind {{altering}} and regulative {{effects of}} substances affect the caregiver incompatible with sensitive caregiving. Thoughts and emotions often circle around substances and substance-related physical symptoms instead of {{attending to the}} emotions and practicalities of childcare. The parent becomes unpredictable and “out of sync” with the infant in ways that potentially threaten child development and secure attachment. This dissertation was motivated by a search for better preventive strategies for children-at-risk because of parental problems of substance addiction. The overarching aim was to investigate how the parents themselves, {{based on the assumption}} that understanding the parental perspective is necessary in any intervention, experienced parenthood and addiction. The work is grounded in the philosophy of science of critical realism. The parents’ experiences are discussed from a psychodynamic, an ethical, and a gender perspective. Sixteen women and eight men participated in focus group discussions and interviews. The qualitative data have been analysed according to Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) (Eatough & Smith, 2008), resulting in four papers based on the following four questions: 1. What kind of theoretical framework can support a study of parenthood and addiction, bearing the child in mind? 2. How does substance abuse influence the mental preparation for motherhood during pregnancy? 3. How do women with addiction experience mandatory placement during pregnancy, and what ethical dilemmas do their experiences expose? 4. How do men with drug addiction experience fatherhood? Paper I, “Minding the baby”, outlines the theoretical and conceptual framework of the dissertation. The mentalizing theoretical model, rooted in several scientific disciplines and traditions, is seen as an integrative theory with explanatory power of problems of addiction, the psychology of parenthood, and child development. The clinical adaptations of the mentalizing theory added to the perceived usefulness of this framework. However, to grasp the complexity of the issue under study, sociocultural theory supplemented the conceptual framework to account for the role of participation in developing caregiving competence, and to give due attention to structural and cultural influences. Paper II, “Mental preparation for motherhood”, describes the subjective experience of the “journey” through pregnancy towards the role of a mother. A prominent finding was that awareness of the symptoms of pregnancy was often delayed and distorted. Also, being high and occupied with drugs and drug-related problems, and fear of not living up to the expectations of the professionals, influenced the psychological preparation. In some of these women, severe feelings of guilt, which otherwise serve to adjust negative behaviour (Elvin- Novak, 1999), contributed to continued use of substances. The experience of ambivalence runs like a red thread through the findings. Ambivalence as a clinical issue is discussed. Paper III, “Pregnancy and substance use – the Norwegian § 10 - 3 solution”, uses two cases to discuss ethical dilemmas in interventions that involve elements of coercion. The § 10 - 3 of the Municipal Health and Care Services Act give access to incarceration of pregnant women when intake of substances are seen as a serious threat to the foetus. The findings confirm those of Paper II in terms of a surface adaptation and fear of the evaluations of the professionals, which might compromise the preparation for the caregiving role. The bioethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and social justice (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009), come up short as a tool to solve the many dilemmas of the situation. A more relationally oriented framework based on mutual respect and trust, and interpersonal and communicative competences, is suggested as an alternative. Paper IV, “The good, the bad, and the invisible father”, describes how men with problems of addiction think about themselves, and how they find themselves mirrored as fathers. A common experience was being the weaker parent and left out of the child and domestic sphere. Gendered roles in the family, a feminized social service, and more sceptisism toward men’s motives and their ability to change are described as obstacles to a present and participating fathering role. The findings are discussed in relation to two opposing discourses of modern fatherhood, the present and the absent father. Fathers’ experiences of being weak and/or invisible call for more attention to the fathering role of men with problems of addiction. The four papers illustrate how parenthood and problems of substance addiction collide and result in a dominant experience of ambivalence. Parents feel pulled between hope and despair, between the forces of addiction and the wish to be a good parent. Ambivalence is further strenghtened by professional and sociological ambivalence. This, together with a sense of insecurity from being under critical examination can result in surface adaptation and endanger the mental <b>preparatory</b> work to <b>support</b> parenthood and caregiving. The unique opportunity for change during early parenthood is threatened by the dynamics of addiction, impingemements on supportive relationships, stigma and social exclusion. A familyoriented approach where the professional helping relationship is used to enhance sensitive caregiving and parental mentalizing is suggested to facilitate healthy child development as well as parental sobriety. The findings indicate a need to further thematize and support men´s development of caregiving competence. Finally, parenthood and addiction requires a complex explanatory model with generative mechanisms at several domains and levels: biological, psychological, relational as well as the larger social, political and structural conditions.
