5000|$|Gooden {{suffered}} {{a shoulder injury}} in 1989, which reduced him to a 9-4 record in 17 starts. He rebounded in 1990, posting a 19-7 season with 223 strikeouts, second only to teammate David Cone's 233. However, after another injury in 1991, Gooden's career declined significantly. Though drug abuse is commonly blamed for Gooden's <b>pitching</b> <b>troubles,</b> some analysts point to his early workload. It {{has been estimated that}} Gooden threw over 10,800 pitches from 1983 to 1985, a period in which he was just 18 to 20 years old. [...] Gooden hurled 276 innings in his historic 1985 season; in the 20 years since, only two pitchers have reached that amount (Charlie Hough, a knuckleballer, and Roger Clemens, both in 1987). By the time he reached his 21st birthday, Gooden had already accumulated 928 strikeouts between both the minor and major leagues.|$|R
50|$|Kennedy never {{generated}} enough pace off the <b>pitch</b> to <b>trouble</b> {{the highest}} quality opposition on good pitches. His failure against the Australians in 1921 was taken to show conclusively {{that he would have}} been as ineffective as most English spinners on hard, flat Australian pitches. Even when English bowling was at its weakest Kennedy was never in contention for an Ashes tour.|$|R

50|$|The only {{occasion}} {{on which}} Griffin Park {{has been closed}} due to crowd trouble was following a Third Division South match versus Brighton & Hove Albion on 12 September 1925. Ill-feeling on the <b>pitch</b> sparked <b>trouble</b> on the terraces and following the referee's report, the FA closed the ground for 14 days. The following home match against Crystal Palace was moved to Selhurst Park, where Brentford suffered a 2-0 defeat and dropped to bottom place in the Football League.|$|R
5000|$|In 1949, the Phillies enjoyed {{their first}} winning season since 1932, winning 81 games and {{finishing}} third. Following {{the final game}} of the season Sawyer told his team: “We are going to win it all in 1950. Come back next year ready to win.” [...] On opening day 1950, the Phillies debuted the red pinstripe uniform the team still wears today. Sawyer had designed it after concluding that “the old uniforms were terrible looking.” The NL pennant was up for grabs that season. The 1949 champion Brooklyn Dodgers suffered from <b>pitching</b> <b>troubles</b> and the outbreak of the Korean War had disrupted Major League rosters. The Phillies charged into the league lead and, despite a late-September tailspin, partially caused by the loss of Simmons to military service, they held off Brooklyn in the season's final game as Sisler's tenth-inning home run sealed a 4-1 victory. With 91 victories against 63 losses, the Phillies had won their first pennant since 1915. [...] However, in the 1950 World Series they were no match for the Yankees, who swept them in four low-scoring games. [...] After the season, Sawyer was named [...] "manager of the year" [...] in the Associated Press' poll of sports writers and sports broadcasters.|$|R

50|$|Gálvez {{displayed}} a distinct pitching form in Japan, often releasing the ball while sticking out his tongue. He had a mid-90 mph fastball and surprisingly good control.

He also showed frequent dissatisfaction with ball and strike calls; a trait which would lead him into clashes with opposing teams and umpires.|$|R

With 15dismissals, Tremlett {{finished}} as the leading wicket-taker in the series on either side. India toured in July for four Tests, five ODIs, and a T20I. Selected for the opening match of the Test series, Tremlett took 4/124 in England's victory, extracting bounce from the Lord's <b>pitch</b> to <b>trouble</b> the Indian batsmen. However, he was hampered by injury with a hamstring problem {{on the fourth day}} of the first Test and a back spasm during pre-match training ahead of the second Test. The back injury prevented Tremlett from playing any further part in the series. In September, for the first time Tremlett was awarded one of 13 central contracts with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) until September 2012.|$|R

Of course it was not real; no such black, easterly day as this had yet begun to be; Judge Pyncheon had not talked with, her.

Shortly before the completion of the first time the numerical balance changed the match, when Andić after a foul on Efrem, he saw ... yellow, the second of the game and was eliminated. The Bosnian defender should not be charged on the first yellow, since it seemed to make theater, as considered by Stelios Tryphonos. From early in the second half Omonia tried to push the advantage of the numerical advantage, but the greatest chance until that point of the mach has lost the Roncatto (51'), who shot from the level of penalty and he sent the ball out [...] Kvirkvelia (61') shortly after entering the game from great vantage sent the ball over the Georgallides. The answer came with Omonia the crossbar to direct foul of Avraam (63'), while Salatić header (64') came out slightly. Even with less Anorthosis player with good inhibitory function is not allowed in Omonia be particularly threatening, and again went on the offensive foul with Laborde to result in his arms Georgallides.

50|$|Patients {{with either}} vocal fold paresis or {{paralysis}} may exhibit a breathy voice quality. This voice quality results from the increased activity of the vocal folds {{to compensate for the}} immobility of the PCA muscle(s). Patients may need to use more effort than normal when speaking and may find that their voice quiets or grows tired after speaking for a long time. This is known as vocal fatigue. Patients may also complain about having a limited <b>pitch</b> range and <b>trouble</b> varying their <b>pitch</b> at quick rate. It is often difficult for the speaker to project their voice and speak loud enough to be heard in noisy environments, over background noise, or when speaking to someone from a distance. It is possible for symptoms to surface only in situations where the environmental acoustics are poor, such as outdoors. Patients may report feeling pain in the throat or experiencing bouts of choking. A patient presenting with diplophonia is of major concern as this typically means that the mass and tension of their vocal folds are asymmetrical which may also indicate vocal fold paresis.|$|R

[...] Samm Levine had originally been selected to voice Kyle, but the character was recast because, as show producer Seth MacFarlane comments, [...] "it seemed a lot funnier when Peter was beating up a kid if he was younger and more defenseless." [...] A deleted scene had been made which showed Chris asking for money and stating [...] "I spent my last ten bucks on a ham costume," [...] and Peter replying with [...] "it's just sitting there right now, {{but you know what}} the great thing is, it's just three months until Halloween and I am done." [...] Peter's ancestor shown preparing to wrestle with a kangaroo was described by Seth MacFarlane to be [...] "a very strange gag," [...] which was added after the other parts of the episode had been created. Quagmire's profanity-laced tirade during the golf game was bleeped out on TV, but uncensored on DVD. The scene of Stewie remembering the time the Griffins had a nymphomaniac from Wisconsin in their attic was edited as FOX objected to the sounds of the woman having an orgasm being shown over a shot of a wide-awake Stewie.|$|R
