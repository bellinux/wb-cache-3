40|$|BACKGROUND—In a {{previous}} case report, {{it was shown}} that an increase in <b>plasma</b> colloid osmotic <b>pressure</b> induced by the removal of fluid during haemodialysis was instrumental in decreasing intraocular pressure. The relation between changes in intraocular <b>pressure,</b> <b>plasma</b> osmolarity, <b>plasma</b> colloid osmotic <b>pressure,</b> and body weight before and after haemodialysis is evaluated.  METHODS—Intraocular <b>pressure,</b> <b>plasma</b> osmolarity, <b>plasma</b> colloid osmotic <b>pressure,</b> and body weight were evaluated before and after haemodialysis in 36  patients.  RESULTS—Intraocular <b>pressure</b> and <b>plasma</b> osmolarity both decreased significantly after haemodialysis (p< 0. 0001). <b>Plasma</b> colloid osmotic <b>pressure</b> increased significantly after haemodialysis (p< 0. 0001). Body weight decreased significantly because of the removal of fluid during haemodialysis (p< 0. 0001). No significant correlation {{was found between the}} change in intraocular pressure and that in plasma osmolarity (r=− 0. 206, p= 0. 2297), whereas the change in intraocular pressure was correlated with the change in <b>plasma</b> colloid osmotic <b>pressure</b> (r=− 0. 510, p= 0. 0012) and the change in body weight (r= 0. 534, p= 0. 0006).

2500|$|Filament {{cavities}} are cooler {{clouds of}} gases (plasma) suspended above the Sun's surface by magnetic forces. The regions of intense magnetic field look dark in images {{because they are}} empty of hot plasma. In fact, {{the sum of the}} magnetic pressure and <b>plasma</b> <b>pressure</b> must be constant everywhere on the heliosphere in order to have an equilibrium configuration: where the magnetic field is higher, the plasma must be cooler or less dense. The <b>plasma</b> <b>pressure</b> [...] can be calculated by the state equation of a perfect gas [...] , where [...] is the particle number density, [...] the Boltzmann constant and [...] the plasma temperature.

2500|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} these reactions, {{in addition to the}} reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum <b>plasma</b> <b>pressure</b> it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that /T2 is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product nTτ required for ignition is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to /T2 (see Lawson criterion). (A plasma is [...] "ignited" [...] if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of /T2 at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.|$|E

We compare {{more than three years}} of Geotail data with 10 consecutive days of simulation results driven by real solar wind data. Both studies have statistically similar solar wind inputs and a plasma sheet definition that follows from criteria that are widely used in the literature. We map the average <b>plasma</b> <b>pressures,</b> fields, and flows as functions ofXY(GSM) position within the equatorial plasma sheet. The comparisons show a persistent dawn–dusk asymmetry in the statistical patterns of plasma flows and electric fields in both the Geotail and the simulation results. Geotail observes a less rapid fall-off of thermal pressure with downtail distance than is seen in the simulation. The Geotail dataset suffers from an orbital bias, but we show the dawn–dusk asymmetry persists after accounting for the bias. Overall, our study finds similar statistical <b>plasma</b> <b>pressures,</b> magnetic pressures, and perpendicular flows in Geotail measurements, and the LFM MHD regions of the plasma sheet...|$|R

2500|$|Boron {{was used}} at many {{locations}} in this dry system; {{it has a}} high cross-section for the absorption of slow neutrons, which fission U and Pu, but a low cross-section for the absorption of fast neutrons, which fission U. Because of this characteristic, B deposited {{onto the surface of}} the secondary stage would prevent predetonation of the sparkplug by stray neutrons from the primary without interfering with the subsequent fissioning of the U of the fusion tamper wrapping the secondary. Boron also played a role in increasing the compressive <b>plasma</b> <b>pressure</b> around the secondary by blocking the sputtering effect, leading to higher thermonuclear efficiency. Because the structural foam holding the secondary in place within the casing was doped with B, the secondary was compressed more highly, at a cost of some radiated neutrons. An example of the usefulness of B can be seen {{by the fact that the}} fizzled Castle Koon MORGENSTERN device didn't use it in its design. As a result, the intense neutron flux from its RACER IV primary pre-detonated the spherical fission sparkplug, which in turn [...] "cooked" [...] the fusion fuel, leading to an overall poor compression. It should be noted, that the plastic's low molecular weight is unable to implode the secondary's mass. Its plasma-pressure is confined in the boiled-off sections of the tamper and the radiation case so that material from neither of these two walls can enter the radiation channel that has to be open for the radiation transit.|$|E
