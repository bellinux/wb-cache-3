50|$|The Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre (India), or CSDIC (I) for short, was the Indian {{branch of}} the CSDIC, {{established}} during World War II. Established along with the <b>parent</b> <b>section</b> {{at the start of}} hostilities in Europe, the branch developed as an important tool for interrogation of enemy troops and informant from November 1942, when the first information emerged of the nascent Indian National Army. The organisation formed a part of the Jiffs campaign, and was initially tasked with identifying Indian troops at risk of defecting to the INA. By {{the end of the war}} its task had evolved into interrogating INA soldiers captured in Burma and Malaya, interrogating them regardless of rank and identifying soldiers as white grey or black on the basis of their commitment to Subhas Chandra Bose and Azad Hind. The classifications was to be important in rehabilitating INA soldiers into the British-Indian Army. Col. Hugh Toye, who worked with the unit, later went on to pen the first subtantive history on the INA in his book 1959 book The Springing Tiger.|$|E

40|$|Parental Alienation Syndrome (PAS) is a {{childhood}} disorder that arises {{almost exclusively in}} child custody disputes. Its primary manifestation is the unjustified rejection of a once-loved parent by a child due {{to a combination of}} the 'programming' parent's alienating techniques and the child's own contributions to the vilification of the targeted parent. Parental Alienation (PA) is differentiated from PAS {{as in the case of}} the former the child's rejection is justified and may be explained either by normal developmental behaviours or by child abuse that involves no form of programming. The purpose of this study is to develop a preliminary interview protocol to aid in the detection of PAS, with a special emphasis on differentiating false allegations of abuse, which usually accompany severe PAS, from true abuse. The aim of the study is to develop a protocol to enhance diagnostic clarity and facilitate appropriate custody-related recommendations. The interview protocol is based on an extensive thematic literature analysis in conjunction with existing guidelines for conducting a child custody and visitation interview. The interview protocol comprises a child and <b>parent</b> <b>section,</b> which both have their own reference tables with supporting corresponding information. The protocol 's administration instructions are outlined in a covering information page. Rigour was added to the protocol by having it assessed for clarity and accessibility by four medico-legal professionals with custody-related experience, and their opinions regarding the protocol's structure, sections, questions and reference tables were taken into consideration in the revision of the protocol.

40|$|We {{test whether}} {{physiological}} integration enhances the short-term fitness of the clonal herb Hydrocotyle peduncularis (Apiaceae, R. Brown ex A. Richards) subjected to spatial variation in water availability. Our measures of fitness and {{costs and benefits}} {{are based on the}} relative growth rate of fragmented genets. Physiological integration over a gradient in soil moisture resulted in a highly significant net benefit to genet growth of 0. 015 g g – 1 day – 1. This net benefit represents a significant enhancement of the average fitness of fragmented genets spanning the moisture gradient relative to the average of those growing in homogeneous moist or dry conditions. Sections of genet fragments growing in dry conditions in spatially heterogeneous treatments had significantly higher growth than the sections they were connected to that were growing in moist conditions. Within fragments, older (<b>parent)</b> <b>sections</b> growing in moist conditions experienced significant costs from connection to younger (offspring) sections growing in dry conditions. In contrast, offspring sections with ample water did not experience any costs when connected to <b>parent</b> <b>sections</b> growing in dry conditions. However, the net benefit of physiological integration was similar for <b>parent</b> and offspring <b>sections,</b> suggesting that <b>parent</b> and offspring <b>sections</b> contributed equally to the net benefit of physiological integration to genet growth and short-term fitness...|$|R

40|$|This volume {{presents}} {{the first comprehensive}} collection of writings by expatriate Czech artist, Pavel Büchler alongside extensive contextual material. As a teacher, critic and occasional curator Büchler has made significant interventions into debates {{about the history of}} photography, theories of media, the paradoxes of art education and artistic research, the peculiarities of art as a form of work, and the politics and poetics of ‘making nothing happen’ Spanning three decades, the selections are pooled in three <b>parent</b> <b>sections</b> that together cover seven thematic areas: Section One – includes a sample of Büchler’s exhibitions, book reviews and a spread of his more systematic writings on analogue media and their afterlives in our digital age. Section Two – gathers articles and lecture scripts on the topic of teaching art and design and interventions into cultural theory with a small ‘t’. Section Three – presents a selection of more discursive, formally playful contributions to catalogues and artists’ pages as well as an extensive new interview prepared during winter 2014 – 15 for this book. Between each of these sections are Editor’s Notes, which focus on the poetic status of language in the foreground of Büchler’s gallery works, to loop attention back to the interplay between what he writes about art and what he writes in his art.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} new philosophy, The Faith Web, {{as a method}} to validate relationships and provide reciprocal social capital between people {{for the sake of}} building Christian community, support, and formation. Section 1 describes the ideals of Christian community and examines the ways these ideals are not realized. Special attention is paid to relationship voids caused by death, divorce, fatherlessness, and absenteeism of <b>parents.</b> <b>Section</b> 2 examines the communal life of ancient Israel and the present day community that occurs in Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) and Social Networking Sites (SNS). This juxtaposition draws upon the strength of both approaches of community. Section 3 argues for the leveraging of the networked relationships inherent within a local congregation and to expand and strengthen these connections. Establishing The Faith Web draws upon Joseph Myers’ work on belonging and Paul Baran’s work that led to the birth of the Internet. Intentional faith webbing will lead to the growth of social capital in the lives of youth, children, and adults. Sections 4 and 5 describe the creation of a Social Media website, thefaithweb. org, that provides a space for faith webbing to take place in a digital medium. This dissertation aims to show that spiritual formation and discipleship occur most authentically in community and that The Faith Web is an effective way to enhance community, generate a sense of belonging, and mitigate relationship voids...|$|R
50|$|There was an evident overlap, {{the court}} found, between the rights created by {{sections}} 26 and 27 and those conferred on children by section 28. This overlap was {{not consistent with}} the notion that section 28(1)(c) created separate and independent rights for children and their <b>parents.</b> <b>Section</b> 28 as a whole ensured that children were properly cared for by their parents or families, and that they received appropriate alternative care in the absence of family or parental care; it also encapsulated the conception of the scope of care that children were to receive in society. Through legislation and the common law, the obligation to provide shelter in subsection (1)(c) was imposed primarily on the parents or family and only alternatively on the State. The subsection therefore did not create any primary State obligation to provide shelter on demand to parents and their children if the children were being cared for by their parents or families. The State did, however, have to provide the legal and administrative infrastructure necessary to ensure that children were accorded the protection contemplated by section 28. Its obligation in this regard would normally be fulfilled by passing laws creating enforcement mechanisms for the maintenance of children, their protection from maltreatment, abuse, neglect or degradation and other forms of abuse, and in addition providing families with access to land, adequate housing and services.|$|R

Currently no valid and reliable instrument is available to measure these negative influences in very young children. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) to measure the OHRQL of preschool children and their families. Methods Twenty-two health professionals evaluated a pool of 45 items that assess the impact of oral health problems on 6 - 14 -year-old children and their families. The health professionals identified 36 items as relevant to preschool children. Thirty parents rated the importance of these 36 items to preschool children; 13 (9 child and 4 family) items were considered important. The 13 -item ECOHIS was administered to 295 parents of 5 -year-old children to assess construct validity and internal consistency reliability (using Cronbach's alpha). Test-retest reliability was evaluated among another sample of parents (N = 46) using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results ECOHIS scores on the child and <b>parent</b> <b>sections</b> indicating worse quality of life were significantly associated with fair or poor parental ratings of their child's general and oral health, and the presence of dental disease in the child.
