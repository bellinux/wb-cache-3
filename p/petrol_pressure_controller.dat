In some cases, the <b>pressure</b> <b>controller</b> is designed for improving the control performance of pneumatic position servo system [7 – 9]. In Ref. [7], a position control for a rodless cylinder was investigated. The proposed controller had an inner linearization pressure control loop and an outer position control loop. A PID controller with feedback linearization was used in the pressure control loop to nullify the nonlinearity arising from the compressibility of air. Noritsugu et al. [8] investigated a positioning control system with pressure control loop for improving control performance. A disturbance observer was employed to improve the pressure response and compensate the influence of friction force and parameter change. Igo et al.

In this paper, an adaptive robust <b>pressure</b> <b>controller</b> is designed to enhance the tracking accuracy of pressure trajectory in the chamber when the pneumatic cylinder is moving.

40|$|Background: Inflation and {{assessment}} of the endotracheal tube cuff pressure is often not appreciated as a critical aspect of endotracheal intubation. Appropriate endotracheal tube cuff pressure, endotracheal intubation seals the airway to prevent aspiration and provides for positive-pressure ventilation without air leak. Materials and Methods: Correlations between manual methods of assessing the pressure by an experienced anesthesiologists {{and assessment}} with maintenance of the pressure within the normal range by the automated <b>pressure</b> <b>controller</b> device were studied in 100 patients divided into two groups. In Group M, endotracheal tube cuff was inflated manually by a trained anesthesiologist and checked for its pressure hourly by cuff pressure monitor {{till the end of}} surgery. In Group C, endotracheal tube cuff was inflated by automated cuff <b>pressure</b> <b>controller</b> and <b>pressure</b> was maintained at 25 -cm H 2 O throughout the surgeries. Repeated measure ANOVA was applied. Results: Repeated measure ANOVA results showed that average of endotracheal tube cuff pressure of 50 patients taken at seven different points is significantly different (F-value: 171. 102, P-value: 0. 000). Bonferroni correction test shows that average of endotracheal tube cuff pressure in all six groups are significantly different from constant group (P = 0. 000). No case of laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, tracheal stenosis, tracheoesophageal fistula or aspiration pneumonitis was observed. Conclusions: Endotracheal tube cuff pressure was significantly high when endotracheal tube cuff was inflated manually. The known complications of high endotracheal tube cuff pressure can be avoided if the cuff <b>pressure</b> <b>controller</b> device is used and manual methods cannot be relied upon for keeping the pressure within the recommended levels...|$|R
40|$|Background Cyclic {{redistribution}} of air within the cuff during respiratory pressure changes creates a self-sealing mechanism which allows tracheal sealing, despite tracheal airway pressure being above baseline cuff inflation pressure. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the effect of continuous automated cuff pressure regulation on tracheal sealing during cyclic respiratory pressure changes. Methods In vitro tracheal sealing was studied in four different high volume-low pressure (HVLP) tracheal tube cuffs size internal diameter 8. 0 and 5. 0 mm in combination with a conventional pressure manometer and two different automated <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers</b> (VBM Cuff Controller; Cuff Pressure Control Tracoe™). Experiments were performed at 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm H 2 O cuff pressure during intermittent positive pressure ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures of 20 and 25 cm H 2 O. Air leakage was assessed spirometrically. Experiments were performed four times with each tube brand and size with two exemplars of each of the three cuff <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers.</b> Results Owing to immediate cuff pressure correction, tracheal sealing at cuff pressure below inspiratory pressure was reduced in most of the tracheal tube cuffs, except in those with reduced sealing characteristics when using the Pressure Control Tracoe™ compared with the conventional pressure manometer and the VBM Cuff Controller. Tracheal sealing with the Pressure Control Tracoe™ comparable with the other two devices was only achieved at cuff pressures of 20 and 25 cm H 2 O. Conclusions Automated cuff <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers</b> with rapid <b>pressure</b> correction interfere with the self-sealing mechanism of high sealing HVLP tube cuffs and reduce their improved sealing characteristic...|$|R

40|$|Road safety {{has been}} the subject of {{interest}} for research from the time the first automotive was invented. Safety has been characterized by many factors but the most prominent is maintaining control over the vehicle motion in all situations. Modern safety systems especially Antilock Braking System (ABS) in combination with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) has brought down the uncontrollable occasions in driving and therefore, sheltering the passengers from accidents. This system ensures the control of the vehicle while braking in varying surface conditions by keeping the friction coefficient close to optimal which helps in preventing wheel lock up and minimizing the braking distance. The current methods employ complex heuristic rules and optimization is still required in algorithm development. The ABS provides reference pressure signals to be achieved in different wheel brake cylinders to a low level controller termed as the brake <b>pressure</b> <b>controller.</b> This low level controller needs to be as precise as possible considering the challenges of hydraulic line characteristics and unavailability of states. Some researchers have investigated this area earlier and there have been performance issues which are yet to be solved. Of these, the core issue was the inability of the controller to adapt to variable conditions. Hence, an adaptive control approach is proposed to this problem. The project aims to optimize the functioning of the brake <b>pressure</b> <b>controller.</b> This report will introduce the reader to the test vehicle and its braking system to be controlled. It will also identify the objectives of the controller and learn the limitations of the hydraulic circuit. Further, 2 models derived from the literature will be compared from analysis on experimental data. Finally, the formulation of adaptive control algorithm and the implementation strategy along with control of essential secondary components will be addressed.

40|$|Abstract [...] Tire {{pressure}} {{plays an}} important role in ensuring safe and economical driving. Even then, many vehicles with under inflated tires are observed to be on the road due to the unawareness of the fact that properly inflated tires can safe tire life up to 20 % which is nine months more of its life span. It can also save fuel from 4 % to 10 %, increase braking efficiency up to 20 %, lightens steering system and ease self steer. Improper maintenance and operation failure of air pressure kiosks are the main reason why users seldom inflate their tires at the gas stations. Besides that, long awaiting queue at the kiosk and not knowing the exactly required tire pressure of their own vehicle is another cause for tires running with improper pressure. Therefore, a method of how to ease the users to inflate their tires is engineered and invented.

40|$|The use of rotary left {{ventricular}} assist devices (LVADs) has extended to destination and recovery therapy for end-stage heart failure. Incidence of right ventricular failure while on LVAD support requires a second device be implanted {{to support the}} failing right ventricle. Without a commercially available implantable rotary right ventricular assist device, rotary LVADs are cannulated into the right heart and operation modified to provide suitable support for the pulmonary system. While this approach can alleviate the demand for transplant through long-term biventricular support, it uncovers a new challenge with respect to controller strategies for these dual device support systems.
