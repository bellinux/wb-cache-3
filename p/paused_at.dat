5|$|Having {{crossed into}} Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece. Five major food depots {{had been set}} up along the path: at White Headland on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, at Tyrodiza in Perinthian territory, at Doriskos at the Evros river estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the Balkan allies, at Eion on the Strymon river, and at Therme, modern-day Thessaloniki. There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in {{preparation}} for the campaign. Animals had been bought and fattened, while the local populations had, for several months, been ordered to grind the grains into flour. The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600km (360 mi). It <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.|$|E
5|$|Near the Ellipse, {{and within}} sight of the White House, the hearse halted and Reagan's body was {{transferred}} to a horse-drawn caisson for the procession down Constitution Avenue to Capitol Hill. Nancy Reagan stepped out of her limousine to witness the body's transfer; she was met with a warm greeting, including applause. The cortege began the 45-minute journey just after 6:00pm EST, with the Reagan family following in limousines. Military units escorted the caisson as it made its way to the sounds of muffled drums. Behind the caisson was a riderless horse named Sergeant York, carrying Reagan's riding boots reversed in the stirrups. The caisson <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> 4th Street and Constitution Avenue, where 21 Air Force F-15's from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, flew over in missing man formation.|$|E
50|$|In January 1888, the Sydney Mail was introduced, {{when first}} class {{sleeping}} cars {{were added to}} the Wallangarra train (Second class sleeping cars were introduced in 1896). A daily service was provided, departing Brisbane <b>at</b> 19:00, <b>pausing</b> <b>at</b> Toowoomba at 00:30 and arriving at Wallangarra at 07:45. The return service departed Wallangarra <b>at</b> 17:00, <b>pausing</b> <b>at</b> Toowoomba at 00:45 and arriving in Brisbane at 06:15. At Wallangarra passengers transferred to the New South Wales Government Railways' Brisbane Limited.|$|R

5|$|Late on Monday 4November, Catesby, John Wright and Bates {{left for}} the Midlands, ready for the planned uprising. That night Fawkes was {{discovered}} guarding the gunpowder in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords. As news of his arrest spread, the next day most of the conspirators still in London fled. Catesby's party, ignorant {{of what was happening}} in London, <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> Dunstable when his horse lost a shoe. When Rookwood caught them up and broke to them the news of Fawkes's arrest, the group, which now included Rookwood, Catesby, Bates, the Wright brothers and Percy, rode toward Dunchurch. At about 6:00pm that evening they reached Catesby's family home at Ashby St Ledgers, where his mother and Robert Wintour were staying. To keep his mother ignorant of their situation, Catesby sent a message asking Wintour to meet him {{at the edge of the}} town. The group continued to Dunchurch, where they met Digby and his hunting party and informed them that the king and Salisbury were dead, thus persuading them to continue with the plan.|$|E

40|$|NusA and NusG are {{transcription}} {{elongation factors}} that bind to RNA polymerase (RNAP) after Ïƒ subunit release. Escherichia coli NusA (NusAEc) stimulates intrinsic termination and RNAPEc pausing, whereas NusGEc promotes Rho-dependent termination and pause escape. Both Nus factors also {{participate in the}} formation of RNAPEc antitermination complexes. We showed that Bacillus subtilis NusA (NusABs) stimulates intrinsic termination and RNAPBs <b>pausing</b> <b>at</b> U 107 and U 144 in the trpEDCFBA operon leader. <b>Pausing</b> <b>at</b> U 107 and U 144 participates in the transcription attenuation and translational control mechanisms, respectively, presumably by providing additional time for trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) to bind to the nascent trp leader transcript. Here, we show that NusGBs causes modest <b>pause</b> stimulation <b>at</b> U 107 and dramatic <b>pause</b> stimulation <b>at</b> U 144. NusABs and NusGBs act synergistically to increase the U 107 and U 144 pause half-lives. NusGBs-stimulated <b>pausing</b> <b>at</b> U 144 requires RNAPBs, whereas NusABs stimulates pausing of RNAPBs and RNAPEc at the U 144 and E. coli his pause sites. Although NusGEc does not stimulate <b>pausing</b> <b>at</b> U 144, it competes with NusGBs-stimulated pausing, suggesting that both proteins bind to the same surface of RNAPBs. Inactivation of nusG results in the loss of RNAP <b>pausing</b> <b>at</b> U 144 in vivo and elevated trp operon expression, whereas plasmid-encoded NusG complements the mutant defects. Overexpression of nusG reduces trp operon expression to a larger extent than overexpression of nusA...|$|R

Some test subjects <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> 135 volts and began to question {{the purpose of the}} experiment. Most continued after being assured {{that they would not be}} held responsible. A few subjects began to laugh nervously or exhibit other signs of extreme stress once they heard the screams of pain coming from the learner.|$|E
25|$|As Morgan with 400 {{remaining}} men headed {{away from}} the river into the interior of southern Ohio, he <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> Nelsonville, a small town on the Hocking Canal. His men burned ten wooden canal boats and set a covered bridge ablaze to slow their pursuers. However, as soon as Morgan's raiders rode off, citizens rushed to save the burning span. Two hours later, Union cavalry arrived, delighted {{to find that the}} townspeople had prepared a feast for them.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 January, the 2/9th Battalion {{approached}} Sanananda village through swamp from the southwest. This unlikely approach was not strongly defended and the village fell by 1:00p.m. The battalion then cleared Sanananda Point and east to the Giruwa River before nightfall. The 127th Infantry Regiment, having <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> Konombi Creek recommenced its advance on 16 January and made steady progress, taking Giruwa on 21 January and linked with the Australians already on the Giruwa River.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the start}} of Operation Olive, Eighth Army had {{suffered}} 14,000 casualties. As a result, British battalions had to be reduced from four to three rifle companies due to a severe shortage of manpower. Facing the Eighth Army LXXVI Panzer Corps had suffered 16,000 casualties. As the Eighth Army <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> the end of September to reorganise Leese was reassigned to command the Allied land forces in South-East Asia, and Lieutenant-General Richard L. McCreery was moved from commanding British X Corps {{to take over the}} army command.|$|E
25|$|The unfurling of the arrays {{started at}} 15:06 UTC, {{beginning}} with the channel 1B array. Commanding the unit from the station, Philips <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> the halfway point, and allowed the array {{to rest in the}} sun for approximately 45 minutes, and then completed the extension. After successfully extending the 1B array, the astronauts started the 3B array extension at 16:35 UTC. The 3B array was expected to be more difficult to extend, as it had been packed in the blanket box for eight years. As with the first, a pause at halfway was performed to allow the arrays to heat up in the sun. While some stiction was seen, once the final extension began all the slats flattened out, and the arrays were fully deployed at 17:17 UTC. The addition of the final set of solar panels brings the station's power output to 120 kilowatts, and doubles the scientific power to 30 kilowatts. The station's surface area of the arrays is just under one acre, or 38,400 square feet.|$|E
25|$|The Army of Tennessee camped for the night, {{unaware that}} the Union army had slipped from their grasp. Bragg {{was not able to}} mount the kind of pursuit that would have been {{necessary}} to cause Rosecrans significant further damage. Many of his troops had arrived hurriedly at Chickamauga by rail, without wagons to transport them, and many of the artillery horses had been injured or killed during the battle. The Tennessee River was now an obstacle to the Confederates and Bragg had no pontoon bridges to effect a crossing. Bragg's army <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> Chickamauga to reorganize and gather equipment lost by the Union army. Although Rosecrans had been able to save most of his trains, large quantities of ammunition and arms had been left behind. Army of Tennessee historian Thomas L. Connelly has criticized Bragg's performance, claiming that for over four hours on the afternoon of September 20, he missed several good opportunities to prevent the Union escape, such as by a pursuit up the Dry Valley Road to McFarland's Gap, or by moving a division (such as Cheatham's) around Polk to the north to seize the Rossville Gap or McFarland's Gap via the Reed's Bridge Road.|$|E

25|$|Ever {{since an}} impromptu {{procession}} formed around Jefferson's second inauguration, every United States president except Ronald Reagan has paraded down the Avenue {{after taking the}} oath of office (Reagan paraded up the avenue for his first inauguration, in 1981, but not for the second in 1985 because of freezing temperatures which high winds made it dangerous). From William Henry Harrison to Gerald Ford, the funeral corteges of seven of the eight presidents who died in office and two former presidents followed this route. Franklin Roosevelt was the only president who died in office whose cortege did not follow this route. Lyndon B. Johnson and Ford were the former presidents whose funeral cortege followed this route. For LBJ, it was along the route from the Capitol to the National City Christian Church, where he worshiped often, because the funeral was held there. Ford's went up Pennsylvania Avenue because it <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> the White House en route to the Washington National Cathedral, where the funeral was held. Abraham Lincoln's funeral cortege solemnly proceeded along Pennsylvania Avenue in 1865; only weeks later the end of the American Civil War was celebrated when the Army of the Potomac paraded more joyously along the avenue.|$|E
25|$|She {{spent the}} rest of 1979 and {{the first two weeks of}} 1980 in port engaged in post-deployment leave and upkeep. The ship resumed normal {{operations}} on 14 January when she put to sea to participate in READEX 1-80. En route to Puerto Rico, she <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> Onslow Beach for four days from 15 to 19 January to allow reservists to train in LVT operations. Underway again on 20 January, she proceeded to Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, where she arrived four days later. Barnstable County spent the night of 24 January in port after loading four drones and proceeded the next day to the Mobil Sea Range, near the Bahamas. Upon successfully launching and completing the portion of an air exercise, she returned to Roosevelt Roads to unload the drone launching equipment and refuel before get underway for Freeport in the Bahamas for a five-day liberty call at the beginning of February. The ship returned to Little Creek on 14 February. There, she spent the next 12 days preparing to be visited by a board of inspection and survey. She got underway briefly on 28 and 29 February to load ammunition. Back at Little Creek on 1 March, she completed her preparations for the inspection only to have it canceled by record snow storms. The ship remained busy, however, getting ready to deploy overseas.|$|E

The collision caused serious damage to Constitutions stern, bow, and figurehead. Two of the captured ships were sent to Malta with Constitution; President sailed to Syracuse, Sicily, arriving on 27August.|$|E
