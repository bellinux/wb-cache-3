40|$|In {{many areas}} of the world {{accessing}} professional physicians ‘when needed/as needed’ might not be always possible for a variety of reasons. Therefore, in such cases a targeted e-Health solution to safeguard patient long-term health could be a meaningful approach. Today’s modern healthcare technologies, often built around electronic and computer-based equipment, require an access to a reliable electricity supply. Many healthcare technologies and products also presume access to the high speed internet is available, making them unsuitable for use in areas where there is no fixed-line internet connectivity, access is slow, unreliable and expensive, yet where the most benefit to patients may be gained. In this paper a full mobile sensor platform is presented, based around readily-purchased consumer components, to facilitate a low cost and efficient means of monitoring the health of patients with <b>prosthetic</b> <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> This platform is designed such that it can also be operated in a standalone mode i. e. in the absence of internet connectivity, thereby making it suitable to the developing world. Also, to counter the challenge of power supply issues in e-Health monitoring, a self-contained rechargeable solution to the platform is proposed and demonstrated. The platform works with an Android mobile device, in order to allow for the capture of data from a wireless sensor unit, and to give the clinician access to results from the sensors. The results from the analysis, carried out within the platform’s Raspberry Pi Zero, are demonstrated to be of use for remote monitoring. This is specifically targeted for monitoring the tissue health of lower limb amputees. The monitoring of residual limb temperature and gait can be a useful indicator of tissue viability in lower limb amputees especially those suffering from diabetes. We describe a route wherein non-invasive monitoring of tissue health is achievable using the Gaussian process technique. This knowledge will be useful in establishing biomarkers related to a possible deterioration in a patient’s health or for assessing the impact of clinical interventions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this study, three {{dimensional}} Finite Element (FE) {{modeling of}} <b>prosthetic</b> <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> was performed for both titanium grade 5 and 302 stainless steel models with appropriate assumptions and realistic boundary and loading conditions. The developed model {{took into account}} many aspects of nonlinearity represented by contact surfaces and impact loading. The adopted design was selected carefully in order to match high strength and minimum weight criteria. Two types of FE analyses were performed; static analysis at standing position and dynamic analysis at jumping condition. The obtained {{results showed that the}} dynamic impact load is the most dominant since both materials were capable to stand with static load with minor Von Mises stresses acting on the pin connections. On the other hand, high Von Mises stresses were developed in the case of dynamic impact load which reached 590. 8 MPa for titanium model and 831. 6 MPa for stainless steel model. The obtained values of stresses are beyond the yield strength of titanium and exceed the ultimate tensile strength of stainless steel and causing failure.

40|$|The Piernas de Vida team {{partnered with}} the Vida Nueva Clinic of Prostheses and Orthoses in Choluteca, Honduras to design, plan, and {{implement}} a prosthetic foot that could be manufactured entirely by the technicians at the clinic {{in order to reduce}} their costs and ultimately allow them to serve more patients each year. Currently, the clinic uses a prefabricated <b>prosthetic</b> <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) which can be adapted to both transDfemoral and transDtibial patients. The team has successfully developed a foot, currently called the Layer Foot, which can be used by the clinic and reduces the expense to purchase a prosthetic foot by more than half. The foot has a simple geometry, which allows for ease of manufacturing, and is made of Delrin, a self-lubricating thermoplastic which is very easy to machine. Multiple iterations have been carried out based on results from both static testing and patient gait analysis, however further testing including cyclic fatigue testing will be necessary for the Layer Foot to compete as a viable product. Future Cal Poly design teams will be assigned the task of carrying out further iterations and developing more advanced testing methods in order to validate the durability and overall design of the product...|$|R
40|$|Background: Postural asymmetries {{are thought}} to lead to {{impairment}} of body structure and function such as muscle imbalance, gait asymmetry and possible chronic conditions, which result in limitation of mobility and restriction of daily activity for transfemoral amputees (TFAs). Despite the potential clinical impact, postural asymmetries have not been confirmed or quantified in TFAs. Objectives: To identify the presence of postural asymmetries in TFAs utilizing clinical evaluation measures. Study design: An observational cross-sectional study in which participants were evaluated at a single time point without intervention or follow-up. Methods: Forty-seven unilateral TFAs were measured for standing limb length, pelvic innominate inclination (PII), lateral trunk flexion and hip extension. Results: Limb length discrepancy was present in 66 % of participants and 57 % had a short prosthetic limb. PII was greater than {{has been reported in}} the literature, and the shorter the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>lower</b> <b>limb,</b> the greater the PII on the amputated side (r 0. 422, p 0. 004). Limb length discrepancy and decreased lateral trunk flexion accounted for 26 % of the variance in amputated side PII. Conclusion: Three postural measurements, namely leg length, pelvic innominate inclination and hip extension, were found to differ between the intact and amputated limb in this study sample. Clinical relevance Clinicians should include postural assessment as part of their routine evaluation of TFAs in an effort to achieve postural symmetry and reduce the risk of chronic conditions associated with impairment of body structure and function...|$|R

5000|$|Electromyography (EMG) is a {{technique}} used for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. [...] Advanced pattern recognition algorithms can take these recordings and decode the unique EMG signal patterns generated by muscles during specific movements. The patterns {{can be used to}} determine the intent of the user and provide control for a <b>prosthetic</b> <b>limb.</b> For <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> robotic prosthesis {{it is important to be}} able to determine if the user wants to walk on level ground, up a slope, or up stairs. Currently this is where myoelectric control comes intro play. During transitions between these different modes of operation EMG signal becomes highly variable and can be used to compliment information from mechanical sensors to determine the intended mode of operation. Each patient that uses a robotic prosthesis that is tuned for this type of control has to have there system trained for them specifically. This is done by have them go through the different modes of operation and using that data to train there pattern recognition algorithm.|$|R
40|$|<b>Prosthetic</b> {{prescription}} for <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees and the methodology used are primarily based on empirical knowledge. Clinical expertise {{plays an important}} role that can lead to an adequate prescription; however, a clear evidence based motivation for the choices made cannot be given. This can lead to local prescription variations with regard to overuse or underuse of prosthetic care and a lack of transparency for consumers and health insurance companies.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: There {{is a lack}} of {{data and}} {{consensus}} concerning the most appropriate functional evaluation in clinical practice at the definitive <b>prosthetic</b> phase after <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputation. OBJECTIVES: To determine among several selected functional tests the most pertinent to evaluate balance and prosthetic walking. STUDY DESIGN: Validation of a diagnostic procedure. METHODS: Sixty-four patients were included. Outcome measures: Timed Up and Go test, Functional Reach test (FRT), one-leg balance, tandem test, Modified Houghton Scale, Berg Balance Scale, two-minute walk test (2 MW test). Correlations were assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Principal Component Analysis. Score distribution was analyzed with the Shapiro-Wilk W normality test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to identify the best predictor for the function. RESULTS: The clinical tests correlated highly with each other. Only 2 MW test and FRT did not have either a floor/ceiling effect, or a bi-modal distribution. The 2 MW test was the best predictor of prosthetic walking limitations (area under the curve 0. 93 (0. 83 - 0. 97), the best threshold was between 130 and 150 meters), and FRT was best for balance. CONCLUSIONS: 2 MW test can be proposed as the first-line clinical test. The FRT can be indicated for the specific assessment of balance disorders.

40|$|Background: Different {{suspension}} {{systems that}} are used within prosthetic devices may alter the distribution of pressure inside the <b>prosthetic</b> socket in <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees. This study aimed to compare the interface pressure of a new magnetic suspension system with the pin/lock and Seal-In suspension systems. Methods: Twelve unilateral transtibial amputees participated in the study. The subjects walked on a level walkway at a self-selected speed. The resultant peak pressure with the three different suspension systems was recorded using F-socket transducers. Findings: There were significant statistical differences between the three studied suspension systems. Pair-wise analyses revealed that the mean peak pressure (kPa) was lower with the magnetic system than {{it was with the}} pin/lock system over the anterior and posterior aspects during one gait cycle (89. 89 vs. 79. 26 and 47. 22 vs. 26. 01, respectively). Overall, the average peak pressure values were higher with the Seal-In system than they were with the new magnetic lock and pin/lock system. Interpretation: The new magnetic system might reduce the pressure within the prosthetic socket in comparison to the pin/lock and Seal-In system during one gait cycle. This is particularly important during the swing phase of gait and may reduce the pain and discomfort at the distal residual limb in comparison to the pin/lock system...|$|R

Purpose: When {{investigating}} <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> landing biomechanics, researchers often assume movement symmetry {{between a}} participant 2 ̆ 7 s {{right and left}} <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> for the simplicity of data collection and analysis, although landing tasks often involve dual-limb motion. However, whether <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> symmetry can be assumed when investigating dynamic, sport-specific movements such as the stop-jump has not been investigated. Therefore, this study aimed {{to determine whether there}} were any significant differences in selected kinetic, kinematic, and muscle activation patterns characterizing <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> biomechanics displayed by the dominant limb compared with the nondominant limb of participants during a stop-jump task. Methods: Sixteen male athletes with normal patellar tendons on diagnostic imaging performed five successful stop-jump trials. Patellar tendon forces (FPT), ground reaction forces, three-dimensional kinematics, and EMG activity of seven <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscles were recorded for the dominant and nondominant <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> during each trial.

40|$|The {{objective}} of personalization {{is to create}} a product that matches the exacting requirements of the individual consumer. Where these products must interface with the changing dynamics of the human form, traditional manufacturing techniques, coupled with traditional manufacturing paradigms do not enable efficient generation of personalized products. Particularly when they must encapsulate body-parts susceptible to variations in dimension through daily activity. Emerging 3 D printing methods are limited to non-conforming rigid materials, with wide tolerance bands. This can make it difficult to generate soft material conforming products that precisely match a consumer’s needs. One such application is the creation of a personalized <b>prosthetic</b> liner for <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees. A residuum liner is the interface that amputees wear between their residual limb and prosthesis. The comfort of a prosthetic liner/socket can determine the daily duration for which patients use their artificial limbs and can also prevent further pathological issues. The purpose of this liner is to enable correct fitting. Current methods use a range of silicon ‘socks’ that encapsulate and cushion the residuum before placement inside the prosthesis socket. The silicon sock can cause skin irritation and damage and are not designed specifically for the individual. Our novel method enables the precise and rapid generation of soft material conforming products and is termed cryogenic CNC machining. This process involves the rapid, physical alteration of soft polymers to enable efficient and direct CNC machining.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> coordination during <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> asymmetry in a split-belt walking paradigm. Eleven healthy individuals walked on a split-belt treadmill with 4 different speed ratios (2 : 2, 2 : 4, 2 : 6 and 2 : 8 km/h) {{and the left}} belt fixed at 2 km/h. Spatial (upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> movement amplitudes) and temporal (correlations between trajectories) aspects of limb movement were analyzed. Results showed that while amplitudes of the right <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> increased and left <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> decreased with increasing asymmetry, both upper limb amplitudes increased. Correlations between diagonal upper/lower limb trajectories increased as right belt speed became faster, suggesting increasing cross-body matching regardless of side. As the treadmill asymmetry increased, ipsilateral lower/upper limbs became more out of phase suggesting a more precise gait pattern to regulate timing between limbs. The upper limbs reached maximum horizontal displacement before the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> except between the right upper limb/left <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> for asymmetrical belt speeds. From these results, it appears the faster moving <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> drives the motion of both upper limbs.

This innate coupling between upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> has a neural basis {{that may be}} advantageous for gait rehabilitation. Adding upper <b>limb</b> effort to <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> stepping could improve <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscle recruitment during therapy. I developed a computer controlled recumbent stepping device with mechanically coupled handles and pedals to test principles of neural coupling of the arms and legs. Subjects drove the stepping motion using different combinations of upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> effort (active or passive). The first study demonstrated that upper limb effort increased passive <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscle activation proportionally in neurologically intact individuals. These results indicated an excitatory neural coupling between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> during rhythmic stepping movements. I then studied neurologically intact subjects performing maximal effort, velocity-controlled recumbent stepping. The results revealed that neural coupling between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> is bidirectional and ipsilaterally biased. For the next study, I examined neural coupling in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury to determine if adding upper limb effort enhanced muscle recruitment of volitionally maximally active <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> The data indicated that maximal upper limb effort did not increase active <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscle recruitment in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury. Similar to neurologically intact individuals, spinal cord injured individuals also demonstrated increased passive <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscle activation with greater upper limb effort. Lastly, I used computer simulations to examine potential neural mechanisms behind the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> neural coupling. These models showed that excitatory sensory feedback, excitatory ipsilateral pathways, and supraspinal drive were all possible specific neural mechanisms explaining my empirical results. Future studies using more sophisticated neural techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation can test the specific neural mechanisms shown in the simulations. Overall, my findings provide {{a better understanding of}} interlimb neural coupling and have specific implications for the design of exercise therapies for gait rehabilitation after neurological injury...|$|R
