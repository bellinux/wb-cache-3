Whole pattern refinements with nontronite X-ray diffraction data from a Western Australian nickel deposit (Bulong) using a nontronite lattice model (Pawley phase) with two space groups(P 3 and C 2 /m) and a <b>peaks</b> <b>phase</b> group model were performed to improve the accuracy of quantitative X-ray diffraction of nickel laterite ore samples. Modifications were applied when building the new models to accommodate asymmetric peak shape and anisotropic peak broadening due to the turbostraticdisorder. Spherical harmonics were used as convolution factors to represent anisotropic crystal size and strain and asymmetric peak shape when using the lattice model. A <b>peaks</b> <b>phase</b> group model was also developed to fit the anisotropic peak broadening in the nontronite pattern. The quantitative resultsof the new Pawley <b>phase</b> and <b>peaks</b> <b>phase</b> group models were compared and verified with synthetic mixtures of nontronite, quartz and goethite simulating various West Australian laterite ore compositions. The models developed in this paper demonstrate adequate accuracy for quantification of nontronite in the synthesized reference materials and should be generally applicable toquantitative phase analysis of nontronite in nickel laterite ore samples...|$|R

30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{frequency}} of <b>phase</b> <b>peak</b> depends on the size of sulfide particles and that larger particles cause a phase shift to lower frequencies (Dias 2000; Revil et al. 2015 a, b). In the present study, as shown in Fig.  3 and described in the results, the spectral IP property includes two conflicting features: The majority of the samples have <b>phase</b> <b>peaks</b> at high frequencies, although low frequencies were measured in a few samples. For instance, the former and the latter correspond to the samples bearing fine-grained pyrite and those containing relatively coarse-grained pyrrhotite with a radius of approximately 1  mm (found at 70  mbsf at site C 9017), respectively. Therefore, the different features of the <b>phase</b> <b>peak</b> appear to be qualitatively explained {{by the size of the}} sulfide particles. Likewise, the <b>phase</b> <b>peak</b> with low frequency below 0.1  Hz for the massive sulfide sample (Fig.  4 d) could be explained by the presence of the very coarse sulfide mineral.|$|R

5000|$|Gordon scored one of {{the biggest}} coups of his career with the first Australian tour by superstar singer Frank Sinatra, who was {{supported}} by vocalist Anne McCormack, actress/dancer Lois Raye and comedian Frank D’Amor. The tour came at a pivotal time in Sinatra's life. He had suffered a disastrous career slump in the late 1940s and early 1950s, compounded by controversy over his alleged connections to the American Mafia, the death of his longtime publicist, his tempestuous affair with Ava Gardner and subsequent bitter divorce from his first wife Nancy, and the successive cancellation of his recording contract by both Columbia Records and MCA Records. But following his signing to Capitol Records and his teaming with arranger Nelson Riddle in early 1953, Sinatra had found renewed form and a deeper artistry. By the time he arrived in Australia in January 1955 he was on the brink of the <b>peak</b> <b>phase</b> of his 'new' career, and within months he would record and release of two of his greatest albums, In The Wee Small Hours (his first 12" [...] LP), and Songs For Swinging Lovers. Sinatra's first Australian tour was a huge success for Gordon and apparently also enjoyable for Sinatra, although daughter Nancy, who accompanied her father on the tour, later recalled it as a bittersweet experience, because Sinatra was then having a brief affair with McCormack.|$|E
5000|$|The {{architecture}} {{produced in}} Colombia between 1850 and 1930 is called [...] "Republican". The use of brick {{and implementation of}} European historical styles were the main novelty. Enrique Haeusler designed the Guayaquil Bridge in 1879. But it was the French architect Carlos Carré who headlined Republican nineteenth century architecture in Medellín. Carré came to town in 1889 and was hired to design and build the new Episcopal Cathedral and several commercial and residential buildings for {{different parts of the}} city, especially in the new neighborhood of Guayaquil. The Metropolitan Cathedral was completed in 1931; also are of authorship Vásquez and Carré buildings, which are located next to Plaza Cisneros. The Medellín Antioquia Railway Station was the work of Enrique Olarte, a work that allowed the definitive urban consolidation in Guayaquil sector. In the twenties Republican architecture reached its <b>peak</b> <b>phase.</b> In this period stand the old Municipal Palace (now the Museum of Antioquia) in 1928, the National Palace and the Palace of Departmental Government (now the Palace of Culture) between 1925 and 1928. The latter two works were designed by the Belgian architect Agustín Goovaerts, both inspired by the Belgian modernist, it applied the Romanesque and Gothic styles respectively. Other works of Goovaerts were the Church of the Sacred Heart (sector Guayaquil), the Church of San Ignacio, among others. The thirties highlighted such constructions of the Prado neighborhood as the Egyptian house and the current Teatro Prado.|$|E

Methods: We evaluated 120 consecutive patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving NOACs. Patients were randomly divided into three groups: a dabigatran group (DG, N= 40), a rivaroxaban group (RG, N= 40) or an apixaban group (AG, N= 40). A warfarin group (WG, N= 40) was matched with NOAC groups for age, sex and type of AF {{during the same time}} period. Blood samples were obtained in pretreatment, trough and <b>peak</b> <b>phases</b> to measure the activity of physiological coagulation inhibitors, including AT III and PC/PS or thrombus formation markers such as D-dimer and thrombin–antithrombin complex (TAT). Results: D-dimer, TAT and AT III values for the NOAC groups were equivalent in the <b>peak</b> and trough <b>phases.</b> PC/PS activity in both phases was equally maintained in the pretreatment phase in the NOAC groups, while the activity in the WG was significantly suppressed in steady state. Moreover, no differences in trends for PC/PS activity were observed among NOAC groups.

Induction of EAE in Lewis rats produces an acute monophasic disease characterised {{by a single}} peak of disability followed by a spontaneous and complete recovery and a subsequent tolerance to further immunizations. In the current study we have performed {{a detailed analysis of}} the dynamics of different lymphocyte populations and cytokine profile along the induction, peak, recovery and post-recovery phases in this paradigm. MBP-injected rats were sacrificed attending exclusively to their clinical score, and the different populations of T-lymphocytes as well as the dynamics of different pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were analysed in the spinal cord by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Our results revealed that, during the induction and <b>peak</b> <b>phases,</b> in parallel to an increase in symptomatology, the number of CD 3 + and CD 4 + cells increased progressively, showing a Th 1 phenotype, but unexpectedly during recovery, although clinical signs progressively decreased, the number and proportion of CD 3 + and CD 4 + populations remained unaltered. Interestingly, during this recovery phase, we observed a marked decrease of Th 1 and an important increase in Th 17 and T-reg cells. Moreover, our results indicate a specific cytokine expression profile along the EAE course characterized by no changes of IL 10 and IL 17 levels, decrease of IL 21 on the peak, and high IL 22 levels during the induction and <b>peak</b> <b>phases</b> that markedly decrease during recovery.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to assess if {{variation}} in sagittal plane landing kinematics is associated with variation in neuromuscular activation patterns of the quadriceps-hamstrings muscle groups during drop vertical jumps (DVJ). Fifty female athletes performed three DVJ. The relationship between peak knee and hip flexion angles and the amplitude of four EMG vectors was investigated with trajectory-level canonical correlation analyses over the entire time period of the landing phase. EMG vectors consisted of the {vastus medialis(VM),vastus lateralis(VL) }, {vastus medialis(VM),hamstring medialis(HM) }, {hamstring medialis(HM),hamstring lateralis(HL) } and the {vastus lateralis(VL),hamstring lateralis(HL) }. To estimate the contribution of each individual muscle, linear regressions were also conducted using one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping. The peak knee flexion angle was significantly positively associated with the amplitudes of the {VM,HM} and {HM,HL} during the preparatory and initial contact phase and with the {VL,HL} vector during the <b>peak</b> loading <b>phase</b> (p< 0. 05). Small peak knee flexion angles {{were significantly associated with}} higher HM amplitudes during the preparatory and initial contact phase (p< 0. 001). The amplitudes of the {VM,VL} and {VL,HL} were significantly positively associated with the peak hip flexion angle during the <b>peak</b> loading <b>phase</b> (p< 0. 05). Small peak hip flexion angles were significantly associated with higher VL amplitudes during the <b>peak</b> loading <b>phase</b> (p = 0. 001). Higher external knee abduction and flexion moments were found in participants landing with less flexed knee and hip joints (p< 0. 001). This study demonstrated clear associations between neuromuscular activation patterns and landing kinematics in the sagittal plane during specific parts of the landing. These findings have indicated that an erect landing pattern, characterized by less hip and knee flexion, was significantly associated with an increased medial and posterior neuromuscular activation (dominant hamstrings medialis activity) during the preparatory and initial contact phase and an increased lateral neuromuscular activation (dominant vastus lateralis activity) during the <b>peak</b> loading <b>phase...</b>|$|R
