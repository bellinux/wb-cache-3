50|$|A geared <b>head</b> takes a <b>pan</b> and tilt <b>head</b> {{and adds}} gears {{to each of}} the axes.

50|$|A {{version of}} the Oscar rivet is the Olympic rivet which uses an {{aluminum}} mandrel that is drawn into the <b>rivet</b> <b>head.</b> After installation, the head and mandrel are shaved off flush resulting in an appearance closely resembling a brazier <b>head</b> driven <b>rivet.</b> They are used in repair of Airstream trailers to replicate {{the look of the}} original rivets.|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in the frictional resistance of a surface caused {{by the presence of}} <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> was determined by towing four planing surfaces of the same dimensions. One surface was smooth and represented a surface without <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> or one with perfectly flush countersunk rivets. The other three surfaces were each fitted with the same number of full-size <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> but of a different type arranged in the same pattern on each surface. The surfaces were towed at speeds representative of the high water speeds encountered by seaplanes during take-off and the range of Reynolds Number covered by the test was from 4 x 10 (exp 6) to 18 x 10 (exp 6). The <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> investigated were oval countersunk, brazier, and round for rivets having shanks 5 / 32 inch in diameter. The oval countersunk heads were sunk below the surface by dimpling the plating around them.

5000|$|While {{structural}} {{blind rivets}} using a locked mandrel are common, {{there are also}} aircraft applications using [...] "non-structural" [...] blind rivets where the reduced, but still predictable, strength of the rivet without the mandrel is used as the design strength. A method popularized by Chris Heintz of Zenith Aircraft uses a common flat-head (countersunk) rivet which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a round <b>head</b> <b>rivet,</b> taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction. Aircraft designed with these rivets use rivet strength figures measured with the mandrel removed.|$|R
50|$|Radial {{riveting}} is subtly {{different from}} orbital forming.

In addition the cracks were monitored on the observable surface by optical and electron microscopy both in-situ and ex-situ during and after the test was completed. Careful fractographic analysis of the fracture surfaces was also done and correlated with the microscopic observations.

40|$|TAP/NDE (Thermo-Acousto-Photonic {{nondestructive}} evaluation) {{has been}} developed {{to the point where}} it is possible to confidently explore many different application areas. One area of interest is the inspection of defects around rivet holes and under <b>rivet</b> <b>heads.</b> This problem is of concern not only from a safety point of view in aging aircraft, but also has major economic implications. For example, a heavy “C” check for a Boeing 707 requires the physical removal, inspection and replacement of many thousands of structural fasteners. Of the various types of <b>rivets</b> the round <b>head</b> <b>rivet</b> hole was chosen for this preliminary analysis (Fig. 1). Since it is not known how Lamb waves interact with an in situ rivet, we have chosen to restrict this analysis to the simplest possible case where there is no rivet in the hole. This corresponds to the current practice of removing the rivet and then using eddy current probes to inspect the hole. Our goal is to develop an inspection technique that does not require the physical removal of the rivet. The buried in-plane defect study was undertaken to provide real time, on-line detection of flaws during the processing of the material to prevent these flaws from causing in-service, premature rivet hole degradation. This inspection would prevent flawed materials from entering service...|$|R
