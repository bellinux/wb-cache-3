40|$|Knitted glass fabrics {{as a kind}} of {{reinforcement}} have received great attention in the com-posites industry in recent years. Glass yarns, however, are very difficult to be processed in the knitting process due to their high stiffness, low elongation and high coefficient of friction.

The experimental results show that damage caused to glass yarn during the knitting process is closely related to yarn parameters.

40|$|Good sleep {{promotes}} {{physical and}} psychological health. Clothing and bedding provide thermal insulation and can impact on thermal comfort and sleep. However, heat or cold exposure could disrupt sleep and alter sleep stages. Textile fabrics with different fibre characteristics have influences on thermal and moisture resistance. Therefore, this thesis explored {{the influence of the}} fabrics of cotton, <b>polyester</b> and <b>wool</b> on sleep. For study 1, the participants slept in cotton, <b>polyester</b> and <b>wool</b> singlets and shorts at 29 °C. Sleep onset latency (SOL), arousal index and wake after sleep onset were reduced in wool compared to the other fabrics. Study 2 explored the effects of sleeping apparel (cotton vs. <b>wool),</b> bedding (<b>polyester</b> vs. <b>wool)</b> and ambient temperature (Ta) (17 °C vs. 22 °C) on sleep. Wool apparel and lower Ta (17 C) were more conducive to sleep. At 17 C, sleeping in wool promoted an early sleep onset, increased stage 3 sleep but decreased stage 2 sleep compared to cotton apparel, whereas at 22 C sleeping in cotton promoted increase stage 3 sleep than in wool. However, no effects were observed for bedding types. The skin and core body temperature data supported findings in SOL at 17 C, but not findings in stage 3 sleep at 22 C. Concordance in sleep measures was assessed between polysomnography (the standard measurement), Actiwatch 2 and SenseWear armband (portable sleep measurements). The data showed similar validity for sleep detection by both devices, except that the SenseWear armband was dependent on Ta especially at 29 °C. Overall, the thesis findings showed that sleeping in wool apparel promoted sleep at 29 C when in singlets and shorts, and at 17 C when in long sleeves and pants. Sleeping in cotton apparel favoured sleep at 22 C. The findings were discussed with respect to the properties of fabric fibres in terms of air trapping and hygroscopicity.

30|$|Wicking, {{moisture}} vapour permeability {{and moisture}} management properties can characterize the moisture transport behaviour of <b>polyester</b> <b>wool</b> yarn and knitted fabrics. Treatment with enzyme caused changes in both yarn and fabric characteristics. The porosity and diameter of yarn increased while packing density reduced on enzymatic treatment. Fabric moisture management behaviour, {{on the other}} hand, showed remarkable improvement after enzyme treatment. Alkaline protease enzyme treated yarns displayed improved wicking behavior than acidic protease enzyme treated yarn due to near complete removal of wool and hence dominance of polyester. The moisture vapour transportation and moisture management properties of alkaline protease enzyme treated fabric were superior than acidic protease enzyme treated fabric.

The results show that kapok assembly with low bulk density, goose down assembly with high bulk density and the randomly arranged fibrous assembly demonstrated the best heat-insulating property; however, considering practical use {{and the influence of}} compression, kapok assembly and fibrous assemblies arranged in the form of fiber balls exhibited the most stable and optimum heat-insulating property. The Daryabeigi heat-transfer model that considers fiber contact and scattering effect was used to calculate the heat-insulating properties of the five fibrous assemblies. A similar model was developed by Fanworth, which neglected the fiber and the scattering effect.

The coating solutions were synthesized by the co-hydrolysis of two silane precursors, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and an alkylsilane, in an alkaline condition. Without any purification, the as-hydrolyzed solutions were directly used to treat fabrics, and the treated fabrics had water contact angles (CA) as high as 170 º and sliding angles (SA) as low as 5 º. Three alkylsilanes {{have been used for}} the synthesis of the coating solutions, and all contain three hydrolysable alkoxyl groups and one non-hydrolysable alkyl, but with different chain lengths (C 1, C 8 and C 16). It was found that the CA value increased with an increase in the alkyl chain length, while the SA showed a reverse trend. When the functional group had a C 16 alkyl, the treated fabric surfaces were highly superhydrophobic, with the CA not being affected much by the fabric type, while the SA values were slightly affected by the original wettability of the fabric substrates. The superhydrophobic feature was attributed to a highly rough surface formed by the particulate coating.

Five different alky silanes were used, namely methyltritthoxysilane (MTES), pheryl triethoxysilane (PTES), n-octyltricthoxysilane (OTES), hexadecyl trimethoxysilan (HDTMS), and tridecafluorooctyl triethoxysilane (FAS), and the water contact anglc (CA) for the coated fabrics ranged between 1300 and 174 °. The alkyl silane used influenced the CA valuc, and the silica coating from FAS, HDTMS and PTES snowed CA value greater than ISO 2 ̆ 7, indicating the formation of superhydrophobicity. The fabric coated by the fluorinated silica (TEOS/FAS) has a water contact angle as high as 174 °.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a Master’s Thesis {{research that has}} been carried out to gain insight in the possible improvements of sound insulation of membrane structures, which are used in practice for temporary structures, e. g. festival tents, and to give practical solutions. This research concentrated on triple-leaf membrane systems with filled cavities. From a state-of-the-art review can be concluded that triple-leaf membrane systems, when filled, perform better than double-leaf and single-leaf membrane structures. From literature research it was concluded as well that tension in the membrane has a negligible effect on the sound insulation and that, on the other hand the flow resistance both of the filling and of the membrane material has large influence. Three different kind of filling materials were used in the present study: (lightweight) glass wool, <b>polyester</b> <b>wool</b> and aerogel. Acoustical measurements were carried out in a laboratory, of which the outcomes were compared to a number of computer and mathematical models. The Multiple Layer Model appears to give good prediction for filled triple-layer membrane systems and this model therefore was used to optimise the important parameters. A well performing triple-layer membrane system was discussed, which met the restriction of 7 kg/m 2 for the surface density of the membrane package. This system includes one layer of aerogel for reasonable sound insulation at low frequencies, and one thicker layer of glass wool yielding good sound insulation at higher frequencies. This system is only investigated theoretically for nog and not empirically (yet). Details have been worked out for a number of practical membrane structure applications for this result (also applicable to variants using only glass wool), focussing on temporary (festival) tent structures.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to produce base layer winter active sportswear fabrics using natural and synthetic fibres and their blends which will deliver good comfort properties. <b>Polyester,</b> <b>wool</b> and bamboo fibres were selected for this study. Polyester is the most common fibre used in sportswear, wool is increasingly being used in sportswear and bamboo is a relatively new fibre that offers properties suitable for base layer sportswear. Bamboo is also regarded as a "green" and eco-sustainable fibre. Preliminary experiments were carried out to find the liquid moisture transfer performance of knitted fabrics made from each selected 100 % fibre blend. Preliminary experimental sample fabrics were produced as single jerseys with different cover factors. It was concluded that cover factor was influenced by loop length; whereas cover factor, physical and structural fabrics properties influenced its performance, depending on the fibre type that was used. Experimental single jersey sample fabrics were also produced from different fibre blends including wool, polyester and bamboo. The physical and structural properties selected for testing were weight/m 2, thickness, stitch density (courses/cm and wales/cm), porosity and optical porosity. The comfort properties selected for testing and analysis were liquid moisture transfer and a fabric classification with respect to the following properties: thermal conductivity, warm/cool feeling, stiffness and number of contact points. These parameters were assessed to determine the comfort properties of commercial and a range of experimental sample fabrics.

This study aimed {{to investigate the}} influences of textile fabrics on sleep under different ambient temperature (Ta) conditions. Seventeen healthy young participants (ten males) underwent nine nights of polysomnography testing including an adaptation night. Participants were randomized {{to each of the}} three binary factors: sleepwear (cotton vs wool), bedding (polyester vs wool), and Ta (17 °C vs 22 °C with relative humidity set at 60 %). Skin temperature (Tsk) and core temperature (Tc) were monitored throughout the sleep period. Sleep onset latency (SOL) was significantly shortened when sleeping in wool with trends of increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency compared to cotton sleepwear. At 17 °C, the proportion of sleep stages 1 (%N 1) and 3 (%N 3) and rapid eye movement sleep was higher, but %N 2 was lower than at 22 °C. Interaction effects (sleepwear × Ta) showed a significantly shorter SOL for wool than cotton at 17 °C but lower %N 3 for wool than cotton at 22 °C. A significantly lower %N 2 but higher %N 3 was observed for wool at 17 °C than at 22 °C. There was no bedding effect on sleep. Several temperature variables predicted the sleep findings in a stepwise multiple regression analysis and explained 67. 8 % of the variance in SOL and to a lesser degree the %N 2 and %N 3. These findings suggest that sleepwear played a contributory role to sleep outcomes and participants slept better at 17 °C than at 22 °C.
