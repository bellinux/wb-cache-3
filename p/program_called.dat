This proved advantageous when the aircraft's mission changed from solely air-to-air combat to multi-role operations. Changes in operational use and additional systems have increased weight, necessitating multiple structural strengthening programs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a new scheme for {{software}} obfuscation and license protection that is based on an original transformation of the <b>program’s</b> <b>call</b> tree. The idea is based on the observation of similarities between a <b>program’s</b> <b>call</b> tree and Context Free Grammars. First, this paper proposes a practical technique for applying well studied LALR methodologies to transforming a <b>program’s</b> <b>call</b> tree. Second, we suggest methods of effective binding of the transformed program to the program’s installation site. Finally, we note that the given scheme provides us with a series of difficult to remove unique identifications integrally embedded into the transformed programs {{that could be used for}} software watermarking purposes...|$|R

5|$|Cooperative {{multitasking}} {{made its}} Macintosh debut in March 1985 with a <b>program</b> <b>called</b> Switcher by Andy Hertzfeld, which allowed {{the user to}} launch multiple applications and switch between them. Many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher. Also, Switcher did not display windows of other applications beside the selected one. It was not included with the operating system, but was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called MultiFinder instead, which was much more mature and widely used in System 6. MultiFinder could be enabled or disabled, with a reboot. If disabled, the Finder would quit when the user launched another application, thus freeing RAM for it. If enabled, the system behaved as in the nowadays familiar multitasking tradition, with the desktop and windows of other applications in the screen's background.|$|E
