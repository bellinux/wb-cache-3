5000|$|The {{predicted}} {{accuracy of}} the VOR system is ±1.4°. However, test data indicate that 99.94% of the time a VOR system has less than ±0.35° of error. Internal monitoring of a VOR station will shut it down, or change over to a standby system if the station error exceeds some limit. A Doppler VOR beacon will typically change over or shut down when the bearing error exceeds 1.0°. [...] National air space authorities may often set tighter limits. For instance, in Australia, a <b>Primary</b> <b>Alarm</b> limit may be set as low as ±0.5° on some Doppler VOR beacons.|$|E
40|$|The {{immune system}} is called into action by alarm signals {{generate}} from injured tissues. We examined {{the nature of these}} alarm signals after exposure of skin residential cells to contact allergens (nickel sulfate and potassium dichromate) and a contact irritant [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ]. Nickel sulfate, potassium dichromate, and SDS were applied topically to the stratum corneum of human skin equivalents. A similar concentration-dependent increase in chemokine (CCL 20, CCL 27, and CXCL 8) secretion was observed for all three chemicals. Exposure to nickel sulfate and SDS was investigated in more detail: similar to chemokine secretion, no difference was observed in the time- and concentration-dependent increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine [interleukin- 1 α (IL- 1 α) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) ] secretion. Maximal increase in IL- 1 α secretion occurred within 2 h after exposure to both nickel sulfate and SDS and prior to increased chemokine secretion. TNF-α secretion was detectable 8 h after chemical exposure. After allergen or irritant exposure, increased CCL 20 and CXCL 8, but not CCL 27, secretion was inhibited by neutralizing human antibodies to either IL- 1 α or TNF-α. Our data show that alarm signals consist of primary and secondary signals. IL- 1 α and TNF-α are released as <b>primary</b> <b>alarm</b> signals, which trigger the release of secondary chemokine (CCL 20 and CXCL 8) alarm signals. However, some chemokines, for example, CCL 27 can be secreted in an IL- 1 α and TNF-α independent manner. Our data suggest that skin residential cells respond to both allergen and irritant exposure by releasing mediators that initiate infiltration of immune responsive cells into the skin. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005...|$|E
25|$|Although no Screamers {{are ever}} seen in the book, they are heard - their scream is so loud as {{to be able to}} deafen and daze people far away from it. They are also the <b>primary</b> method of <b>alarm</b> for {{sleeping}} Myrmidons - only a Screamer can wake a Myrmidon quickly. They do not travel in groups. It is mentioned that when a human is close to the screamer while it screams it can peel away the skin on the insides of their ears.|$|R
40|$|Researchers and {{designers}} have investigated ways {{to mitigate the}} consequences of alarm mistrust, including using redundant information sources to ensure response consistency. Research concerning the benefit of this practice has not considered the operator's prior alarm system knowledge, or the division of attention among multiple tasks. We investigated the influence of real-time individual alarm validity information and prior alarm system reliability information on <b>primary</b> and <b>alarm</b> task responses. One hundred undergraduate students performed a continuous compensatory tracking task while responding to microcomputer-based alarms. Dependent measures included alarm response frequency, speed, accuracy, and appropriateness, and primary task tracking error. Results indicated that participants with real-time alarm validity information responded less frequently, but more appropriately than those without such information. Participants with prior access to alarm system reliability information responded more frequently than those without such information. The results are discussed as they apply to prior literature and alarm system design...|$|R
40|$|Color poster with text, photographs, and images. The goal of {{this project}} was to {{establish}} a <b>primary</b> culture of <b>alarm</b> cells from the skin of Creek Chub (Semtilus atromaculatis). The skin (epithelium) is composed of different cell types. Included among them are cells that produce alarm substance. This compound is released following tissue damage, such as would occur during a predation event (Smith 1992, Canadian Journal of Zoology, 70 (8) : 1473 - 1476). When the alarm substance enters the water, anti-predatory behaviors are initiated by neighboring fish (e. g., darting, freezing, schooling). Alarm substance has not been isolated and commercial preparations are not available. Establishing a culture of fish epithelial cells will provide an immediate source of alarm substance {{that can be used}} in behavioral experiments with Creek Chub. To generate a viable culture of cells, we developed protocols for tissue collection and processing, and determined optimal media formulations and culture conditions.

40|$|Leading human-computer {{interaction}} (HCI) researchers recognize {{a fundamental difference}} exists between men and women. Some HCI {{research has been done}} regarding gender differences in hand-eye coordination for interactions with computer touch display interfaces, navigation through virtual environments (VE) and language in computer-mediated communication. In these previous studies, gender differences were found in the use of words and language in computer-mediated communication and in navigation strategies for VE but no gender-related differences were found for the hand-eye coordination needed to effectively use a touch display. The current study used a cross-modal (auditory-visual), dual-task, computer interface to examine gender differences in crisis control simulations. For the <b>primary</b> task of <b>alarm</b> monitoring, no gender differences were found for average or maximum response and completion times. Likewise, no gender differences were found in terms of error rates for the primary task or the number correct on the secondary task. However, in terms of minimum response and completion times for alarm monitoring, gender differences were found...|$|R
40|$|Plastic scintillators provide {{homeland}} security organisations with large area, low cost gamma-ray counters at international borders. Currently these detectors connot {{distinguish between the}} sources they detect, leading to high false <b>alarm</b> rates during <b>primary</b> screening. These <b>alarms</b> must be followed up by time consuming secondary screening techniques using spectroscopic detectors. Here we review current PVT scintillators and present a range of techniques that optimise their characteristics. By combining these optimisations with Symetrica's spectral deconvolution and isotope identification software, PVTdetectors were given isotope identification ability. Far from being simple gamma-ray counters, these detectors were used to successfully identify a range of complex isotopes, such as Eu- 152, Ra- 226 and Th- 232. The resulting clarity produced by these detectros was impressive, with a measured full width at half maximum of ~ 5 % at 662 keV in deconvolved Cs- 137 spectrum. Detector designs are also presented here which allow PVT detectors to identify {{a full range of}} isotopes during primary screening, potentially eradicating the need for follow up examinations.

40|$|Complex {{industrial}} {{processes such as}} nuclear power plants, chemical plants and petroleum refineries are usually equipped with alarm systems capable of monitoring thousands of process variables and generating {{tens of thousands of}} alarms which are used as mechanisms for alerting operators to take actions to alleviate or prevent an abnormal situation. Overalarming and a lack of configuration management practices have often led to the degradation of these alarm systems, resulting in operational problems such as the Three-Mile Island accident. In order to aid alarm rationalization, this paper proposed an approach that incorporates a context-based segmentation approach with a data mining technique to find a set of correlated alarms from historical alarm event logs. Before the set of extracted results from this automated technique are used they can be evaluated by a process engineer with process understanding. The proposed approach is evaluated initially using simulation data from a Vinyl Acetate model. The approach is cost effective as any manual alarm analysis of the event logs for identifying <b>primary</b> and consequential <b>alarms</b> could be very time and labour intensive...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} a survival disadvantage for rural dwellers who develop colorectal cancer, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Delayed presentation to general practitioners (GPs) maybe a contributory factor but evidence is lacking. Aim: To examine the association between rurality and travel time on diagnosis and survival from colorectal cancer in a cohort from Northeast Scotland. Design and setting: We used a database linking GP records to routine data for patients diagnosed between 1997 / 98, and followed up to 2011. Method: <b>Primary</b> outcomes were <b>alarm</b> symptoms, emergency admissions, stage and survival. Travel time in minutes from patients to GP was estimated. Logistic and Cox regression were used to model outcomes. Interaction terms {{were used to determine}} if travelling time impacted differently on urban versus rural patients. Results: Rural patients and patients travelling farther to the GP had better three-year survival. When the travel - outcomes association were explored using interaction terms, the associations differed between rural and urban areas. Longer travel in urban areas significantly reduced the odds of emergency admissions (OR 0. 62, p< 0. 05), and increased survival (HR 0. 75, p< 0. 05). Longer travel also increased the odds of presenting with alarm symptoms in urban areas, this was nearly significant (OR 1. 34, p= 0. 06). Presence of alarm symptoms reduced the likelihood of emergency admissions (OR 0. 36, p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Living in a rural area, and travelling farther to GP in urban areas may reduce the likelihood of emergency admissions and poor survival. This may be related to how patients present with alarm symptoms...|$|R
40|$|A Fire Protection 2 ̆ 6 Life Safety Analysis was {{conducted}} {{in order to fulfill}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Fire Protection Engineering. The Fire Protection 2 ̆ 6 Life Safety Analysis consisted of a prescriptive and performance-based analysis of the Eric Rood Administration Center (Rood Center). The prescriptive based analysis {{was conducted}} to determine if the Rood Center adhered to the applicable codes and standards. It utilized the 2013 California Building and Fire Codes and the 2012 Life Safety Code (NFPA 101). Other NFPA codes that were referenced included the 2013 edition of NFPA 13, Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems, the 2013 edition of NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm Signaling Code, and the 2015 edition of NFPA 2001, Standard on Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing systems. The prescriptive based analysis examined four portions of the building’s fire protection system: Egress Analysis 2 ̆ 6 Design, Fire Detection 2 ̆ 6 Alarm Notification, Water-based Fire Suppression, and Structural Fire Protection Deficiencies were found in the building’s fire detection and notification systems, as well as the inspection, testing, and maintenance of said systems. The building’s <b>primary</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system has photoelectric smoke detectors installed in only portions of the building. The bulk of the detectors are installed in the exit corridors with typically only one detector per department. While the number of smoke detectors in most departments is lacking, some departments don’t have any at all. The first floor has only 23 smoke detectors, while the second floor has only 16. Based on coverage-area-per-detector calculations alone, the first floor should have a minimum of 56 detectors and the second floor should have a minimum of 58. One of the departments in the building that does have smoke detectors, has only local detectors (they are not connected to the building’s fire alarm control panel (FACP)). Two of the fire scenarios in the performance based analysis indicated the fires were detected within 10 seconds of ignition. In the other two fire scenarios, the fires were not detected until 73 seconds and 107 seconds into the simulations respectively. Examining the building’s notification systems revealed several issues as well. Three of the notification devices types currently in use in the building are listed in the FACP’s manual as not compatible. Similar to the detection system, there are not enough notification appliances (audio or visual) throughout the building to ensure proper coverage. Inspections and tests are not done to confirm proper audible and/or visual levels in the building during an active alarm. The performance based analysis examined how the building’s fire protection system would react to a fire, and whether occupants would have enough time to escape to safety. A computational fluid dynamics modeling program, Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), was used to estimate the available safe egress times (ASET) for four different fire scenarios throughout the building. Those values were then compared with the required safe egress times (RSET) calculated in the prescriptive based analysis for each fire scenario. The original RSET values were calculated for the departments affected by the fire scenarios. The fire models were analyzed and the ASET values were determined when conditions either first became untenable, or when all the occupants had exited the building; whichever came first. The conditions in the building became untenable before people could evacuate the building in all four fire scenarios (RSET 3 ̆e ASET). In some situations, conditions became untenable seconds after the fire alarm was activated, and several minutes before evacuations were complete. The performance based analysis determine that the arrangement of the dead end hallway off the second floor lobby was especially problematic as it could cause the occupants to be trapped {{in the event of a}} fire. Two fire scenarios were examined, one with the fire in the dead end hallway, and another with the fire in the main lobby. In both cases, the conditions in the building became untenable long before the occupants would have been able to escape the hallway, let alone the building...|$|R
