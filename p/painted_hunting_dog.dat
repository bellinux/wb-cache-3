25|$|About 220 mammals {{are found}} in the Horn of Africa. Among {{threatened}} species of the region, there are several antelopes such as the beira, the dibatag, the silver dikdik and the Speke's gazelle. Other remarkable species include the Somali wild ass, the desert warthog, the hamadryas baboon, the Somali pygmy gerbil, the ammodile, and the Speke's pectinator. The Grevy's zebra is the unique wild equid of the region. There are predators such as spotted hyena, striped hyena and African leopard. The endangered <b>painted</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog</b> had populations in the Horn of Africa, but pressures from human exploitation of habitat along with warfare have reduced or extirpated this canid in this region.|$|E

White studied in Paris for four years, and spent three more years {{traveling}} and painting in other European cities including in Brussels, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Liege, Rouen, Biarritz and Pau. [...] While in Biarritz, White painted The Basque Shepherd, a painting of the dog of Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich, of Russia. The $300 sale of that painting to the Grand Duke financed his remaining travels, {{and for the rest}} of his career White would have an affinity for the <b>painting</b> of <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered <b>painted</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs</b> (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|R

40|$|There are {{two basic}} aspects of <b>hunting</b> <b>dog’s</b> health care: {{infectious}} diseases of <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs</b> and <b>dog’s</b> <b>hunting</b> performance. Concerning infectious diseases of <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs,</b> special {{attention is paid to}} public health, preventing possible dangers that could possibly arise. On the other hand, <b>hunting</b> performance of <b>dogs</b> depends on their nutrition. A complete analysis of hunting dogs’ health care in our country requires an assessment of awareness level in hunters about dangers which both humans and <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs</b> are exposed to, evaluation of preventive measures implementation in dogs by hunters, the prevalence of certain infections in dogs and determination of health risk for dogs and people related to hunting.
