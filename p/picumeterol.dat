40|$|Aims The new potent and {{selective}} beta(2) -adrenoceptor agonist, GR 114297 A (<b>picumeterol)</b> is the R-enantiomer of the racemic form, GR 63411 B. <b>Picumeterol</b> {{has been shown}} to produce long-lasting relaxation of airways smooth muscle both in vitro and in vivo. We assessed the intrinsic activity of <b>picumeterol</b> by increasing intracellular levels of c-AMP and compared this with isoprenaline and salbutamol. Methods In human atopic asthmatics, we have investigated the duration of action and efficacy of <b>picumeterol</b> and GR 63411 B with regard to improvement in resting lung function (i. e. FEV(1)) and airways responsiveness (i. e. PC 20) to methacholine (MCh). The study design consists of two clinical parts each for one drug. Different asthmatics participated in the two studies, seven in the first part and eight in the second part. In human bronchial smooth muscle cells in vitro, we have investigated the intrinsic activity of <b>picumeterol</b> in increasing intracellular levels of cyclic AMP and compared it with isoprenaline and salbutamol. Results In vivo, both drugs caused bronchodilatation with similar potency, but, their effects were short-lasting. Despite their bronchodilator activity, neither drug improved PC 20, when compared with placebo. lit vitro, <b>picumeterol</b> was found have intrinsic activity lower than the other beta(2) -adrenoceptor agonists tested. Conclusions In the clinical studies, the bronchodilator potencies of <b>picumeterol</b> and GR 63411 B were similar. However, both drugs were short-acting, which is at odds with their activity in vitro. Our data suggest that these compounds display dissociation between bronchodilator activity and protection against MCh-induced bronchoconstriction. These findings may be explained by low intrinsic activity and need further conformation...|$|E
