5000|$|The {{statistical}} {{mechanics of the}} Zimm-Bragg model may be solved exactly using the transfer-matrix method. The two parameters of the Zimm-Bragg model are σ, the statistical weight for nucleating a helix and s, the statistical weight for <b>propagating</b> <b>a</b> helix. These parameters may depend on the residue j; for example, a proline residue may easily nucleate a helix but not <b>propagate</b> one; <b>a</b> leucine residue may nucleate and <b>propagate</b> <b>a</b> helix easily; whereas glycine may disfavor both the nucleation and propagation of a helix. Since only nearest-neighbour interactions are considered in the Zimm-Bragg model, the full partition function for a chain of N residues can be written as follows ...|$|R
