However, the output power induced in the photovoltaic modules is influenced by an intensity of solar cell radiation, temperature of the solar cells. Therefore, to maximize {{the efficiency of the}} renewable energy system, it is necessary to track the maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> of the input source. In this paper, a new maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> tracker (MPPT) using Perturb & Observe algorithm is proposed to improve energy conversion efficiency.

However, the traditional maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> tracking (MPPT) algorithm might be easily trapped in local maximum <b>power</b> <b>points</b> (MPPs) and cannot find the global maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> (GMPP).
