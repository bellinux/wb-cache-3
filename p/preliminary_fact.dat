30|$|The {{content of}} this article is {{organized}} as follows: In Section 2, some <b>preliminary</b> <b>fact</b> is recalled; the perturbed abstract measure functional differential equation is proposed, as well as some relative notations. In Section 3, the existence theorem is given and strict proof is shown; two remarks are given to analyze that our existence results are less conservative. In Section 4, an example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of our results for existence of solutions.|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedSince we {{have the}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>fact</b> that the irreducible, {{aperiodic}} and reversible Markov Chain can asymptotically converge to a unique stationary distribution, and then the rate of convergence have been well studied by many researchers in the field, this convergence rate depends heavily on the second largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix for the chain, {{so in order to}} analyze this fact, I developed the convergence bounds as well as the geometric interpretation, which has application on simple random walk on a graph and cube.; I also have a brief introduction beyond the idea of the convergence bounds, which is the extension of Markov Chain on the Monte Carlo methods, because {{there seems to be an}} increasing number of problems that require the techniques of simulation. One interesting model is the “Simulated Annealing”, although the process concerns more about the optimization than the simulation...|$|E
