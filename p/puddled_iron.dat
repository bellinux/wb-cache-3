Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal.

40|$|Europe has {{a number}} of ancient riveted {{metallic}} bridges, constructed {{during the second half of}} the 19 th century up to the middle of the 20 th century, which are still in operation. In this paper, a unified approach is presented to generate probabilistic S-N curves to be applied to structural components, accounting for uncertainties in material properties. The approach is particularly demonstrated for a plate with a circular hole, made of <b>puddle</b> <b>iron</b> from the Portuguese Eiffel Bridge. This paper presents an extension of the local strain-based fatigue crack propagation model proposed by Noroozi et al. The latter model is applied to derive the probabilistic fatigue crack propagation field (p-S-Np field).

40|$|AbstractProbabilistic fatigue {{models are}} {{required}} to account conveniently for several sources of uncertainty arising in the prediction procedures for structural details, such as the scatter in material behaviour. In this paper, a procedure to derive probabilistic S-N fields for structural details [1] is applied to a notched geometry with elliptic central hole made of <b>puddle</b> <b>iron</b> from the Eiffel bridge, based on the local approaches supported by the probabilistic ɛa–N or Smith–Watson–Topper (SWT) –N fields [1, 2]. This procedure suggests {{an extension of the}} fatigue crack propagation model proposed by Noroozi et al. [3, 4] to structural details, in order to cover both the fatigue crack initiation and fatigue crack propagation, based on local strain approaches to fatigue. Both fatigue crack initiation and fatigue crack propagation mechanisms are accounted for in the proposed approach.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cumulative}} concept {{proposed by}} Palmgren and Miner [1] {{maintains that the}} damage level can be {{expressed in terms of}} the number of cycles applied at a given stress range divided by the number of cycles needed to produce failure for the same stress range. Failure occurs when the summation of these damage increments at several stress ranges becomes unity. After this formulation, this rule is repeatedly tested for different materials under multi-step and variable amplitude loading programs [2]. Though its applicability has been often questioned, it has been practically adopted by all design codes related to structural and mechanical fatigue design. In this paper, a fatigue damage assessment of a riveted connection made of <b>puddle</b> <b>iron</b> from the Fão bridge [3 – 6] using the modified probabilistic interpretation technique (MPIT) is applied [7]. This technique is a generalization of the Van Leeuwen and Siemes [8, 9] work by considering a probabilistic S-N field providing a statistical distribution of the Miner number although based on a log-normal distribution. This generalization was proposed by Fernández-Canteli [10], based on the probabilistic model developed by Castillo and Fernández-Canteli [11]...|$|R
50|$|Laborde built a {{complete}} industrial complex. Within 6 years, he had blast furnaces with waterwheel-powered draught producing cast <b>iron,</b> <b>puddling</b> mills producing wrought iron, a steeling plant producing spring steel, a glassworks, brickworks and cement-plant, a heavy foundry {{capable of producing}} 24-pound cannons, a musket factory, a gunpowder mill, a tower to make lead shot, and textile mills.|$|R
50|$|Stays {{made from}} <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> bar {{were used as}} a cheaper {{alternative}} to copper for joining {{the inner and outer}} firebox plates of steam locomotives. The incorporated stringers gave flexibility akin to stranded wire rope and stays made of the material were therefore resistant to snapping in service. Wrought iron rivets made from iron bar typically contained stringer filaments running the length of the rivet, but filaments at right angles to the tension, particularly beneath the head, caused weakness.|$|E
50|$|The curtain weir was {{attached}} to the superstructure of the Pont de la Machine bridging the right arm of the river Rhône. The old superstructure was replaced during the construction of the power plant by a new superstructure for pedestrian use made from <b>puddled</b> <b>iron.</b> The chosen building material was strong enough to support the additional lateral forces introduced by the curtain weir into the structure. The curtain weir consisted of 39 single roller blinds made from larch wood. It was able to dam the Rhône to a height of maximal 3.3 meters.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built {{according}} to the plans of Heinrich Gottfried Gerber, the Head of Bridge Division of Maschinenfabrik Klett. The <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> (wrought iron) structure bridge had four 105.2 m bridge segments. The Pauli truss structure was arranged above the roadway, {{according to the}} Pauli lenticular truss bridge recently developed by Friedrich August von Pauli. Right of Rhine joined a long flood bridge with 28 other fields. 2 At both bridgeheads were they equipped with scheduled by district architect Ignaz victims man Gothic gates and bridge towers, which were to serve {{in time of war}} to defend the bridge.|$|E
50|$|The hearth {{is where}} the iron is charged, melted and puddled. The hearth's shape is usually elliptical; 1.5 - 1.8 m in length and 1 - 1.2 m wide. If the furnace is {{designed}} to <b>puddle</b> white <b>iron</b> then the hearth depth is never more than 50 cm. If the furnace is designed to boil gray iron then the average hearth depth is 50 - 75 cm. Due to the great heat required to melt the charge the grate had to be cooled, else it would melt with the charge. This was done by running a constant charge of cool air on it, or by throwing water {{on the bottom of}} the grate.|$|R
50|$|Either {{white cast}} iron or refined iron is then placed in hearth of the furnace, {{a process known as}} charging. For wet <b>puddling,</b> scrap <b>iron</b> and/or iron oxide is also charged. This mixture is then heated until the top melts, {{allowing}} for the oxides to begin mixing; this usually takes 30 minutes. This mixture is subjected to a strong current of air and stirred by long bars with hooks on one end, called puddling bars or rabbles, through doors in the furnace. This helps the oxygen from the oxides to react with impurities in the pig iron, notably silicon, manganese (to form slag) and to some degree sulfur and phosphorus, which form gases that escape with the exhaust of the furnace.|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s, the {{transition}} from wrought <b>iron</b> <b>puddling</b> to mass-produced Bessemer steel greatly increased worker productivity. Highly skilled workers remained essential, but the average level of skill declined. Nevertheless, steelworkers earned much more than ironworkers despite their fewer skills. Workers in an integrated, synchronized mass production environment wielded greater strategic power, for the greater cost of mistakes bolstered workers' status. The experience demonstrated that the new technology did not decrease worker bargaining leverage by creating an interchangeable, unskilled workforce.|$|R
50|$|Though {{it was not}} {{the first}} process to produce bar iron without charcoal, {{puddling}} was by far the most successful, and replaced the earlier potting and stamping processes, as well as the much older charcoal finery and bloomery processes. This enabled a great expansion of iron production to take place in Great Britain, and shortly afterwards, in North America. That expansion constitutes the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution so far as the iron industry is concerned. Most 19th century applications of wrought iron, including the Eiffel Tower, bridges, and the original framework of the Statue of Liberty, used <b>puddled</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|E
50|$|The berths were {{accessed}} {{from the}} river via sea locks with a maximum size of 180 by 31 ft. From 1844 the docks had a Steam powered, cable-towed <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> Drag-Dredger, Bertha, {{similar to the one}} Brunel had designed for Bristol Harbour. Now preserved at the World of Boats in Eyemouth, she is undergoing restoration {{at the head of the}} Old Harbour. The dock area contained flour mills, timber yards and chandlers. The docks opened on 25 March 1841, with volumes resultantly reaching a peak between 1880 and 1885; with an average of 3,600 ships per year entering the port. Peak tonnage occurred in 1857, with 142 vessels totalling 17800 tonne LT.|$|E
50|$|In 1816, the Forth and Clyde Canal Company, {{which had}} earlier {{successfully}} adapted {{new technology to}} shipbuilding with the Charlotte Dundas, authorised {{the development of an}} all-iron ship, and they quickly settled upon building a canal barge. In 1818, Thomas Wilson (1781-1873), was hired as the shipwright. The barge was to be 20 metres (66.5 ft.) long and narrow enough for the canal. The design called for iron sectionals to be riveted together with covering plates. Two blacksmiths were hired to construct the parts. The plating had to be hammered out of <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> as no iron rolling mills existed at the time. The iron was supplied by the Monklands Steel Company.|$|E
50|$|Puddling was {{one step}} {{in one of}} the most {{important}} processes of making the first appreciable volumes of high-grade bar iron (malleable wrought iron) during the Industrial Revolution. In the original <b>puddling</b> technique, molten <b>iron</b> in a reverberatory furnace was stirred with rods, which were consumed in the process. It was one of the first processes for making bar iron without charcoal in Europe, although much earlier coal-based processes had existed in China. Eventually, the furnace would be used to make small quantities of specialty steels.|$|R
50|$|While the {{bloomery}} process produced {{wrought iron}} directly from ore, cast iron or pig iron were the starting {{materials used in}} the finery forge and <b>puddling</b> furnace. Pig <b>iron</b> and cast iron have higher carbon content than wrought iron, but have a lower melting point than iron or steel. Cast and especially pig iron have excess slag which {{must be at least}} partially removed to produce quality wrought iron. At foundries it was common to blend scrap wrought iron with cast iron to improve the physical properties of castings.|$|R
60|$|Frank {{agreed with}} this, {{but he had}} never {{realized}} the truth of it as he did just then. It was clear that the man who made all he wanted must live as the Indians or grosser savages did, and that it was only the division of employments that provided one with the comforts of civilization. Every man, it seemed, lived by the toil of another, for while on the Pacific Slope they turned the forests into dressed lumber and raised fruit and wheat, the clothes they wore, and their saws and plows and axes, came from the East. One could clear a ranch on Puget Sound only because a host of other men <b>puddled</b> liquid <b>iron</b> or pounded white-hot steel in the forges of, for instance, Pennsylvania. Frank would very much have liked to provide his companion with the fruit of somebody else's labor {{in the shape of a}} few matches, which would have made a cheerful fire possible.|$|R
