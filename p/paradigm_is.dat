5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming <b>paradigm</b> <b>is</b> not significant due to business-related concerns; there are risks associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business {{would need to be}} discarded. Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies tend to be the need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E

40|$|Business {{utilizes}} {{a variety}} of theoretical paradigms drawn from the social sciences to support its research activities. The predominant <b>paradigms</b> <b>are</b> the positivistic or postpositivistic paradigms. These paradigms have traditionally provided business with its social sciences methods. However, {{during the second half}} of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century, paradigms associated with the traditions of social constructionism, social constructivism, social phenomenology and the interpretive social science <b>paradigm</b> <b>were</b> and are being used by business to provide alternative methods for the conduct of business research. Related to those <b>paradigms</b> <b>are</b> critical theory, feminist perspectives, postmodern and participatory paradigms. Essentially, the positivistically derived paradigms (positivism, postpositivism and critical realism) are associated with a quantitative methodology.

25|$|The {{advocates of}} the Tübingen School have intensively {{examined}} the scattered evidence and testimony in the sources in order to reconstruct the principles of Plato's unwritten doctrines.

25|$|Jerry Fodor {{attempts}} {{to establish that}} this theoretical <b>paradigm</b> <b>is</b> fallacious and misleading by demonstrating the impenetrability of perception to the background knowledge of subjects. The strongest case can be based on evidence from experimental cognitive psychology, namely the persistence of perceptual illusions. Knowing that the lines in the Müller-Lyer illusion are equal does not prevent one from continuing to see one line as being longer than the other. This impenetrability of the information elaborated by the mental modules limits the scope of interpretationalism.|$|E
25|$|In {{analogy with}} Thomas Kuhn's {{definition}} of a scientific paradigm, Dosi has defined a technological paradigm as the general outlook on the productive problems faced by firms. As such, a technological <b>paradigm</b> <b>is</b> composed by some sort of model of the technology at stake (e.g. the model of a microprocessor) and by the specific technological problems posed by such model (e.g. increasing computational capacity, reducing dimensions, etc.). Therefore, technology is identified as a problem-solving activity in which the problems to be solved are selected by the paradigm itself. In this sense, a technological paradigm entails strong prescriptions on the direction of technological change, that is the direction toward which future technical improvements will converge. Such gradual improvements along the specific lines prescribed by the paradigm are what constitute technological trajectories and progress.|$|E

25|$|In any {{community}} of scientists, Kuhn states, {{there are some}} individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a crisis exists, embark on what Kuhn calls revolutionary science, exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate paradigm will appear {{to be accompanied by}} numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, so they should. To fulfill its potential, a scientific community needs to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who are conservative. There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for a new paradigm will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory's potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging paradigm. There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms. In time, if the challenging <b>paradigm</b> <b>is</b> solidified and unified, it will replace the old paradigm, and a paradigm shift will have occurred.|$|E
500|$|For Kuhn, {{the choice}} of {{paradigm}} was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more [...] "portraits" [...] against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a <b>paradigm</b> <b>is</b> a social process {{as much as a}} logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism. According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, {{the choice of}} a new <b>paradigm</b> <b>is</b> based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, {{the group}} {{returns to the}} school to investigate further. The Doctor confronts Mr. Finch, who confirms {{that he and the}} others are Krillitanes— a composite species that takes desirable attributes of the species they conquer.

Meanwhile, Sarah Jane and Rose, now getting on better than at their first meeting, try to unlock the programming on the school's computers; Mickey and K9 remain in Sarah Jane's car for surveillance. With the Doctor's help, they discover that the computers— bolstered by the students' enhanced intelligence— are part of a Krillitane effort to solve the [...] "Skasis Paradigm", a theory of everything. As the <b>paradigm</b> <b>is</b> nearly solved, which would allow the Krillitanes full control over time and space, they seal the school. Mr. Finch propositions the Doctor a second time, tempting him with the ability to save the Time Lords and override human mortality. With Sarah Jane's counseling, the Doctor refuses, and they run from Mr. Finch. After Kenny (a student who had not eaten the chips) alerts Mickey to the students' plight, Mickey crashes Sarah Jane's car through the school's doors and unplugs the computers, allowing the children to flee. The Doctor leads the Krillitanes to the kitchen. [...] Upon their arrival, K9 detonates the chip oil container, saturating the Krillitanes. [...] The Krillitanes suddenly explode, destroying the school and K9.|$|E
