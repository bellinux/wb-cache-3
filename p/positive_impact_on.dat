However, while FDI has clearly <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> technology transfers, its effects on resource use within firms is less clear and, in principle, efficiency losses might offset some of the productivity gains associated with improved technologies. In this paper, we study the <b>impacts</b> of FDI <b>on</b> efficiency in Swedish manufacturing. We find that foreign ownership has <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> efficiency, supporting the earlier findings on productivity...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the means of systemising the hotel sector by {{integrating}} the concepts and practices of ISO 14001 certification. The research problem was approached by a literature synthesis, questionnaire survey and case study analysis. It was identified that the implementation of ISO 14001 is being very less at present. The case study analysis revealed that, the ISO 14001 certification made <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> the identified performance indicators and recognized the there were more <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> energy saving and reduction of waste generation. The result of ISO 14001 non-certified hotel shows, the EMS policy made few <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> units of production and reduction of waste generation {{and there were no}} more <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> other indicators. By failing to perceive benefits from this well-known standard, hotel can lose financial stability as well as benchmarks. Finally, the paper sets the direction for continual improvement of environmental and financial performance in the future hotel sector...|$|R

The album made a <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the mod revival movement of the late 1970s, and the resulting film adaptation, released in 1979, was successful. The album has been reissued on compact disc several times, and seen a number of remixes that corrected some perceived flaws in the original.|$|E
5|$|The Gateway Protection Programme {{initially}} had a {{quota of}} 500 refugees per year, which was later increased to 750, {{but the actual}} number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. Liberian, Congolese, Sudanese, Burmese, Ethiopian, Mauritanian, Iraqi, Bhutanese, Eritrean, Palestinian and Somali refugees are amongst those who have been resettled under the programme. Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN has {{recommended}} co-operation between countries across the cheetah's range to minimise {{the conflict between}} cheetahs and human beings. A 2016 study showed that ecotourism can have a significantly <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the conservation of the cheetah. Although the requirement of space for the habitat {{would have to be}} compromised in most cases, establishment of private reserves for cheetahs and ensuring the absence of predators and poachers could be a successful conservation measure. Additionally, the financial benefits accrued and the awareness generated can further aid the cause of the cheetah. At the same time, the animals should not be unnecessarily handled or disturbed, as cheetahs are particularly sensitive to human interference.|$|E

Results reveal that, in all three sectors, employment growth was higher among firms that initiated FDI than those that remained exclusively domestic. Moreover, manufacturing firms experienced higher growth in the share of non-regular workers. In addition, empirical results indicate that FDI's positive employment effects were accompanied by <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> overall sales and/or exports. <b>Positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> export sales in manufacturing and wholesale sectors and on overall sales in manufacturing and services sectors were found...|$|R

5|$|The {{extinction}} of megalodon {{set the stage}} for further changes in marine communities. The average body size of baleen whales increased significantly after its disappearance, although possibly due to other, climate-related, causes. Conversely however, the increase in baleen whale size {{may have contributed to the}} {{extinction of}} megalodon, as they may have preferred to go after smaller whales; bite marks on large whale species may have come from scavenging sharks. Megalodon may have simply become coextinct with smaller whale species, such as Piscobalaena nana. The extinction of megalodon had a <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> other apex predators of the time, such as the great white shark, in some cases spreading to regions where megalodon became absent.|$|E
5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> their sense of well-being.|$|E
5|$|Werner Erhard (born John Paul Rosenberg), a California-based former salesman, {{training}} manager and {{executive in the}} encyclopedia business, created the Erhard Seminars Training (est) course in 1971. est {{was a form of}} Large Group Awareness Training, and was part of the Human Potential Movement. est was a four-day, 60-hour self-help program given to groups of 250people at a time. The program was very intensive: each day would contain 15–20hours of instruction. During the training, est personnel utilized jargon to convey key concepts, and participants had to agree to certain rules that remained in effect {{for the duration of the}} course. Participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes, and were promised a dramatic change in their self-perception. est was controversial. While some critics characterized the training methods as brainwashing, proponents and participants asserted that it had a profoundly <b>positive</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> people's lives. By 1984 nearly half a million people had completed the est training, including public figures and mental health professionals.|$|E
40|$|There is {{debate about}} whether {{microfinance}} has <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> education and health for borrowing households in developing countries. To provide evidence for this debate we use a new survey {{designed to meet the}} conditions for propensity score matching (PSM) and examine the impact of household credit on education and healthcare spending by the poor in peri-urban areas of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In addition to matching statistically identical non-borrowers with borrowers, our estimates also control for household pre-treatment income and assets, which may be associated with unobservable factors affecting both credit participation and the outcomes of interest. The PSM estimates of binary treatment effect show significant and <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> of borrowing <b>on</b> education and healthcare spending. However, multiple ordered treatment effect estimates reveal that only formal credit has significant and <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> education and healthcare spending, while informal credit has insignificant <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> the spending. matching; education and healthcare spending; household credit; the poor; peri-urban; Vietnam...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate individual private returns to tertiary academic achievement based on the classical human capital model. Using non-random sampling method, a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from relevant participants. A reduced form Structural Equation Model (SEM) in STATA 12 was applied to estimate individual private returns to tertiary academic achievement. The computed results show that both tertiary academic achievement and college ranking have sizable effects on individual incomes; while tertiary academic achievement further has a significant <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> employment prospects. Congruently, employment prospects and individual incomes exhibit substantial endogenous <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> tertiary academic achievement. The reduced form estimates of the SEM show that grade point average (GPA) and college ranking have significant <b>positive</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> tertiary academic achievement, employment prospects and individual incomes...|$|R
