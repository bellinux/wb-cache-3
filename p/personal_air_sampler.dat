40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to compare personal air sampling data to stationary air sampling data and to bioassay data that was taken during the decontamination and decommissioning of sixty-one plutonium glove boxes at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in 1995. An air monitoring program administered at Argonne National Laboratory was assessed by comparing <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> (PAS) data, stationary air sampler (SAS) data, and bioassay data. The study revealed that the PAS and SAS techniques were equivalent when averaged over all employees and all workdays, but the standard deviation was large. Also, large deviations were observed in individual samples. The correlation between individual PAS results and bioassay results was low. Personal air samplers and bioassay monitoring played complementary roles in assessing the workplace and estimating intakes. The PAS technique is adequate for detection and evaluation of contaminated atmospheres, whereas bioassay monitoring is better for determining individual intakes...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Biomedical Technology)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 2003 Increased seafood {{consumption}} {{due to its}} {{nutrition and}} promotion of a healthy diet has lead to more frequent reports of allergic reactions. In the seafood industry, workers {{are exposed to the}} antigens through inhalation of the vapours created during the seafood processing and cooking. Most seafood allergens are stable molecules, which are resistant to the effect of cooking and processing. The prevalence of occupational asthma varies from 7 - 36 % among different groups of workers including seafood processing and fishmeal workers, fishermen and restaurant cooks (Jeebhay et al 2001). Purpose of Study: The purpose of the study is to determine total protein and the specific fish antigen concentrations in the environment by means of <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> filters obtained from various categories of workers in the seafood processing industry. Objectives: • To determine the correlation between total protein concentrations and specific fish (pilchard and anchovy) antigen concentrations on <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> filters using the linear response model of the standard curve. • To determine the correlation between total protein concentrations and specific fish (pilchard and anchovy) antigen concentrations on <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> filters using the sigmoidal response model with a variable slope of the standard curve. • To identify the most efficient standard curve response model for fish antigen detection by comparing the percentage recovery of the linear standard curve response model and the sigmoidal standard curve response model.

The mix of active pesticide ingredients is changing in response to 2000 – 2001 regulations restricting use of the organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the impact of U. S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations on pest infestation levels, pesticide use, and pesticides measured in indoor <b>air</b> <b>samples.</b> METHODOLOGY: 511 pregnant women from inner-city New York were enrolled between 2000 and 2006.

40|$|Objectives 　To {{investigate}} the adverse effect of manganese exposure on the iron metabolism in peripheral blood of professionally exposed workers. Methods 　The manganese in air was collected using <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler,</b> {{and the time}} weighted average (TWA) concentration of exposure to manganese was then calculated. The subjects were divided into exposure group (n= 85) and control group (n= 80) based on the exposure doses they received. The concentrations of iron and manganese in the plasma and blood cells of the subjects were determined using flame atomic absorption detector and graphite furnace atomic absorption detector. Serum ferritin, transferrin, transferrin receptor and total iron binding capacity were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results 　The manganese contents in both plasma and blood cells were much higher in exposure group than in control group (P 0. 05). It was revealed by linear correlation analysis that no linear correlation existed between the professional exposure time and manganese and iron contents in both plasma and blood cells, serum ferrin, transferrin, transferring receptor and total iron binding capacity (P> 0. 05).

In each of those municipalities three air monitoring stations were established representing predominant industrial, commercial and residential areas. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2) had been estimated from air sampling programme which spanned 7 months and a total of 126 days reflecting winter, premonsoon and monsoon seasons. Low Volume Air (LVA) Sampler and <b>Personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> were used for sampling. UV spectrophotometer was used for estimation of the NO 2. The study found that during winter season the concentration of NO 2 was more and among the areas commercial area found to be highest level pollution.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Assessment {{of level}} of {{exposure}} to platinum and platinum concentration in urine from platinum industry workers to evaluate internal exposures and excretion kinetics. METHODS: Platinum concentrations in urine samples from 34 workers were measured by adsorptive voltammetry after UV-photolysis. Morning and evening samples were taken two to six times during six months. Individual exposures were assessed by <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampling.</b> Also, two male volunteers were exposed to platinum dust for four hours at a typical platinum refinery workplace. RESULTS: Urinary platinum excretion after a shift in platinum industry workers {{was found to be}} up to 6270 ng/g creatinine [...] that is, 1000 times above the median value of unexposed people. Urinary excretion reached the maximum nearly 10 hours after inhalative exposure to dust containing platinum. Elimination corresponded to a first half life of about 50 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 36 to 66) hours, but there were indications that a part of the incorporated platinum is stored longer. The amount of urinary platinum excretion showed a close correlation with the exposure level monitored by <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampling.</b> CONCLUSIONS: A newly developed analytical method enabled the detection of even natural background concentrations of platinum.

Three sampling stations were considered in Mysore city. Indoor concentration of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) emitted from all the three fuels were monitored using <b>Personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler.</b> Sampling before, during and after cooking was carried out for 2 hours. The average indoor concentrations before, during and after cooking {{were found to be}} 67. 93, 298. 40 and 95. 15 µg/m 3 respectively for kerosene. The average Indoor concentrations before, during and after cooking was found to be 67. 06, 1484. 89 and 485. 768 µg/m 3 while the average concentrations for Indoor before, during and after cooking were found to be 53. 03 µg/m 3, 62. 17 µg/m 3 and 57. 22 µg/m 3 respectively for LPG. Biomass seems to emit high concentrations of RSPM followed by kerosene and LPG. To characterize the morphology of RSPM, filter papers were examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy.

40|$|Intakes of {{radionuclides}} {{are estimated}} with the <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> (PAS) and by biological monitoring techniques: {{in the case}} of plutonium, there are problems with both methods. The statistical variation in activity collected when sampling radioactive aerosols with low number concentrations was investigated. By treating man as an ideal sampler, an analytical expression was developed for the probability distribution of intake following a single measurement on a PAS. The dependence on aerosol size, specific activity and density was investigated. The methods were extended to apply to routine monitoring procedures for plutonium. Simple algebraic approximations were developed to give the probability of exceeding estimated intakes and doses by given factors. The conditions were defined under which PAS monitoring meets the ICRP definition of adequacy. It was shown that the PAS is barely adequate for monitoring plutonium at ALl levels in typical workplaceconditions. Two algorithms were developed, enabling non-recycling and recycling compartmental models to be solved. Their accuracy and speed were investigated, and methods of dealing with partitioning, continuous intake, and radioactive progeny were discussed. Analytical, rather than numerical, methods were used. These are faster, and thus ideally suited for implementation on microcomputers. The algorithms enable non-specialists to solve quickly and easily any first order compartmental model, including all the ICRP metabolic models. Nonrecycling models with up to 50 compartments can be solved in seconds: recycling models take a little longer. A biokinetic model for plutonium in man following systemic uptake was developed. The proposed ICRP lung model (1989) was represented by a first order compartmental model. These two models were combined, and the recycling algorithm was used to calculate urinary and faecal excretion of plutonium following acute or chronic intake by inhalation. The results indicate much lower urinary excretion than predicted by ICRP Publication 54...|$|E
40|$|It is {{more and}} more {{recognised}} that an estimation of the exposure of the population to air pollutants is more relevant than the ambient air quality, since it gives a better indication of health risk. Outdoor workers in an urban region are generally of low income status and are exposed to higher levels of both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Hence respondents from this population subgroup have been selected for this study. Outdoor workers are divided into two categories, viz. traffic constables and casual outdoor workers like watchmen, roadside shopkeepers etc. Most of the respondents are from the lower income group. Each respondent is monitored for a continuous 48 -hour period. The sampling frequency is once a week. The study region is situated in the north-west part of the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation. It can be classified as industrial cum residential area. The daily integrated exposure of the outdoor workers consists of two major micro-environments, viz. occupational and indoor residential. A <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> was used along with a cyclone to measure levels of Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM). The cyclone has a 50 % removal efficiency for particle diameter of 5 mu m. Paired samples of PM 10 (ambient) and RPM (personal) were collected to establish the correlation between them. The average 24 -hour integrated exposure to RPM was 322 mu g/m(3) and exceeded the corresponding PM 10 level observed at the nearest Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station by a factor of 2. 25. The 90 % confidence interval for this exposure is 283 - 368 mu g/m(3).

Spot urine samples were collected during the same 48 -hr period from the New York women (n = 25). The following four phthalates or their metabolites were measured in both <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> and urine: diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP). All were present in 100 % of the <b>air</b> and urine <b>samples.</b> Ranges in <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> were as follows: DEP (0. 26 – 7. 12 µg/m 3), DBP (0. 11 – 14. 76 µg/m 3), DEHP (0. 05 – 1. 08 µg/m 3), and BBzP (0. 00 – 0. 63 µg/m 3). The mean <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> concentrations of DBP, di-isobutyl phthalate, and DEHP are higher in Krakow, whereas the mean <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> concentration of DEP is higher in New York.

Conventional dosimeters may not be at hand {{or may not be}} applicable calling for alternative materials. The possible exposure situations can be divided into external and internal; the radiation field stems either from outside the body or from a source within. This thesis investigates the possibility to use chewing gum and hair as retrospective dosimeters. The chewing gum would be used after an unexpected radiation event of external type whereas human hair is examined after chronic intake of uranium. Chewing gum containing xylitol and sorbitol was analyzed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and the hair was analyzed by alphaspectrometry following radiochemistry and by synchrotron radiation microbeam x-ray fluorescence (SR μ-XRF). Xylitol and chewing gum (in this particular case, V 6) are in the present work found to be valuable dosimeters after unexpected radiation events. The xylitol signal linearity with dose in the interval 0 - 10 Gy was confirmed (r 2 = 1. 00). The doses to the coating of the chewing gums were determined 4 - 6 days after irradiation with an uncertainty of less than 0. 2 Gy (1 SD). Spectral dependence with time after exposure was found, but was, however, minimal between 4 - 8 days. Hair was evaluated and compared with urine as biodosimeter after ingestion and inhalation intake of uranium. Concentrations of 234 U and 238 U and their activity ratios were measured in the hair, urine and drinking water sampled from 24 drilled bedrock well water users in Östergötland, Sweden, as well as among 8 workers at a nuclear fuel fabrication factory, Westinghouse Electric Sweden. The results show that there is a stronger correlation between the uranium concentrations in the drinking water of the well water and the users’ hair (r 2 = 0. 50) than with their urine (r 2 = 0. 21). There is also a stronger correlation between the 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios of water and hair (r 2 = 0. 91) than between water and urine (r 2 = 0. 56). The individual absorbed fraction of uranium, the ƒ value, calculated as the ratio between the excreted amount of uranium in urine and hair per day and the daily drinking water intake of uranium stretched from 0. 002 to 0. 10 with a median of 0. 023. The uranium concentrations of the fuel factory workers’ hair and urine were also obtained {{as well as that of}} <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> (PAS) filters for the determination of inhaled uranium activity. A large day-to-day variation (7 - 70 Bq d- 1) of the inhaled 234 U activity was seen over a 6 week period. Over a 12 week period the 234 U activity concentration in urine was similarly seen to vary from 2 to 50 mBq kg- 1. Four hair samples from the same subject and period showed less variation (100 - 240 mBq g- 1). The uranium inhalation to urine and hair factors finh,u and finh,h were found to be 0. 0014 and 0. 0002 respectively given by calculations based on the measured PAS, urine and hair data from two individuals. The SR μ-XRF measurements showed that uranium is present in an outer layer of the hair shaft, about 10 - 15 μm wide. The  measurements also revealed particles containing uranium being present on the surface of unwashed hair shafts. However, the washed hair shafts showed few, if any, particles.

Exposure to total PAH for all worksites varied from 3. 99 to 120. 6 μg PAH m− 3 and for benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) from 0. 17 to 4. 88 μg BaP m− 3. The concentration of 1 -hydroxypyrene in post- and pre-shift urine samples was in the range (0. 5 - 61. 8 μmol 1 -OHP per mol creatinine) and depended on the worksite. The Spearman rank correlation test showed a low but significant (P< 0. 05) correlation of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene in the post- and pre-shift samples with respiratory pyrene exposure. The quantitative aspects of biological monitoring for the evaluation of respiratory PAH exposure were tested with a pharmacokinetic model. On the basis of individual pyrene exposure, excretion of urinary 1 - hydroxypyrene during the working week was calculated for each worker. The results presented in this investigation indicate that biological monitoring of the pyrene metabolite 1 -hydroxypyrene is a useful indicator of a general PAll exposure, but cannot replace <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> for assessing the lung cancer risk of individuals.

40|$|Abstract This article {{reports the}} results of a study, {{conducted}} in the framework of the scientific activities of the Italian Society for Reference Values, aimed at defining reference values of urinary trans,trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA) in the general population not occupationally exposed to benzene. t,t-MA concentrations detected in 376 subjects of the resident population in three areas of Italy, two in central (Florence and southern Tuscany) and one in northern Italy (Padua), by three laboratories, compared by repeated interlaboratory controls, showed an interval of 14. 4 - 225. 0 microg/L (5 th- 95 th percentile) and a geometric mean of 52. 5 microg/L. The concentrations measured were influenced by tobacco smoking in a statistically significant way: Geometric mean concentrations were 44. 8 microg/L and 76. 1 microg/Ll in nonsmokers (264 subjects) and smokers (112 subjects), respectively. In the nonsmoking population, a significant influence of gender was found when concentrations were corrected for urinary creatinine, geometric mean concentrations being 36. 7 microg/g creatinine in males (128 subjects) and 44. 7 microg/g creatinine in females (136 subjects). The place of residence of subjects did not seem to influence urinary excretion of the metabolite, although personal inhalation exposure to benzene over a 24 -h period showed slightly higher concentrations in Padua and Florence (geometric means of 6. 5 microg/m(3) and 6. 6 microg/m(3), respectively) than in southern Tuscany (geometric mean of 3. 9 microg/m(3)). Concentration of t,t-MA in urine samples collected at the end of <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> showed little relationship to personal inhalation exposure to benzene, confirming the importance of other factors in determining excretion of t,t-MA when concentrations in <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> are very low...|$|R
40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} managers serving the Kootenai National Forest in Montana. The request concerned employees' potential exposure to Libby amphibole during forest management and fire suppression activities in an area surrounding a former vermiculite mine. The site has approximately 40 full-time employees, and up to 100 additional employees in the summer. Work shifts are typically 8 - 10 hours per day. Most of the work involves land management activities, including civil engineering, trail and road maintenance, forest biology, fuels and timber management, hydrology, and wildland fire suppression. Our evaluation included (1) observing work activities and use of PPE, and (2) collecting and analyzing the samples for asbestos and Libby amphibole. We collected full shift and activity-based <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> on employees conducting various forest management activities; bulk samples of bark, duff, and soil; and wipe and vacuum samples from surfaces in the hydrology lab. Six of 109 <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> analyzed by PCM exceeded the occupational exposure limit of 0. 1 f/cc; however, we found non-asbestos material that met {{the definition of a}} fiber on these samples. Of the 27 <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> evaluated by TEM, which included the six <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> exceeding 0. 1 f/cc, six contained mineral fibers. Five of six contained richterite (one of the fibers that compose Libby amphibole), and one contained chrysotile (a serpentine form of asbestos). Of the five samples containing richterite, four were collected during fireline construction and one was collected during tree thinning. On the basis of these results, we found that employee exposures to Libby amphibole did not exceed occupational exposure limits during activities in the mine area. We detected no Libby amphibole in the bulk or surface samples. Employees wore respirators during trail maintenance and fuel reduction activities and completed a 3 -stage decontamination; removed and discarded equipment and clothing, showered, and changed into street clothing. We recommended the employer (1) create a respirator program for employees working in the mine area, (2) periodically monitor employees' exposure to Libby amphibole, (3) analyze samples for Libby amphibole by electron microscopy in addition to current methods, (4) schedule dust generating work when the potential for dust generation is low, and (5) train employees on good work practices to minimize dust.

The removal of the road surface {{has the potential to}} release respirable crystalline silica, to which workers can be exposed. This article describes an evaluation of respirable crystalline silica exposures to the operator and ground worker from two different half-lane and larger asphalt pavement milling machines that had ventilation dust controls and water-sprays designed and installed by the manufacturers. Manufacturer A completed milling for 1120 days at 4 highway construction sites in Wisconsin, and Manufacturer B completed milling for 1020 days at 7 highway construction sites in Indiana. To evaluate the dust controls, full-shift <b>personal</b> breathing zone <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> were collected from an operator and ground worker during the course of normal employee work activities of asphalt pavement milling at 11 different sites. Forty-two <b>personal</b> breathing zone <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> were collected over 2120 days (sampling on an operator and ground worker each day). All samples were below 502025 g/m(3) for respirable crystalline silica, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommended exposure limit. The geometric mean <b>personal</b> breathing zone <b>air</b> <b>sample</b> was 6. 22025 g/m(3) for the operator and 6. 12025 g/m(3) for the ground worker for the Manufacturer A milling machine.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to measure the dermal and {{respiratory}} exposure levels of hexavalent chromium during electroplating work. Methods: Potential dermal exposure of the body was measured with patch samples and actual exposure of hands with hand-wash <b>samples.</b> For comparison, <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> were also collected. Results: The exposure varied widely between workers. The range of body and hand expos-ure to the electroplating solution was 0. 17 – 28. 1 mg/h and 0. 04 – 6. 37 mg/h, respectively. Hands and lower limbs were the most contaminated body parts. Conclusions: The results of breathing zone samples and dermal exposure did not correlate with each other. In manual electroplating processes, dermal exposure was higher than in semi-automatic and automatic processes. The amount of hexavalent chromium the workers were exposed to is probably high enough to cause a risk of skin sensitization...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to measure the dermal {{exposure}} levels of chromium dust during grinding of stainless and acid-proof steel parts. Methods: The potential dermal exposure of the body was measured with a patch sampling method and the actual exposure of hands with a hand-wash method. Simultaneously, <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> were also collected. Results: The range of body and hand exposure to chromium dust was 4. 04 – 3406 and 0. 72 – 79. 7 mg/h, respectively. Dust was distributed quite evenly to different body parts. Conclusions: Workers using hand-held grinding tools were more exposed than those using band grinders. It was judged that the sampling methods applied in this study gave a realistic estimation of exposure levels, because of the uniform distribution of contamination during grinding. Respiratory exposure was high compared to Finnish occupational exposure limit values...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{methods for}} {{monitoring}} occupational creosote exposure {{have focused on}} inhalation. However, {{there is evidence that}} dermal exposure contributes importantly to total systemic dose, as measured by biological monitoring methods. This study was conducted to further characterize the relationships between inhalation and dermal exposures to creosote, and to compare traditional ambient exposure monitoring versus biological monitoring in 36 creosote-exposed wood treatment workers. Full-shift <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> were obtained, along with post-shift and next-day urine measurements for 1 -hydroxypyrene. There was little or no correlation between airborne measures and urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene (r 2 0. 05 to 0. 35). More than 90 % of 1 -hydroxy-pyrene could be attributed to dermal exposure. These data indicate that traditional monitoring methods may be inappropriate for creosote workers, raising concerns about the adequacy of methods currently mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Objectives We {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} 1 -Nitropyrene (1 -NP) concentration in air is a viable surrogate measure of diesel exhaust exposure, as compared with industry-standard elemental carbon (EC) and total carbon (TC) measurements. 1 -NP content in <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> was measured for a cohort of underground miners and compared with measures of Elemental Carbon (EC), Organic Carbon (OC), and Total Carbon (TC) in the same samples. Additionally, data from surveys was assessed as potential modifiers of these comparisons, and used to form a predictive model for 1 -NP. Methods Personal exposure data were collected on a cohort of 20 employees at a large underground metal mine during 4 different sample campaigns. Full-shift personal sampling was conducted using an MSHA compliant SKC DPM impactor downstream of a GS- 1 cyclone pre-filter. Each DPM filter element was analyzed for EC and OC using NIOSH method 5040. After EC and OC analysis each DPM filter was extracted with methylene chloride and analyzed for 1 -NP using an LC/MS/MS method. Results Regression analysis of 1 -NP vs. EC yields a 5. 3 % increase in geometric mean (GM) 1 -NP for each 10 % increase in GM EC (p< 0. 001). Associations between 1 -NP and OC or TC were {{not found to be}} statistically significant. Survey data variables for location in the mine, fuel type, and cigarettes smoked were investigated for effect modification upon the 1 -NP/EC association and none were found statistically significant. Out of ten survey variable combinations examined as predictive models for 1 -NP, a model predicting 1 -NP from primary tasks conducted alone was found to yield the best model performance (cross-validated r 2 = 0. 254). Conclusions 1 -NP was found to be associated with EC in <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples.</b> 1 -NP was not found to be associated with OC or TC with statistical significance, due to a large number of OC samples below the limit of detection. Location within the mine, fuel type, and cigarette use as examined in this study were not found to significantly affect the 1 -NP/EC association. Information on primary job tasks can be used to predict <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> concentrations of 1 -NP...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to compare the {{exposure}} levels of benzene in maintenance and regular works at the petrochemical plant. Four companies handling benzene were investigated during maintenance and regular works. The data were analyzed by classifying the workers into two groups (maintenance operations: 129, regular operations: 63) comprising a total of 192 plant workers. Benzene concentrations in long-term samples during maintenance were found to be 1. 7 – 9 times higher than those during regular operations; furthermore, benzene concentrations in short-term samples during maintenance were 20 times higher than those during regular operations (p< 0. 01). For <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples,</b> the exceedances above the ACGIH TLV for benzene were 17. 8 % during maintenance operations and were not significant during regular operations. In short-term <b>air</b> <b>samples,</b> the exceedances above TLV were 11. 1 % during maintenance works and none of the samples exceeded the TLVs during regular operations. Therefore, the periodic monitoring according to manual which is standardized is necessary to reinforce during maintenance operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{exposure}} of shipyard workers to asbestos has been frequently investigated during the in-stallation, repair or {{removal of asbestos}} insulation. The same level of attention, however, has not been directed to asbestos {{exposure of}} maritime seamen or sailors. In this paper, we assem-ble and analyze historical industrial hygiene (IH) data quantifying airborne asbestos concen-trations onboard maritime shipping vessels between 1978 and 1992. Air monitoring and bulk sampling data were compiled from 52 IH surveys conducted on 84 different vessels, including oil tankers and cargo vessels, that were docked and/or at sea, but these were not collected dur-ing times when there was interaction with asbestos-containing materials (ACMs). One thou-sand and eighteen area <b>air</b> <b>samples,</b> 20 <b>personal</b> <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> and 24 <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> of unknown origin were analyzed by phase contrast microscopy (PCM); 19 area samples and six samples of unknown origin were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 13 area <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, 482 bulk sam-ples were collected from suspected ACMs, including insulation, ceiling panels, floor tiles, valve packing and gaskets.
