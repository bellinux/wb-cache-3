5|$|Children {{have always}} played games. It is {{accepted}} {{that as well}} as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder called Children's Games, painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as marbles, hide-and-seek, blowing soap bubbles and <b>piggyback</b> riding continue to be played.|$|E

5|$|Although railroads {{have lost}} much of the general-freight-carrying {{business}} to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of containerization has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds. In addition, the introduction of <b>piggyback</b> flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E
40|$|The <b>piggybacking</b> {{framework}} for designing erasure codes for distributed storage has empirically {{proven to be}} very useful, and {{has been used to}} design codes with desirable properties, such as low repair bandwidth and complexity. However, the theoretical properties of this framework remain largely unexplored. We address this by adapting a general characterization of repair schemes (previously used for Reed Solomon codes) to analyze <b>piggybacking</b> codes with low substriping. With this characterization, we establish a separation between <b>piggybacking</b> and general erasure codes, and several impossibility results for subcategories of <b>piggybacking</b> codes; for certain parameters, we also present explicit, optimal constructions of <b>piggybacking</b> codes...|$|R
40|$|This paper generalizes the <b>piggybacking</b> constructions for {{distributed}} storage {{systems by}} considering various protected instances and piggybacked instances. Analysis {{demonstrates that the}} proportion of protected instances determines the average repair bandwidth for a systematic node. By optimizing the proportion of protected instances, the repair ratio of generalized <b>piggybacking</b> codes approaches zero instead of 50 % as the number of parity check nodes tends to infinity. Furthermore, the computational complexity for repairing a single systematic node cost by generalized <b>piggybacking</b> codes is less than that of the existing <b>piggybacking</b> designs...|$|R

5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as <b>piggyback.</b> The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background.|$|E

40|$|<b>Piggybacking</b> is an {{efficient}} method {{to decrease the}} repair bandwidth of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes or Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes. In this paper, for minimizing the repair bandwidth of parity nodes of the known MSR codes with high rate, which is usually the whole size of the original data, i. e., the maximal, a new systematic <b>piggybacking</b> design is proposed through an in-depth analysis of the design of <b>piggybacking.</b> As a result, new MSR codes are obtained with almost optimal repair bandwidth of parity nodes while retaining the optimal repair bandwidth of systematic nodes. Furthermore, MSR codes with balanced download during node repair process are presented based on the new <b>piggybacking</b> design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} the presumed-either two-phase commit protocol. Presumed-either exploits log <b>piggybacking</b> {{to reduce the}} cost of committing transactions. If timely <b>piggybacking</b> occurs, presumed-either combines the performance advantages of presumed-abort and presumed-commit. Otherwise, presumed-either behaves much like the widely-used presumed-abort protocol.

25|$|As strikers rallied {{against the}} McCormick plant, {{a team of}} {{political}} anarchists, who were not Knights, tried to <b>piggyback</b> support among striking Knights workers. A bomb exploded as police were dispersing a peaceful rally, killing seven policemen and wounding many others. The anarchists were blamed, and their spectacular trial gained national attention. The Knights of Labor were seriously injured by the false accusation that the Knights promoted anarchistic violence. Many Knights locals transferred to the less radical and more respectable AFL unions or railroad brotherhoods.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} {{commonly}} used of these <b>piggyback</b> protocols was Echomail, public discussions similar to Usenet newsgroups in nature. Echomail was supported by a variety of software that collected up new messages from the local BBSes' public forums (the scanner), compressed it using ARC or ZIP, attached the resulting archive to a Netmail message, and sent that message to a selected system. On receiving such a message, identified because it was addressed to a particular user, the reverse process was used to extract the messages, and a tosser put them back into the new system's forums.|$|E

A <b>piggybacking</b> relationship consists of a rider (SME) and a carrier (larger MNC), where the rider exploits the carriers’ marketing resources. These relationships enable small firms, lacking resources and competencies, to overcome barriers in foreign markets. The research investigates whether <b>piggybacking</b> increases the riders’ probability to become an independent international firm eventually, and use a multiple-case study to test 6 propositions. The findings reveal that foreign-established riders {{are more likely to}} conduct independent international strategies, and riders who are entrepreneurial and flexible tend to become more international...|$|R

Any additional IVs to be administered {{are connected to the}} primary tubing and are called secondary IV, or IV <b>piggyback</b> instead of having to place multiple catheters in the patient. When administering a secondary IV medication, the primary bag is held lower than the secondary bag so that the secondary medication can flow into the primary tubing rather than fluid from the primary bag flowing into the secondary tubing. The fluid from the primary bag is needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary IV from the tubing into the patient.|$|E
25|$|North American railroads {{operated}} 1,471,736 {{freight cars}} and 31,875 locomotives, with 215,985 employees. They originated 39.53 million carloads (averaging 63 tons each) and generated $81.7 billion in freight revenue of present 2014. The average haul was 917 miles. The largest (Class 1) U.S. railroads carried 10.17 million intermodal containers and 1.72 million <b>piggyback</b> trailers. Intermodal traffic was 6.2% of tonnage originated and 12.6% of revenue. The largest commodities were coal, chemicals, farm products, nonmetallic minerals and intermodal. Other major commodities carried include lumber, automobiles, and waste materials. Coal alone was 43.3% of tonnage and 24.7% of revenue. Coal accounted for {{roughly half of}} U.S. electricity generation and was a major export. As natural gas became cheaper than coal, coal supplies dropped 11% in 2015 but coal rail freight dropped by up to 40%, allowing an increase in car transport by rail, some in tri-level railcars.|$|E
