40|$|In recent years, the {{international}} oil price has fluctuated violently, bringing about huge risk for {{the international}} oil trade. In fact, the risk of crude oil and <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> imports is different because of the different import origins and prices. Which import risk is lower for China? From the perspective of oil supply security, how should China portfolio crude oil and <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> imports to minimize its oil import risk? Using portfolio theory and a diversification index approach, this paper compares and analyzes the supply, price and transport risks of crude oil and <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> imports. Our {{results show that the}} following: (1) Specific risk (diversification risk) and marine transport risk of China's <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> imports are lower than that of crude oil imports. (2) The average rate of return of China's <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> imports is higher than that of crude oil imports. Moreover, the average import price variance of <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> imports is lower than that of crude oil imports. Thus, the systematic risk (price risk) of <b>petroleum</b> <b>products</b> is lower too. Therefore, from the perspective of oil supply security, China should increase <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> imports to decrease its oil import risk.

We use panel unit root rests and long-run modeling based on vector error correction models to assess links and convergence in <b>petroleum</b> <b>product</b> prices across countries. Our results indicate that in general over the long-run there is convergence in prices across the countries. The estimation results for gasoline and diesel prices suggest the presence of long-run links between retail prices among the different country groupings with long-run multipliers ranging from 11 to - 6. 66. The speed of Adjustment to equilibrium varies significantly according to the countrygroupings considered. In contrast, the econometric results for kerosene prices not only indicate a weaker link between prices across countries, but also a much slower adjustment to equilibrium.
