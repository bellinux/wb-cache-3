5000|$|Each brake {{reservoir}} stores air at {{a pressure}} of 7 bar and is fed via a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> off the Main Reservoir Pipe. The driver's brake handle passes control voltages down three wires to each EP control valve, which allows {{air from the}} brake reservoir to pass into the brake cylinder, thereby activating the disc brake. The presence of the voltage holds the brakes off, providing a Fail Safe system.|$|E
50|$|A {{low-temperature}} separator is {{a special}} one in which high-pressure well fluid is jetted into the vessel through a choke or <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> so that the separator temperature is reduced appreciably below the well-fluid temperature. The temperature reduction is obtained by the Joule-Thomson effect of expanding well fluid as it flows through the pressure-reducing choke or valve into the separator. The lower operating temperature in the separator causes condensation of vapors that otherwise would exit the separator in the vapor state. Liquids thus recovered require stabilization to prevent excessive evaporation in the storage tanks.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{attempts to}} solve the BBLAWN challenge. The examined town consists of several pressure zones with significant elevation differences, causing accesses water pressure and pipe leakage. The challenge of optimally resizing the water system, to meet future water demands and minimize leakage, was solved using a successive linear programming, minimum cost, optimal operation model that includes head loss constraints, leakage control, pipe diameter selection and <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> A combination of an optimization model and practical engineering experience {{was used in the}} positioning of the <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> and sizing of pump stations and water tanks...|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{electricity}} generation from water pipelines was rare because {{the water would}} have been pumped by other engines in the system prior to the intake of water turbines to generate electricity. The energy generated from the turbines would have been offset by the power used in pumping, canceling out the power generation benefit. However, there have been renewed interests to apply this method to recover energy {{when there is a}} need to <b>reduce</b> <b>pressure</b> in the water supply system that is normally done through <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> The conduit hydro{{electricity generation}} in this case can be done by replacing the <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> with small turbines and electrical generators.|$|R
5000|$|During its {{operational}} life, {{the steam}} reservoir was charged to [...] from a charging plant at Kemsley, and a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> admitted steam to the cylinders at [...] It {{was capable of}} working for 8 hours on one charge, although was rarely used for more than 4 hours at a time. It remained the most powerful engine on the site until the 0-4-4-0T Monarch was delivered in 1953. It continued in use until {{the closure of the}} former Lloyd's system, and was acquired by the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway. It is now preserved, but has not worked in preservation, as {{there is no longer a}} source of high-pressure steam available to charge it.|$|E
50|$|Since ACE {{introduced}} its valve many companies have engineered their own versions. Though {{many of the}} products available vary in features and applicability, the fundamental design is the same. When the pressure inside the container drops below a set point, a valve opens and allows the blanketing gas to enter. Once the pressure reaches the set point, the valve closes. As a safety feature, many systems include a pressure vent that opens when the pressure inside exceeds a maximum pressure set point. This helps to prevent the container from rupturing due to high pressure. Since most blanketing gas sources will provide gas {{at a much higher}} than desired pressure, a blanketing system will also use a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> to decrease the inlet pressure to the tank.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pressure}} {{of a sample}} stream can be lowered by a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valve,</b> particularly since many analysers are not designed to withstand high pressure. Such pressure reducing or similar valves {{may be used to}} control the flow rate to the online analyser. If the process pressure is insufficient to allow a sample stream to flow by itself to the analyser, a small pump may be used to move it there. The temperature of a hot sample may be lowered by use of an online sample cooler. The sampling and analysis can be done at the command of an operator, periodically (for example, every 15 minutes), or continuously - providing an analysis result vs. time graph on a chart recorder, computer, or other device. For periodic sampling, valves (or other devices) can be switched open to allow a fluid sample stream to flow to the analyser and shut when not sampling.|$|E

50|$|As the {{pressure}} builds rapidly {{in relation to}} depth, underground mining operations require a fairly complex water system with <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> These devices must be installed at a certain distance interval, usually 600 ft.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} optimal pressure management in water distribution systems through the introduction and regulation of <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> Reduction in <b>pressure</b> is aimed at controlling water leakages which, being in some cases {{a high proportion of}} the total volume supplied, are nowadays one of the major concerns for water utilities. The determination of the number, location, and setting of such valves is formulated as a two criteria optimization problem and is solved with multiobjective genetic algorithms. In particular, the first criterion is represented by the minimization of the number of valves, and the second is the minimization of the total leakage in the system, when maintaining the required pressure at each node. The great advantage of the multiobjective approach resides in the fact that, in one run, several trade-off alternatives are found, thus providing the set of the optimal solutions with a different level of compromise between the conflicting objectives. At the same time, data necessary for practical choice and operation of <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> may be determined...|$|R
50|$|In {{the plant}} design, the units are sized for the maximum {{capacity}} each {{may have to}} handle. Similarly, sizes for pipes, pumps, compressors, and associated equipment are chosen for the flow capacity they have to handle. Utility systems such as electric power and water supply should also {{be included in the}} plant design. Additional piping lines for non-routine or alternate operating procedures, such as plant or unit startups and shutdowns, may have to be included. Fluid systems design commonly includes isolation valves around various units or parts of a plant so that a section of a plant could be isolated in case of a problem such as a leak in a unit. If pneumatically or hydraulically actuated valves are used, a system of pressurizing lines to the actuators is needed. Any points where process samples may have to be taken should have sampling lines, valves, and access to them included in the detailed design. If necessary, provisions should be made for reducing high pressure or temperature of a sampling stream, such including a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> or sample cooler.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} system of Dallas Water Utilities (DWU) {{is one of}} the largest in the United States. As of June 2003, DWU provided retail water service to just over 1.2 million people within the Dallas city limits. The major {{distribution system}} facilities include 28 pump stations (including the high service pump stations at the three water treatment plants), 11 ground storage reservoirs, 9 elevated tanks, and 78 vault structures separate from the major facilities, in addition to over 4600 mi of distribution and transmission main. The distribution system is divided into 17 pressure zones to maintain adequate water pressures throughout the system. There are four major pressure zones (Central Low,North High, East High, and South High), and five smaller secondary pressure zones (Meandering Way High, Red Bird High, Trinity Heights, Pleasant Grove, and Cedardale) which comprise most of the Dallas service area. Each of the nine major and secondarypressure zones are supplied by one or more pump stations and have elevated or ground storage facilities that establish the static hydraulic gradient for each zone. The remaining eight pressure zones are supplied from an adjacent pressure zone via <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valve,</b> or single, small booster pump station. These pressure zones do not have storage facilities that establish their static hydraulic gradient.|$|E
50|$|An oxygen {{concentrator}} has an air compressor, two cylinders filled with zeolite pellets, a pressure equalizing reservoir, and some valves and tubes. In the first half-cycle the first cylinder receives {{air from the}} compressor, which lasts about 3 seconds. During that time the pressure in the first cylinder rises from atmospheric to about 1.5 times normal atmospheric pressure (typically 20 psi/138 kPa gauge, or 2.36 atmospheres absolute) and the zeolite becomes saturated with nitrogen. As the first cylinder reaches near pure oxygen (there are small amounts of argon, CO2, water vapour, radon and other minor atmospheric components) in the first half-cycle, a valve opens and the oxygen enriched gas flows to the pressure equalizing reservoir, which connects to the patient's oxygen hose. At {{the end of the}} first half of the cycle, there is another valve position change so that the air from the compressor is directed to the 2nd cylinder. Pressure in the first cylinder drops as the enriched oxygen moves into the reservoir, allowing the nitrogen to be desorbed back into gas. Part way through the second half of the cycle there is another valve position change to vent the gas in the first cylinder back into the ambient atmosphere, keeping the concentration of oxygen in the pressure equalizing reservoir from falling below about 90%. The pressure in the hose delivering oxygen from the equalizing reservoir is kept steady by a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|Automatic control <b>valves</b> include: <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valves,</b> {{flow control}} valves, {{back-pressure}} sustaining valves, altitude valves, and relief valves. An altitude valve controls {{the level of}} a tank. The altitude valve will remain open while the tank is not full and it will close when the tanks reaches its maximum level. The opening and closing of the valve requires no external power source (electric, pneumatic, or man power), it is done automatically, hence its name.|$|R

During the process the energy is conserved but losses occur in form of exergy. The aim of this thesis {{is to reduce the}} losses of exergy. This can be done by letting turbines replace the <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> In this thesis an investigation has been done of the conditions today, the conditions after the change from <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> to turbines and a comparison of three different types of turbine solutions. The three examined solutions are one turbine, several helical screw expanders and several small turbines in parallel with asynchronous generators. The six absorption heat pumps have been divided into two groups; one group of four and one group of two absorption heat pumps. An investigation of locations and space in nearby switchgears has been done for each group. Contacts with retailers of the examined turbine solutions have been taken to gather technical specifications. These technical specifications have been used to simulate the electricity production and the economical yield of each type of examined solution. The investigation shows that the best solution is the solution with several small turbines with asynchronous generators. It has lower investment cost (15 [MSEK]) and the best yield. The proposed solutions will have an installed capacity of 2. 65 [MW] to a cost of 5 601 [SEK/kW]. The electric energy production will be 15. 7 [GWh/year].

40|$|High <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> (HPRV) {{is widely}} used for pressure and temperature control of heated steams in power plant and other related process engineering. The structures of throttling components inside HPRVs have important effects on the control performances. In this paper, a parametric study of throttling components in a multi-stage high <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> (MSHPRV) is carried out, including the relative angle of inner and outer porous shrouded holes, the orifice plate thickness, the number of orifice plates and the diameter of plate holes. A numerical model is established to investigate internal flow and throttling characteristics with RNG k-ε model, and it is validated by the theoretical flux calculation. The results show that, the relative angle set as 180 ° can obtain the largest decompression pressure when steam flows through porous shrouded valve core, while the turbulence degree is the lowest. Setting one orifice plate can decrease the turbulent dissipation rate. The plate thickness has less influence on throttling effects. For ensuring the outlet flux, plate holes with smaller diameters should be chosen with a better flowing property on thermodynamic parameters. The work can be referred by the design work of throttling components in MSHPRV and it can also benefit the further research on similar HPRVs...|$|E
