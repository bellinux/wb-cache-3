40|$|Previous studies {{recognize}} institutional {{impacts on}} the arrangement of large infrastructure projects {{but they have not}} analysed the process by which a host country's institutions shape infrastructure projects. Institutional theory was applied as an analytical lens to identify different effects of regulatory, normative and cultural institutions on <b>project</b> <b>arrangements.</b> A cross-case comparative study of high-speed rail projects in China and Taiwan was conducted to investigate the processes through which political cultures and industrial structures determined the decisions for <b>project</b> <b>arrangements,</b> including delivery method, financing, participants' roles, the degree of private and foreign participation, and organization. Longitudinal archival methods combined with exploratory case studies were employed to examine project decisions by analysing government regulations, official publications, news articles, project documents and 20 interviews. A conceptual model was presented to integrate the findings. The political culture in each host country defines the political goals and legitimate approaches of large infrastructure projects, while industrial structure limits feasible alternatives for <b>project</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Collectively, they shape <b>project</b> <b>arrangements</b> and largely dictate the roles played by the government, private enterprises and foreign actors. <b>Project</b> <b>arrangements,</b> political culture, industrial structure, infrastructure, project,...|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify the problematic issues associated with project partnering based on contractors' perceptions. Fifteen problematic issues were identified from six contractors involved in unsuccessful project partnering relationships. The results indicate that the unwillingness of the client to fully commit to the partnering agreement was the main reason for ineffective project partnering.

40|$|Globally, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} pressure on coastal and marine ecosystems. The development of marine infrastructure is causing additional ecological impacts on these systems. To reduce ecological impacts innovative approaches of marine infrastructure development are being developed. These approaches, such as Building with Nature, aim to integrate ecological and social dynamics {{in the creation of}} coastal and marine infrastructure. This integration has implications for the development and management of these projects. To understand opportunities for Building with Nature approaches, this article analyzes the development of the Melbourne Channel Deepening project in Australia that developed from a conventional, state-led project toward a Building with Nature arrangement. This article shows that a Building with Nature <b>project</b> <b>arrangement</b> differs not just substantially in its ecological focus and primacy from a conventional <b>project</b> <b>arrangement,</b> but also in its leading discourse, its actor coalition, its power and resources applied, and {{the rules of the game}} through which the project is designed and implemented.

40|$|The Joint Research <b>Project</b> <b>Arrangement</b> # 6 (JRPA 6) between Canada and Finland required, amongst other things, that IMD conduct {{high speed}} {{uniaxial}} compression tests on ice {{in an effort}} to obtain the strength of ice at speeds typical of ice-propeller interaction. These speeds are estimated to be about 30 ms- 1. It was decided, therefore, to conduct uniaxial compression tests at speeds as high as possible with the available equipment, approximately 1 ms- 1. While this was not as high as when impacted by a propeller, it was at least 10 times faster than any results in the literature. Results are given in this report for freshwater and "Baltic" sea ice.

Two different propeller models were examined, one open and one ducted, which are typical of conventional controllable-pitch icebreaker propellers. Strain gauge instrumentation was utilized to record the stresses on one of the blades of the propellers. These stresses were translated to blade bending moments through a set of influence coefficients. Finite element techniques were employed to determined the blade bending strain gauge locations. This paper describes the methodology used to evaluate the instrumentation for the measurement of the out of plane blade bending loads on the propeller blades.

However, some respondents observed that its establishment under UNDP’s <b>project</b> <b>arrangement</b> is a liability since it might cease upon the project’s completion if the state is not interested in developing it further (interview 6, 10, 11). The meetings organised by InPOP are often not results-orientated (interview 10, 15), but this is not surprising since immediate results from a policy program such as InPOP might not be immediately evident (interview 8). Also, state officials often show an unconvincing commitment to work beyond an ad-hoc approach (interview 6, 7).

The 2 -D program for blockage case can deal with time-dependent potential flow around a blade section with ice blockage at proximity condition and the 2 -D program was extended to calculate the non-contact loads during the milling process with and without ice extrusion. The 3 -D program can calculate local and global loads acting on a propeller. The results obtained by these two programs include pressure distributions on various blade sections, variations of propeller blade force and moment in one revolution. The 3 -D program can be used for skewed propeller and extended to a ducted propeller. The programs are written in FORTRAN and the interactive mode was introduced in order to make the programs more user-friendly. The operation manual for them is presented in this report.

40|$|Ports {{are crucial}} in the {{economic}} growth of the marine sector, but a growing awareness on the adverse ecological implications influences their development. Ecodynamic development and design (EDD) is an innovative approach with the aim to integrate the economic aspects of port development projects with dynamics of marine ecosystems. These projects develop within different governance settings, therefore not only different types of project arrangements develop, {{but there is also}} a difference in the possibilities for ecodynamic design. Based on an analysis of 28 port development projects, we distinguish four ideal-typical Marine Infrastructural Project Arrangements (MIPAs) : Conventional, Integrated market, External Financier initiated and Private. These arrangements differ from each other on the actors involved, the rules applied, the division of resources and the discourse set. Due to these differences, we formulate enabling and constraining conditions of the <b>project</b> <b>arrangement</b> to incorporate ecodynamic design principles in terms of marine infrastructural projects. The possibilities for EDD in these MIPAs increase if there is space for contractors, consultants and project owners to (co) develop the design. The analysis shows that the ‘Integrated Market’ and ‘Private’ project arrangements are best capable of incorporating EDD port development projects...|$|E

40|$|Coastal {{decision-making}} is {{impacted by}} {{global climate change}} and region-specific changes related to population growth, economic activities and the natural environment. This results in complex and interdependent problems. Addressing these problems requires the involvement of decision-makers, researchers and other societal actors in knowledge production. However, such means of knowledge production are poorly understood {{when it comes to}} coastal regions. Using a conceptual framework that makes a distinction between <b>project</b> <b>arrangements</b> and knowledge arrangements, this paper analyses interactive knowledge development in a nature restoration project on the US West Coast. The project adopted a collaborative approach, and involved diverse organisations in developing knowledge for reaching its restoration solutions. The case study analysis results in seven causal mechanisms. The mechanisms are divided into two groups. One group discusses processes that affect interactive knowledge development, such as the need for public support. The other group explains how interactive knowledge development functions, for example through facilitation and the creation of safe environments for researchers and regulators. Through identifying these mechanisms, this paper contributes to an improved understanding of interactive knowledge development in coastal region...|$|R
