In this work, microstructures with ellipsoidal and spherical particles are considered. Three dimensional particles are randomly generated for different volume fractions without any contact between neighbouring spheres according to Poisson process. The used analysis is based on numerical homogenization approaches by finite element method and morphological characterization of microstructures by random fields. The effects of various parameters such as <b>particles</b> <b>volume</b> fraction, contrast in phase properties and particles shape were identified. The statistical methods are introduced and then coupled with numerical simulations. The notion of statistically representative volume, named the deterministic representative volume element (RVE), is used. The variation of this RVE as a function of <b>particles</b> <b>volume</b> fraction for heterogeneous materials is presented. These variations suggest us to identify the morphological distribution of particles which is more anisotropic and which needs a large RVE size...|$|R

50|$|Particles {{from air}} bursts {{are smaller than}} 10-25 micrometers, usually in the submicrometer range. They are {{composed}} mostly of iron oxides, with smaller proportion of aluminium oxide, and uranium and plutonium oxides. Particles larger than 1-2 micrometers are very spherical, corresponding to vaporized material condensing into droplets and then solidifying. The radioactivity is evenly distributed throughout the <b>particle</b> <b>volume,</b> making total activity of the particles linearly dependent on <b>particle</b> <b>volume.</b> About 80% of activity is present in more volatile elements, which condense only after the fireball cools to considerable degree. For example, strontium-90 will have less time to condense and coalesce into larger particles, resulting in greater degree of mixing in the volume of air and smaller particles. The particles produced immediately after the burst are small, with 90% of the radioactivity present in particles smaller than 300 nanometers. These coagulate with stratospheric aerosols. Coagulation is more extensive in the troposphere, and, at ground level, most activity is present in particles between 300 nm and 1 µm. The coagulation offsets the fractionation processes at particle formation, evening out isotopic distribution.|$|E

The large amount of directing factors can cause complications in directing self-assembly by LAOS.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, nonreacting and nonevaporating spray {{characteristics}} of {{heavy fuel oil}} (HFO) /n-butanol blends are numerically investigated under two different high pressure injections in medium speed engines. An Eulerian-Lagrangian multiphase scheme is used to simulate blend of C 14 H 30 as HFO and 0 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % by volume of n-butanol. OpenFOAM CFD toolbox is modified and implemented to study the effect of different blends of HFO/n-butanol on the spray characteristics at 600 and 1000 [*]bar. To validate the presented simulations, current numerical results are compared against existing experimental data and good compliance is achieved. Based on the numerical findings, addition of n-butanol to HFO increases the <b>particles</b> <b>volume</b> in parcels at 600 [*]bar. It was also found that blend fuels {{increase the number of}} spray particles and the average velocity of spray compared to pure HFO. Moreover, under injection pressure of 1000 bar, HFO/n-butanol blends compared to pure HFO fuel decrease <b>particles</b> <b>volume</b> in parcels of spray. Another influence of HFO/n-butanol blends is the decrease in average of particles diameter in parcels. Meanwhile, the effect of HFO/n-butanol on spray length is proved to be negligible. Finally, it can be concluded that higher injection pressure improves the spray efficiency...|$|R
