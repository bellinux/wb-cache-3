50|$|In June 1983, judge Mario Amato, who was {{investigating}} {{the links between}} the Terza <b>Posizione</b> and neo-fascist terrorism, was assassinated by a commando formed by Gilberto Cavallini and Luigi Ciavardini. The instigators of the killing were NAR members Francesca Mambro and Valerio Fioravanti. (Both were convicted of other terrorist killings and the 1980 Bologna massacre). The judge had been investigating in isolation from his superiors, like the chief prosecutor Giovanni De Matteo, a member of Propaganda Due, and under heavy attacks from his colleague Antonio Alibrandi, a right-wing sympathizer and father of Alessandro Alibrandi, member of Terza <b>Posizione</b> and NAR.|$|E

50|$|Despite its brief {{life and}} {{ambiguous}} relationships with terrorist groups, Terza <b>Posizione</b> {{remains one of}} the most influential groups of the Italian and European far right.

50|$|Indeed, in 1889 Mario Pieri {{translated}} von Staudt, before {{writing his}} I Principii della Geometrie di <b>Posizione</b> Composti in un Systema Logico-deduttivo (1898). In 1900 Charlotte Scott of Bryn Mawr College paraphased much of von Staudt's work in English for The Mathematical Gazette.When Wilhelm Blaschke published his textbook Projective Geometry in 1948, {{a portrait of}} the young Karl was placed opposite the Vorwort.|$|E
50|$|From 1970 {{he began}} joining several far right extraparliamentary movements: the Fronte Studentesco, then Avanguardia Nazionale, Lotta di Popolo and, in the end, Alternativa Studentesca. Together with Giuseppe Dimitri and Roberto Fiore, in 1976, {{he is one}} of the founders of Lotta Studentesca in the {{bookshop}} of Walter Spedicato. In 1977 Lotta Studentesca becomes Terza <b>Posizione,</b> which eventually become one of the most important extraparliamentary far right movements.|$|E
50|$|The Third Position (Terza <b>Posizione)</b> was a {{far right}} group founded in Rome in 1978 (but already present {{with the name of}} Lotta Studentesca from 1976). The TP {{rejected}} both capitalism and socialism, looking instead to found a political and economic Third Position, with its main influence being Julius Evola. The group became a front for the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (NAR) in 1980. It insisted on tradition, nationalism, anti-parliamentarism and militarism.|$|E
5000|$|Sideras è stato anche un produttore. Nel 1975 produce l'album Alba di Riccardo Cocciante che raggiunge la prima <b>posizione</b> nelle classifiche italiane. Produce anche gli album di Sigma Fay, nel 1979 Love's Fool che vende 75,000 copie, ed in seguito nel 1981 l'album Dead Line, che vende 52,000 copie. Nel 1984 ha prodotto il singolo [...] "You're the Drug in My Life" [...] per Sigma Fay vendendo 34,000 copie.|$|E
50|$|In 1982 in Paris, Adinolfi collaborated in the {{realization}} of three numbers of the journals Terza <b>Posizione</b> and Dixie, the latter focusing on finance and power. In the same year, Adinolfi and Spedicato gave life to the Centro Studi Orientamenti e Ricerca ("Scholarship Center for Orientation and Research") in which they elaborate five political documents and ten years of trimonthly bulletins. Orientamenti e Ricerca stopped its publications in 1995 {{with the death of}} Spedicato.|$|E
50|$|After the Bologna {{massacre}} of 2 August 1980, Massimo Morsello, Roberto Fiore, leader of Terza <b>Posizione</b> and seven {{other people were}} accused of subversive association.They will then acquitted in 1990. They escaped first to Germany, then, after a few months, to London. Italy called for their extradition but it was refused by England because the crimes they were accused of were only political. It has been rumoured that Morsello and Fiore escaped extradition by collaborating with the MI6.|$|E
5000|$|Some ideologies, notably Christian Democracy, {{claim to}} combine {{left and right}} wing politics; {{according}} to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, [...] "In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles." [...] Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include Fascist Terza <b>Posizione</b> economic politics in Italy, Peronism in Argentina, and National Action Party in Mexico.|$|E

50|$|On 2 August, a bomb killed 85 {{people and}} wounded more than 200 in Bologna. Known as the Bologna massacre, the blast {{destroyed}} {{a large portion}} of the city's railway station. This was found to be a neo-fascist bombing, mainly organized by the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari: Francesca Mambro and Valerio Fioravanti were sentenced to life imprisonment. In April 2007 the Supreme Court confirmed the conviction of Luigi Ciavardini, a NAR member associated closely with close ties to Terza <b>Posizione.</b> Ciavardini received a 30-year prison sentence for his role in the attack.|$|E
50|$|Peppe Dimitri later joined Alleanza Nazionale {{and became}} the advisor of Gianni Alemanno. Fiore and Morsello, meanwhile, {{repaired}} to Great Britain founding the International Third Position along with Nick Griffin and other British nationalists. They then returned some of their ideals to Italian politics with Forza Nuova, albeit with less social-oriented and more strictly anti-immigration overtones. Forza Nuova web sites and manifests are still sometimes titled Forza Nuova per la Terza <b>Posizione</b> ("New Force for the Third Position"). Gabriele Adinolfi is not formally involved in politics {{but he is still}} active in the Italian far right scene as an ideologue and thinker.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} a cultural background for the ideology, Fiore looked to the ruralism of Julius Evola and sought to combine it with the desire for a cultural-spiritual revolution. He adopted some of {{the positions of the}} contemporary far right, notably the ethnopluralism of Alain de Benoist and the Europe-wide appeal associated with such views as the Europe a Nation campaign of Oswald Mosley (amongst others). Fiore was {{one of the founders of}} the Terza <b>Posizione</b> movement in 1978. Third Position ideas are now represented in Italy by Forza Nuova, led by Fiore and by the movement CasaPound - a network of far-right social centres.|$|E
50|$|On December 1979, {{in one of}} the {{premises}} of the organization, three members were arrested, having been caught while moving a box of hand grenades. After the incident, the police found several Carabinieri uniforms, false papers, arms and explosives. As a result, in September 1980, Fiore, Adinolfi and forty members of Terza <b>Posizione</b> received a warrant of arrest. Fiore and Adinolfi escaped abroad, leaving the leadership of the group to Giorgio Vale (a member of Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari). The NAR's Giusva Fioravanti would later accuse Fiore and Adinolfi of absconding with the movement's money. Without Di Mitri's lead, the NAR quickly took control and used TP as a front movement.|$|E
