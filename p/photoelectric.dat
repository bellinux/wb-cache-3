5|$|With Jesse Beams {{from the}} University of Virginia, Lawrence {{continued}} {{to research the}} <b>photoelectric</b> effect. They showed that photoelectrons appeared within 2 x 10−9 seconds of the photons striking the <b>photoelectric</b> surface—close to the limit of measurement at the time. Reducing the emission time by switching the light source on and off rapidly made the spectrum of energy emitted broader, in conformance with Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.|$|E
5|$|As {{an element}} with high {{electron}} density and atomic number, iodine absorbs X-rays weaker than 33.3keV {{due to the}} <b>photoelectric</b> effect of the innermost electrons. Organoiodine compounds are used with intravenous injection as X-ray radiocontrast agents. This application is often in conjunction with advanced X-ray techniques such as angiography and CT scanning. At present, all water-soluble radiocontrast agents rely on iodine.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{concluded}} that each wave of frequency f {{is associated with}} a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the <b>photoelectric</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|In a 1905 paper, Einstein {{postulated}} that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the <b>photoelectric</b> effect, {{and with the}} measurement of Compton scattering.|$|E
5|$|In {{that same}} year, {{which has been}} called Einstein's annus mirabilis (miracle year), he {{published}} four groundbreaking papers, on the <b>photoelectric</b> effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were {{to bring him to}} the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.|$|E
5|$|Shive held several patents {{including}} Selenium rectifier {{and method}} of making it, Directly heated thermocouple, Photoresistive translating device, Selenium rectifier including tellurium and method of making it, Apparatus for and method of treating selenium rectifiers, Semiconductor <b>photoelectric</b> device, Conditioning of semiconductor translators, Semiconductor amplifier, and Alternating gate current.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP). CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. PV converts light into electric current using the <b>photoelectric</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the electrons in solid materials can be visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique employs the <b>photoelectric</b> effect to measure the reciprocal space—a mathematical representation of periodic structures {{that is used to}} infer the original structure. ARPES can be used to determine the direction, speed and scattering of electrons within the material.|$|E
5|$|Blind cricket, {{which is}} played {{basically}} the same as conventional cricket but using larger stumps and wickets and a white ball so that players may see it much more easily, is also played at the college, and RNC has its own cricket team, which competes in the British Blind Sport (BBS) National Cricket League. The college also features acoustic shooting, a sport which uses air rifles fitted with <b>photoelectric</b> cells which convert light reflected from targets into sound.|$|E
5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the <b>photoelectric</b> effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E
5|$|However, {{attempting}} to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the <b>photoelectric</b> effect, and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe, proved troublesome. Through {{the work of}} leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the <b>photoelectric</b> effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the <b>photoelectric</b> effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth Tompkins Bainbridge {{was born}} in Cooperstown, New York, the second of three sons of William Warin Bainbridge and Mary Grinnell Tompkins. He was educated at Horace Mann School in New York. While at high school he {{developed}} an interest in ham radio which inspired him to enter Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1921 to study electrical engineering. In five years he earned both bachelor of science (S.B.) and master of science (S.M.) degrees. During the summer breaks he worked at General Electric's laboratories in Lynn, Massachusetts and Schenectady, New York. While there he obtained three patents related to <b>photoelectric</b> tubes.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{followed}} Swann to the University of Chicago, {{and then}} to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where Lawrence completed his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in physics in 1925 as a Sloane Fellow, writing his doctoral thesis on the <b>photoelectric</b> effect in potassium vapor. He was elected a member of Sigma Xi, and, on Swann's recommendation, received a National Research Council fellowship. Instead of using it to travel to Europe, as was customary at the time, he remained at Yale University with Swann as a researcher.|$|E
5|$|SGDs {{have their}} roots in early {{electronic}} communication aids. The first such aid was a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the patient-operated selector mechanism (POSSUM) prototyped by Reg Maling in the United Kingdom in 1960. POSSUM scanned {{through a set of}} symbols on an illuminated display. Researchers at Delft University in the Netherlands created the lightspot operated typewriter (LOT) in 1970, which made use of small movements of the head to point a small spot of light at a matrix of characters, each equipped with a <b>photoelectric</b> cell. Although it was commercially unsuccessful, the LOT was well received by its users.|$|E
5|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw {{increasingly}} rapid {{advances in the}} scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude. The development of the <b>photoelectric</b> photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
5|$|When Robert Baker arrived he {{continued}} a <b>photoelectric</b> photometry program focusing on variable stars. He {{continued to use}} the 12-inch refractor until 1927 when a new photometer was constructed and attached it to the 30-inch reflector telescope in the Observatory annex. He supervised two graduate students who worked on this equipment in the early 1930s. On May 27, 1933 the star Arcturus provided light which fell onto a photo cell in the observatory's annex and sent a signal to open the Chicago World's Fair.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the ultraviolet catastrophe, and the <b>photoelectric</b> effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of <b>photoelectric</b> photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{photovoltaics}} (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the <b>photoelectric</b> effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell {{recognized the importance of}} this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. By 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20%, and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40%.|$|E
25|$|In November 2011 the Northern Territory enacted Australia's first {{residential}} <b>photoelectric</b> legislation mandating {{the use of}} <b>photoelectric</b> smoke alarms in all new Northern Territory homes.|$|E
25|$|From that date, all {{replacement}} smoke alarms must be <b>photoelectric.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although <b>photoelectric</b> alarms {{are highly}} {{effective}} at detecting smoldering fires and do provide adequate protection from flaming fires, fire safety experts and the National Fire Protection Agency recommend installing {{what are called}} combination alarms, which are alarms that either detect both heat and smoke, or use both the ionization and <b>photoelectric</b> processes. Some combination alarms may include a carbon monoxide detection capability.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy is {{a chemical}} analysis technique {{relying on the}} <b>photoelectric</b> effect, usually employed in surface science.|$|E
25|$|The <b>photoelectric</b> {{effect is}} one {{interaction}} mechanism between photons and atoms. It {{is one of}} 12 theoretically possible interactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{type and}} {{sensitivity}} of light source and <b>photoelectric</b> sensor, {{and type of}} smoke chamber differ between manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|As {{it passes}} through matter, gamma {{radiation}} ionizes via three processes: the <b>photoelectric</b> effect, Compton scattering, and pair production.|$|E
25|$|Millikan is also {{credited}} with measuring {{the value of}} Planck's constant by using <b>photoelectric</b> emission graphs of various metals.|$|E
25|$|The <b>photoelectric</b> (optical) smoke {{detector}} {{was invented by}} Donald Steele and Robert Emmark of Electro Signal Lab and patented in 1972.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} the <b>photoelectric</b> effect must explain the {{experimental}} observations of the emission of electrons from an illuminated metal surface.|$|E
25|$|Einstein {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his {{discovery}} {{of the law of}} the <b>photoelectric</b> effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the photomultiplier is predicated upon two prior achievements, the separate discoveries of the <b>photoelectric</b> effect and of secondary emission.|$|E
25|$|The <b>photoelectric</b> {{effect will}} cause {{spacecraft}} exposed to sunlight {{to develop a}} positive charge. This can be a major problem, as {{other parts of the}} spacecraft are in shadow which will result in the spacecraft developing a negative charge from nearby plasmas. The imbalance can discharge through delicate electrical components. The static charge created by the <b>photoelectric</b> effect is self-limiting, because a higher charged object doesn't give up its electrons as easily as a lower charged object does.|$|E
25|$|In 1888 Russian {{physicist}} Aleksandr Stoletov {{built the}} first cell based on the outer <b>photoelectric</b> effect discovered by Heinrich Hertz in 1887.|$|E
