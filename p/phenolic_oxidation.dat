50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{biosynthesis}} of griseofulvin by P. griseofulvin is the synthesis of the 14-carbon poly-β-keto chain by a type I iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) via iterative addition of 6 malonyl-CoA to an acyl-CoA starter unit. The 14-carbon poly-β-keto chain undergoes cyclization/aromatization, using cyclase/aromatase, respectively, through a Claisen and aldol condensation to form the benzophenone intermediate. The benzophenone intermediate is then methylated via S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) twice to yield griseophenone C. The griseophenone C is then halogenated at the activated site ortho to the phenol group on the left aromatic ring to form griseophenone B. The halogenated species then undergoes a single <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> in both rings forming the two oxygen diradical species. The right oxygen radical shifts alpha to the carbonyl via resonance allowing for a stereospecific radical coupling by the oxygen radical on the left ring forming a tetrahydrofuranone species. The newly formed grisan skeleton with a spiro center is then O-methylated by SAM to generate dehydrogriseofulvin. Ultimately, a stereoselective reduction of the olefin on dehydrogriseofulvin by NADPH affords griseofulvin.|$|E

Ripening indices (RI) of olive samples were 1. 93 (unripe), 4. 28 (ripe) and 5. 89 (overripe). Most of the mentioned features changed with ripening. During ripening there was a sharp decrease in total chlorophyll, carotenoid and pheophytin a contents. An increase in oleic and linoleic acids and a decrease in palmitic acid were found in the fatty acid composition. Olive oils showed strong relations among oxidation stability, tocopherol content, total phenols content, and antiradical actvity of phenol extracts and these parameters decreased with maturation. Nevertheless, higher amounts of trans- 2 -hexenal were found in the oil from ripe olives than from unripe and overripe olives.

40|$|STOBBS, Lorne,W ABSTRACT Biochemical and Histological Investigations of viral {{localisation}} in the hypersensitive {{reaction of}} Phaseolus vulgaris L. var Pinto to tobacco mosaic virus infection. The infection of Phaseolus vulgaris L. var Pinto with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) {{results in the}} production of distinct necrotic lesions confining the virus to restricted areas of the leaf surface. Biochemical and histological changes in the leaf tissue as a result of infection have been described. Trace accumulations of fluorescent metabolites, detected prior to lesion expression represent metabolites produced, by the cell in response to virus infection. These substances, are considered to undergo oxidation and in diffusing into adjacent cells, react with cellular constituents causing the death of these cells. Such cellular necrosis in advance of infection effectively limits virus spread. Chromatographic studies on extracts from TMV infected Pinto bean leaf tissue suggests that a number of extra-fluorescent metabolites produced on lesion'expression represent end products of <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> r,eactionsoccurring earlier in these cells. Inhibition of <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> by ascorbate infiltration or elevated temperature treatment resulted in the absence of extra-fluorescent metabolites and the continued movement of virus in the absence of necrosis.

Histochemical tests indicated that callose formation was initiated at this time, and occurred in response to necrotisation. Inhibition of necrosis by either ascorbate infiltration or elevated temp 8 rature treatment resulted in the absence of callose deposition. Scanning electron'micrographs of infected tissue revealed severe epidermal and palisade cell damage.

40|$|Background: Red-skin root {{disease has}} seriously {{decreased}} {{the quality and}} production of Panax ginseng (ginseng). Methods: To explore the disease's origin, comparative analysis was performed {{in different parts of}} the plant, particularly the epidermis, cortex, and/or fibrous roots of 5 -yr-old healthy and diseased red-skin ginseng. The inorganic element composition, phenolic compound concentration, reactive oxidation system, antioxidant concentrations such as ascorbate and glutathione, activities of enzymes related to <b>phenolic</b> metabolism and <b>oxidation,</b> and antioxidative system particularly the ascorbate–glutathione cycle were examined using conventional methods. Results: Aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), magnesium, and phosphorus were increased, whereas manganese was unchanged and calcium was decreased in the epidermis and fibrous root of red-skin ginseng, which also contained higher levels of phenolic compounds, higher activities of the phenolic compound-synthesizing enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and the phenolic compound oxidation-related enzymes guaiacol peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase. As the substrate of guaiacol peroxidase, higher levels of H 2 O 2 and correspondingly higher activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were found in red-skin ginseng. Increased levels of ascorbate and glutathione; increased activities of l-galactose 1 -dehydrogenase, ascorbate peroxidase, ascorbic acid oxidase, and glutathione reductase; and lower activities of dehydroascorbate reductase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione peroxidase were found in red-skin ginseng. Glutathione-S-transferase activity remained constant. Conclusion: Hence, higher element accumulation, particularly Al and Fe, activated multiple enzymes related to accumulation of phenolic compounds and their oxidation. This might contribute to red-skin symptoms in ginseng.

During this time, a modification of sensory properties of wines such as the decrease of astringency or the stabilization of color is recognized to phenolic compounds, mainly attributed to anthocyanins and derived pigments. The presentwork aims to illustrate the oxidation of red Portwine based on its phenolic composition by the effect of both thermal and oxygen exposures. A kinetic approach toanthocyanins degradation was also achieved. For this purpose a forced red Port wine aging protocol was performed at four different storage temperatures, respectively, 20, 30, 35 and 40 °C, and two adjusted oxygen saturation levels, no oxygen addition (treatment I), and oxygen addition (treatment II). Three hydroxycinnamic esters, three hydroxycinnamic acids, three hydroxybenzoic acids, two flavan- 3 -ols, and six anthocyanins were quantitated weekly during 63 days, along with oxygen consumption. The most relevant <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> markers were anthocyanins and catechintype flavonoids, which had the highest decreases during the thermal and oxidative red Port wine process. Both temperature and oxygen treatments affected the rate of phenolic degradation. In addition, temperature seems to influence mostly the phenolics kinetic degradation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Plants {{have been}} {{suggested}} to have an immunological memory comparable to animals. The evidence for this, however, is scarce. In our study with the mountain birch— Epirrita autumnata system, we demonstrated that birches exposed as long as 5 yr to feeding of E. autumnata larvae (delayed induced resistance, DIR), responded more strongly to a new challenge than trees without an herbivory history. Pupal weights remained lower, and {{the duration of the}} larval period was prolonged in the DIR trees, although immunity, measured as an encapsulation rate, was not affected. We further demonstrated that the effects of birch phenolics on performance of E. autumnata were different in the exposed (DIR) trees from naive control trees, although we found only one significant change in chemistry. The quercetin:kaemferol ratio was increased in DIR trees, suggesting that herbivory caused oxidative stress in birches. In DIR trees, phenolics, especially hydrolyzable tannins (HTs), affected pupal weights negatively, whereas in control trees, the effects were either nonsignificant or positive. HTs also prolonged the duration of the larval period of females, whereas peroxidase (POD) activity prolonged that of males. We suggest that the causal explanation for the induced resistance was an enhanced oxidation of phenolic compounds from the DIR trees in the larval digestive tract. <b>Phenolic</b> <b>oxidation</b> produces semiquinones, quinones, free radicals, and ROS, which may have toxic, antinutritive, and/or repellent properties against herbivores...|$|E
40|$|Changes of the polyphenolic content, {{including}} total phenolics (TP), total flavonoids (TF), {{and total}} flavan- 3 -ols (TF 3 -ols) determined by spectrophotometric methods, {{have been studied}} in Macedonian white wines from Vitis vinifera L. cv, Smederevka and Chardonnay, obtained under different vinifications and analyzed during 16 months of aging in bottles. Winemaking treatments for both varieties included an addition of two doses of SO 2 (50 and 100 mg/L) and two commercial yeasts for fermentation, Vinalco and Levuline, both Saccharomyces cerevisiae species, in order to study the influence of SO 2 and yeasts on the phenolic content of the wines. Comparing the two varieties, Chardonnay wines contained higher levels of total phenolics, flavonoids, and flavan- 3 -ols, probably {{as a result of}} the cultivar differences. Sulfur dioxide protected the <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxidation,</b> resulting in higher phenolic content in the wines with higher SO 2 dose, while the yeast did not show significant influence on the total phenolics. During aging, the TP, TF, and TF 3 -ols in the wines from both varieties decreased significantly up to the second month of storage and remained stable till the sixth month. The Student–Newman–Keuls test has been applied to ascertain possible significant differences between the studied wines, and a principal component analysis has been employed, showing separation and grouping of the wines according to the cultivar and time of aging...|$|E
40|$|After SO 2 {{has entered}} leaves of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) through open stomata and been {{hydrated}} in the aqueous phase of cell walls, the sulfite formed can be oxidized to sulfate by an apoplastic peroxidase that is normally involved in phenol oxidation. The oxidation of sulfite is competitive with the <b>oxidation</b> of <b>phenolics.</b> During sulfite <b>oxidation,</b> the peroxidase is inhibited. In {{the absence of}} ascorbate, which is a normal constituent of the aqueous phase of the apoplast, peroxidative sulfite oxidation facilitates fast additional sulfite oxidation by a radical chain reaction. By scavenging radicals, ascorbate inhibits chain initiation and sulfite oxidation. Even after exposure of leaves to high concentrations of SO 2, which inhibited photosynthesis, the redox state of ascorbate remained almost unaltered in the apoplastic space of the leaves. It is concluded that the oxidative detoxification of SO 2 in the apoplast outside the cells is slow. Its rate depends on the rate of apoplastic hydrogen peroxide generation and on the steady-state apoplastic concentrations of phenolics and sulfite. The affinity of the peroxidase for phenolics is higher than that for sulfite...|$|R
40|$|Enzymatic {{reactions}} {{taking place}} in minimally processed vegetables are considered as a major problem, because they adversely affect sensorial and nutritional quality. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD) and lipoxygenase (LOX) from lettuce were purified on a column packed with positively charged diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose by applying pH gradient elution from pH= 4. 0 to 9. 0. The main purified fractions (PPO 1 and PPO 4, POD 1 and POD 2, LOX 1 and LOX 2) were characterized for enzyme concentration-reaction rate relationship, thermal stability, pH activity and kinetic parameters. Kinetic properties of each isoform were considerably different. Cysteine was found as the most effective inhibitor of both fractions of PPO. Kinetic parameters of lettuce POD were presented using guaiacol at various H 2 O 2 concentrations. β-carotene directly influences lettuce LOX in the reaction medium available for the catalytic conversion of linoleic acid into hydroperoxides. Ascorbic and oxalic acids appear as effective PPO inhibitors, protecting <b>phenolic</b> compounds against <b>oxidation</b> in lettuce. Understanding the characteristics of deteriorative enzymes becomes important to maintain suitable conditions for fresh-like quality of lettuce. The results can be useful to keep the nutritional quality of minimally processed lettuce during shelf-life...|$|R
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} the different polyphenolic extracts prepared from Tunisian azarole, Crataegus azarolus and Crataegus monogyna (Rosaceae family) leaves, fruit peel, pulp and syrup was evaluated using cholesterol, liposome and rat liver-homogenate oxidation assays and cytotoxic activity in differentiated Caco- 2, undifferentiated Caco- 2, and B 16 F 10 melanoma cells. Protective effects were observed against thermal-cholesterol degradation at 140 °C for 1 h, which depended on the concentration {{and the type of}} the extract. Moreover, the pre-treatment with the phenolic extracts preserved liposomes and rat liver-homogenate from oxidative induced damage by Cu 2 + and Fe 2 + at 37 °C for 24 h and 2 h, respectively. Azarole <b>phenolics</b> inhibited the <b>oxidation</b> of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and limited the production of oxidized compounds. Furthermore, within tested concentrations (0. 24 - 4. 8 mg/mL), all extracts did not show any toxic effect on differentiated Caco- 2 cells; while, they were found cytotoxic to cancer Caco- 2 cells, except, extracts of pulp and syrup of C. monogyna. Using B 16 F 10 melanoma cell model, only azarole pulp and syrup extracts were found toxic and induced the production of melanin in a dose-dependent manne...|$|R
