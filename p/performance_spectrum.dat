40|$|International audienceThe optimal {{tradeoff}} {{among the}} channel estimation <b>performance,</b> <b>spectrum</b> efficiency and computational complexity {{has always been}} one of the major topics for wireless communication system especially OFDM system. Traditional channel estimation methods are usually based on the classical (Least Squares) LS method without considering whether the multipath channel is sparse or rich, therefore, those methods can hardly balance the channel estimation <b>performance,</b> <b>spectrum</b> efficiency and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an effective compressed sensing (CS) based sparse channel estimation method for OFDM system. As an efficient reconstruction tool for CS, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is adopted in this paper for sparse channel estimation.

In this sense, the relative space per player (RSP, here defined as the total playing area divided by the number of players) is a key manipulable constraint that may be affected by the emergent relations between the number of players and pitch dimensions involved during practice. The tactical implications of different RSPs have received very little attention, however.|$|E

In this work we argue that the inability of cognitive radio users to perfectly know beforehand the primary signals that might {{be present in the}} sensed band and their properties, referred to as signal uncertainty in this work, also results in an additional detection performance degradation. The noise uncertainty consequences have widely been studied, verified experimentally and distilled into tractable mathematical models. However, the potential effects of the particular primary signal properties on the resulting detection probability of generic spectrum sensing algorithms, such as energy detection, have not been taken into account in the analysis and <b>performance</b> evaluation of <b>spectrum</b> sensing in cognitive radio networks.
