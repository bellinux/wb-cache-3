Therefore, this study provides important data for the risk assessment of atrazine application areas or atrazine-contaminated sites.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{empirical}} {{estimates of}} human elimination kinetics for <b>persistent</b> <b>chemicals</b> reflect apparent elimination half-lives {{that represent the}} aggregated effect of intrinsic elimination, ongoing exposure, and changes in body weight. However, estimates of intrinsic elimination at background levels are required for risk assessments for the general population. OBJECTIVE: To estimate intrinsic human elimination half-lives at background levels for nine polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, we used a novel approach based on population data. METHODS: We used a population pharmacokinetic model to interpret two sets of congener-specific cross-sectional age-concentration biomonitoring data of PCB concentrations measured in lipid and blood samples that were collected from 229 individuals in 1990 and 2003. Our method is novel because it exploits information about changes in concentration in the human population along two dimensions: age and calendar time. RESULTS: Our approach extracted information about both elimination kinetics and exposure trends from biomonitoring data. The longest intrinsic human elimination half-lives estimated {{in this study are}} 15. 5 years for PCB- 170, 14. 4 years for PCB- 153, and 11. 5 years for PCB- 180. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are further evidence that a maximum intrinsic elimination half-life for <b>persistent</b> <b>chemicals</b> such as PCBs exists and is approximately 10 - 15 years. A clear conceptual distinction between apparent and intrinsic half-lives is required to reduce the uncertainty in elimination half-lives of <b>persistent</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The method presented here estimates intrinsic elimination half-lives and the exposure trends of persistent pollutants using cross-sectional data available from a large and growing number of biomonitoring programs...|$|R

The three models were calibrated interactively to supplement the shortcomings of an individual model and minimize differences between them.

40|$|The {{development}} of a <b>persistent</b> <b>chemical</b> agent simulation system (PCASS) is described.

The fluorescent tracer employed has no daylight activation, but yet is easily removed with a decontaminate solution or water and surfactants. Also employed is a time delayed color developing system. When an individual is subjected to the PCASS and does not decontaminate adequately, red blotches or red coloration will develop as a function of time and temperature. The intent of this is to simulate the delayed chemical reaction of mustard contaminates...|$|E
40|$|Three {{types of}} tissue samples—{{umbilical}} cord (UC), umbilical cord serum (CS), and maternal serum (MS) —have often {{been used to}} assess fetal exposure to chemicals. In order to know the relationship of contamination between mothers and fetuses, we measured <b>persistent</b> <b>chemicals</b> in comparable sets of the three tissue samples. Also, we analyzed the association between the chemicals in maternal and fetal tissues to know which tissue is the best sample for fetal exposure assessment. On a wet basis, the chemical concentrations were of the order MS > CS > UC, except for some chemicals such as cis-chlordane and endosulfan. On a lipid basis, the concentrations in UC were nearly equal or often higher than in MS, but the concentrations in CS were usually lower than in others. Hexachlorocyclohexanes and penta-, hexa-, and heptachlorinated biphenyls showed an association between the concentrations in UC versus MS, and UC versus CS. These chemicals also showed high correlation coefficients between the chemical concentrations in UC of first babies and maternal age. These chemicals were closely {{related to each other}} when grouped {{on the basis of their}} concentrations using cluster analysis. In conclusion, we insist that UC is the best sample to assess fetal contamination status of <b>persistent</b> <b>chemicals.</b> There is a possibility that the assessment based on the contamination levels in CS result in an underestimation...|$|R

Pharmacological investigations as well as natural poisoning episodes have led to the association between exogenous chemicals and alterations in multiple hormonal systems. Persistent environmental contaminants such as dioxins and PCBs have been shown to modulate the activities of several different hormones. The unborn child or the neonate may be at special risk from these chemicals because of rapid growth and development, in addition to enhanced exposure.

40|$|Epidemiologic {{approaches}} to assessing human cancer risk from consuming fish from contaminated waters must confront {{the problems of}} long latency and rarity of the end point (cancer).

These factors are discussed {{in relation to the}} study designs most commonly employed in epidemiology. It is suggested that the use of biomarkers for <b>persistent</b> <b>chemicals</b> may be useful to mitigate the difficulty of determining exposure, while the use of more prevalent and timely end points, such as carcinogen-DNA adducts or oncogene proteins, may make the latency and rarity problems more tractable...|$|R
40|$|AIDA 1 links <b>persistent</b> <b>chemical</b> {{signaling}} events {{occurring at}} the neuronal synapse with global changes in gene expression.

A comprehensive survey of peptides identified a consensus sequence around an NxxY motif that is shared by a number of related neuronal signaling proteins. Using peptide arrays and fluorescence based assays, we determined that the AIDA 1 PTB domain binds amyloid protein precursor (APP) in a similar manner to the X 11 /Mint PTB domain, albeit at reduced affinity (, 10 mM) that may allow AIDA 1 to effectively sample APP, as well as other protein partners in a variety of cellular contexts...|$|E

Mersey sediments contain three diagnostic and <b>persistent</b> <b>chemical</b> species arising from either a unique, or a dominant, source – 137 Cs, Hg and DDT.

40|$|Persistence in the {{environment}} and potential for long-range transport are related since time in {{the environment}} is required for transport. A <b>persistent</b> <b>chemical</b> will travel longer distances than a reactive chemical that shares similar chemical properties. Scheringer (1997) has demonstrated the correlation between persistence and transport distance for different organic chemicals. However, this correlation is not sufficiently robust to predict one property from the other. Specific chemicals that are persistent mayor may not exhibit long-range transport potential. Persistence and long-range transport also present different societal concerns. Persistence concerns relate to the undesired possibility that chemicals produced and used now may somehow negatively affect future generations. Long-range transport concerns relate to the undesired presence of chemicals in areas where these compounds have not been used. Environmental policy decisions can be based on either or both considerations depending on {{the aim of the}} regulatory program. In this chapter, definitions and methods for quantifying persistence and transport potential of organic chemicals are proposed which will assist in the development of sound regulatory frameworks...|$|E

50|$|Bioaccumulation of POPs is {{typically}} associated with the compounds high lipid solubility and ability to accumulate in the fatty tissues of living organisms {{for long periods of}} time. <b>Persistent</b> <b>chemicals</b> tend to have higher concentrations and are eliminated more slowly. Dietary accumulation or bioaccumulation is another hallmark characteristic of POPs, as POPs move up the food chain, they increase in concentration as they are processed and metabolized in certain tissues of organisms. The natural capacity for animals gastrointestinal tract concentrate ingested chemicals, along with poorly metabolized and hydrophobic nature of POPs makes such compounds highly susceptible to bioaccumulation. Thus POPs not only persist in the environment, but also as they are taken in by animals they bioaccumulate, increasing their concentration and toxicity in the environment.|$|R
