40|$|ABSTRACT: Three {{distinct}} entities are now {{covered by the}} definition of primary pulmonary clonal lymphoid proliferation. The aim of this review is to describe the pathophysiological, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic aspects of these three entities. Low-grade <b>pulmonary</b> B-cell <b>lymphoma</b> is the most frequent form of primary pulmonary clonal lymphoid proliferation. It arises from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. It is usually indolent and appears {{in the form of}} a chronic alveolar opacity. The prognosis is excellent, but treatment is controversial (simple monitoring, surgery or single-agent chemotherapy). High-grade <b>pulmonary</b> B-cell <b>lymphoma</b> is far rarer and usually occurs in individuals with an underlying disorder (e. g. immunodeficiency). The prognosis is poor and therapeutic options depend on the underlying disorder. The inclusion of lymphomatoid granulomatosis in the definition of primary <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lymphomas</b> is controversial. The clonal nature of the proliferation is very rarely demonstrated and extrapulmonary involvement is frequent (upper airways, skin, kidneys, central nervous system, etc.). The prognosis is extremely variable, with some authors reporting complete remission with steroids and cyclophosphamide and others reporting failure of combination chemotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Extranodal {{involvement}} {{is common in}} lymphomas associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Clinical presentation is nonspecific, with “B ” and respiratory symptoms. Also, patients were with advanced immunodeficiency at the time of diagnosis. Generally, chest radiography showed peripheral nodules or cavitary masses. Primary <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> associated with AIDS is generally a high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Epstein-Barr virus is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of these tumors.

Pulmonary functional test has shown a severe restrictive pattern with a low FVC and DLCO. CT scan showed bronchiectasis in the medium lobule without adenomegalies. Echocardiogram was normal, and the laboratory findings only showed leukocytosis.

There were systemic symptoms in all three, and respiratory symptoms {{in just two}} patients. lmageologic studies revealed a solid mass on the inferior left pulmonary lobe in the first case, nodular infiltrates with cavitation in the second, and a pneumonic consoUdation in the third. The diagnosis of Hodgkinâs disease was made on biopsies: bronchial in case one, pulmonary through thoracoscopy in case two and lymph node in case three. The histological features of these cases were very typical of the dJsease. All patients were treated with chemotherapy.
