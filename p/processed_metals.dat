These studies focused on the use of High Pressure Gas Atomization and the development of new containment technologies for the liquid alloy. This allowed the production of alloys with a much more refined starting microstructure and lower contamination than available by other methods;The knowledge gained in the previous studies was used to develop two completely new families of deformation <b>processed</b> <b>metal</b> metal matrix composites.

The importance of the salt trade was illustrated during the negotiations for alliance between Bulgaria and East Francia in 892 when the Frankish King Arnulf demanded that Bulgaria discontinue the export of salt to Great Moravia.Trade had an important weight in the economy, as Bulgaria lay between the Byzantine Empire, Central Europe, the Rus' and the steppes. Trade relations with the Byzantine Empire was regulated on a most favoured nation basis by treaties that included commercial clauses. The first such treaty was signed in 716 and determined that goods could only be imported or exported when provided with a state seal. Goods without documents were to be confiscated for the state treasury. The Bulgarian merchants had a colony in Constantinople and paid favourable taxes. The relevance of international trade for Bulgaria was evident, as the country was willing to go to war with the Byzantine Empire when in 894 the latter moved the market of the Bulgarian traders from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where they had to pay larger taxes and did not have direct access to goods from the east. In 896 the war was won and the status of Bulgaria as a most favoured nation restored and commercial restrictions - abolished. Some Bulgarian towns acquired great prosperity, such as Preslavets on the Danube that was described in the 960s as being more prosperous that the capital of the Rus', Kiev. A contemporary chronicle lists the main trade partners and chief imports to Bulgaria. The country imported gold, silks, wine and fruits from the Byzantine Empire, silver and horses from Hungary and Bohemia, furs, honey, wax and slaves from the Rus'. There were commercial ties with Italy and the Middle East as well.|$|E

They were closed down because of their environmental hazards. There are also several other enterprises which have been privatized after the war, such as: Ferronikeli in 2005, Llamkos Galvasteel in 2005, and Sharrcem in 2000. These enterprises: Ferronikeli in Drenas, a nickel mining and smelting complex; Sharrcem in Han i Elezit, a miner of limestone and manufacturer of cement; and Llamkos Galvasteel in Vushtrri, a manufacturer of steel, were [...] "industrial champions" [...] in the former Yugoslavia. Investments in the mining and metals sector in Kosovo have been very low and even declining during 2007-2011; however, this industry constitutes the largest portion of Kosovo’s exports. The mining and metals industry provides almost 76% of the export revenues in Kosovo. This has also contributed to decreasing {{a portion of the}} rent-based income in Kosovo and increasing the real-economy income in Kosovo. Nevertheless, there are many structural imbalances in this sector and although it constitutes a high portion of the exports, the industry is also heavily dependent upon imports. The mining and metals industry in Kosovo shows a lack of internal integration, which means that there are few links in the production process between different segments in the industry and {{there is a need for}} investments in the field. Also, by establishing new enterprises in the mining and metals sector, Kosovo was able to decrease its current account deficit in 2011 by around 537 million Euros.Although metal processing developed quickly within the mining and metal industry during 2003-2011 and it increased export revenues by 16-fold, it was not able to encourage production linkages within the industry. During 2009-2011 the only mining licenses issued were to existing companies in Kosovo and only 5 were issued for extraction projects. During 2003-2011 imports also increased of ore and ore concentrates which were then processed locally and re-exported. While ores extracted by private companies or at Trepča are exported and further on processed and refined out of Kosovo, the domestic manufacturing industry uses <b>processed</b> <b>metals</b> imported from abroad. Thus, there are no linkages within the metals and mining industry in Kosovo and the industry is fully dependent linked with external economies. The extractive sector, although it is increasing in importance, it still remains at a relatively low level of 1.1% of GDP (2010) and significantly lower than its level prior to the war and the 90s.In 2008, the export of nickel ingots amounted to almost half of the whole exports value. The mining sector contributes relatively low to GDP (approximately 1%). Base metals accounted for almost 33% of all exports in 2010. These figures align Kosovo among the countries which the World Bank evaluates as [...] "mineral economies".|$|E

The dislocation strengthening effect thus shows a strong correlation with GB strengthening, and correlation of strength or hardness with d− 1 / 2, where d is the grain size, as in a Hall-Petch type plot, can not be taken as an indication that GB strengthening dominates.

40|$|Abstract — The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess the magnitude of the metal wastes in KSA, and the feasibility of their recycling. Data were collected from 49 manufacturing enterprises in Jeddah processing metals, as related to their use of metals, metal wastes, and recycling issues, as well as data from some main enterprises in KSA, which are recycling metals, and data of the metals ' trades in general. Results show that metal wastes represent on the average 0. 58 % of the <b>processed</b> <b>metals</b> in all the metals ' industries; the ratio significantly varies in the different types of industries (0. 1 % to 14. 0 %). An estimate of 58, 593 Tons of metal wastes has been suggested in 2008 G, which represent {{only a small fraction of}} the total metal wastes in KSA; the main source being the scrap yards. The factors hindering the optimal use and recycling of the metal wastes in KSA may include: lack of data base about the actual size of the wastes, lack of systems for collection, isolation and reuse of the different of wastes ' components, and lack of legislation protecting the investors in recycling. It has been recommended to: (a) begin urgently building database of metal wastes in KSA; (b) encourage research for developing systems for their collection, isolation and recycling; (c) carry out education programs for the public to initiate population's awareness to be involved in the recycling process, and (d) encourage investors to launch programs for metal wastes recycling, issue legislation for their protection, and provide them with government financial incentives...|$|E
40|$|A primary {{objective}} of the International Space Station {{is to provide a}} premier facility for microgravity research. There are many disturbances on board the Station that can disturb the quality of the microgravity environment, including disturbances caused by both system and payload hardware. Disturbances within experiments themselves can also affect the quality of their own environment. The primary functions of the Bridgman Unidirectional Dendrites in Liquids Experiment (BUNDLE) are to melt, directionally solidify, and perform in-situ quench of metallic alloys, providing data to aid in understanding the effects of the microgravity environment on the characteristics of these <b>processed</b> <b>metals.</b> Quenching of the samples in the BUNDLE furnace is accomplished by rapidly introducing high pressure helium into the furnace chamber. This type of quench will induce sample vibrations which may be large enough to adversely affect sample quality. The {{primary objective}} of the test described in this presentation was to determine the acceleration imparted on the BUNDLE sample during helium quench. From this information, the science community can better assess whether this method of quench will allow them to obtain the data they need. Utilizing breadboard hardware, the sample quench sequence was conducted. Data was collected from accelerometers located on the breadboard hardware and inside the sample cartridge. The test data indicated that the maximum acceleration achieved by the sample was 0. 325 g, which is much higher than the desired microgravity (10 (exp - 6) g) environment. However, this acceleration level occurred over a time period of less than 0. 1 second. Because this time period is so short, there should be no detrimental effects to dendrite growth. This result was consistent with the observations of the experiment scientists, who are satisfied with the results of previous dendrite growth in this breadboard unit...|$|E

VII Zw 403 is a BCD galaxy, in recent years considered in many discussions related to star formation histories and the possible impact of dwarf systems on the surrounding intergalactic medium. It is an isolated system, however considered {{to be a member of}} M 81 group. The X-ray observations (Papaderos et al. 1994; Fourniol 1997) added more interest to the system, as they revealed an extended kpc-scale region of diffuse X-ray emission. Several models have been investigated with the aim of matching the main observed parameters of VIIZw 403 : The Hα luminosity (LHα = 1. 8 × 10 39 erg s − 1), the X-ray power (LX = 2. 3 × 10 38 erg s − 1) and the size of the diffuse X-ray emitting region (∼ 1 kpc). In all of them we assumed that the photons presently produced by the stellar clusters are all used up to reestablish the ionization of the central HII region. This fact is supported by the HI mass present in VIIZw 403. The Hα flux defines then the present star formation rate which we have assumed to be constant in time. We have further assumed that the observed HI mass occupies a smooth low density halo but an important fraction of it is in a dense cloud component (Mcl). This has a major impact on the evolution as it affects both the time required to reach a given size as well as the X-ray luminosity produced by the superbubble.
