5|$|In Rule 90, on an {{infinite}} one-dimensional lattice, every configuration has exactly four predecessor configurations. This is because, in a predecessor, any two consecutive cells may have {{any combination of}} states, but once those two cells' states are chosen, {{there is only one}} consistent choice for the states of the remaining cells. Therefore, there is no Garden of Eden in Rule 90, a configuration with no <b>predecessors.</b> The Rule 90 configuration consisting of a single nonzero cell (with all other cells zero) has no <b>predecessors</b> that have finitely many nonzeros. However, this configuration is not a Garden of Eden because it does have <b>predecessors</b> with infinitely many nonzeros.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcity}} of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his <b>predecessors.</b> He was most likely {{a member of the}} royal family, although the possibility that he was a usurper unrelated to his <b>predecessors</b> cannot be totally excluded.|$|E

25|$|The <b>predecessor</b> of the {{successor}} {{of a number}} is the number itself. For example, five is {{the successor}} of four therefore four is the <b>predecessor</b> of five. Every natural number except zero has a <b>predecessor.</b>|$|R
2500|$|We {{also need}} to know what the actual {{shortest}} path is. To do this, we use another array p, a <b>predecessor</b> array. This array implicitly stores the path to any square s by storing the previous node on the shortest path to s, i.e. the <b>predecessor.</b> To reconstruct the path, we lookup the <b>predecessor</b> of s, then the <b>predecessor</b> of that square, then the <b>predecessor</b> of that square, and so on, until we reach the starting square. Consider the following code: ...|$|R
5|$|Of the Western nations {{represented}} in No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando only Norway did not develop a Commando force. The French troops were the <b>predecessors</b> of the Naval commandos. The Dutch Troops were the <b>predecessors</b> of the Korps Commandotroepen and the Belgian Troops were the <b>predecessors</b> of the Paracommando Brigade. The 1st Battalion of the United States Army Rangers were {{also influenced by}} the British Commandos. Their first volunteers were from troops stationed in Northern Ireland, who were sent to train at the Commando depot at Achnacarry. However, subsequent Ranger battalions were formed and trained independent of British influence.|$|E

5000|$|Once all the {{successor}} path metrics {{are smaller than}} T, the algorithm moves backward to the <b>predecessor</b> path if the <b>predecessor</b> path metric beats T; thereafter, threshold examination will be subsequently performed on another successor path of this revisited <b>predecessor.</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{presiding}} {{officer of}} the Senate, Johnson was called on to cast a tie-breaking vote fourteen times, more than all of his <b>predecessors</b> save John Adams and John Calhoun. Despite the precedent set by some of his <b>predecessors,</b> Johnson never addressed the Senate {{on the occasion of}} a tie-breaking vote; he did once explain his vote via an article in the Kentucky Gazette.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} <b>predecessors,</b> the album {{received}} mixed reviews. A tour, named The Seize the Night Tour, followed the release, concentrating upon {{songs from the}} Bat albums.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} two <b>predecessors,</b> Sonic 3 was a {{critical}} and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States; though this makes {{it one of the}} best-selling Genesis games, its <b>predecessors,</b> bundled with the Genesis in some regions, had sold a combined 21million. The game has been re-released in compilations and download releases for various platforms, including Sonic Mega Collection for the GameCube and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.|$|E

5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four <b>predecessors,</b> other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no Garden of Eden, a configuration with no <b>predecessors.</b> It {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective (each configuration has a predecessor) but not injective (it has sets of more than one configuration with the same successor), showing that the converse of the Garden of Eden theorem is not true.|$|E

5|$|<b>Predecessor</b> and {{successor}} queries can {{be performed}} with rank queries. Once the rank of the target value is known, its <b>predecessor</b> is the element at the position given by its rank (as {{it is the largest}} element that is smaller than the target value). Its successor is the element after it (if it is present in the array) or at the next position after the <b>predecessor</b> (otherwise). The nearest neighbor of the target value is either its <b>predecessor</b> or successor, whichever is closer.|$|R

30|$|In addition, if the {{accumulated}} similarity, H(i,j), is negative, {{then it is}} set to zero (first branch of the equation) and the fictitious node (0, 0) becomes the <b>predecessor</b> of (i,j). If, on the other hand, {{the accumulated}} similarity is positive, the <b>predecessor</b> of (i,j) is the node which maximizes H(i,j). The coordinates of the best <b>predecessor</b> of each node are stored in a separate matrix. Concerning the first row and first column of the grid, the <b>predecessor</b> is always the fictitious node (0, 0).|$|R

In addition, Nightshade features an enhanced {{version of the}} Ultimate Play the Game's Filmation game engine, branded Filmation II. The game received positive reviews upon release; critics praised its gameplay traits, graphics and colours, however one critic was divided over its perceived similarities to its <b>predecessors.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game {{follows the}} five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn {{they are part}} of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit <b>predecessors</b> from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game {{character}} selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their <b>predecessors</b> from destruction.|$|E
5|$|After Franklin's 1932 election, Howe told Eleanor {{that given}} ten years, {{he could make}} her {{president}} as well.

5000|$|The minimal [...] "(a,b)"-separators also form an {{algebraic}} structure: For two fixed vertices a and b {{of a given}} graph G, an (a,b)-separator S can {{be regarded}} as a <b>predecessor</b> of another (a,b)-separator T, if every path from a to b meets S before it meets T. More rigorously, the <b>predecessor</b> relation is defined as follows: Let S and T be two (a,b)-separators in 'G'. Then S is a <b>predecessor</b> of T, in symbols , if for each , every path connecting x to b meets T. It follows from the definition that the <b>predecessor</b> relation yields a preorder on the set of all (a,b)-separators. Furthermore, [...] proved that the <b>predecessor</b> relation gives rise to a complete lattice when restricted to the set of minimal (a,b)-separators in G.|$|R
25|$|The {{algorithm}} described so far {{gives us}} only {{the length of}} the shortest path. To find the actual sequence of steps, the algorithm can be easily revised so that each node on the path keeps track of its <b>predecessor.</b> After this algorithm is run, the ending node will point to its <b>predecessor,</b> and so on, until some node's <b>predecessor</b> is the start node.|$|R
