We use authentication throughout our everyday lives, especially on the Internet, you might have found one user having more and more usernames or IDs and passwords, which contains users private information. It is very difficult to remember all usernames and passwords and it is unsafe to write them down on notebooks. To solve this problem, this paper explained a design and implementation of <b>Passwords</b> <b>Management</b> System (PMS), by which you can manage your usernames and passwords efficiently. It was made based on Blowfish Algorithm, which is a symmetric block cipher provides high security and designed by Bruce Schneier. Because of the difficulties associated with remembering passwords, a group of software applications, password managers has emerged. These applications deal with everything from the simple storage of user IDs and <b>passwords</b> to the <b>management</b> of <b>password</b> access across many users...|$|R
40|$|A mobile {{single sign on}} system Today {{users have}} to manage a set of username, {{passwords}} for every service they are using. As the number of passwords to mange grow, people start writing them down, use easily guessable passwords or use the same password on different accounts. This severely reduces the security passwords provide and a better <b>password</b> <b>managements</b> system is needed. Single sign-on (SSO) allows users to store all their passwords securely in one place. Many of the SSO solutions available {{on the market today}} are either to expensive for the common user or they lack mobility. This goal of this thesis is to propose a new mobile singe sign-on system that automates logons for the user. The passwords will be stored on a mobile phone and transferred securely to a USB unit plugged into the PC. This unit will be configured as a keyboard and input characters as if the user was typing them on a conventional keyboard. The main contribution from this thesis will be to show whether or not it’s possible to implement the proposed idea, and the results will be a prototype of the solution in accompanied by a security and usability analysis...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} {{identify}} and authenticate users {{is regarded as the}} foundation of computer security. Although new authentication technologies are evolving, passwords are the most common method used to control access in most computer systems. Research suggests that a large portion of computer security password breaches are the result of poor user security behaviour. The <b>password</b> creation and <b>management</b> practices that online consumers apply have a direct effect on the level of computer security and are often targeted in attacks. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate South African online consumers’ computer password security practices and to determine whether consumers’ perceptions regarding their password security ability is reflected in the <b>password</b> creation and <b>management</b> practices that they apply. Method: A Web-based survey was designed to (1) determine online consumers’ perceptions of their skills and competence in respect of computer password security and (2) determine the practices that South African online consumers apply when creating and managing passwords. The measures applied were then compared to (1) the users’ perceptions about their computer password security abilities and (2) the results of international studies to determine agreement and inconsistencies. Results: South African online consumers regard themselves as proficient password users. However, various instances of unsafe passwords practices were identified. The results of this South African study correspond with the results of various international studies confirming that challenges to ensure safe online transacting are in line with international challenges. Conclusion: There is a disparity between South African online consumers’ perceived ability regarding computer password security and the <b>password</b> creation and <b>management</b> practices that they apply. </p...|$|R

In explicating digital privacy practices in the home we find an abiding methodological concern amongst members to manage the potential ‘attack surface’ of the digital on everyday life occasioned by interaction in and with the networked world. We also find, as a feature of this methodological preoccupation, that privacy dissolves into a heterogeneous array of relationship management practices. Accordingly we propose that ‘privacy’ has little utility as a focus for design, and suggest instead that a more productive way forward would be to concentrate on supporting people’s evident interest in managing their relationships in and with the networked world...|$|R

To address this problem, password managers are designed to reduce or eliminate password reuse across multiple accounts and devices through lightweight <b>password</b> generation and <b>management</b> features that allow users to create random, unique passwords across their accounts while only needing to remember the password to their password manager to access those accounts. If properly utilized, a password manager can help users stay secure without increasing their cognitive burden through arduous memorization, and so many experts recommend users take up the tool [2, 8]. Thus, this study investigates what users think of these tools towards understanding why some choose to use them while others do not.|$|R

On the negative side, the same DES algorithm was used with only 56-bit encryption for the subsequent authentication steps, {{and there is still}} no salting. Furthermore, Windows machines were for many years configured by default to send and accept responses derived from both the LM hash and the NTLM hash, so the use of the NTLM hash provided no additional security while the weaker hash was still present. It also took time for artificial restrictions on <b>password</b> length in <b>management</b> tools such as User Manager to be lifted.|$|R
