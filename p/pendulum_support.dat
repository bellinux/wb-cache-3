40|$|The string {{pendulum}} {{consists of}} a mass attached {{to the end of}} an inextensible string which is fastened to a support. Analyzing the dynamics of such forced supports is motivated by understanding the behavior of suspension bridges or of tethered structures during earthquakes. Applying an external forcing to the <b>pendulum's</b> <b>support</b> can cause the pendulum string to go from taut to slack states and vice versa, and is capable of exhibiting interesting periodic or chaotic dynamics. The inextensibility of the string and its capacity to go slack make simulation and analysis of the system complicated. The string pendulum system is thus formulated here as a piecewise-smooth dynamical system using the method of Lagrange multipliers to obtain a system of differential algebraic equations (DAE) for the taut state. In order to find a formulation for the forced string pendulum system, we first turn to similar but simpler pendulum systems, such as the classic rigid pendulum, the elastic spring pendulum and the elastic spring pendulum with piecewise constant stiffness. We perform a perturbation analysis for both the unforced and forced cases of the spring pendulum approximation, which shows that, for large stiffness, this is a reasonable model of the system. We also show that the spring pendulum with piecewise constant stiffness can be a good approximation of the string pendulum, in the limit of a large extension constant and a low compression constant. We indicate the behavior and stability of this simplified model by using numerical computations of the system's Lyapunov exponents. We then provide a comparison of the spring pendulum with piecewise constant stiffness with the formulation of the taut-slack pendulum using the DAE for the taut states and derived switching conditions to the slack states.

40|$|For liquid {{transfer}} system in three-dimensional space, {{the use of}} multijoint robot arm provides much flexibility. To realize quick point-to-point motion with minimal sloshing in such system, we propose an integrated framework of trajectory planning and sloshing suppression. The robot motion is decomposed into translational motion of the robot wrist and rotational motion of the robot hand to ensure the upright orientation of the liquid container. The trajectory planning for the translational motion is based on cubic spline optimization with free via points that produces smooth trajectory in joint space while it still allows obstacle avoidance in task space. Input shaping technique is applied in the task space to suppress the motion induced sloshing, which is modeled as spherical <b>pendulum</b> with moving <b>support.</b> It has been found through simulations and experiments that the proposed approach is effective in generating quick motion with low amount of sloshing...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} two forced dissipative pendulum systems, {{the pendulum}} with vertically oscillating <b>support</b> and the <b>pendulum</b> with periodically varying length, {{with a view}} to draw comparisons between their behaviour. We study the two systems for values of the parameters for which the dynamics are non-chaotic. We focus our investigation on the persisting attractive periodic orbits and their basins of attraction, utilising both analytical and numerical techniques. Although in some respect the two systems have similar behaviour, we find that even within the perturbation regime they may exhibit different dynamics. In particular, for the same value of the amplitude of the forcing, the pendulum with varying length turns out to be perturbed to a greater extent. Furthermore the periodic attractors persist under larger values of the damping coefficient in the pendulum with varying length. Finally, unlike the <b>pendulum</b> with oscillating <b>support,</b> the <b>pendulum</b> with varying length cannot be stabilised around the upward position for any values of the parameters...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{the analysis of}} four classes of nonlinear oscillators. We investigate a damped planar pendulum subject to vertical sinusoidal displacement of appropriate amplitude and frequency, a Hamiltonian planar <b>pendulum</b> with <b>support</b> point oscillating in the vertical direction, a forced spherical pendulum as a constrained dynamical system and a spinning double pendulum with the two masses oscillating in transversal planes. The motivation for this research was to understand and determine the fundamental dynamical properties of the four model systems. For this purpose analytical and numerical tools have been employed. Linearization, phase portraits, Poincare sections, basins of attraction, KAM theory, Lyapunov exponents and normal form theory have been considered as examples. For the damped planar pendulum a rigorous analysis is presented {{in order to show}} that, in the presence of friction, the upward equilibrium position becomes asymptotically stable. Furthermore, using numerical tools, the dynamics of the system far from its equilibrium points is systematically investigated. For the undamped and parametrically perturbed planar pendulum, we use KAM type arguments to rigorously prove the stability of the equilibrium point corresponding to the upside-down position. For the spherical pendulum a numerical framework is developed, which allows orbits to explore the entire sphere. We show that the qualitative change in the Poincare sections from regular to chaotic behaviour is in excellent qualitative agreement with corresponding computations of the Lyapunov exponents. Finally we study the dynamics of the spinning double pendulum by using normal form theory. We have identified the regions in physical parameter space where a codimension-two singularity occurs. An algorithm for the Cushman-Sanders normal form is constructed and analyzed. A representative model for the truncated normal form is presented...|$|R
