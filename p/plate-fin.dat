A sealed air cooling constant temperature box with dual-chamber structure that can provide constant working condition for precision instruments in-vehicle was developed. According to the heat transfer analysis of the double <b>plate-fins</b> heatsink, the heat radiation area and dimensions were determined based on electrical analogy. The air flow rate and temperature distribution of the system in heat steady-state was simulated by CFD software, {{and the results are}} consistent with that of experimental test. In different conditions, the thermal test results indicate that when the heat flow rate in the inner chamber is about 170 W, the temperature difference between inner chamber and environment is no more than 6. 5 ℃.

40|$|The {{classical}} substances as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) used {{as working}} fluids in the vapour compression plants {{have to be}} replaced by new substances because of their ozone depletion potential and their greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is non-toxic, non-flammable, has zero ozone depletion potential and negligible global warming potential as refrigerant. Referring to a transcritical CO 2 cycle working as a classical ‘‘splitsystem’’ to cool air in residential applications, the aim of this paper is the evaluation of the energy performances using an internal heat exchanger. The experimental plant employs a semi-hermetic compressor, <b>plate-finned</b> tube type heat exchangers, a back pressure valve electronically controlled and an expansion valve.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. An evaluation of the thermal characteristics of a flat plate heat pipe spreader was performed through an analytical, numerical, and experimental analysis. The physical system considered was comprised of a high heat flux heat source attached to the center of a flat plate heat pipe, mounted {{at the base of a}} <b>plate-finned</b> heat sink and cooled by forced convection. In the analysis, the theoretical maximum operating conditions for the heat pipe are predicted, and it is found that the specific heat pipe configuration would most likely fail based on capillary limitations of the wick structure for conditions typical of electronic cooling applications. The mass and heat transfer processes which contribute to the capillary limitation were considered in theory, and a novel technique which utilizes well-known conventional heat pipe relations for pressure loss was developed to estimate the point of heat pipe failure. In addition, a thermal resistance network was developed in an effort to predict the temperature drop across the heat pipe spreader. Through a separate approach, a numerical model was developed to solve the conjugate problem of heat transfer in the heat pipe/heat sink with turbulent forced convection. In this approach, the heat pipe was modeled as a solid material having a high effective conductivity. Finally, the system was tested experimentally, and the results were compared to the analytical and numerical results. It was found that the capillary limit model over-predicted the measured point of heat pipe failure by several orders of magnitude, and the resistance model under-represented the actual resistance by a factor of 2 to 3. In addition, a change in thermal resistance with power input was discovered during experimentation that was not predicted by the analysis. The numerical model was compared to the experimental results and a relation for the effective conductivity as a function of power input was determined. Complexities associated with the internal heat and mass transfer processes of the flat plate heat pipe spreader were thoroughly discussed and the discrepancies between the experimental and analytical results were examined...|$|R

A <b>plate-fin</b> heat exchanger {{is made of}} layers of corrugated sheets separated by flat metal plates, typically aluminium, to create a series of finned chambers.

Heat is transferred from one stream through the fin interface to the separator plate and through {{the next set of}} fins into the adjacent fluid. The fins also serve to increase the structural integrity of the heat exchanger and allow it to withstand high pressures while providing an extended surface area for heat transfer.|$|E
