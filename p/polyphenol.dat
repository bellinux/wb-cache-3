The aim of this work was to estimate the amount of total <b>polyphenols</b> consumed in a whole diet (Spanish Mediterranean diet) and their intestinal bioaccessibility. Total <b>polyphenols</b> were determined, as {{the sum of the}} <b>polyphenols</b> present in methanol:acetone:water extracts (extractable <b>polyphenols)</b> of plant foods and condensed tannins and hydrolysable <b>polyphenols</b> (non-extractable <b>polyphenols)</b> in the corresponding residues. The <b>polyphenols</b> intestinal bioaccessibility was estimated by an in vitro gastrointestinal model where food <b>polyphenols</b> are released by enzyme digestion and colonic fermentation. The mean daily intake of <b>polyphenols</b> in the Spanish diet was estimated between 2590 and 3016 mg/person/day. The amount of non-extractable <b>polyphenols</b> was almost double that of extractable <b>polyphenols.</b> It was estimated that about 48 % of dietary <b>polyphenols</b> are bioaccessible in the small intestine, while 42 % become bioaccessible in the large intestine. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as <b>polyphenol</b> oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

The cytokine-inducing activity of the enzymatically polymerised <b>polyphenols</b> derived from caffeic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and p-coumaric acid (CoA) was investigated using murine splenocytes. Polymerised <b>polyphenols,</b> but not non-polymerised <b>polyphenols,</b> induced cytokine synthesis in murine splenocytes.

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{reported}} a greater reduction in cardiovascular risk and metabolic disorders associated with diets rich in <b>polyphenols.</b> The antioxidant effects of <b>polyphenols</b> are attributed to the regulation of redox enzymes by reducing reactive oxygen species production from mitochondria, NADPH oxidases and uncoupled endothelial NO synthase in addition to also up-regulating multiple antioxidant enzymes.

5|$|Polish {{studies found}} that {{although}} the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, several studies showed I.badia bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect {{is caused by a}} brown pigment, the <b>polyphenol</b> compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali chelators based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a bioremediation agent to clean up contaminated sites.|$|E

No literature {{could be found in}} respect of the determination of total <b>polyphenols,</b> non-tannin <b>polyphenols</b> and tannins in the species T. halacsyanum Heldr., T. hyrcanicum L. and T. scorodonia L. Quantitative analysis of <b>polyphenols</b> and tannins was therefore performed. Materials and Methods: Plant material was collected over two consecutive seasons in the Pharmaceutical Botanical Garden “Fran Kušan” of the Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb, Croatia. The content of total <b>polyphenols,</b> non-tannin <b>polyphenols</b> and tannins was determined by combination of spectrophotometric and hide powder method. Results: The quantity of total <b>polyphenols</b> of investigated species ranged from 0. 87 to 4. 1 %. The content of <b>polyphenols</b> unadsorbed on hide powder (non-tannin <b>polyphenols)</b> was between 0. 83 and 3. 4 %, while the quantity of tannins ranged from 0. 04 to 1. 4 %.

25|$|Proteins {{account for}} 8% to 12% of dried green coffee beans. A {{majority}} of the proteins are of the 11-S storage kind (alpha – component of 32 kDa, beta – component of 22 kDa), {{most of which are}} degraded to free amino acids during maturation of green coffee beans. Further, 11-S storage proteins are degraded to their individual amino acids under roasting temperature, thus are an additional source of bitter components due to generation of Maillard reaction products. High temperature and oxygen concentration and low pH degrade 11-S storage proteins of green coffee beans to low-molecular-weight peptides and amino acids. The degradation is accelerated in the presence of organic acids such as chlorogenic acids and their derivatives. Other proteins include enzymes, such as catalase and <b>polyphenol</b> oxidase, which are important for the maturation of green coffee beans. Mature coffee contains free amino acids (4.0mg amino acid/g robusta coffee and up to 4.5mg amino acid/g arabica coffee). In Coffea arabica, alanine is the amino acid with the highest concentration, i.e. 1.2mg/g, followed by asparagine of 0.66mg/g, whereas in C. robusta, alanine is present at a concentration of 0.8mg/g and asparagine at 0.36mg/g. The free hydrophobic amino acids in fresh green coffee beans contribute to the unpleasant taste, making it impossible to prepare a desirable beverage with such compounds. In fresh green coffee from Peru, these concentrations have been determined as: isoleucine 81mg/kg, leucine 100mg/kg, valine 93mg/kg, tyrosine 81mg/kg, phenylalanine 133mg/kg. The concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (a neurotransmitter) has been determined between 143mg/kg and 703mg/kg in green coffee beans from Tanzania. Roasted coffee beans do not contain any free amino acids; the amino acids in green coffee beans are degraded under roasting temperature to Maillard products (reaction products between the aldehyde group of sugar and the alpha-amino group of the amino acids). Further, diketopiperazines, e.g. cyclo(proline-proline), cyclo(proline-leucine), and cyclo(proline-isoleucine), are generated from the corresponding amino acids, and are the major source of the bitter taste of roasted coffee. The bitter flavor of diketopiperazines is perceptible at around 20mg/liter of water. The content of diketopiperazines in espresso is about 20 to 30mg, which is responsible for its bitterness.|$|E
