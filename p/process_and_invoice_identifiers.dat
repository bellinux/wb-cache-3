40|$|Abstract. Companies order, receive, {{and pay for}} goods. Hence they {{continually}} receive <b>and</b> <b>process</b> <b>invoices.</b> For {{the most}} part these are printed on paper and are dealt with manually, so that each invoice after receipt involves processing costs of about 9 Euro on average. Often, human searching and typing of data into computer forms is required to transfer the information from paper into the computer, e. g. into ERP-systems, like SAP, that many companies run. This article presents the main results of our 300 -page market survey of 11 suppliers of invoice reading systems (  ¢¡¤£¥¡§ ¦), which automate the transfer of invoice data to ERP-systems. For the scientific  ¢¡¤£¥¡¨¦ community we hope to provide {{the service of a}} better visibility of our discipline to potential investors and users. ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 4, 000 instances annually where state property located along Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) maintained right-of-way {{needs to be}} replaced or repaired due to motor vehicle crashes. The median cost of invoices to responsible parties 419. INDOT incurs significant financial losses from state property damage that is not reimbursed directly by the responsible driver or when invoice costs {{do not reflect the}} fully-loaded cost of the repair. This study 2 ̆ 7 s objective is to identify enhanced management procedures to decrease the financial burden of the state by identifying practices supporting the following four goals: increasing the amount <b>invoiced</b> <b>and</b> the percent collected, associating more crash reports to damage, decreasing the entire <b>process</b> time, <b>and</b> <b>invoicing</b> fully-loaded repair costs. To implement the best practices found in other agencies, this study administered two sets of surveys to state highway agencies in the United States. After comparing INDOT 2 ̆ 7 s process with those of peer states, this study recommends that the recovery process should begin with assignment, by law enforcement, of a tag to each damage instance. On the bases of assigned tags, maintenance crews proceed with the processing of crash damage documentation forms. An overhead and administration fee should be recorded in the repair costs to recover labor used to process the repair documents. This study also recommends that the repair invoice should be preceded with a notification letter to the driver and/or insurance company. The study also establishes appropriate performance measures {{that could be used to}} evaluate the effectiveness of the process. Past invoicing challenges show that these components are expected to increase the frequency of reimbursement of repair costs. ...|$|R
50|$|Electronic Invoicing {{can be a}} {{very useful}} tool for the AP department. Electronic {{invoicing}} allows vendors to submit invoices over the internet <b>and</b> have those <b>invoices</b> automatically routed <b>and</b> <b>processed.</b> Because <b>invoice</b> arrival <b>and</b> presentation is almost immediate invoices are paid sooner; therefore, the amount of time and money it takes to process these invoices is greatly reduced. (Financial Operations Networks, 2008) These solutions usually involve a third party company that provides and supports an application which allows a supplier to submit an electronic invoice to their customer for immediate routing, approval, and payment. These applications are tied to databases which archive transaction information between trading partners. (US Bank, Scott Hesse, 2010) The invoices may be submitted in a number of ways, including EDI, CSV, or XML uploads. PDF files, or online invoice templates. Because E-invoicing includes so many different technologies and entry options, it is used as an umbrella term to describe any method by which an invoice is electronically presented to a customer for payment.|$|R
