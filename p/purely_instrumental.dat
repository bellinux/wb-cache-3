Art Bears went on to make two more albums of songs.|$|E
5|$|A Hero's Song was Dvořák's last orchestral {{work and}} the final of his five symphonic poems, the others being The Water Goblin, The Noon Witch, The Golden Spinning Wheel, and The Wild Dove (Opp. 107–110). It is also the last {{instance}} of him writing <b>purely</b> <b>instrumental</b> music, as he dedicated himself to vocal and operatic works after its completion. He began working on the piece on August 4, 1897, immediately after revising the third act of his opera The Jacobin. The work was completed in three months, during which time Dvořák lived at his summer residence {{in his hometown of}} Příbram, and spent time at his chateau of the patron Josef Hlávka in Lužany. The piece was completed on October 25 of the same year, and was published in 1899 by Fritz Simrock in Berlin. The symphonic poem coincidentally anticipated Richard Strauss's similar tone poem Ein Heldenleben (A Hero's Life), which was composed a year later. In fact, Dvořák originally intended to title the piece A Hero's Life, a name which had been suggested to him by his pupil Vítězslav Novák.|$|E

5|$|Michael Kennedy characterises Vaughan Williams's {{music as}} a {{strongly}} individual blending of the modal harmonies familiar from folk‐song with the French influence of Ravel and Debussy. The basis of his work is melody, his rhythms, in Kennedy's view, being unsubtle at times. Vaughan Williams's music {{is often described as}} visionary; Kennedy cites the masque Job and the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies. Vaughan Williams's output was prolific and wide-ranging. For the voice he composed songs, operas, and choral works ranging from simpler pieces suitable for amateurs to demanding works for professional choruses. His comparatively few chamber works are not among his better known compositions. Some of his finest works elude conventional categorisation, such as the Serenade to Music (1938) for sixteen solo singers and orchestra; Flos Campi (1925) for solo viola, small orchestra, and small chorus; and his most important chamber work, in Howes's view—not <b>purely</b> <b>instrumental</b> but a song cycle—On Wenlock Edge (1909) with accompaniment for string quartet and piano.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between experience, emotions, cognition, and learning is of increasing interest to educators and researchers who recognise {{that efforts to}} promote student engagement and learning {{must take into account}} factors beyond the <b>purely</b> cognitive and <b>instrumental.</b> The significance of experience considered as a unity in regard to child development was discussed through the concept of perezhivanie decades ago in the work of Lev Vygotsky (1934). Contemporary explorations of perezhivanie as a concept and phenomenon may be further informed through drawing upon Dewey's work on Art as Experience (1934) and the concept of metaxis as understood in drama education literature. This paper will examine the special nature of arts and educational drama experiences for experiencing, realising, and expressing perezhivanie. It also reflects upon the role of the teacher, their own experiences of arts-inspired perezhivanie and the potentially contagious impact of the teacher's experiences for their students...|$|R
40|$|Abstract‘Warm care’ {{is often}} contrasted with ‘cold technology’. But {{is this a}} {{meaningful}} opposition? Much research into healthcare technology frames the relation between humans and their technologies as <b>purely</b> rational and <b>instrumental,</b> where technologies are functional means to a human end. Other studies, however, foreground how technologies and users (re) configure each other in particular use practices. In this paper, we build on the latter work by studying relations with healthcare technologies as not only functional but also social and affective. We analyse a documentary about robot pets next to ethnographic material about a particular care technology. We analyse the relations between these technologies and their users, the values that are brought into play and the identities generated in the interaction. Then we analyse the structuredness of the interaction, and trace the social relations that are brought into being. Our main argument is that the opposition between cold technology and warm care does not hold, but that there are different relations between people and technologies within different use practices, allowing different affective and social relations, and that this blurs taken-for-granted categories such as medical versus social problems, warm versus cold care, play and seriousness, and affective versus rational technologies...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{production}} ergonomics is a pursuit {{common to}} many companies in different industrial sectors. At the core is an aspiration to eliminate risks for work-related musculo-skeletal disorders (MSDs), but modern views on ergonomics have evolved the discipline from a <b>purely</b> physiological, <b>instrumental</b> concern to an organizational, holistic systems-performance discipline (macroergonomics). This modern perspective implies {{that it is}} not enough to consider ergonomics as the domain of only ergonomics specialists; nor is it advisable to try improving it in isolation, without paying attention to the influences of the surrounding stakeholders and context. This thesis proposes that the “ergonomics infrastructure” of an organization is made up of the structural, technical, organizational and stakeholder-relational conditions that enable or hinder improvement of ergonomics. These conditions focus on the positioning of different stakeholders towards ergonomics issues, the relations between stakeholders and strategies they use for persuasion, and the influences that arise from industry-specific culture, attitudes and procedural integration (or exclusion) of ergonomics into engineering processes. This in turn affects an organization’s tendency to handle ergonomics proactively (i. e. at the design stage) or reactively (in response to injury, discomfort and compensation claims). It was found that stakeholder influence and relational interactions are of particular importance to the implementation of ergonomics improvements. Ergonomics practitioners who are politically aware and are able to link ergonomics improvements to business and production benefits are best poised to advance an ergonomics agenda. The knowledge gleaned from the work in this thesis has been synthesized, together with relevant theoretical concepts found in the literature, into a “Tentative Framework” which guides empirical data collection aimed at mapping the “ergonomics infrastructure” in an organization. Its step-by-step systematic review of conditions at different hierarchical levels in the organization should serve ergonomics practitioners and managers alike in identifying pathways and roadblocks to improving production ergonomics. This contributes to the branch of macroergonomics literature, which to date has placed little focus on day-to-day ergonomics practice and organizational-relational influences on ergonomics work...|$|R

40|$|Population ageing, {{economic}} circumstances, {{and human}} behaviour are placing social welfare systems under great strain. In England extensive {{reform of the}} social work profession is taking place. Training curricula are being redesigned in the context of new standards of competence for social workers – the Professional Capabilities Framework (PCF). Students must be equipped on qualifying to address an extensive range of human problems, presenting major challenges to educators. Critical theory suggests an approach to tackle one such challenge – selecting the essential content required for areas of particular practice. Teaching on social work with older people is used to illustrate this. Habermas’ theory of cognitive interests highlights the different professional roles served by the social work knowledge base - instrumental, interpretive, and emancipatory. Howe’s application of sociological theory distinguished four social work roles corresponding to these. It is suggested that curriculum design decisions must enable practitioners to operate in each. When preparing students to work with older people, educators therefore need to include interpretive and emancipatory perspectives, and not construct social work <b>purely</b> as an <b>instrumental</b> response to problems older people present. This approach provides one useful rationale for curriculum design decisions, which is applicable to other areas of practice, and to contexts outside England...|$|R
40|$|The {{role that}} brands {{play in the}} lives of {{consumers}} has changed dramatically over time, from <b>purely</b> functional to <b>instrumental,</b> symbolic and hedonic in nature. Literature supports that brands are major contributors to, and reflections of, consumer identities. Despite this, literature referring to adolescents, brands and identity is lacking. Adolescents are emerging as the most brand-orientated, consumer-involved and materialistic generation in history. This research sought to understand the role of brands in adolescent identity through: i) sourcing literature to understand the role of brands in the formation and manifestation of adolescent identity, and ii) empirically deepening our understanding of how adolescents use brands to form and manifest their identities in an emerging market context. In a qualitative research study using focus groups, the views of four high- and low-income groups of female adolescents were investigated, compared and contrasted. Differences and commonalities were evident among groups around current brands owned versus brands aspired to, whether brands are consumed for the self or for others, and the role of reference groups. The findings showed differences between the high-income groups, suggesting that variances exist due to differing social standings. The findings further suggested commonalities between the low- and high-income adolescents from a lower social standing. These findings suggest the importance and need for further research in understanding the adolescent consumer psyche and proposes ethical considerations on the part of marketers.

Though these two minuets have the binary form and triple meter {{of the original}} dance form, they have moved beyond the simple phrasing and harmonic movement of the minuet accompaniment into <b>purely</b> Haydnesque <b>instrumental</b> works. The Triste, by Julian Aguirre (1868 - 1924), was transcribed for guitar by Andres Segovia. Aguirre, an Argentine composer and pianist, wrote numerous tristes from the folk melodies of the gauchos, the horsemen {{in the region of}} Argentina known as the Pampa. Nortena, by Jorge Gomez Crespo is an Argentine Indian. The theme is a five-note melody ending with a descending step-wise resolution. The Prelude, BWV 999 by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 - 1750) was originally written for lute in the key of c minor. Andres Segovia transcribed the work for guitar in d minor. Though it is not known if the Prelude was meant to accompany any specific work, the modulation to A major in end is generally thought to lead to the Fugue, BWV 1000, which begins in a minor (originally g minor). This Fugue is transcribed from the lute version of the Fugue from Violin Sonata I. The Siciliana, also from the First Violin Sonata, is in typical 12 / 8 meter with a sixteenth-note upbeat that introduces the recurring theme. Carlos Pedrell (1878 - 1941) wrote Pagina Romantica in dedication to Andres Segovia. Although the Pagina Romantica is a short work, the constant alternation of irregular and regular rhythmic patterns leaves a strong impression. John Dowland (1563 - 1626) was a highly regarded English composer and lutenist. Though the Melancholy Galliard and the Fantasia are performed on the guitar, the third string is tuned down a half-step to an F# to keep the same relative tuning of the lute, which sounds a minor third higher than the guitar. As an instrumental work, the galliard contains variations on the first stanza, rather than the conventional repetition of refrain. The Fantasia, although somewhat fugal in nature, is more a musical invention rather than a work from a particular genre. Emilio Pujol (1886 - 1980) wrote the Becqueriana in honor of the Spanish poet Gustavo Adolfo Becquer. Becquer wrote in a bright, vivid manner to allow the reader to see all that he envisioned. The half-page Becqueriana, replete with musical notation and expressions, captures this style. (See more in text. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was sparked off {{by listening to}} the Miles Davis recording “What I Say”, a twenty one minute piece from the jazz album ‘Live Evil’, which was recorded in 1970. This track features Miles Davis and his ensemble of Gary Bartz, John McLaughlin, Keith Jarrett, Michael Henderson, Jack DeJohnette and Airto Moreira. Bob Palmer, of Rolling Stone music magazine, stated that “…in an area of music where individual virtuosity is the rule rather than the exception, give-and-take between players becomes all important” (Palmer, 1972). ‘What I Say’ could be a metaphor for student speech. The song doesn’t have an easily determinable meaning as it is <b>purely</b> an <b>instrumental,</b> as such without lyrics, but as with the jazz genre, it carries emotional resonance for each listener. Pérez- Sobrino (2014) in her research paper “Meaning construction in verbomusical environments: Conceptual disintegration and metonymy” looks at how different levels of multimodal meaning are rendered into verbo-musical environments. Pérez-Sobrino (2014) focuses on a particular strategy of musical meaning (re) construction, {{the way in which}} the different patterns of conceptual disintegration that structure the multimodal expression trigger the activation of metonymic reasoning at the conceptual level, in her study through classical music. Meaning (re) construction is here understood as a two-step process: the first involves the configuration of certain cues to structure the multimodal manifestation (product), and the second relates to the cognitive operations triggered at the conceptual level by those multimodal cues (process). In the case of another musician actually playing with Miles Davis, multimodal cues may trigger cognitive operations at both the conceptual level and through the activation of metonymic reasoning. In the case of someone only listening directly to a jazz recording, such as that of Miles Davis, cognitive operations may be triggered at the conceptual level. Atypical English language learners at college level may not find jazz music the slightest bit interesting, and when time is a premium in teaching, it is unrealistic to try to install some form of jazz music appreciation in class. In order to circumnavigate this problem, it is better for the teacher to understand such products and processes and apply these notions to actual lessons. Jazz improvisation, such as that in the recording ‘What I Say’, offers a new insight into teaching English, through improvisation itself. It offers a valuable alternative to rigid lessons and is easy to plan and apply. As with musicians learning how to improvise, teachers need to see through apparent ambiguity, an integral element in the genre of jazz, and clarify processes, meanings and products; and constantly question themselves. Such awareness and focus in lesson planning and adaptability and improvisation in class will allow them to pass on their ideas to the students themselves. This research paper focuses on what students actually say, in particular with a focus on improvisation skits during drama plays in a group environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} foreign policy {{transformation}} evokes significant scientific interest. But {{at the same time}} it is so multi-faceted that attempts at its theoretical understanding has been rather sporadic and incomplete. For social constructivism the transformative aspect of international life is a natural object of analysis since the construction of social phenomena is, in fact, a primary and principal way of transforming international realities. Although, this aspect remains insufficiently covered in the existing literature due to two main setbacks, namely, asserting secondary and reactive nature of ideational changes in foreign policy which, according to prevailing idea, may occur only in response to certain objective in material or institutional circumstances. In order to properly comprehend the mechanism of ideational changes we should first get detached from the view that practical material shifts are a basic starting point for any transformational processes in state?s foreign policy. Instead, we should encompass into our perspective ideational changes not provoked by exogenous material factors but initiated by actors themselves and aimed at programming international environment and not only reacting to its input. In that case the research task will consist in revealing the ways of transformation of social meanings and structures thereof that constitute state?s foreign policy identity and motivation. Transformation of social meanings cannot be confined to their loss of relevance for actors. Ideational changes take place not only because actors renounce certain ideas. Social structures, including foreign policy identity and motivation, often exist in the form of multi-level hierarchical constructions within which the role of particular ideas may be transferred from one level to another. Besides, social structures may be imbued with different meanings or associated with different practices that also constitutes important changes though less tangible than those spurred by evident external crisis. The most significant in this sense is the change of ontological quality of those social meanings ? from <b>purely</b> casual or <b>instrumental</b> preferences to constitutive identification features that are perceived as given and require persistent reproduction, and vice versa. Actually, what is in focus is the possibility of two-way transition from the realm of the logic of consequences to the realm of the logic of appropriateness. In the first case we are dealing with the process of social construction exemplified by objectification and internalization, in the second with the process of deconstruction by means of problematization and externalization of valid social meanings. Since these processes run in highly competitive public space, the most influential factor for them is the availability of alternative versions for the social meanings in question and for practices associated with them. But the mere presence of an alternative discourse disputing a stable social meaning does not lead to automatic changes in the foreign policy complex. A challenge emanating from articulating and asserting alternative meanings may be neutralized through discursive strategies that downgrade these alternatives or minimize their discrepancy with the existing social structure or incorporating them to it. In the last two cases actors may initiate certain changes correcting the existing structures themselves. It means that alongside crisis-driven frustrational changes aimed at dismantling the existing social structures there may occur also changes of more adaptive modificative character whose task lies in adjustment of the existing structures for the sake of their stabilization and preservation of their validity. Adaptive changes may envisage partial revision of deconstruction of the existing social meanings and practices associated thereof while general ideational structure defining actor?s identity or motivation is not dismantled but is getting reinvigorated and reinforced. Since most states and decision-making elites are not interested in eliminating own subjectivity and seek to sustain continuity of their identity, the majority {{of foreign policy}} changes tend to be of adaptive and not frustrational character. Although, sometimes the cumulative effect of such adaptive changes may lead to profound transformation of state?s foreign policy. Foreign policy transformation is not a purely ?introvert? proves proceeding exclusively within state?s domestic social context. Construction and deconstruction of international system?s social structure inevitably entails shifts in state?s foreign policy structure because it requires fixation and reproduction in its discourse and behaviour. Plurality of social meanings in international and domestic social contexts allows the ruling class to conduct foreign policy transformations in a way that conforms to exogenous and endogenous challenges while preserving coherence of the own identity and motivation. ? ?????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ???????????????. ?? ?????? ??????? ????????? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ????????????? ?? ???? ???????? ??? ? ???????????? ???????? ??????????????? ? ????????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ? ??????????????? ? ???? ???????, ?????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ????????? ? ????????????? ??????????? ????????????????? ????????? ?? ?????????????????? ????????? ??????????? ? ? ????????? ????????????? ???????...|$|R
