40|$|VPNs enable {{companies}} to connect geographically dispersed oflces and remote workers via secure {{links to the}} <b>private</b> <b>company</b> <b>network,</b> using the public Internet as a backbone. Specially, VPN service in the broadband data communication network is very important and necessary to take in users who want to specify group communication. VPN mechanisms are needed which work over existing deployed backbones, and which can also be migrated to new backbones like MPLS. MPLS is the latest step {{in the evolution of}} multilayer switching in the Internet In this paper, we are trying to clarify how MPLS can be applied to creating VPNs. For that, we researched an architectural model for building VPNs in a MPLS domain. The proposed model takes advantage of both network layer peering and packet switching, and link layer circuit and per-stream switching. It comes with a design scheme and an implementation procedure for VPN service in MPLS system. And then we describe MPLS based VPN service procedures. And, we describe MPLS VPN schemes that must be accommodated with existing network backbones and also provide for a full range of QoS characteristics. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the REMPLI project is to design and {{implement}} a communication infrastructure for distributed data acquisition and remote control operations using the power grid as the communication medium. The primary target application is remote meter reading with high time resolution, where the meters can be energy, heat, gas, or water meters. The users of the system (e. g. utility companies) {{will benefit from the}} REMPLI system by gaining more detailed information about how energy is consumed by the end-users. In this context, the power-line communication (PLC) is deployed to cover the distance between utility <b>company’s</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> and the end user. This document specifies a protocol for real-time PLC, in the framework of the REMPLI project. It mainly comprises the Network Layer and Data Link Layer. The protocol was designed having into consideration the specific aspects of the network: different network typologies (star, tree, ring, multiple paths), dynamic changes in network topology (due to network maintenance, hazards, etc.), communication lines strongly affected by noise...|$|R
40|$|In the post-liberalisation area, utility {{companies}} {{operate in a}} context of multilevel regulation, involving a wide set of authorities with general or sector-based competencies. The literature points out that the presence of a multitude of regulatory actors may have disadvantages, such as a lack of transparency, redundancy in interventions, high administrative burdens for companies, risk of blame shifting between regulatory actors, and blind spots in rule enforcement. Previous research has tempered these predictions, and pointed out that coordination mechanisms limit the amount of overlaps and blind spots in the multilevel regulatory arrangements. It is therefore necessary for researchers to ascertain the level of coordination between all regulatory actors. In line with Verhoest and Bouckaert (2005) coordination is understood as a process that aims to enhance the voluntary and forced alignment of tasks and efforts of organisations within the public sector. The network of public actors involved in rule implementation, licensing, monitoring and enforcement (Hood et al, 2001) represents a regulatory constellation. Classic research tools can identify structural and procedural coordination instruments, but this gives only a partial view of the interactions amongst these actors, and between public actors and <b>private</b> <b>companies.</b> Social <b>network</b> analysis {{has the potential to be}} a powerful new research instrument, complementing data on procedural and structural coordination instruments, thus providing us with a more complete picture of how the different actors interact and coordinate. In this paper, we pose ourselves the question how social network analysis can influence perceptions on the regulatory constellation of two utility sectors in Belgium, energy and telecommunication. We do this by comparing the conclusions of earlier research, which only uses classic research tools, with the results of a Social Network Analysis on the same regulatory constellation. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|When the TPA is {{permitted}} in Scenario 3 and Scenario 4, LI will lend surplus LNG receiving capacity to entrant LT. In China, <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> usually have exclusive local distribution channels for natural gas, while SOCs have to transport and distribute natural gas nationwide. <b>Private</b> <b>companies</b> {{can make more}} profit than SOCs by saving distribution cost in LNG trading. The comprehensive production cost (including distribution cost) of SOC (LI) is 0.3 RMB/m 3, while the cost of <b>private</b> <b>company</b> LT is around 0.2 RMB/m 3. Although SOCs own LNG terminals, <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> have the comparative advantage in LNG trading. Therefore, the SOCs have the incentive to obtain extra profit by lending capacity to <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> and collect the rent fee rather than utilizing the capacity by themselves, and the <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> are also willing to allot parts of their profit as renting fee to rent the SOCs’ LNG terminal capacity.
