5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, <b>patulin,</b> or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi {{have been}} used as folk {{medicines}} around the world, including in Europe and in India where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as Ustilago tritici (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with active ingredients <b>patulin</b> and other penicillin-like compounds.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, <b>patulin,</b> and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E
25|$|Dietary {{intake of}} <b>patulin</b> from apple juice has been {{estimated}} at between 0.03 and 0.26 μg/kg bw/day in various age groups and populations. Content of <b>patulin</b> in apple juice {{is estimated to be}} less than 10–15μg/L. A number of studies have looked into comparisons of organic vs conventional harvest of apples and levels of <b>patulin</b> contamination. For example, one study showed 0.9% of children drinking organic apple juice exceeded the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for <b>patulin.</b> A recent article described detection of <b>patulin</b> in marine strains of Penicillium, indicating a potential risk in shellfish consumption.|$|E
25|$|<b>Patulin</b> is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} a variety of molds, in particular, Aspergillus and Penicillium and Byssochlamys. Most commonly found in rotting apples, in general the amount of <b>patulin</b> in apple products is viewed as a measure {{of the quality of the}} apples used in production. In addition, <b>patulin</b> has been found in other foods such as grains, fruits, and vegetables. While not considered a particularly potent toxin, a number of studies have shown <b>patulin</b> to be genotoxic, which has led some to theorize that it may be a carcinogen, although animal studies have remained inconclusive. <b>Patulin</b> has shown antimicrobial properties against some microorganisms. Several countries have instituted <b>patulin</b> restrictions in apple products. The World Health Organization recommends a maximum concentration of 50µg/L in apple juice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Patulin</b> was {{originally}} {{used as an}} antibiotic against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but after several toxicity reports, {{it is no longer}} used for that purpose. It was specifically trialed to be used against the common cold. <b>Patulin</b> is used as a potassium-uptake inhibitor in laboratory applications. Kashif Jilani and co-workers reported that <b>patulin</b> stimulates suicidal erythrocyte death under physiological concentrations.|$|E

25|$|<b>Patulin</b> is a {{white powder}} soluble in low-pH water and organic solvents. It is a polyketide lactone that is heat-stable, {{so it is not}} {{destroyed}} by pasteurization or thermal denaturation. However, stability following fermentation is lessened. Isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (IDH) is an important enzyme in the multi-step biosynthesis of <b>patulin,</b> and its gene is present in other fungi that may potentially produce the toxin. It is reactive with sulfur dioxide, so antioxidant and antimicrobial agents may be useful to destroy it. Levels of nitrogen, manganese, and pH as well as abundance of necessary enzymes regulate the biosynthetic pathway of <b>patulin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Patulin</b> {{exposure}} can {{be successfully}} managed by following good agricultural {{practices such as}} removing mold, washing, and not using rotten or damaged apples for baking, canning, or juice production.|$|E
25|$|To {{test for}} <b>patulin</b> contamination, {{a variety of}} methods and sample {{preparation}} methods have been employed including thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), capillary electrophoresis.|$|E
25|$|WHO {{concluded}} that <b>patulin</b> is genotoxic based on variable genotoxicity data, {{however it is}} considered a group 3 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), since data was inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|A {{subacute}} rodent NOAEL of 43 μg/kg {{body weight}} {{as well as}} genotoxicity studies were primarily the cause for setting limits for <b>patulin</b> exposure, although a range {{of other types of}} toxicity also exist.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{an earlier}} MRC trial on the {{antibiotic}} <b>patulin</b> {{on the course}} of common colds has been suggested {{to have been the}} first randomized trial. Another early and until recently overlooked randomized trial was published on strophanthin in a local Finnish journal in 1946.|$|E
25|$|<b>Patulin</b> {{was found}} to be immunotoxic in a number of animal and even human studies. Reduced {{cytokine}} secretion, oxidative burst in macrophages, increased splenic T lymphocytes, and increased neutrophil numbers are a few endpoints noticed. However, dietary relevant exposure would not be likely to alter immune response.|$|E
25|$|<b>Patulin</b> is toxic {{primarily}} through affinity to sulfhydryl groups (SH), {{which results in}} inhibition of enzymes. Oral LD50 in rodent models have ranged between 20 and 100mg/kg. In poultry, the oral LD50 range was reported between 50–170mg/kg. Other routes of exposure are more toxic, yet less likely to occur. Major acute toxicity findings include gastrointestinal problems, neurotoxicity (i.e., convulsions), pulmonary congestion, and edema.|$|E
25|$|The {{provisional}} tolerable {{daily intake}} (PTDI) for <b>patulin</b> was set at 0.43µg/kg bw by the FDA based on a NOAEL of 0.3mg/kg bw per week. Monte Carlo analysis was done on apple juice to compare exposure and the PTDI. Without controls or an action limit, 90th percentile of consumers would not be above the PTDI. However, the concentration in children 1–2 years old would be 3 {{times higher than the}} PDTI. Hence, an action limit of 50µg/kg was set.|$|E
25|$|Molds {{can also}} pose a hazard to {{human and animal}} health when they are {{consumed}} following the growth of certain mold species in stored food. Some species produce toxic secondary metabolites, collectively termed mycotoxins including aflatoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins, trichothecenes, citrinin, and <b>patulin.</b> These toxic properties {{may be used for}} the benefit of humans when the toxicity is directed against other organisms; for example, penicillin adversely affects the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Clostridium species), certain spirochetes and certain fungi.|$|E

50|$|Although it {{is a major}} {{economical}} {{problem in}} apples, this plant pathogen can be isolated from a wide host range, including pears, strawberries, tomatoes, corn, and rice.
