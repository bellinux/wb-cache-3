The aryl groups in {{both types of}} ligands were modified with alkyl substituents (methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl) or hetero substituents (methoxy, N,N-dimethylaniline, thiomethyl).

The syntheses of the <b>palladium</b> <b>complexes</b> are solvent-dependent and afford either mono- or dinuclear complexes depending on the choice of the solvent. Additionally, two 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole <b>palladium</b> <b>complexes</b> were synthesized and characterized. A rare distorted lantern-type structure was presented for the first time. The ligands were characterized by 1 H, 13 C, 31 P NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The <b>palladium</b> <b>complexes</b> were characterized by 31 P NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and elemental analysis. Links between the NMR data of the <b>palladium</b> <b>complexes</b> and ligands and their catalytic activity was screened and correlation found.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Suzuki reaction is best viewed {{from the perspective of}} the palladium catalyst. The first step is the oxidative addition of palladium to the halide 2 to form the organopalladium species 3. Reaction with base gives intermediate 4, which via transmetalation with the boron-ate complex 6 (produced by reaction of the boronic acid 5 with base) forms the organopalladium species 8. Reductive elimination of the desired product 9 restores the original palladium catalyst 1 which completes the catalytic cycle. The Suzuki coupling takes place in the presence of a base and for a long time the role of the base was never fully understood. The base was first believed to form a trialkyl borate (R3B-OR), in the case of a reaction of an trialkylborane (BR3) and alkoxide (−OR); this species could be considered as being more nucleophilic and then more reactive towards the <b>palladium</b> <b>complex</b> present in the transmetalation step. Duc and coworkers investigated the role of the base in the reaction mechanism for the Suzuki coupling and they found that the base has three roles: Formation of the <b>palladium</b> <b>complex</b> ArPd(OR)L2, formation of the trialkyl borate and the acceleration of the reductive elimination step by reaction of the alkoxide with the <b>palladium</b> <b>complex.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Reactions {{involving}} palladium(II) acetate and phosphine ligands proceed {{by a third}} mechanism, the anionic pathway.

50|$|In 2005, Meyers et al. Proposed the {{following}} {{mechanism for the}} decarboxylative cross-coupling reaction. The initial and rate determining step is the decarboxylation. The ipso carbon of the arene ring is thought to coordinate to the palladium centre initially and {{is followed by the}} expulsion of carbon dioxide, forming an aryl-palladium intermediate. The olefin then inserts between the arene and palladium center, which then undergoes beta elimination to form the desired vinyl halide, as well as a palladium hydride. This proton is abstracted by silver carbonate, which acts as both a base and an oxidant to regenerate the starting <b>palladium</b> <b>complex</b> completing the catalytic cycle.|$|E
50|$|First, {{when the}} organostannane {{initially}} {{adds to the}} trans metal complex, the X group can coordinate to the tin, {{in addition to the}} palladium, producing a cyclic transition state. Breakdown of this adduct results in the loss of R3Sn-X and a trivalent <b>palladium</b> <b>complex</b> with R1 and R2 present in a cis relationship. Another commonly seen mechanism involves the same initial addition of the organostannane to the trans <b>palladium</b> <b>complex</b> as seen above; however, in this case, the X group does not coordinate to the tin, producing an open transition state. After the α-carbon relative to tin attacks the palladium, the tin complex will leave with a net positive charge. In the scheme below, please note that the double bond coordinating to tin denotes R2, so any alkenyl, allyl, or aryl group. Furthermore, the X group can dissociate {{at any time during the}} mechanism and bind to the Sn+ complex at the end. Density functional theory calculations predict that an open mechanism will prevail if the 2 ligands remain attached to the palladium and the X group leaves, while the cyclic mechanism is more probable if a ligand dissociates prior to the transmetalation. Hence, good leaving groups such as triflates in polar solvents favor the former, while bulky phosphine ligands will favor the latter.A less common pathway for transmetalation is through a dissociative or solvent assisted mechanism. Here, a ligand from the tetravalent palladium species dissociates, and a coordinating solvent can add onto the palladium. When the solvent detaches, to form a 14-electron trivalent intermediate, the organostannane can add to the palladium, undergoing an open or cyclic type process as above.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism of allylic C-H acetoxylation has been studied. [...] The {{first step in}} the catalytic cycle is cleavage of the allylic C-H bond. The sulfoxide ligand is thought to promote this step by generating a highly electrophilic, possibly cationic palladium species in situ. This species coordinates to the alkene and acidifies the adjacent C-H bond, which allows acetate to abstract the proton and forms a π-allyl <b>palladium</b> <b>complex</b> (II). Subsequently, a π-acid such as benzoquinone coordinates to the palladium, activating the π-allyl complex to nucleophilic attack (III). A nucleophile, in this case acetate, attacks to reductively eliminate palladium, generating the product and palladium(0) (IV). The palladium(0) is reoxidized to palladium(II) by benzoquinone and the sulfoxide ligand reassociates, closing the catalytic cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Chain walking occurs {{after the}} polymer chain has grown {{somewhat}} {{on the metal}} catalyst. The precursor is a 16 e− complex with the general formula Ni(diimine)(C2H4)(chain)+. The ethylene ligand (the monomer) dissociates to produce a highly unsaturated 14 e− cation. This cation is stabilized by an agostic interaction. β-Hydride elimination then occurs to give a hydride-alkene complex. Subsequent reinsertion of the M-H into the C=C bond, but in the opposite sense gives a metal-alkyl complex. [...] This process moves the metal {{from the end of}} a chain to a secondary carbon center. At this stage a molecule of ethylene associates with the <b>palladium</b> <b>complex</b> to give Pd(diimine)(alkyl)(ethylene)+. At this second resting state, the ethylene molecule can insert to grow the polymer or dissociate inducing further chain walking. Eventually many branches can form, thereby giving a hyperbranched topology.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 Goossen et al. {{proposed}} {{a reaction to}} synthesize biaryl compounds via catalytic decarboxylative cross coupling.The mechanism involves two overlapping cycles, one using a copper halide and the other using palladium. The decarboxylation step occurs between the substituted benzoic acid and copper halide to form the intermediate aryl copper species. The palladium initially undergoes oxidative addition from the aryl halide to form a Pd(II) aryl complex. After both of these initial steps, the substituted aryl copper undergoes trans-metalation with the <b>palladium</b> <b>complex.</b> This step forms the copper halide, which then undergoes anion exchange with the substituted benzoic acid to reform the aryl copper intermediate, continuing the catalytic cycle.
