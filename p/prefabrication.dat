25|$|Installation {{techniques}} such as <b>prefabrication,</b> in-situ machine forming, mechanized seaming, and the long-strip system help to reduce the installation costs of copper roofing. By lowering installation costs, these techniques permit designers to specify copper into a wider array of building types, not just large prestigious projects as had been common in the past.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the houses}} were brick built, but due to the {{shortage}} of bricks and wood in the early 1920s, {{and the availability of}} factories tooled up for war work some interesting experimental designs and <b>prefabrications.</b>|$|R

Due to their similar design {{and the way the}} buildings lock together like blocks, the estate was also nicknamed [...] "Legoland". It also has the nickname Explorers Estate as each of the streets, Scott Close, Shackleton Close, Drake Close, Clive Road and Mallory Close were named after discoverers.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} {{production}} ceased, 211 SD14's {{had been built}} either at A's Southwick and South Dock yards and or by licencees in Greece, Brazil, Scotland and Argentina. The largest volume of sales was to Greek shipowners. The SD14 and B-series standard ship designs, and the <b>prefabrication</b> methods by which they were built enabled A to maintain a full order book until nationalisation in 1977, in contrast to many other UK shipbuilders in that era.|$|E
25|$|Austin & Pickersgill {{was formed}} in Sunderland in 1954 by the merger of S.P. Austin & Son Ltd (founded by Samuel Peter Austin in c.1826) and William Pickersgill & Sons Ltd (founded c. 1838). After the merger Austin's Wear Dock yard was used for repair while {{shipbuilding}} was concentrated at Pickersgill's Southwick Yard. The latter was modernised {{with the introduction of}} large assembly shops and <b>prefabrication</b> processes. This reduced costs and increased the maximum size of a vessel that the yard could build from 10,000 to 40,000 tons deadweight.|$|E
25|$|Metabolism {{developed}} during the post war period in a Japan that questioned its cultural identity. Initially the group had chosen the name Burnt Ash School to reflect the ruined state of firebombed Japanese cities and the opportunity they presented for radical re-building. Ideas of nuclear physics and biological growth were linked with Buddhist concepts of regeneration. Although Metabolism rejected visual references from the past, they embraced concepts of <b>prefabrication</b> and renewal from traditional Japanese architecture, especially the twenty-year cycle of the rebuilding of the Ise Shrine (to which Tange and Kawazoe were invited in 1953). The sacred rocks onto which the shrine is built were seen by the Metabolists as symbolising a Japanese spirit that predated Imperial aspirations and modernising influences from the West.|$|E

In 1970 the shipyard presented {{itself in a}} new modern shape with giant cranes of 500 and 780 tons capacity, which span two slipways {{for the construction of}} ships up to 500,000 tons deadweight. Spacious <b>prefabrications</b> workshops with automation equipment and cranes of all sizes were in operation. Ship and engine repairs as well as machinery production and general engineering was performed in well-equipped drydocks and workshops. At this time A.G. „Weser” in Bremen and the affiliated Seebeckwerft in Bremerhaven employed about 8,000 workers and office staff.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to further {{understand}} the sociological tradition of language through the analysis of language alternation behaviors among bilingual speakers, namely Korean-Eng lish conversational code-switching. The paper investigates how and in what ways the code-s witches are used as a linguistic resource to accomplish particular social and communicative f unctions as well as how and in what ways cultural-social meanings, such as social hierarchy, are both conditions for and reproduced in code-switches. The goal of this study is to look bey ond the boundaries of a particular communicative event and study the affordances that bring t he particular code-choices to the present moment. The paper also explores, through the analys is of particular micro-events, that within the constraints and <b>prefabrications</b> in which each par ticipant operate, the possibility that people have of re-fabricating and re-synthesizing the pre-conditions that they are socialized into as they engage in an active and creative process of lan guage practices production...|$|R
25|$|Because Mostar’s eastern {{bank was}} {{burdened}} by inadequate infrastructure, the city expanded {{on the western}} bank {{with the construction of}} large residential blocks. Local architects favored an austere modernist aesthetic, <b>prefabrication</b> and repetitive modules. Commercial buildings in the functionalist style appeared on the historic eastern side of the city as well, replacing more intimate timber constructions that had survived since Ottoman times. In the 1970s and 1980s, a healthy local economy fueled by foreign investment spurred recognition and conservation of the city’s cultural heritage. An economically sustainable plan to preserve the old town of Mostar was implemented by the municipality, which drew thousands of tourists from the Adriatic coast and invigorated the economy of the city. The results of this ten-year project earned Mostar an Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{redevelopment}} of {{the town}} centre was started in 1952, with a new centre based on Marlowe's south of the old town. This was alongside a green area called the Water Gardens, designed by Jellicoe, formed by ponding back the River Gade. The old centre of the High Street was to remain largely undeveloped, though the market square closed {{and was replaced by}} a much larger one in the new centre. The former private estate of Gadebridge was opened up as a public park. New schools and roads were built to serve the expanding new neighbourhoods. New housing technology such as <b>prefabrication</b> started to be used from the mid-'50s, and house building rates increased dramatically. Highfield was the next neighbourhood to be constructed. The M1 motorway opened to the east in 1959, and a new road connecting it to the town was opened.|$|E
500|$|Dreadnought was {{the sixth}} ship of the RN {{to bear the}} name. To meet Admiral Fisher's goal of {{building}} the ship in a single year, material was stockpiled in advance {{and a great deal}} of <b>prefabrication</b> was done from May 1905 onwards with approximately 6,000 man weeks of work expended before she was formally laid down on 2 October 1905 on No.5 Slip. In addition, she was built at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth which was regarded as the fastest-building shipyard in the world. The [...] slip was screened from prying eyes and attempts made to indicate that the design was no different than other battleships.|$|E
40|$|Alternatives {{to replace}} {{concrete}} slabs for prefabricated wood as structure of pavement with wearing course was evaluated, ensuring that these <b>prefabrications</b> {{work as a}} single element using finger joints. The mechanical behavior of two types of wood identified through simulations implementing a method of finite elements was evaluated, to subsequently determined optimal configuration for the alternative design with wood pavements and finally verified in the laboratory with the optimal configuration determined with simulation for a design of 440 000 vehicles shafts, {{with the use of}} the MTS machine and a load of 6. 50 tons equivalent to a load of a single axle shaft with two wheels, found that for different traffic design the thickness of the slab of wood to resist this load varies between 0. 125 and 0. 24 meters. This research shows that prefabricated wood building systems are a viable alternative in the market for pavement construction in the structural sense; additionally, they are an innovation since they modify the structural system of slabs, conventionally built on concrete slabs and reduce environmental impact...|$|R

The Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that the original 1979 zoning and theoriginal Wildridge PUD language exclude short term rentals use, stating:The plain language of the subdivision plat and zoning ordinance defined permitted use ofa [...] "dwelling" [...] to exclude use of the dwelling as a hotel or lodge unit. Because thesubdivision plat and ordinance specified that the permitted use of the subject propertywas a duplex, and that such use of the duplex as a hotel or a lodge was not permitted,their objective import clearly was to prohibit uses inconsistent with the residentialcharacter of the area. See Town of Alta v. Ben Hame Corp., 836 P.2d 797, 801 (UtahCt.App.1992); see also Ord. No. 79-12, art. V, § 5.1(f) ("In residential [...] [...] [...] districts,business or commercial activity is prohibited at all times except that limited homeoccupation offices may be allowed under special review uses in certain residential areasas specified in Section 3.2."). This reading of the subdivision plat and ordinancecomports with the general purposes those regulations serve. Among the objectives to beserved by zoning is to avoid mixing together of industrial, commercial, business, andresidential uses. Cf. § 31-23-301, C.R.S.2006. The subdivision plat and ordinanceshould thus legitimately maintain the character of a residential neighborhood. Jackson &Co. (USA), Inc. v Town of Avon, 166 P.3d 297 (Colo. App. 2007).Due to the express language of the original Wildridge PUD approval and the direct ruling in theJackson & Co case, an amendment to the Wildridge PUD is required to alter the prohibition onshort term rental use. Both the Avon Municipal Code and state statute provide specificprocedures for amending planned unit developments.1 Avon Municipal Code section17.20.110(k)(2) requires the Town to provide notification to “owners of all property within thePUD that may be affected by the proposed amendment (as determined by the CommunityDevelopment Director).” If required notice procedures are not properly followed, the localgovernment may not approve an amendment to a planned unit development. Whatley v Summit County Board of County Commissioners, 77 P.3d 793 (Colo. App. 2003). Finally, the consent ofproperty owners is not required to approve an amendment to a PUD, Whatley.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Prefabrication</b> of the hulls began {{even before}} the final design was {{approved}} and {{proved to be a}} major mistake as the strength analysis of the longitudinal joints in the hull proved to be severely flawed and construction was suspended until the end of November 1927 when new blueprints were issued. No slipways were available at the Zhandov Yard until three were finished in May 1928, having only begun construction at the end of 1927, and the assembly of the hulls of the first three Series I ships began shortly afterwards. The other three slipways were completed by July and the other three ships began assembly as the slipways were finished. The hull of Uragan was completed within ten weeks after the keel was laid, although the other ships were built a more normal pace.

2500|$|At the Sackets Harbor shipyard, where Eckford had a {{work force}} of over 200 {{carpenters}} by April 1813 and of over 400 by April 1814 and where he employed over 800 men by January 1815, Eckford and the Browns combined to build all US Navy men-of-war launched on Lake Ontario during the war. By 1814, the Sackets Harbor yard had converted some Great Lakes merchant vessels to carry guns and also had launched eight new purpose-built warships. [...] Among the converted ships was the sloop-of-war the new purpose-built warships ranged in size from the 89-ton schooner [...] launched in 1813, to the never-finished 3,200-ton, 106-gun ship-of-the-line , and also included the corvette [...] in 1813 and the frigate [...] in 1814. Eckford understood that the American war effort on the Great Lakes required the US Navy to keep ahead of British shipbuilding in Canada, and that speedy construction and delivery of warships was critical. Using <b>prefabrication</b> in New York City and on-site assembly in Sackets Harbor, he achieved what were considered breathtaking construction rates. Among the yards most spectacular feats was the rapid construction of Madison, which took only nine weeks from the cutting of her timbers, and only 45 days from keel-laying, to launch on 26 November 1812; the yard went on to beat that record in November 1814 by taking only five weeks between laying the keel of the frigate [...] and launching her. The Sackets Harbor yard also built smaller ships in record time; the schooner [...] took only 21 days from keel-laying to launch in 1813. Eckford also demonstrated a facility for dealing with labour crises, as demonstrated by an incident on 1 May 1814, when a United States Army soldier on sentry duty at Sackets Harbor shot and killed a carpenter after the launching of USS Superior, provoking an armed confrontation between soldiers and shipyard workers, who threatened to go on strike and go home, crippling American shibuilding on the Great Lakes; Eckford joined Chauncey and the US Army commander, Major General Jacob Brown, in talking {{to the men and}} defusing the situation, avoiding further violence and allowing shipyard work to continue.|$|E
