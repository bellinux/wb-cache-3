40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the accuracy of current <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> theory when applied to <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> design. Brass and nylon hex samples were <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> with hardened steel dowel pins. <b>Press</b> <b>fit</b> force and torque required to induce slipping were measured experimentally. Sample dimensions and material properties were utilized to predict expected force and torque levels, which were then measured experimentally. Brass <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> forces proved difficult to predict due to plowing effects in tight interference <b>press</b> <b>fits</b> where material yielding was observed. However, once vertical force was removed, torque was applied to each sample. The observed torque values matched <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> theory well suggesting that the interface pressure of the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> can be accurately predicted by theory. The brass torque samples matched theory well once material yield conditions were taken into account. The creep sensitivity of the nylon samples made predictions over the testing period unreliable. Results show the need for further testing with specific attention to precision in sample machining and measurements.

40|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) consists of two bundles, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral bundle (PM). Double bundle reconstructions appear to give better rotational stability. The usual technique is to make two tunnels in the femur and two in the tibia. This is difficult and in small knees {{may not even be}} possible. We have developed a foreign material free <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> fixation for double bundle ACL reconstruction using a single femoral tunnel (R). This is based on the ALL <b>PRESS</b> <b>FIT</b> ACL reconstruction. It is suitable for the most common medium and, otherwise difficult, small sizes of knees. Method: Using diamond edged wet grinding hollow reamers, bone cylinders in different diameters are harvested from the implantation tunnels of the tibia and femur and used for the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> fixation. Using the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> technique the graft is first fixed in tibia. It is then similarly fixed under tension in the femoral side with the knee in 120 degree flexion. This is called Bottom To Top Fixation (BTT). On extending the knee the graft tension is self adapting. Depending {{on the size of the}} individual knee, the diameter of the femoral bone plug is varied from 8 to 13 mm to achieve an anatomic spread with a double bundle-like insertion. The tibia tunnel can be applied with two 7 or 8 mm diameter tunnels overlapping to a semi oval tunnel between 10 to 13 mm. Results: Since May 2003 we have carried out ACL-reconstructions with Hamstring grafts without foreign material using the ALL <b>PRESS</b> <b>FIT</b> technique. Initially, an 8 mm <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> fixation was used proximally with good results. Since April 2008, the range of diameters was increased up to 13 mm. The results of the Lachman tests have been good to excellent. Results of the Pivot shift test suggested more stability with femoral broader diameters of 9, 5 to 13 mm. Conclusions: The foreign material free fixation of hamstring in the ALL <b>PRESS</b> <b>FIT</b> Bottom To Top Fixation is a successful method for ACL Reconstruction. The Diamond Instruments and tubed guiding devices are precise, reliable and easy to manage. On this basis a double bundle reconstruction is achieved using a single tunnel.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{crack propagation}} simulation is {{performed by the}} Dual Boundary Element Method (DBEM). The Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) along {{the front of a}} semi elliptical crack, initiated from the external surface of a hollow axle, are calculated for bending and <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> loading separately and for a combination of them. In correspondence of the latter loading condition, a crack propagation is also simulated, with the crack growth rates calculated using the NASGRO 3 formula, calibrated for the material under analysis (steel ASTM A 469). The J-integral and COD approaches are selected for SIFs calculation in DBEM environment, where the crack path is assessed by the minimum strain energy density criterion (MSED). In correspondence of the initial crack scenario, SIFs along the crack front are also calculated by the Finite Element (FE) code ZENCRACK, using COD, in order to provide, by a cross comparison with DBEM, an assessment on the level of accuracy obtained. Due to the symmetry of the bending problem a pure mode I crack propagation is realised with no kinking of the propagating crack whereas for <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> loading the crack propagation becomes mixed mode.

The intent is to provide a correlation between bone–implant interaction and heavy stress–strain effects induced in bone tissues. In particular, the analysis allows for the evaluation of the bone mechanical response considering the inelastic range. Materials and methods. Bone material properties are defined, with regard to the elastic phase, according to a procedure that distributes, over the entire volume, the material constants magnitude and orthotropic directions deduced from experimental data. The inelastic phenomena are interpreted by a specific constitutive formulation and parameter identification procedure. The displacement field induced by implant insertion is provided by imposing the geometric configuration of the implant on the assumed drilled surface. Results. Results are reported with regard to the displacement and strain fields caused in the peri-implant region.

40|$|Dental {{implantology}} {{is commonly}} adopted {{for the treatment}} of edentulous patients. The reliability is mainly determined by interaction phenomena between implant and bone tissue, that are affected by loading imposed and the corresponding response of bone tissue. Dental implants biomechanics can be investigated by numerical methods. An accurate characterization of bone mechanical response by specific constitutive formulations is required. Elastic orthotropic model is adopted with regard to the elastic phase of the material, accounting for non-homogeneous distribution of mechanical properties. At this purpose, a procedure is developed to provide a distribution of orthotropic elastic properties over the anatomical region where the implant is placed. Furthermore, attention must be focused on problems that are part of clinical practice and can determine relevant strain/stress, imposing the consideration of bone inelastic response. In particular, misfit and <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> conditions are investigated. Misfit occurs in multiple implant frames, when no perfect geometric compatibility occurs between connecting framework and implants. <b>Press</b> <b>fit</b> {{is due to the fact}} that the diameter of hole drilled within the mandible is smaller than the implant one.

40|$|Axisymmetric {{analysis}} of cylindrical contacts is {{considered in the}} context of axisymmetric assemblies such as shrink-fits. Fretting fatigue induces sub-critical cracks along the contact interface of <b>press</b> <b>fits</b> especially when they are subjected to vibration. The surface and near surface stresses {{play a major role in}} the fretting fatigue crack initiation process. Assuming near surface contact stresses to be largely independent of the actual geometry of components in contact, half-plane analyses and experimental results obtained from a strip configuration are often cited in the literature to predict and understand crack initiation in the actual components (ASTM STP 1425). This thesis starts with half plane and strip models for cylindrical contact such as in a shrink fitted shaft. Different traction profiles underpinning a typical fretting contact constitute a study of different geometrical parameters and friction coefficients. The cylindrical shrink fitted contact is considered using mixed boundary formulation. The different cases of contact such as full slip, partial stick-slip and full stick are considered. A formulation for cyclically varying tractions is attempted using dynamic elasticity. Finally, the problem of cylindrical cracks is highlighted to understand interface delamination in a fiber reinforced composite. Stress functions in conjunction with Fourier transforms are used for analysis. Dynamic potentials based on Helmholtz decomposition are used for dynamic loading. For static loading Love’s stress function is used for axisymmetric problems while Airy’s stress function is used for 2 D problems. Solution procedures for solving traction boundary and mixed boundary conditions are described. Preliminary experiments are described to appreciate the contact stresses and crack initiation in cylindrical contact. Photoelastic fringes in a cylinder under a band of pressure illustrate fretting contact stresses concentrated close to the surface with the core of the cylinder relatively unstressed. Further, some material testing experiments using a specially designed cylindrical fretting rig demonstrated typical features of fretting fatigue crack initiation for providing the theoretical motivation. Fretting fatigue induces the initiation of a number of sub critical cracks along the contact interface of components in mechanical assemblies especially under vibration. The dominant crack among the initiated cracks may grow in size to the critical length in the presence of bulk cyclic loading finally resulting in fracture of the entire component. Fretting fatigue leads to unexpected failure of the component well below the expected life. It is therefore, critical to analyse, detect and control fretting. The blade root-disk joint in gas turbines as a critical example of fretting fatigue has spurred extensive research effort. There is relatively little literature available on cylindrical fretting in shrink fitted joint focused in this thesis. Analytical solutions for static fretting tractions are presented using both axisymmetric and plane elastic stress functions for later comparison. While Fourier transforms in conjunction with Airys stress functions are exploited for attacking plane problems, Loves axisymmetric stress functions are explored for cylindrical fretting. Near surface stresses are of great interest in fretting fatigue research. Although two dimensional models provide general understanding of stresses caused during fretting, these models become inadequate to explain the interaction of local stresses with the bulk stresses inevitably present in cylindrical components. Global stress analysis tools are desirable for estimating the fatigue life of components experiencing fretting. While numerical techniques immensely aid fatigue life estimation they have their limitation when it comes to coated components. Stress {{analysis of}} coated cylinders unveils the intricate influence of the elastic mismatch as well as the width of the loading for varying friction coefficients. Comparison of results obtained from axisymmetric elasticity with plane elasticity is discussed in detail. The validity and scope of relying on plane fretting results to cylindrical fretting contacts is examined by comparing the results obtained for three different traction profiles. Fretting is generally modeled as a stress boundary value problem wherein the normal and frictional shear stresses are prescribed on the cylindrical surface. In reality fretting generally turns out to be a mixed boundary value problem with unknown regions of stick and slip requiring prescribing traction and displacement simultaneously. This belongs to a formidable class of unsolved contact mechanics problems in cylindrical axisymmetric elasticity. The famous spherical axisymmetric Hertz problem has no cylindrical counterpart except in the limiting case of a cylinder of large radius. These aspects are investigated for studying the hub-shaft interfacial geometry. A conformal contact profile is considered to model a shrink fit; the contact pressure is zero at the ends of contact. The case of full slip condition is analysed assuming a frictionless contact. With friction, partial stick-slip condition is analysed. The unknown contact traction is resolved in terms of Chebyshev expansions whose unknown coefficients are solved using Schmidt method. The unknown contact length and stick zone length are determined through an iterative procedure. A rigid uneven undulating axisymmetric hub in total contact over an elastic shaft under full stick condition is analysed for obtaining the near surface stresses for a given value of hub penetration. Even though the stresses oscillate in fretting, almost all the analyses reported in the literature use static formulation. Understanding this need, a dynamic analysis for modeling fretting of a cylinder subjected to harmonic pressure and shear is attempted. The Pochhammer dispersion relation becomes a prerequisite for a dynamic analysis. The results show that the stresses do not decay away from the contact, in contrast to the static results. This shows the propagation of stresses along the axial direction. Further extension of the dynamic analysis to a layered cylinder is also described. The results obtained on contact stresses and contact tractions under the cylindrical contact represent a significant advance to the literature for modeling fretting fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Formulating cylindrical crack problems is somewhat similar to cylindrical contacts. Such cylindrical cracks arise from the debonding along the fiber-matrix interface of a composite. A unified formulation for the problem of a pressurised cylindrical crack as also a pair of 2 D parallel cracks in infinite media is attempted using Love’s stress function in conjunction with Fourier transforms. The results obtained for stress intensity factors, strain energy release rate, mode mixity, crack opening and sliding displacements are compared with that of a 2 D pair of parallel cracks obtained using the unified formulation. The asymptotic situation of a large crack length to spacing ratio is examined in detail. In the case of a pair of parallel cracks, this implies a single crack in mode-I as far as the total energy release rate is concerned while at the same time retaining an asymptotic value for the mode mixity. This unique feature of near field mixed mode blending smoothly to mode-I in the far field is also seen for the stress field around a symmetrically branched crack.
