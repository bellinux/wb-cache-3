40|$|Islam is a {{comprehensive}} religion guiding the lives of its followers through sets of rules governing the personal, social, and public aspects through the verses of the Holy Qur’an and Hadiths, the compilation of the traditions of Prophet Mohammed (pbuh), the two main documents that serve as guidelines. Islam is explicit with regard to using animals for human purposes {{and there is a}} rich tradition of the Prophet Mohammad’s (pbuh) concern for animals {{to be found in the}} Hadith and Sunna. Islam has also laid down rules for humane slaughter. In many countries animals are killed without <b>pre-stunning.</b> Regardless of <b>pre-stunning,</b> such meat should not be treated as halāl or at least be considered as Makrooh (detestable or abominable), because the animals have been beaten or treated without compassion during production, handling, transport, and slaughter. Many Muslims and Islamic religious leaders are not aware of the cruelty that is routinely inflicted on animals during transport, pre-slaughter, and slaughter in many Islamic countries. There is an urgent need to sensitize all Muslims to the teachings of animal welfare in the Qur’an and the Hadiths. A campaign is needed to apprise religious leaders of the current cruelty that occurs during transport and slaughter...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Animal Health and Welfare {{was asked}} to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion {{on the use of}} carbon dioxide for stunning rabbits. Specifically, EFSA {{was asked to}} give its view on the findings of the study performed by the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Spain) and the Animal Technology Centre CITA-ITAVIA “Estudio sobre la valoración mediante parámetros técnicos y de manejo del sistema de aturdimiento con gas CO 2 ”. As a first step, the type of study, critical variables, experimental design, data collection and analysis and reporting methods needed to supply scientific evidence that the use of CO 2 is an acceptable alternative for the stunning of rabbits were defined. These criteria were then applied to the study. The submitted study is not adequate for a full welfare assessment of the alternative method studied because it does not fulfil the eligibility criteria and the reporting quality criteria defined in this opinion. The shortcomings of the study have been highlighted to indicate where improvements are required. To be considered for a full assessment of the welfare implications of the use of high concentrations of CO 2 as a stunning method for rabbits, a study must meet the eligibility standards described herein. A full assessment of the welfare implications of the use of high concentrations of CO 2 as a stunning method for rabbits would need {{to take into account the}} restraining methods, the <b>pre-stunning,</b> and the stunning phases of the slaughter process and the correlation of the study findings with the results of other scientific evidence...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Animal Health and Welfare {{was asked}} to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on two studies performed by IRTA: “Evaluation of the electrical stunning effectiveness in sheep with a current intensity lower than 1 Ampere” and “Evaluation of the electrical stunning effectiveness with electric currents lower than 1 A in lambs and kid goats”. To achieve this, {{the first step was}} to define the type of study, critical variables, experimental design, data collection and analysis and reporting needed to supply scientific evidence that a given electrical stunning protocol of small ruminants provides a level of animal welfare at least equivalent to that ensured by the use of a minimum current of 1 A. These criteria were then applied to the two IRTA studies. The submitted studies are not adequate for a full welfare assessment of the alternative method studied because they do not fulfil the eligibility criteria and the reporting quality criteria defined in this opinion.

40|$|The South African Animal Protection Law, which {{requires}} animals to be stunned before slaughter, allows certain exemptions to accommodate religious slaughter. The {{supporters of the}} Jewish method of slaughter (Shechita), in which animals are slaughtered without <b>pre-stunning,</b> claim that the bleed-out and some quality parameters are better than when the animals are stunned before slaughtering. In this study, the percentage blood loss (BL%), presence (%) {{of blood in the}} trachea (BLT%) and blood splash % in the lungs (BS%), between the Shechita (Kosher) group and the conventionally slaughtered group of cattle were compared. Results showed {{no significant difference between the}} two treatment groups in terms of blood loss, although the conventional group had a higher bleed-out. However, there were significant differences in the presence of blood in the trachea and blood splash in the lungs, with the Kosher group having the highest percentages of these quality defects. Out of 170 animals examined for Kosher, 93 % had blood lining the trachea, ranging from one to over 50 %. From the 141 animals examined for the conventionally-slaughtered group, 97 % had no blood lining the trachea while the remaining 3 % had less than 10 % blood lining the trachea. Furthermore, 65 % of animals slaughtered in the Kosher way had blood splash ranging from 5 % to over 50 %, while the conventional group had only 0. 7 % incidence of blood splash in the lungs. These results show that slaughtering animals without stunning do not improve bleed-out, but increase blood in the trachea and blood splash in the lungs.

40|$|This {{guidance}} {{defines the}} assessment process and the criteria that will be applied by the Animal Health and Welfare Panel to studies on known new or modified legal stunning interventions to determine their suitability for further assessment. The criteria {{that need to be}} fulfilled are eligibility criteria, reporting quality criteria and methodological quality criteria. The eligibility criteria are based upon the legislation and previously published scientific data. They focus on the intervention and the outcomes of interest, i. e. immediate onset of unconsciousness and insensibility or absence of avoidable pain, distress and suffering until the loss of consciousness and sensibility, and duration of the unconsciousness and insensibility (until death). If a study fulfils the eligibility criteria, it will be assessed regarding a set of reporting quality criteria that are based on the REFLECT and the STROBE statements. As a final step in this first assessment phase, the methodological quality of the submitted study will be assessed. If the criteria regarding eligibility, reporting quality and methodological quality are fulfilled, a full assessment of the animal welfare implications of the proposed alternative stunning intervention, including both <b>pre-stunning</b> and stunning phases, and an evaluation of the quality, strength and external validity of the evidence presented would be carried out at the next level of the assessment. In the case that the criteria regarding eligibility and reporting quality and methodological quality are not fulfilled, the assessment report of the panel will highlight the shortcomings and indicate where improvements are required before the study can be assessed further. In addition to the assessment criteria, the guidance also specifies general aspects applicable to studies on stunning interventions that should be considered when studying the effectiveness of stunning interventions...|$|E
40|$|In Belgium, fresh pig meat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{exported}} food products. The total export in 2010 was 702, 576 tons, which is 68 % of the total Belgian pig meat production and is 2 % more than the previous year. These results confirm the rising trend of the past five years. Accordingly, it is very important to deliver good quality of meat and financial losses need to be avoided. Stress and consequently impaired animal welfare might be an important cause of financial loss by affecting pigs behaviour and meat quality. The aim of this research is to study the effect of (1) stressors such as ventilation and environmental enrichment on pigs biting behaviour and (2) pre-slaughter stress on meat quality of fresh and processed meat. Tail and ear biting are severe problems in modern pig production, have a multi-factorial origin and might result in a reduction of animal welfare and productive performance. This abnormal behaviour is investigated in the first part of the study (Chapter 2 and 3). In Chapter 2, the effect of genetics and ventilation on pigs biting behaviour was investigated. All pigs originated from one of two Piétrain boars, originating from two different lines. Genetics and ventilation were found to have a significant impact on the biting behaviour and the appearance of wounds. More precisely, pigs descendant of a boar, which had a better conformation and higher lean tissue content than pigs originating from the other boar, were more vulnerable for inappropriate ventilation, i. e. more pigs showed biting behaviour and more wounds were seen. In Chapter 3, the effect of a sequence of toys (weekly change) versus a single toy (chain) on pigs biting behaviour during the complete fattening period are reported. Toy contact and biting pen mate behaviour were observed on the day of introduction of the toy and five days later. The continuous sequence of seven enrichment objects reduced biting pen mate behaviour and the number of wounds compared to the providing only a single toy. The study also confirmed that not every object was feasible as an enrichment object for growing pigs. Generally, the most toy contact was observed together with the highest biting pen mate behaviour and could be induced by the competition for popular toys. However, biting pen mate behaviour was still the highest in pens with only a chain as enrichment object. Furthermore, habituation still occurred since toy contact behaviour was lowest at observation day five or decreased when the same toys were provided for the second or third time. The ideal sequence should maintain toy contact behaviour without competition in order to avoid biting pen mate behaviour and reduced animal welfare. No effect on growth and feed conversion was seen. In consensus with Chapter 2, biting pen mate behaviour decreased over age since the activity of pigs decreased over age. PSE meat is still a common meat quality defect in Belgium and pre-slaughter stress is the determining factor being multifactorial in its nature. The effect of several pre-slaughter parameters concerning transport, unloading, lairage, pig handling, stunning and season on fresh meat quality based on pH measurements 30 min after slaughter are reported in Chapter 4. Ten pre-slaughter parameters had a significant effect on meat pH after separate introduction of the variables as a fixed effect in the model. Simultaneous analysis of these variables in the global model revealed that the pH was influenced by four main risk factors, namely the mean noise level produced during unloading, the percentage of panting pigs, the use of an electric prod and season. Meat quality in terms of the percentage of potentially PSE carcasses was better in summer than spring or autumn and could be explained by a lower observed <b>pre-stunning</b> stress in summer. The processing of meat with PSE or DFD characteristics has determinable effects on the quality of the end product. As a result, measurements in the slaughter line that can predict the quality of the processed meat product would be very interesting and is studied in Chapter 5. Meat quality measurements (pH, electrical conductivity, colour and/or water holding capacity) were carried out 30 min, 24 and/or 35 h after slaughter in three different muscles: M. gracilis, M. semimembranosus and M. longissimus dorsi. From these measurements, a tendency towards a higher proportion of PSE meat during summer was found compared to winter. Moreover a higher protein, a higher dry matter content, a lower water/protein ratio and a lower slicing yield were found for the cooked hams suggesting a higher PSE prevalence in the summer. These results, in combination with the results of Chapter 4, showed that pre-slaughter stress, temperature fluctuations and weather conditions might be more important factors than season concerning the occurrence of PSE meat. Temperature fluctuations and weather conditions were not measured and need to be considered in further research. Chapter 5 also showed that multiple meat quality measurements can provide more information about the meat quality but are not easy to perform on an industrial scale. From this study, it can be concluded that the ultimate pH measurements (after 24 h and 35 h) in the three examined muscles, and certainly the ultimate pH in the M. gracilis, are good measurements to predict colour 24 - 35 h post-mortem and the meat quality of hams after cooking. The results of this thesis showed that good rearing practices for pigs also involves appropriate ventilation and the provision of enrichment objects that can maintain novelty. If the proposed pre-slaughter stressors are taken into account, i. e. minimal pre-slaughter stress, meat quality can be improved. However, further research is needed to associate good rearing practices for pigs with their final meat quality. This can practically be true when pre-slaughter stress is very low. status: publishe...|$|E
