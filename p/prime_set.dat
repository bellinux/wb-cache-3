30|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} decision making in a severely dynamic competitive environment of the universe has urged the wise managers to have relevant strategic plans for their firms. Strategy is not formulated from one criterion but from multiple criteria in environmental scanning, and often, considering all of them is not possible. A list of criteria utilizing Delphi was selected by consultation with company experts. By reviewing the literature and strategy experts’ proposals, the list is then classified into five categories, namely, human resource, equipment, market, supply chain, and rules. Since all the criteria may not be necessary for the decision process, as they are eliminated in the early stage traditionally, {{it is important to}} identify the <b>prime</b> <b>set</b> of criteria, which is a subset of the original criteria and affects decision making. Utilizing these criteria, a Mahalanobis-Taguchi System-based tool was developed to facilitate the selection of a <b>prime</b> <b>set</b> of criteria, which is a subset of the original criteria for ensuring that only ineffective subcriteria are eliminated and the conditions are prepared for relevant strategy formulation. Mahalanobis distance was used for making a measurement scale to distinguish ineffective subcriteria from significant criteria in the environmental scanning stage. The principles of the Taguchi method were used for screening the important criteria in the system and generate the <b>prime</b> <b>set</b> of criteria for each category. One can use these criteria within each category instead of all criteria for the identification of a suitable institution in training. To validate the proposed approach, a case study has been conducted for 38 educational institutions in Iran. The results demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed approach.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{existing}} prime generation algorithms {{on small}} portable devices, makes optimizations and compares their efficiencies. It shows {{by comparing the}} performances that the bit array algorithm is the most efficient among all the existing prime generation algorithms. The paper further optimizes {{the implementation of the}} bit array algorithm by using an optimal parameter in the prime generations, namely the small <b>prime</b> <b>set</b> for its sieving procedure. A method for estimating the optimal small <b>prime</b> <b>set</b> for the bit array algorithm is provided. The paper gives generalized bit array algorithms which are able to find primes with special constraints, i. e., DSA primes and strong primes. Finally, the algorithms are implemented in a smart card and a PDA for validation. It shows that there is very little efficiency sacrifice for generating special primes with respect to generating random primes. It also shows that using optimal sets of small primes for prime generations will result in 30 – 200 % efficiency improvement. Ó 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|We can now {{progress}} {{much further}} on making an additional assumption concerning {{the nature of}} the <b>prime</b> <b>set</b> P. We could consider two possibilities: i) that P is the set of all primes on an induced subgraph H≺G; or ii) that P is a cut-off set, e.g. one disposes of all the primes of length ℓ(γ)≤Θ. Remarkably, in number theory, if i) is true then ii) is true as well, and the sieve benefits from the advantages of both situations. In general however, i) and ii) are not compatible and while ii) could be used to obtain direct estimates for the number of primes of any length, a problem of great interest, we can show that this makes the sieve NP-hard to implement. We therefore focus on the first situation.|$|E

The important set of subcriteria will be assigned to each main criterion accordingly. The weakness of such a method is that we only compare subcriteria which belong to one type of main criterion isolately. However, in this method, the L 32 (227) orthogonal array was utilized for {{the identification of the}} <b>prime</b> <b>set</b> of subcriteria with minimum number of subcriteria combinations.
