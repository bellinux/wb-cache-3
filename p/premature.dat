5|$|As of 2015, the EEU has no {{directly}} or indirectly elected body. In 2012, {{the creation of a}} Eurasian parliament was under consideration. However, it was considered too <b>premature,</b> and member states have instead begun harmonising national laws and legal codes.|$|E
5|$|At one time, <b>premature</b> {{babies were}} placed in {{incubators}} containing -rich air, but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin {{has been}} proven to {{decrease}} the risk of <b>premature</b> births in women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis during early pregnancy to {{about a third of}} the risk of untreated women.|$|E

5|$|Living in Pennsylvania {{with his}} wife Corina, Williamson retired in his seventies and died on June 12, 2010, in Upstate New York. Some <b>premature</b> reports, based on {{unsubstantiated}} Twitter claims, erroneously gave June 13, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Nancy later discovers she {{is again}} {{pregnant}} with Darren's child. Nancy later suffers a miscarriage. Nancy and Darren later discover she is again pregnant. Nancy goes into <b>premature</b> labour and {{gives birth to}} their son three months <b>premature</b> by emergency caesarean. Darren and Nancy are told that their son may suffer brain damage. During her pregnancy Nancy helped her friend Mitzeee Minniver (Rachel Shenton) after she escaped from prison, making Nancy stressed. Darren blames Nancy for their son's <b>premature</b> birth and tells her he will not forgive her if their son dies. Darren and Nancy name their son Oscar, who {{turns out to be}} deaf. This causes problems in Darren and Nancy's relationship, with Darren wanting their son to go through an operation for his hearing but Nancy not wanting to. The stress results in Nancy becoming addicted to painkillers. Darren eventually finds out about Nancy's painkiller addiction leaving him furious and Nancy moves away for a short time. Darren and Nancy become friends with Sienna Blake (Anna Passey), and let her move in with them as a full-time nanny.|$|E

5|$|<b>Premature</b> or {{spontaneous}} ejaculation {{is treated}} with antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which {{are known to}} delay ejaculation as a side effect.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Reserve publishes data on <b>premature</b> {{death rates}} by county, {{defined as those}} dying below age 74. According to the Kaiser Foundation, {{expanding}} Medicaid in the remaining 19 states would cover up to 4.5 million persons. Since expanding Medicaid expands coverage and expanding coverage reduces mortality, therefore expanding Medicaid reduces mortality by syllogism. Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Missouri and South Carolina, indicated on the map at right as having many counties with high <b>premature</b> mortality rates could therefore reduce mortality by expanding Medicaid, other things equal.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth stage}} can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a risk for <b>premature</b> death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they {{block out the}} {{feelings}} of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.|$|E
5|$|The {{highest quality}} {{evidence}} indicates that circumcision does not decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} penis, harm sexual function or reduce sexual satisfaction. A 2013 systematic review found that circumcision did not appear to adversely affect sexual desire, pain with intercourse, <b>premature</b> ejaculation, time until ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or difficulties with orgasm. However, the study found that the existing evidence is not very good. Another 2013 systematic review found that the highest-quality studies reported no adverse effects of circumcision on sexual function, sensitivity, sensation or satisfaction. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that circumcision did not affect <b>premature</b> ejaculation.|$|E

5|$|A final {{difference}} in Plutarch's account is Horus's birth. The form of Horus that avenges {{his father has}} been conceived and born before Osiris's death. It is a <b>premature</b> and weak second child, Harpocrates, who is born from Osiris's posthumous union with Isis. Here, two of the separate forms of Horus that exist in Egyptian tradition have been given distinct positions within Plutarch's version of the myth.|$|E

5|$|Apollo 11 {{landed with}} less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts {{encountered}} a <b>premature</b> low fuel warning. This was later {{found to be}} the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.|$|E
5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{is among}} the most common complications of prematurely born infants and its incidence has grown as the survival of extremely <b>premature</b> infants has increased. Nevertheless, the severity has decreased as better management of supplemental oxygen has resulted in the disease now being related mainly to factors other than hyperoxia.|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{have offered}} many {{theories}} for {{the origins of}} vampire beliefs, trying to explain the superstition – and sometimes mass hysteria – caused by vampires. Everything ranging from <b>premature</b> burial to the early ignorance of the body's decomposition cycle after death has been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires.|$|E
5|$|Emeric, who {{received}} {{the name of his}} maternal uncle, Emperor Henry II, was born around 1007. His Legend from the early 12th century describes him as a saintly prince who preserved his chastity even during his marriage. According to Györffy, Emeric's wife was a kinswoman of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. His <b>premature</b> death led to the series of conflicts leading to Vazul's blinding and civil wars.|$|E
5|$|FH {{needs to}} be {{distinguished}} from familial combined hyperlipidemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Lipid levels {{and the presence of}} xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. Sitosterolemia and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis are two rare conditions that can also present with <b>premature</b> atherosclerosis and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities.|$|E

5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a <b>premature</b> old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the <b>premature</b> and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
5|$|Gyorko {{married his}} wife Karley in 2011. While {{he played with}} the Padres, the couple lived within walking {{distance}} of Petco Park, the home stadium of the Padres, during the season, and returned to Morgantown during the offseason.

5|$|Hitler was {{concerned}} that a military attack against Poland {{could result in a}} <b>premature</b> war with Britain. Hitler's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, assured him that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland. Accordingly, on 22 August 1939 Hitler ordered a military mobilisation against Poland.|$|E
5|$|Hypertension causes 7.6 million <b>premature</b> deaths {{worldwide}} each year. (Note that salt {{contains about}} 39.3% sodiumthe rest being chlorine and trace chemicals; thus, 2.3g sodium is about 5.9g, or 2.7 ml of saltabout half a US teaspoon.) The American Heart Association recommends {{no more than}} 1.5g of sodium per day.|$|E
5|$|In 1518 Sigismund I married Bona Sforza d'Aragona, a young, strong-minded Italian princess. Bona's {{sway over}} {{the king and}} the magnates, her efforts to {{strengthen}} the monarch's political position, financial situation, and especially the measures she took to advance her personal and dynastic interests, including the forced royal election of the minor Sigismund Augustus in 1529 and his <b>premature</b> coronation in 1530, increased the discontent among szlachta activists.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, 25 {{years after}} the incident, former Gov. Romero Barceló {{admitted}} in a public radio interview that it was “an error of judgment” and “a <b>premature</b> declaration” to laud the police officers, since at that time he believed they were {{telling the truth about}} their self-defense. However, he has publicly denied any wrongdoing regarding the alleged cover-up during the first investigations.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, sarus cranes {{have been}} known to live for as long as 42 years. <b>Premature</b> adult {{mortality}} is often the result of human actions. Accidental poisoning by monocrotophos, chlorpyrifos and dieldrin-treated seeds used in agricultural areas has been noted. Adults {{have been known}} to fly into power lines and die of electrocution, this is responsible for killing about 1% of the local population each year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the dying}} {{stages of the}} conflict, FRELIMO was {{provided}} with a few SA-7 MANPAD shoulder-launched missile launchers from China; these were never used to shoot down a Portuguese plane.

5|$|Mutations in lamin genes {{leading to}} defects in {{filament}} assembly cause {{a group of}} rare genetic disorders known as laminopathies. The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of <b>premature</b> aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which the body is normally exposed. This occurs in three principal settings: underwater diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, {{and the provision of}} supplemental oxygen, particularly to <b>premature</b> infants. In each case, the risk factors are markedly different.|$|E
