5|$|Having {{received}} Nintendo 64DD development kits {{that included}} the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, Iguana Entertainment added an optional high-resolution mode to the game {{early on in the}} development cycle. In conjunction with the Expansion Pak, this mode allows the game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels, a technical accomplishment for the Nintendo 64 at the time. An upgraded polygon modelling technique was used to give the game better-formed creatures. However, motion capture was avoided because none of game's enemies are human. Dienstbier felt that if their animations were motion captured, enemies would look like a person <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lizard in a costume. The game features different animations for different creatures. Unlike its predecessor, where enemies have two types of death animations, Seeds of Evil includes a third and gorier one.|$|E

5|$|According {{to a story}} {{published}} in Century magazine in September 1898, Edwin Emerson, Jr., was <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> German journalist. He presented himself to the German Consul in St. Thomas and asked for the names of Puerto Ricans of German descent whom he could interview. Among the names which the consul gave him were that of the Riefkohl family {{of the town of}} Maunabo. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met 14-year-old Rudolph W. Riefkohl and asked the lad in German if he had a map of Puerto Rico (Emerson had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, however it was decidedly too big for Emerson's use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that Emerson was a spy, and quickly drew another with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. Emerson used the map and it is believed by some that he may have given the map to the U.S. Army Commanding General, Nelson A. Miles, influencing Mile's decision on the landing points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A photostatic copy of Riefkohl's map was {{published in}} the Century article.|$|E

Just like Tom and Bart, Homer and Pepi spend time together doing activities.|$|E

He was taken back to a German command post, where he secretly destroyed the receipt. He convinced a German colonel that he had been wounded in Morocco, suffered from malaria, and had six children, all of which was true, and he was thus exempted from military service, which was false. The Germans let him go. He then made his way to the Crozat Canal, swam across, and encountered a French patrol.|$|E

30|$|Traditional {{security}} solutions such as cryptography and {{intrusion detection}} {{have been successfully}} applied in the computer networks, but when dealing with the internal compromised nodes, these methods are not so effective. The reason is that compromised nodes still have the access to the cryptographic keys that <b>are</b> used <b>to</b> secure the communication links within the network. Additionally, <b>a</b> compromised node <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> authorized one cannot be detected by using cryptographic primitives. Thus, compromised nodes can <b>pretend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> legitimate one from a cryptographic standpoint while undertaking malicious actions.|$|R

25|$|Byzantine {{failures}} {{are considered}} the most general and most difficult class of failures among the failure modes.
