40|$|We {{report a}} {{systematic}} histopathologic study of <b>papillomas</b> {{at different times}} during promotion, correlating the results with those from cytogenetic analysis of the same tumors. <b>Papillomas</b> were induced in SENCAR mice by two-stage carcinogenesis (7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate). Individual tumors were randomly sampled at different times during promotion, and histopathologic and cytogenetic {{studies were carried out}} on every tumor. Early during promotion (10 weeks), most <b>papillomas</b> were well-differentiated hyperplastic lesions with mild or no cellular atypia. No tumors showed severe dysplastic changes. By 20 weeks of promotion, a dramatic drop had occurred in the number of lesions with no dysplasia. Most of the tumors presented moderate dysplasia, and some already showed severe dysplastic changes. At later stages (30 - 40 weeks), most of the <b>papillomas</b> were classified as moderately or severely dysplastic <b>papillomas,</b> and several were considered to be intrapapillomatous carcinomas. This histopathologic evaluation was supported by nuclear measurements performed on <b>papillomas</b> at different time points. Chromosomal abnormalities followed a similar trend. <b>Papillomas</b> seem to start as diploid lesions, but between 10 and 20 weeks of promotion, hyperdiploid cells can be observed in almost every tumor. In some cases the stem line was taken over by aneuploid clones. At 40 weeks of promotion, all <b>papillomas</b> were aneuploid, most of them with hyperdiploid stem lines. A positive correlation was found between the histological and cytogenetic studies, with the most aggressive and atypical tumors being the more aneuploid.

In low-risk tumors, 90 % of the proliferating cells are confined to the basal compartment. In contrast, the majority of high-risk <b>papillomas</b> are devoid of both TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 as soon as they arise; these tumors have up to 40 % of the proliferating cells in the suprabasal layers.

In tumors, loss of TGF-beta is controlled at the posttranscriptional level and is associated with expression of keratin 13, a documented marker of malignant progression.
