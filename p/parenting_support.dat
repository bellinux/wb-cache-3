Through the international project ‘Integrating Disadvantaged Ethnicities through Adult Learning’ (IDEAL) the opportunity was provided to involve in the current study, immigrant women in the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark who are usually not easily reached by <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> services. The exact needs of the women for informal- and formal <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> were examined, {{in order to make it}} possible to adapt <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> programmes to these needs and to therefore make it possible to more easily reach the women, when necessary. From February 2012 to April 2012, semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty women. All the women were found to have a need for informal <b>parenting</b> <b>support.</b> Especially the need for an informal social network and for information from television programmes was great. In thirteen out of the twenty women this need of informal <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> was completely met. The need of formal <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> was found to be much less than the need of informal <b>parenting</b> <b>support,</b> because the women didn’t perceive their parenting difficulties as real problems. Women who mentioned to have a need for formal <b>parenting</b> <b>support,</b> had a need for briefings, information sessions, face to face contact with specialists or contact with a group of other parents to share experiences. That need, however, was at the moment mostly not adequately met. Although the needs of the women differed very much, it is clear that, when necessary, the women are best reached through informal <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> services like an informal social network or television programmes about parenting, provided in their native language.

The analysis shows that <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> builds upon a century-long tradition of for example pre-emptive health care check-ups and services to parents, counselling and parenting education. There are, however, elements in <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> policy which mark a clear deviation from this policy legacy.

However, providing <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> may increase their vulnerability to psychological stress. The {{purpose of this}} mixed-method dissertation was to review potential sources of stress and support in African American paternal grandmothers’ <b>parenting</b> <b>support,</b> use an adaptation of the Caregiving Stress Model to explore associations between <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> and psychological stress via appraisal and mediating conditions, and interpret results in light of potential program and policy interventions. Using an Intersectional approach, I argued that paternal grandmothers experienced <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> as a stressor uniquely due to the intersection of race, gender, motherhood, and the parenting of African American teenage fathers. The purpose of Study 1 was to identify differences in psychological stress based on <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> and two factors affecting appraisal (timing into grandmotherhood and peer time), and whether these factors exacerbated or buffered an association between <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> and psychological stress. Younger, off-time grandmothers and grandmothers who provided less <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> experienced more stress. Having peers who were also grandmothers exacerbated stress for grandmothers providing less support. The purpose of Study 2 was to explore different facets of grandmothers’ satisfaction with their sons’ fathering practices, determine whether these different facets were directly associated with stress, and determine whether they mediated the association between <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> and stress. The results revealed how grandmothers characterized satisfactory fathering practices, how these characterizations aligned with their expectations, and how grandmothers were inconsistent in assessing satisfaction. Conflict with the son about his fathering practices was associated with stress, but did not mediate the association between <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> and psychological stress. The purpose of Study 3 {{was to determine whether}} grandmothers’ perceived relationship quality with sons and psychological stress were associated with stress, and examine whether perceived relationship quality mediated between <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> and psychological stress. While perceived relationship quality was not associated with psychological stress, it did mediate the association between <b>parenting</b> <b>support</b> and psychological stress. The results of these studies suggest that more research and intervention is needed that addresses the diversity inherent in this population of African American grandmothers...|$|E
