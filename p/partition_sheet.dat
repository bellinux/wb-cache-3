Particularly, the effects of the welding current, clamping force, and welding time on the mechanical strength of the Q&P/TRIP joints have been assessed. An L- 9 (33) orthogonal array was used to design the welding tests, performing three replications for each welding condition. Optical microscopy and SEM fractographic examinations were conducted to evaluate the microstructure of the steels and the weld nugget size, and to detect the possible occurrence of welding defects, in each welding condition. The welded samples mainly failed by button pull, with interfacial fracture occurring in very few cases. Moreover, metal expulsion, which occurred in the samples welded at the highest welding current, limits the achievable maximum extent of the weld nugget and the shear tension strength...|$|R

40|$|Measuring the {{biological}} activity of hydrophobic chemicals using in vitro assays is challenging because their aqueous solubility {{is low and}} the high density of bio-suspensions strongly decreases the bioavailability of hydrophobic pollutants. Dynamic dosing by partitioning from a stable polymer has a potential to overcome these limitations. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was chosen due to its documented bio-compatibility and excellent <b>partitioning</b> properties. PDMS <b>sheets</b> were loaded with five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and then immersed in model bio-suspensions composed of membrane vesicles (“chromatophores”, composed of 30 % lipids and 70 % proteins) isolated from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides or phospholipid bilayer vesicles (liposomes) composed of palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC). Method development included the determination of partition coefficients between chromatophores or liposomes and water, desorption rate constants from PDMS to bio-suspensions, and diffusion resistances in both PDMS and bio-suspensions. The release of the PAHs from the PDMS into the bio-suspensions was measured and modeled as a combination of diffusion in pure water and diffusion in a completely mixed solvent composed of water and bio-suspensions. The mass transfer resistance for the release was lower in the PDMS than in the tested solutions, which demonstrates that PDMS can efficiently deliver PAHs even to dense biosuspensions. The contribution of aqueous diffusion to the mass transfer decreased with increasing hydrophobicity of the PAHs indicating that hydrophobic chemicals are efficiently transported with suspended biomaterial. The passive dosing system is versatile and offers a number of applications. Promising are tests with instantaneous response, where the time-dependent effect can be translated to concentration-effect curves but the system is also applicable for assuring constant dosing for longer-term testing...|$|R
40|$|Subglacial {{drainage}} {{plays an}} important role in controlling coupling between glacial ice and underlying bed. Here, we study the flow of water in thin, macroporous sheets between ice and bed. Previous work shows that small perturbations in depth of a nearly parallel-sided water film grow unstably because these areas have enhanced viscous dissipation that leads to enhanced melting of an ice roof. We argue that in the presence of bed protrusions bridging a water sheet, downward motion of the ice roof can stabilize this sheet. Stability results when the rate of roof closure increases faster with water depth than the rate of viscous dissipation. We therefore modify existing theory to include protrusions that partially support the overlying glacier. Differences in the pressure on protrusions relative to water pressure drive roof closure. The mechanisms of both regelation and creep normal to the bed close the overlying ice roof and decrease the icebed gap. In order to account for multiple protrusion sizes along the bed (for instance, resulting from an assortment of various-sized sediment grains), we incorporate a method of partitioning overburden pressure among different protrusion size classes and the water <b>sheet.</b> <b>Partitioning</b> is dependent on the amount of ice protrusion contact and, therefore, water depth. This method allows prediction of roof closure rates. We then investigate stable, steady sheet configurations for reasonable parameter choices and find that these steady states can occur for modest water depths at very low effective pressures, as is appropriate for ice streams. Moreover, we find that multiple steady sheet thicknesses exist, raising the possibility of switches between low and high hydraulic conductivity regimes for the subglacial water system...|$|R

Bondi Beach was {{opened to the public}} as a pleasure grounds for picnicing in 1855. The beach was dedicated as a public reserve in 1882, and Waverley Council built and opened ocean baths there in 1889 and a bathing shed in 1903. Bondi Surf Lifesaving Club was established in 1906. People went to the beach for a picnic, but they seldom went swimming. [...] Waverley Council agreed to the construction of two dressing sheds in 1905 - one for men and one for women (the ladies' shed is shown in the centre photo below) - although it soon became apparent that these sheds were not adequate, as they seem to have lacked roofs. One lady complained in 1910 that people passing in the tram could see those in the sheds dressing and undressing. Consequently, Waverley Council asked for tenders for the structure and accepted a bid for £3,000 submitted by Taylor and Bills. The new sheds were completed in 1911 and were affectionately dubbed 'The Castle' or 'Castle Pavilion' in reference to the distinctive turrets. The new dressing shed is pictured below (far right photo) and was described in detail in the Sydney Morning Herald:Bondi now boasts not only the most up-to-date surf bathers' accommodation in the State but also the Commonwealth. It is provided with facilities for 1000 bathers and building is divided into two sections providing accommodation for 750 men and 250 women.

40|$|Throughout history, {{men have}} searched for {{knowledge}} by observing natural phenomenon, study of literature, thought, discussion {{and above all}} the integrated scientific experimentation. The twentieth century saw {{the advent of a}} large number of new materials and products accompanied by the emergence of new methods for the production and use of traditional materials. The basic incentive sprang from the vast construction programmes, which originated from the necessity for a rapid rise in the living standards and the need to provide infrastructure to the shelter less. Research on building science is much more paying than any other discipline because the buildings are repetitive in character and invoke interest of private and public sectors alike. The research done in other countries can only be a guide line as it is rarely applicable Universally. Each country has to find solution to its problems compatible with loea 1 / 1 iving conditions. During the present century, Portland cements have reached a dominant stage and become the keynote of the development of any country. Since limes immemorial, two types of cementing materials have been in use, non-calcareous and the calcareous. The non-calcareous cementing materials include mud, clay, glue, bitumen etc. While the calcareous category comprises compounds containing essentially calcium oxide, as the basic ingredient. The only binding agent in use, in the local building industry, the Port land cement, falls into this category. It has been all along in short supply. The ever accentuating shortage has been posing great hinderance to most of the developmental works and threatening the achievements of the Annual Development Programmes of the country. This state of affairs has attracted the attention. of builders, engineers and the chemists to carry out applied research for the development of a Iternate conventional or modern cementing materials, from within t he natural resources so as to maximize the use of indigenous raw materials/technology, without jeopardising the safety or the stability of the structures. Pakistan abounds in easily mineable high quality raw materials like gypsum, limestone and argillaceous/calcareous earths that could be usefully utilized as substitutes for Portland cement, which has a history of only about 160 years. Before its advent in 1824, the role of gypsum and lime, as cementing materials, was well recognized/established in building works. Ironically however, these have been totally omitted /relegated tot he background in Pakistan, now-a-days. Their revival, inspite of several inherent plus points and the venerable heritage in cons truction could only be possible, if these are presented in modified/improved low-in-cost forms, duly supported by scientific/technical studies/data. The work Was aimed a t achieving this. target alongwith studying the chemical -aspects of various steps involved. In order to fulfill the responsibility of making the right choice of materials of good performance and properties, a thorough understanding of the nature and behavior of the materials is needed. The study of behavior involves the application of the principles of the nature of materials, under different conditions. The plan of work to exploit and familiarize the use of gypsum and lime as alternate materials of construction, in Pakistan comprised:- a) conducting comprehensive literature survey on the historical background of various cementing materials including the gypsum, lime and the Portland current; b) Finding out the composition of the mortars/plasters with particular emphasis on the ancient, pre- Moghal, Moghal and subsequent constructions in the Indo-Pakistan sub continent; c) Assessing the cuantum /chemical quality of the natural gypsum and lime stone resources; d) Evolving steps, ways and means to improve these raw materials to within the required limits by the physical and chemical purification/treatment; e) Evaluating the quality of the being manufactured gypsum plasters by chemical, physical and mechanical means; f) Studying the chemical and physicc: 1 changes in the setting process of gypsum plaster, the chemistry of reactions involved, mechanism of retardation/acceleration of the set; g) controlling the setting limes of the gypsum plasters without jeopardising strength so as to make these acceptable to the building trade either by making improvements in the calcination operations or by the use of chemical admix tures; h) popularizing the various forms of construction with gypsum including prefabricated low cost <b>partition</b> board/ <b>sheet</b> walling units; i) Improving the brittle characteristics of gypsum in thin sections by fibrous reinforcement/determining their impact, flexural and fire resistance qualities. j) Using gypsum in unit masonry cons tructionand the pi aster works instead of cement sand mortars/plasters; k) Finding out background and the chemical steps involved in the use of various forms of lime in its old conventional putty and the modern dry hydrated powder forms; I) Comparing the strength values and other related criteria of gypsum, lime and cement-lime neat or sand compounded mixes /mortars, vis-a-vis common- in-practice Portland cement mixes under identical conditions; m) Finding out the degree of fineness and the storage sensitivity of dry hydrated lime cement; n) Comparing costs of construction- by using gypsum boards, sheets, plasters and the lime or cement lime mortars vis-a-vis Portland cement mortars/plasters.
