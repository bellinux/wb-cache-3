5000|$|Here it is {{impossible}} to lay down hard and fast rules; for, as the Mishnah says, [...] "it all depends on who is put to shame and who it is that puts him to shame." [...] But for certain acts of violence that involve very little pain and no <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement,</b> but mainly disgrace, the sages fixed a scale of compensation, namely: for a stroke with the fist, one sela or shekel (nominally 60 cents); for a slap with the open hand, two hundred zuzin (1 zuz = 15 cents); for a back-handed slap, or for pulling a man's ear or hair, or tearing off his cloak or a woman's headgear, or spitting at a person if the spittle reaches his flesh, four hundred zuzin ($60 nominal) (B. Ḳ. viii. 6). A kick with the knee costs three selas; with the foot five selas; a stroke with an ass' saddle thirteen (B. Ḳ. 27b, Rashi l.c.). According to Maimonides (Yad ha-Ḥazaḳah, Ḥobel u-Mazziḳ, iii. 8-10), each slap, kick, or stroke counts separately. But he also says (following B. Ḳ. 36b) that these sums are not meant for the full-weight or Tyrian coins, but for the [...] "country currency," [...] worth only one-eighth of the Tyrian.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LLM (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The {{right to}} be {{entitled}} to compensation for injuries sustained in the course of employment has always been an essential component of basic social security rights. Provision is made in the international sphere by the International Labour Organization and the United Nations. In the regional sphere there are standards that apply within the Southern African Development Community, and on a national level the rights are provided in terms of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, and the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, 103 of 1993 (COIDA). COIDA provides for a system of no fault compensation for employees who have sustained injuries or contracted occupational diseases during the course of their employment. “No fault compensation” provides that an employee does not have to prove fault with the employer or any other party in {{to be entitled to}} claim compensation. COIDA’s main purpose is to provide for compensation for disablement caused by occupational injuries or diseases sustained or contracted by defined employees {{in the course of their}} employment. Section 49 of COIDA provides for compensation for permanent disablements. In terms of section 49, the Commissioner must assess the <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> of the employee by applying Schedule 2 of COIDA, which stipulates percentages of disablement for different injuries or mutilations. By “matching” the injury or mutilation from which the employee is suffering to the corresponding injury or mutilation provided for in Schedule 2, the Commissioner is then able to determine the degree of <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement.</b> Discretions are also granted to the Commissioner in terms of which he is allowed to determine the degree of disablement suffered by an employee under certain circumstances. The nature and amount of compensation awarded depend on the degree of disablement that the employee is afflicted with. Compensation for <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> may be paid either in a lump sum or a monthly pension depending on the degree of disablement determined. Problems arise with the application of both these approaches of determining the <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> of an employee. The guidelines in Schedule 2 have been previously described to be applied “mechanically” with no consideration being given to the individual circumstances of the employee. In practice the discretion granted to the Commissioner in terms of section 49 is often not applied judicially, which has led to numerous objections being lodged against the initial amount of compensation granted. The lack of medical expertise at the initial assessment of the disablement, and the “mechanical application” of Schedule 2, often lead to the incorrect determination of the degree of <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> from which the employee is actually suffering. The determination of the degree of disablement is often not consistent with Schedule 2 of COIDA and results in an unjustifiable amount of compensation granted to the employee which holds no relation to the impairment suffered. The core question that needs to be considered is whether and to what extent the employee is still useful for the labour market in the line of his or her employment, and the disablement should be assessed in the light thereof.

50|$|In March 1943, B. P. Adarkar was {{appointed}} by Government of India to create a report on health insurance scheme for industrial workers. The report {{became the basis for}} the Employment State Insurance (ESI) Act of 1948. The promulgation of Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948 envisaged an integrated need based social insurance scheme that would protect the interest of workers in contingencies such as sickness, maternity, temporary or <b>permanent</b> physical <b>disablement,</b> death due to employment injury resulting in loss of wages or earning capacity. The Act also guarantees reasonably good medical care to workers and their immediate dependents.Following the promulgation of the ESI Act the Central Govt. set up the ESI Corporation to administer the Scheme. The Scheme, thereafter was first implemented at Kanpur and Delhi on 24th February 1952. The Act further absolved the employers of their obligations under the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 and Workmen’s Compensation Act 1923. The benefit provided to the employees under the Act are also in conformity with ILO conventions.|$|R

The proposed {{structural equation model}} is tested by using data from a comprehensive health survey {{of the population of}} Finmark county, Norway (1987 - 1988), including 4549 men and 4360 women aged 30 - 62. The findings suggest the burden of physical distress and reliance on <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> benefit to play the key role in reducing self-evaluated health. The seemingly strong labelling impact of permanent work disability, contrasted to modest effect of diagnoses of chronic disease. Moreover, the impact of both these key factors and other important determinants is strongly socially patterned. Positive health related life-style appeared to {{have a positive impact on}} self-rated health, while preoccupation with health had a negative impact. This finding adds some credibility to the suggestion that the growing occupation and fascination with health have some negative health outcomes. self-rated health health status structural equation model...|$|E
40|$|A major {{component}} of the Genetic Discrimination Project (GDP), an Australia-wide study to examine {{the advantages and disadvantages}} for individuals of having genetic information and cases of alleged genetic discrimination, is the analysis of insurers' use of genetic test results. The peak life insurance body, IFSA, had collected data through the Australian Institute of Actuaries (AIA) for the period June 1999 -May 2003 from life insurance companies in Australia regarding their use of genetic test results in insurance underwriting. The GDP negotiated with IFSA and the AIA for access to this data for independent analysis. Applications from 288 individuals who had disclosed a genetic test result included products for cover for death, trauma/crisis, income protection/disability and total and <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement.</b> A total of 81 % (234 / 288) contained usable data for analysis. These cases involved the genetic conditions haemochromatosis (71 %), Huntington disease (12 %) and breast/ovarian cancer (6 %). In 49 % of cases, the genetic test result was described as the only influencing factor and of these, 32 % involved a "positive" genetic test result. Whilst underwriting in most cases appeared to be reasonable, the article highlights several cases involving disclosure of a positive predictive test result for breast/ovarian cancer that required further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Commuting {{accidents}} (CA) play {{an important}} role in many systems of workers' compensation insurance and with good reason, as they generally bring about more serious consequences in terms of <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> and death than ordinary occupational accidents; this usually leads to high social costs. Nevertheless, research investigations aimed at studying the possible causes underlying the phenomenon are not available in medical literature. Objective of the present study is to evaluate whether excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) might influence the occurrence of CA. 463 CA occurred to 411 police officers in northern Italy during the period 1999 - 2002 were collected; 51. 9 % of the subjects were working on shifts, 48. 1 % were non-shift workers. The study was carried out by submitting a self-administered questionnaire to gather information on age and physical characteristics, working conditions, sleep-related problems and accidents occurrence; EDS was measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). A large number of workers (36 %) complained of EDS; a strict significant relationship between shift - work condition and the presence of EDS was found, thus suggesting that CA are significantly influenced by EDS. The shift work schedule adopted by Italian Police might be accountable for the disruption of the balance between circadian and homeostatic factor...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory {{disease of the}} central nervous system, whose etiology is unknown, and which is characteristic {{by the appearance of}} a diverse neurological symptomatology consisting of outbreaks or gradual deterioration and lesions in any location of the brain?s white matter which may provoke the after-effect of a definitive demyelination of the area. The disease affects young people, with its appearance being most frequent between 20 and 40 years of age, in temperate and cold climates, and with a man-woman rate of 0. 46 / 0. 67. The magnitude of this disease {{lies in the fact that}} it is the primary cause for <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> among young adults. We are presenting 4 cases of MS whose initial symptom of the disease was the appearance of paraesthesia in the maxillofacial area, affecting one or more ramifications of the trigeminal nerve, and a progression time varying from 15 days to one year. All the patients were clinically diagnosed, with their diagnostics being confirmed both with magnetic resonance imaging as well as through the study of their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the evoked potentials (EPs).

40|$|Muscoloskeletal {{disorders}} {{are the first}} cause of disability and the second cause of <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> in Italy. Osteoarthritis is the most frequent rheumatic disease and affects about 4 million Italians. In spite of that, data concerning social costs are lacking. On account of this lack we measured sanitary costs of 314 patients suffering from osteoarthritis. A retrospective, prevalence- based multicentric study was performed using a bottom-up approach. The study period was 12 months and referred to 1999. Eight percent of patients didn’t take any drug {{for the treatment of}} osteoarthritis; NSAIDs were prescribed to 86. 9 % of patients, analgesics to 29. 9 %, chondroprotective drugs to 7. 6 %, and gastroprotective drugs to 36. 9 %. Total sanitary costs came to 455 € / patient / year: 122 € were spent on diagnostics, 293 € on therapy and 40 € on management of drug-related gastropathy. Since the costs of anti-inflammatory drugs came to 30 € we calculated iatrogenic cost factor of 2. 3. Moreover, the study supplied interesting informations about prescriptive habits, which differ in Italy from international guidelines for the medical treatment of OA, about patient management, because of hospitalization, which by itself absorbs 1 / 3 of resources, and about physiotherapy, which costs twice as much as pharmacological therapy. At last, data analysis gave the cue for suggestions on changing patients’ management...|$|E
40|$|Statistic {{has shown}} that the number of {{fatality}} and <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> cases due to accident at the Malaysia construction sites is one of the highest as compared to the other sector. Even though the number of industrial accidents decreasing but the benefits paid to the accidents victims are ever increasing. Hence, there is an urgent need to mitigate this problem. There are three basic steps that should be taken namely identifying the hazard, assessing the risk and controlling the risk to ensure a safe and conducive working condition. Implementation of effective hazards control methods may require different approaches due to changing of working environment at the construction sites. Latest technology employed at site had wiped out traditional method of construction and consequently introduce new types of hazard to the industry. Therefore, this paper is intended to identify and highlights the hazards that are most commonly found at our construction sites today. The data collection was being carried out through site investigation using a structured questionnaires forms regarding hazards in construction. The sites vary from infrastructure works, high rise building, housing development, industry building and institutional building. The study determine twelve (12) major groups of hazards in relation to works at construction sites such as power access equipment, ladder, roof work, manual handling, plant and machinery, excavation, fire and emergency, hazardous substances, noise, protective clothing and protection to public. The study was conducted on 140 construction sites and the results showed that the most common hazards for the project around the study area are associated with the protective clothing, noise and fire and emergency...|$|E
40|$|When an health {{condition}} has been identified, {{the question of}} whether to continue driving depends not on a medical diagnosis, but on the functional consequences of the illness. The complex nature of physical and mental impairments and their relationship with safe driving make the availability of evidence based tools necessary for health professionals. The review aims at identifying and summarizing scientific findings concerning the relationship between neuropsychological and clinical screening tests and fitness to drive among people with chronic conditions. Studies were searched for driving ability evaluation by road test or simulator, clinical/ neuropsychological examinations of participants with chronic diseases or <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> impairing driving performance, primary outcomes as fatal/non-fatal traffic injuries and secondary outcomes as fitness to drive assessment. Twenty-seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Some studies included more than one clinical condition. The illness investigated were Alzheimer Disease (n = 6), Parkinson Disease (n = 8), Cardiovascular Accident (n = 4), Traumatic Brain Injuries (n = 3), Sleep Apnea Syndrome (n = 2), Narcolepsy (n = 1), Multiple Sclerosis (n = 1) and Hepatic Encephalopathy (n = 1), comorbidities (n = 3). No studies match inclusion criteria about Myasthenia Gravis, Diabetes Mellitus, Renal Diseases, Hearing Disorders and Sight Diseases. No studies referred to primary outcomes. The selected studies provided opposite evidences. It would be reasonable to argue that some clinical and neuropsychological tests are effective in predicting fitness to drive even if contrasting results support that driving performance decreases as a function of clinical and neuropsychological decline in some chronic diseases. Nevertheless we found no evidence that clinical and neuropsychological screening tests would lead to a reduction in motor vehicle crashes involving chronic disabled drivers. It seems necessary to develop tests with proven validity for identifying high-risk drivers so that physicians can provide guidance to their patients in chronic conditions, and also to medical advisory boards working with licensing office...|$|E
40|$|I {{studied a}} {{potential}} function and underlying mechanism(s) {{of the magnetic}} sense in honey bees, Apis mellifera. A waggle-dancing bee informs hive mates about a food source. Directional information pointing to the food source relative to the sun 2 ̆ 7 s azimuth is encoded in the angle between the straight segment of her waggle dance and a reference line such as gravity or the local geomagnetic field (LGMF). Neither cancelling the LGMF nor shifting its declination affected the recruitment success of waggle-dancing bees, implicating gravity as the reference line for the dance alignment. To study the underlying mechanism(s) of the bees’ magnetic sense, I analyzed lyophilized and pelletized bee tagmata by a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device. A distinct hysteresis loop for the abdomen {{but not for the}} thorax or the head of bees indicated the presence of magnetite in the abdomen. Magnetic remanence of abdomen pellets produced from bees that I did, or did not, expose to an NdFeB magnet while alive differed, indicating that magnet-exposure altered the magnetization of this magnetite in live bees. Following exposure of live bees to the same magnet, magnetized bees, unlike sham-treated control bees, failed to sense the presence of a magnetic anomaly, demonstrating a functional connection between magnetite in the abdomen and the magnetoreceptor, and temporary or <b>permanent</b> <b>disablement</b> of the receptor through magnet-exposure. To test whether bees sense the polarity of a magnetic field, I trained bees to associate a magnetic anomaly with a sugar water reward. I then presented trained bees with a sugar water reward in two separate watch glasses, placing one reward {{in the center of the}} anomaly that I either kept the same as during bee training (control experiment) or that I altered by reversing its polarity (treatment experiment). That bees continued to recognize the magnetic anomaly when its polarity was kept unaltered, but failed to recognize it when its polarity was reversed, indicates that bees have a polarity-sensitive magnetoreceptor. To increase the detectability of magnetite in bee tissues, I lyophilized samples to reduce water content, maximized the signal amplitude by pelletizing samples, and accounted for sample dimensions in data analyses...|$|E
