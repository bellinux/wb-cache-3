25|$|The prototype, {{named the}} Stipa-Caproni, first flew on October 7, 1932. Remarkably ungainly in appearance, the plane {{nonetheless}} proved Stipa's concept in that its intubed propeller increased its engine's efficiency, and the airfoil {{shape of the}} tube gave it an improved rate of climb compared to conventional aircraft of similar engine power and wing loading. The Stipa-Caproni also had a very low landing speed and was much quieter than conventional aircraft.

The requirement was passed to Aichi and Kawanishi, with both companies producing aircraft to meet the navys needs. While Aichi produced a biplane similar to the aircraft {{that was to be}} replaced, Kawanishi designed a gull winged cantilever monoplane.

50|$|The taildragger {{configuration}} {{has its own}} advantages, and {{is arguably}} more suited to rougher landing strips. The tailwheel makes the plane sit naturally in a nose-up attitude when on the ground, which is useful for operations on unpaved gravel surfaces where debris could damage the propeller. The tailwheel also transmits loads to the airframe in a way {{much less likely to}} cause airframe damage when operating on rough fields. The small tailwheel is much lighter and much less vulnerable than a nosewheel. Also, a fixed-gear taildragger exhibits less interference drag and form drag in flight than a fixed-gear tricycle aircraft whose nosewheel may sit directly in the <b>propeller's</b> <b>slipstream.</b> Tailwheels are smaller and cheaper to buy and to maintain, and manhandling a tailwheel aircraft on the ground is easier. Most tailwheel aircraft are lower in overall height and thus may fit in lower hangars. Tailwheel aircraft are also more suitable for fitting with skis in wintertime.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{natural laminar flow}} (NLF) flight {{experiences}} over the period from the 1930 's to the present {{has been given to}} provide information on the achievability and maintainability of NLF in typical airplane operating environments. Significant effects of loss of laminar flow on airplane performance have been observed for several airplanes, indicating the importance of providing information on these changes to laminar flow airplane operators. Significant changes in airplane stability and control and maximum lift were observed in flight experiments with the loss of laminar flow. However, these effects can be avoided by proper selection of airfoils. Conservative laminar flow airfoil designs should be employed which do not experience significant loss of lift (caused by flow separation) upon the loss of laminar flow.

50|$|The {{propeller}} disks extended slightly {{beyond the}} wingtips, {{so the whole}} of the wing (except for the portion above the fuselage) was immersed in the <b>propeller</b> <b>slipstream.</b> This, together with full-span leading edge and trailing edge flaps which were programmed with wing tilt angle, ensured that the wing was never stalled.

50|$|The {{tests were}} carried out at the NACA Langley in Virginia on a model {{situated}} in the free-flight wind tunnel facility. The span of the model's wings was approximately equal to the theoretical diameter of the <b>propeller</b> <b>slipstream,</b> i.e. 70% of the propeller diameter(24 inches cm). Robert Kirby summarized his research on deflected slipstream in NACA Technical Note TN 3800:“The investigation showed {{that it was possible}} to turn the <b>propeller</b> <b>slipstream</b> 90° so that the resultant-force vector of the wing-propeller combination was normal to the propeller shaft and was 80 percent of the magnitude of the propeller thrust. When the model was near the ground, the slipstream was turned only about 75°, but the resultant force increased to about 88 percent of the thrust. The resultant force was reduced about 10 percent when a fuselage was added to the wing system.” He added in his conclusion , “End plates with an approximately semicircular shape on each wing (defined by the upper surface of the wing with the flaps deflected and a tie between the leading and trailing edge) were essential for obtaining high turning angles and efficiency. Larger end plates showed no improvement in the turning effectiveness of the wing system”.|$|E

It had a T-tail and originally a tailwheel fixed landing gear. It had wide-span double retractable trailing-edge flaps, these were extended into the <b>propeller</b> <b>slipstream</b> for takeoff.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} the interaction between the hull, propeller and rudder is presented in this paper. The flow around a ship hull at full scale is first calculated using a RANS solver with a series of systematically generated grids. This grid dependence study is made for the total resistance of the hull and a grid density is chosen. The total resistance of the same ship at four Froude numbers at model scale are computed and compared with experiments. Then self-propulsion tests of the hull and propeller with and without rudder are simulated and compared with measured data. Good agreement is found. By moving the rudder backwards, the effect of the distance between propeller and rudder behind the hull is captured and shows the same tendency as the experiment. Flow fields, such as axial velocity contours at the <b>propeller</b> plane, <b>slipstream</b> deformation, due to the rudder, and limiting streamlines on the surface of rudder and hull are illustrated. Comparisons between two configurations with rudder at different positions are made. It is demonstrated that the present method is promising for evaluating self-propulsion characteristics of hull/propeller/rudder configurations...|$|R

After a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) evaluation in 1938 recommended a number of changes, a total of 431 Finch trainers were built for the RCAF between 1939 and 1941. The aircraft had conventional construction for the period with a welded steel-tube fuselage and composite metal, wood and fabric design features, with Frise ailerons, a flat-bottom airfoiled lifting tailplane and similarly [...] "lifting airfoil" [...] on the vertical stabilizer, cambered into an airfoil on its starboard side only, to offset the P-factor of the <b>propeller's</b> swirling <b>slipstream.</b> The RCAF acquired the aircraft type as an elementary trainer.

40|$|The writer {{points out}} briefly {{the history of}} the method {{proposed}} for the study of steady motion of an airplane, which is different from other methods now used. M. Paul Painleve has shown how convenient the drag-lift curve was for the study of airplane steady motion. The author later added to the drift-lift curve the curve called the "speed curve" which permits a direct checking of the speed of the airplane under all flying conditions. But the speed curve was plotted in the same quadrant as the drag-lift curve. Later, with the progressive development of aeronautical science, and with the continually increasing knowledge concerning engines and propellers, the author was brought to add the three other quadrants to the original quadrant, and thus was obtained the steady motion chart which is described in detail in this report. This charts permits one to read directly for a given airplane its horizontal speed at any altitude, its rate of climb at any altitude, its apparent inclination to the horizon at any moment, its ceiling, its propeller thrust, revolutions, efficiency, and power absorbed, that is the complete set of quantities involved in the subject, and to follow the variations of all these quantities both for variable altitude and for variable throttle. The chart also permits one to follow the variation of all of the above in flight {{as a function of the}} lift coefficient and of the speed. The author also discusses the interaction of the airplane and <b>propeller</b> through the <b>slipstream</b> and the question of the properties of the engine-propeller system and its dependence upon the properties of the engine considered alone and of the propeller considered alone.

50|$|A {{contra-rotating}} propeller or contra-prop places two {{counter-rotating propellers}} on concentric drive shafts {{so that one}} sits immediately 'downstream' of the other propeller.

It had more powerful Dart Mk 301s engines and a unique kneeling landing gear was fitted. In April 1963 the Royal Air Force ordered 31 aircraft and these were designated the Andover C.1 by the RAF. The 748MF first flew from Woodford Aerodrome on 21 December 1963. The aircraft had larger four-bladed propellers than the 748 which required a greater distance between the engines and the fuselage, although the wingtips were reduced by 18 inches to maintain the same wingspan as the 748.

5000|$|The {{tailplane}} is kept {{well out}} of the disturbed airflow behind the wing and fuselage, giving smoother and faster airflow over the elevators.

This configuration also allows high performance aerodynamics [...] and an excellent glide ratio as the empennage is less affected by wing and fuselage slipstream. A T-tail has a better effective aspect ratio (better lift slope), less interaction drag than a cruciform tail, and a more efficient vertical tail, the horizontal tail plate effectively increasing the aspect ratio of the fin by virtue of the 'end plate' effect Therefore, the T-tail configuration is especially popular on gliders.|$|E
50|$|The power {{developed}} by an aircraft engine under any given external conditions can be computed approximately if the normal {{power at the}} given speed is multiplied by appropriate temperature and pressure correction factors.

For unequal intake and exhaust pressures, the correction factor for a small range of values may be taken from a graph in Report No. 45. The temperature rise in the compressor, which has an important part in determining the power output of the engine, can be computed when the pressure ratio, the shaft efficiency, and the heat radiated per pound of air by the compressor and discharge pipe are known.
