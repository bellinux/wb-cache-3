40|$|A {{survey on}} the {{notification}} of information on dangerous preparations by companies to Poisons Information Centres shows that each EU Member State has made different arrangements. This {{is the result of}} missing guidelines in the Preparations Directive 1999 / 45 /EC. The implementation of the 'Globally Harmonised System of classification and labelling of chemicals' (GHS) in the EU will replace the Preparations Directive. This is a good opportunity to harmonize product notification at an EU level and have it legally enforced. The notified product information is used for medical purposes, particularly to provide information on poisonings with these preparations. This report shows that in six countries the Poisons Information Centre (PIC) directly receives the information on the dangerous preparations. In most other countries, a governmental authority is appointed that makes the information available to the PICs.

40|$|A recent concern arose {{over the}} {{treatment}} of uncertainty associated with the K-Reactor axial power monitors (APMs). There are nine axial power monitor rods located at various positions in the K-Reactor core. By comparing the output of one sensor {{near the top of}} the rod to the output of another sensor near the bottom of the rod, the relative ratio of the neutron flux from the top to the bottom of the core can be determined. This ratio is called the roof-top-ratio (RTR) and is the output of a top sensor (Sensor 2) divided by the output of a bottom sensor (Sensor 6). The RTR is important to the safety analyses because when the RTR is maintained within certain ranges, the severity of reactivity transients is limited. There are uncertainties associated with the equipment`s ability to measure the true roof top ratio. It was determined recently that sufficient uncertainty was not accounted for either in reactor operation or in the safety analyses. The concern about uncertainty was addressed for three separate issues. One issue dear with the linear response of the sensors for power ranges planned for K-Reactor operation. The second issue dear with overall uncertainty in the RTR channel. The third issue dear with apparent large ranges in confidence bands for the RTR at low reactor powers as represented by original vendor data. Plots of sparse vendor data indicated unacceptably large uncertainties in RTR would have to be accounted for at the power ranges planned for K-Reactor operation. These concerns were brought to management`s attention through the existing <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>notification,</b> irrespective of their potential impact on the restart schedule. Analyses have been completed to resolve the APM issues described above, and work is progressing to take the needed steps to change operational procedures...|$|E
40|$|Through an {{examination}} of the emerging domain of cognitive systems, with a focus on attention-centric cognitive systems used for notification, this document explores the human-computer interaction challenges that must be addressed for successful interface design. This document asserts that with compatible tools and methods, user notification requirements and interface usability can be abstracted, expressed, and compared with critical parameter ratings; that is, even novice designers can assess attention cost factors to determine target parameter levels for new system development. With a general understanding of the user tasks supported by the notification system, a designer can access the repository of design knowledge for appropriate information and interaction design techniques (e. g., use of color, audio features, animation, screen size, transition of states, etc), which have analytically and empirically derived ratings. Furthermore, usability evaluation methods, provided to designers as part of the integrated system, are adaptable to specific combinations of targeted parameter levels. User testing results can be conveniently added back into the design knowledge repository and compared to target parameter levels to determine design success and build reusable HCI knowledge. This approach is discussed in greater detail as we describe five HCI challenges relating to cognitive system development: (1) convenient access to basic research and guidelines, (2) requirements engineering methods for notification interfaces, (3) better and more usable predictive modeling for pre-attentive and dual-task interfaces, (4) standard empirical evaluation <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>notification</b> systems, and (5) conceptual frameworks for organizing reusable design and software components. This document also describes our initial work toward building infrastructure to overcome these five challenges, focused on notification system development. We described LINK-UP, a design environment grounded on years of theory and method development within HCI, providing a mechanism to integrate interdisciplinary expertise from the cognitive systems research community. Claims allow convenient access to basic research and guidelines, while modules parallel a lifecycle development iteration and provide a process for requirements engineering guided by this basic research. The activities carried out through LINK-UP provide access to and interaction with reusable design components organized based on our framework. We think that this approach may provide the scientific basis necessary for exciting interdisciplinary advancement through many fields of design, with notification systems serving as an initial model. A version of this document will appear as chapter 3 in the book Cognitive Systems: Human Cognitive Models in Systems Design edited by Chris Forsythe, Michael Bernard, and Timothy Goldsmith resulting from a workshop led by the editors in summer 2003.

50|$|Having {{served as}} {{executive}} secretary or {{president of the}} National Conference of State Boards of Health (now the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials) for its first eight years, McCormack was instrumental in developing the framework for interstate cooperation between state boards of health. Without a national health board it was especially important for public health authorities in each state to maintain close communications. In 1883 McCormack, Stephen Smith, and three other state board secretaries formed the Conference to meet this need. For {{the first two years}} McCormack served as executive secretary and from 1886 to 1893 served as president.

40|$|The term {{sickle cell}} disease (SCD) refers to a {{collection}} of hemoglobinopathies (inherited blood disorders) characterized by abnormal hemoglobin and produced through the homozygous inheritance of a sickle cell allele. Heterozygous inheritance results in a condition known as sickle cell trait (SCT). Individuals with SCT have a 50 % chance of passing the gene to future offspring. In recent years mounting evidence has confirmed that SCT is also associated with several rare but serious complications including renal complications, renal cancer, spleen damage, and exercise-related sudden death. In the United States, sickle cell conditions primarily occur among African Americans. While all 50 states conduct newborn screenings which identify individuals with SCD and SCT, no studies have examined whether trait status is effectively conveyed to affected individuals or investigated knowledge of SCT among a large sample of African Americans.

Methods: Data on NNO beginning in 2007 and notified to the 19 LPHAs were extracted from the national database, investigated regarding internal validity and compared to data collected from LPHAs for a study on NNO control. LPHAs were questioned whether they routinely contacted all persons for whom a laboratory diagnosis of norovirus infection was notified. The number of outbreaks per 1, 000 hospital beds and the number of cases within NNOs for acute care and rehabilitation hospitals were compared between counties with and without complete follow-up. Results: The national database contained information on 155 NNOs, including 3, 115 cases. Cases were missed in the national database in 58 (37 %) of the outbreaks.

40|$|Heat {{illness in}} the Armed Forces is {{considered}} preventable. The UK military relies upon dual Command and Medical reporting for case ascertainment, investigation of serious incidents and improvement of preventive practices and policy. This process could {{be vulnerable to}} under-reporting. To establish whether heat illness in the British Army has been under-reported, by reviewing concordance of reporting to the Army Incident Notification Cell (AINC) and the Army Health Unit (AHU) and to characterise the burden of heat illness reported by these means. Analysis of anonymised reporting databases held by the AHU and AINC, for the period 2009 - 2013. 565 unique cases of heat illness were identified. Annual concordance of reporting ranged from 9. 6 % to 16. 5 %. The overall rate was 13. 3 %. July was the month with {{the greatest number of}} heat illness reports (24. 4 % of total reporting) and the highest concordance rate (30 %). Reports of heat illness from the UK (n= 343) exceeded overseas notifications (n= 221) and showed better concordance (17. 1 % vs 12. 8 %). The annual rate of reported heat illness varied widely, being greater in full-time than reservist personnel (87 vs 23 per 100   000) and highest in full-time untrained personnel (223 per 100   000). The risk of heat illness was global, year-round and showed dynamic local variation. Failure to dual-report casualties impaired case ascertainment of heat illness across Command and Medical chains. Current preventive guidance, as applied in training and on operations, should be critically evaluated to ensure that risk of heat illness is reduced as low as possible. Clear <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> casualty <b>notification</b> and surveillance are required in support of this and should incorporate communication within and between the two reporting chains...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Early {{detection}} of colorectal cancer through timely follow-up of positive Fecal Occult Blood Tests (FOBTs) remains a challenge. In our previous work, we found 40 % of positive FOBT results eligible for colonoscopy had no documented response by a treating clinician at two weeks despite <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> electronic result <b>notification.</b> We determined if technical and/or workflow-related aspects of automated {{communication in the}} electronic health record {{could lead to the}} lack of response. Methods Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, we evaluated positive FOBT communication in the electronic health record of a large, urban facility between May 2008 and March 2009. We identified the source of test result communication breakdown, and developed an intervention to fix the problem. Explicit medical record reviews measured timely follow-up (defined as response within 30 days of positive FOBT) pre- and post-intervention. Results Data from 11 interviews and tracking information from 490 FOBT alerts revealed that the software intended to alert primary care practitioners (PCPs) of positive FOBT results was not configured correctly and over a third of positive FOBTs were not transmitted to PCPs. Upon correction of the technical problem, lack of timely follow-up decreased immediately from 29. 9 % to 5. 4 % (p Conclusion Electronic communication of positive FOBT results should be monitored to avoid limiting colorectal cancer screening benefits.

40|$|Introduction We {{report on}} the {{implementation}} of a Radiology Notification System (RNS), set up by the medical imaging department of a major Sydney teaching hospital in March 2010. This study aimed to investigate the views of the medical imaging department staff about: (i) the results follow-up problem encountered by the medical imaging department prior to the implementation of the RNS; (ii) what changes occurred following implementation of the RNS; and (iii) suggestions for improving the RNS. Methods This is a cross-sectional qualitative study incorporating semi-structured interviews with 16 staff (15 radiologists and 1 clerk) after the implementation of the RNS. Interviews were conducted in August/September 2011. Results The reasons behind the development of the RNS were related to: (i) major existing problems with the communication of results between the imaging department and hospital wards; (ii) cumbersome and inefficient paper-based notification systems; and (iii) the absence of standardised guidelines and <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> radiology test <b>notification</b> and follow-up. The RNS managed to free up a significant proportion of radiologist time, resulting in greater efficiencies. Study participants also highlighted a number of areas for improvement, including the need for a 24 -h service, feedback and acknowledgement of test results by clinicians and the standardisation of test management definitions and procedures. Conclusion Test management systems can play an important part in enhancing safe and effective communications between wards and hospital departments. However, their uptake and sustainability will require the establishment of a multidisciplinary and hospital-wide collaboration that includes clinicians. 7 page(s...|$|R
