40|$|Resource intensification, or the {{logistical}} {{approach to}} the mass capture and extension of food resources through storage, is first evident for marine resources of the Northwest Coast during the Locarno Beach Phase (LBP) (ca. 3, 500 BP to ca. 2, 400 BP). <b>Plant</b> <b>resource</b> intensification is evident by 4, 000 BP within {{the interior of the}} Pacific Northwest, but until recently there has been little evidence to support early intensification of plant use in the Puget Sound during the LBP. Test excavations conducted as part of a damage assessment of the Bray Site indicated that the site may contain the earliest known evidence for intensive plant processing in the lower Puget Sound (ca. 3, 000 BP). This finding is supported by analyses of materials previously recovered from the Bray Site by an amateur archaeologist in the 19902 ̆ 7 s. Analyses are conducted for five assemblage dimensions: pit features, fire-modified rock (FMR), macrobotanical, lithic tools, and lithic debitage. The Bray Site results are compared to evidence for <b>plant</b> <b>resource</b> intensification from sites in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon and the Calispell Valley of northeastern Washington.

The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values in animal tissues are {{a reflection of}} the carbon and nitrogen isotope values in diet, and consequently represent a powerful tool to study animal feeding ecology. We measured the d 13 C and d 15 N values in the growth rings on the shells of tortoises in different populations to characterize dietary specialization and track tortoise use of isotopically distinct C 4 /CAM versus C 3 plant resources. Plants using C 3 photosynthesis are generally more nutritious than C 4 plants and these trait differences can have important growth and fitness consequences for consumers. We found that dietary specialization decreases in successively drier and less vegetated sites, and that broader population niche widths are accompanied by an increase in the dietary variability between individuals. Our results highlight how individual consumer <b>plant</b> <b>resource</b> use is bounded under a varying regime of precipitation and plant productivity, lending insight into how intra-individual dietary specialization varies over a spatial scale of environmental variability...|$|E
40|$|Background/Question/Methods Herbivory is {{expected}} to have important effects on grassland plant community structure and biomass. However, the effects of herbivores may be mitigated by <b>plant</b> <b>resource</b> availability, which can influence plant compensatory response and plant defense, and may vary among herbivore taxonomic groups. Although a number of experiments have tested the relative importance and interactive effects of herbivory and <b>plant</b> <b>resource</b> availability in limiting plant biomass, little is known about how different herbivore taxonomic groups contribute to these patterns particularly in terrestrial systems. We tested for the additive or interactive effects of insect and non-bovine mammalian herbivores on plant community structure and biomass in a restored grassland in south-central Kansas. The experiment consisted of ninety-six, 3. 5 x 4 m plots. Mammal access was restricted by fencing while insect abundance was reduced by applying a pyrethroid-based insecticide every two weeks during the growing season. These treatments were crossed with either ambient soil fertility or fertilizer addition treatments. We quantified plant community structure in the central 3 x 3. 5 m area of each plot. Light penetration through the plant canopy was utilized as a non-destructive measure of plant biomass. Results/Conclusions After four growing seasons, we found herbivore access influenced light penetration through the plant canopy (a surrogate for total plant biomass) and these effects varied depending on herbivore taxonomic group and <b>plant</b> <b>resource</b> availability. Under ambient soil nutrients, the combination of insect and mammal herbivory decreased plant biomass and these herbivores' effects combined additively. However, under increased soil fertility, the specific combinations of the different herbivore groups resulted in higher, lower, or equal plant biomass compared to communities with ambient soil fertility. Additionally, the different herbivore groups altered plant species composition and abundance, but these changes were much smaller in ambient than fertilized communities even when adjusted for differences in biomass. These results suggest that different herbivore taxonomic groups can have unique effects on plant biomass and community structure and these impacts vary with soil fertility...|$|E
40|$|Throughout their lifetimes, plants must {{coordinate}} {{the regulation of}} various facets of growth and development. Previous evidence {{has suggested that the}} Arabidopsis thaliana R 2 R 3 -MYB, AtMYB 61, might function as a coordinate regulator of multiple aspects of <b>plant</b> <b>resource</b> allocation. Using a combination of cell biology, transcriptome analysis and biochemistry, in conjunction with gain-of-function and loss-of-function genetics, the role of AtMYB 61 in conditioning resource allocation throughout the plant life cycle was explored. In keeping with its role as a regulator of resource allocation, AtMYB 61 is expressed in sink tissues, notably xylem, roots and developing seeds. Loss of AtMYB 61 function decreases xylem formation, induces qualitative changes in xylem cell structure and decreases lateral root formation; in contrast, gain of AtMYB 61 function has the opposite effect on these traits. AtMYB 61 coordinates a small network of downstream target genes, which contain a motif in their upstream regulatory regions that is bound by AtMYB 61, and AtMYB 61 activates transcription from this same motif. Loss-of-function analysis supports the hypothesis that AtMYB 61 targets play roles in shaping subsets of AtMYB 61 -related phenotypes. Taken together, these findings suggest that AtMYB 61 links the transcriptional control of multiple aspects of <b>plant</b> <b>resource</b> allocation...|$|E
