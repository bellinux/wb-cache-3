40|$|Time and the {{accuracy}} of a lexical decision performed on a letter string (either a word or nonword), presented foveally after a parafoveal <b>preview</b> displayed at 5 degrees of eccentricity and 100 msec. duration were measured. Students of Padova University, 10 women and 7 men, ages 19 to 23 years were subjects. The hypothesis investigated was whether the facilitatory effect, a reduction in lexical decision time due to the parafoveal <b>preview,</b> was tied to global visual information acquired in the visual periphery during the <b>preview</b> presentation. In Exp. 1, eight subjects performed the task either with no <b>preview</b> (No <b>Preview)</b> or with a <b>preview</b> presented at 5 degrees eccentricity in two conditions, <b>preview</b> of the same foveal string (Preview-Letters) and <b>preview</b> of symbols ("x xx [...] . ") of the same length as the foveal string (<b>Preview</b> Symbols). In Exp. 2, 9 subjects performed the task with two <b>preview</b> conditions, No <b>Preview</b> and <b>preview</b> of the foveal string in uppercase letters at 5 degrees of eccentricity (<b>Preview</b> Uppercase). Analyses suggested the reduction in lexical decision time due to the <b>Preview</b> {{with respect to the}} No <b>Preview</b> condition is tied to global information extracted during parafoveal presentation. The reduction in lexical decision time depends on word texture, i. e., letters' identities and also word boundary, in addition to word length...|$|R

5|$|In September 2011, Simon Bates {{presented}} {{a week of}} programmes from South Australia {{as part of a}} promotion in which the station gave away a holiday to the state. In December 2011, Bates travelled to Afghanistan to present a series of shows with British troops at Camp Bastion, which featured Christmas messages from British soldiers serving there to their friends and relatives. Bates discussed the possible future of Afghanistan as coalition forces prepared to hand over control to the Afghan National Army. On 8 April 2012, Easter Sunday, the forces broadcaster BFBS simulcast a two-hour show presented jointly by Bates and BFBS's Rachel Cochrane, with Smooth, allowing family and friends of serving troops to connect with their loved ones. On 27 May 2012, Bates {{presented a}} special programme ahead of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, <b>previewing</b> Elizabeth II's journey along the River Thames on the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell. He was given special access to the vessel and spoke to the boat's owner, Philip Morrell and to composer Debbie Wiseman who was commissioned to write the music for the event. To commemorate the 30th anniversary {{of the end of the}} 1982 Falklands War, Bates broadcast the breakfast show from the Falkland Islands for a week; he explored the lives and experiences of Islanders and reflected on the conflict.|$|E

40|$|In certain categories, an {{important}} element of competition is the use of <b>previews</b> to signal information to potential consumers about product attributes. For example, the front page of a newspaper provides a <b>preview</b> to potential newspaper buyers before they purchase the product. In this context, a news provider can provide <b>previews</b> that are highly informative about the content of the news product. Conversely, a news provider can utilize a <b>preview</b> that is relatively uninformative. We examine the incentives that firms have to adopt different <b>preview</b> strategies in a context where they do not have complete control of product positioning. Our analysis shows that <b>preview</b> strategy can be a useful source of differentiation. However, when a firm adopts a strategy of providing informative <b>previews,</b> it confers a positive externality on a competitor that utilizes uninformative <b>previews.</b> This reinforces the incentive of the competitor to use uninformative <b>previews</b> and explains why the market landscape in news provision is often characterized by asymmetric competition.

40|$|We {{describe}} <b>preview</b> cues, {{a lightweight}} mechanism to assist exploration of multimedia content. A <b>preview</b> cue provides a <b>preview</b> {{of the kind}} of content/information associated with an area (as opposed to an instance) of a domain. <b>Preview</b> cues associate media files and their meta data with the label of a topic in a domain. A lightweight gesture such as brushing a cursor over a label initiates playback of the <b>preview</b> cue file associated with that label. With these cues, users can <b>preview</b> the type of content associated with an area of a domain in order {{to decide whether or not}} that area is of interest for further exploration before having to select it. In this paper we describe the <b>preview</b> cues mechanism. We look at one case study of an implementation of <b>preview</b> cues in the audio domain, and we present the results of a user study of <b>preview</b> cue deployment.
