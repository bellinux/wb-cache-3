How- ever, despite of the new methods and technologies in software engineer- ing such as CBSE, or AOP, it is still difficult to talk about adaptation since adaptation policies might impact the architecture, the <b>configura-</b> <b>tion</b> data, and some extra-functional features as well.

In this paper {{we present a}} general framework for pose esti- mation of unknown objects based on Shafer's eviden- tial reasoning. During learning an evidential model of the object is built, integrating different image fea- tures to improve both estimation robustness and pre- cision. All the measurements coming from one or more views are expressed as belief functions, and com- bined through Dempster's rule. The best pose esti- mate at each time step is then extracted from the resulting belief function by probabilistic approxima- tion. The choice of a sufficiently dense training set is a critical problem. Experimental results concerning a human tracking system are shown...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to reconsider the {{definition}} of syllable in Aristotle’s Poetics. The problems arising from this text can be solved, in my opinion, by reading it in the full context of the twentieth chapter of the Poet- ics, and by comparing it with what Aristotle wrote about syllables and phonet- ic unities in the whole Corpus Aristotelicum. The definition of ‘syllable’ (syl- labé) must thus be read in close connection with the definition of ‘element’ (stoicheion). For Aristotle, the syllable cannot be reduced to its elements (Met. Z 17), because the syllable has a prosodic and metrical structure which de- fines it as minimal linguistic unity. A vocal expression is a prosodic <b>configura-</b> <b>tion</b> determined by the alternation of long and short syllables (Cat. 4 b 33 - 5). This prosodic configuration is, in turn, the basis of linguistic meaning...|$|R

However, very few numerical studies have been performed. Phoenics, a computational fluid dynamics computer program, produced results for several duct configurations and calculat- ed the heat transfer characteristics of each. The <b>configura-</b> <b>tions</b> investigated included a straight, square duct and a rectangular duct with turbulators (a form of turbulence promoters) present. The parameters varied included Reynolds numbers, turbulence intensity and grid geometry. Results for the turbulated duct indicated highly distinct and repeatable flow patterns developed over a wide range of values. The variation of the inlet turbulence intensity had little impact on the kinetic energy. The results proved to be highly grid dependent, which greatly impacted the correlation between experimentally and numerically produced data, for the same configurations, under similar operating parameters.

40|$|Continuous {{controllers}} {{have been}} widely used in automotive do- main to monitor and control physical components. These con- trollers are subject to three rounds of testing: Model-in-the-Loop (MiL), Software-in-the-Loop and Hardware-in-the-Loop. In our earlier work, we used meta-heuristic search to automate MiL test- ing of fixed configurations of continuous controllers. In this paper, we extend our work to support MiL testing of all feasible <b>configura-</b> <b>tions</b> of continuous controllers. Specifically, we use a combination of dimensionality reduction and surrogate modeling techniques to scale our earlier MiL testing approach to large, multi-dimensional input spaces formed by configuration parameters. We evaluated our approach by applying it to a complex, industrial continuous controller. Our experiment shows that our approach identifies test cases indicating requirements violations. Further, we demonstrate that dimensionally reduction helps generate surrogate models with higher prediction accuracy. Finally, we show that combining our search algorithm with surrogate modelling improves its efficiency for two out of three requirements...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a unique {{framework}} {{for evaluating the}} required repetition rate of channel estimation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in slowly continuous fading radio channels. An analytical formula for the interference due to the temporal variation of the channel coefficients is given and verified by link level simulations based on measured impulse responses. The proposed interference model {{makes it possible to}} optimise the training and data interval under different performance criteria. As an example, we investigate the bit-error-rate performance of MIMO systems with zero-forcing detection and determine the time interval after which the channel has to be estimated again, {{in order to keep the}} error probability below a desired threshold. In the second part, the length of the training and data interval is optimised based on the information-theoretical capacity. It is shown that these inter- vals depend in general not only on the Doppler spread of the channel but also on the antenna <b>configura-</b> <b>tion,</b> detection algorithm, noise power and modulation scheme...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} work {{it was shown}} that a class of axisymmetric viscoelastic membrane problems {{can be reduced to}} the numerical solution of a system of partial differential [...] Volterra integral equations. This general method has the disadvantage that a change in constitutive equation requires rederiva- tion of specific details of the governing system. In this paper, a re- vised method is presented in which a change in constitutive equation does not affect the details of the governing equations. All that is needed is a change in the subprogram for computing stress from the deformation history. The revised method is illustrated for the case of the inflation of a cir- cular membrane by lateral pressure, a rheological experimental <b>configura-</b> <b>tion.</b> The membrane material is assumed to be a fluid such as polyisobuty- lene.

40|$|International audienceWith {{the spread}} of new and {{innovative}} Internet services such as SIP-based communications, the challenge of protecting and defending these critical applications has been raised. In particular, SIP firewalls attempt to filter the signaling un- wanted activities and attacks based on {{the knowledge of the}} SIP protocol. Optimizing the SIP firewall configuration at real-time by selecting the best filtering rules is problematic because it depends on both natures of the legal traffic and the unwanted activities. More precisely, we do not know exactly how the unwanted activities are reflected in the SIP messages and in what they differ from the legal ones. In this paper, we address the case of Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) mitigation. We propose an adaptive solution based on extracting signatures from learnt decision trees. Our sim- ulations show that quickly learning the optimal <b>configura-</b> <b>tion</b> for a SIP firewall leads to reduce at lowest the unso- licited calls as reported by the users under protection. Our results promote the application of machine learning algo- rithms for supporting network and service resilience against such new challenges...|$|R
40|$|Reversing with a dolly steered trailer <b>configura-</b> <b>tion</b> {{is a hard}} {{task for}} any driver without {{extensive}} training. In this work we present a motion planning and control framework {{that can be used}} to automatically plan and execute complicated manoeuvres. The unstable dynamics of the reversing general 2 - trailer configuration with off-axle hitching is first stabilised by an LQ-controller and then a pure pursuit path tracker is used on a higher level giving a cascaded controller that can track piecewise linear reference paths. This controller together with a kinematic model of the trailer configuration is then used for forward simulations within a Closed-Loop Rapidly Exploring Random Tree framework to generate motion plans that are not only kinematically feasible but also include the limitations of the controller’s tracking performance when reversing. The approach is evaluated over a series of Monte Carlo simulations on three different scenarios and impressive success rates are achieved.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{describe}} the design and implementation of a general framework for visualizing and editing motion planning environments, problem instances, and their solutions. The motion planning problem consists of finding a valid path between a start and a goal configuration for a movable object. The workspace is, in traditional robotics and animation applications, composed {{of one or more}} objects (called obstacles) that cannot overlap with the robot. As even the simplest motion planning problems {{have been shown to be}} in- tractable, most practical approaches to motion planning use randomization and/or compute approximate solutions. While the tool we present allows the manipulation and evaluation of planner solutions and the animation of any path found by any plan- ner, it is specialized for a class of randomized planners called probabilistic roadmap methods (PRMs). PRMs are roadmap-based methods that generate a graph or roadmap where the nodes represent collision-free configurations and the edges represent feasible paths between those configurations. PRMs typically consist of two phases: roadmap con- struction, where a roadmap is built, and query, where the start and goal <b>configura-</b> <b>tions</b> are connected to the roadmap and then a path is extracted using graph search techniques...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAnalytic multi-compartment {{models have}} gained a tremen- dous {{popularity}} in the recent literature for studying the brain white matter microstructure from diffusion MRI. This class of models require the number of compartments to be known in advance. In the white matter however, several non-collinear bundles of axons, termed fascicles, often coexist in a same voxel. Determining the optimal fascicle configuration is a model selection problem. In this paper, we aim at proposing a novel approach to identify such a configuration from clinical diffusion MRI where only few diffusion images can be ac- quired and {{time is of the}} essence. Starting from a set of fitted models with increasing number of fascicles, we use Akaike information criterion to estimate the probability of each can- didate model to be the best Kullback-Leibler model. These probabilities are then used to average the different candidate models and output an MCM with optimal fascicle <b>configura-</b> <b>tion.</b> This strategy is fast and can be adapted to any multi- compartment model.

Nevertheless, such infrastructures usually require network administrators to perform a wide set of complex planning and management tasks trying to attain adequate network <b>configura-</b> <b>tions.</b> Many of such management tasks can be mathematically for- mulated as NP-hard optimization problems, sometimes involving several objective functions. In this context, this work explores and demonstrates the potential of using computational intelligence methods as optimization engines to tackle complex network op- timization problems. In particular, Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are used to attain near-optimal link state routing configurations robust to distinct operational conditions. As result, network administrators will be provided with a set of alternative routing configurations representing distinct tradeoffs between the considered optimization goals. The robustness of the proposed methods is illustrated by presenting several multi-objective optimization examples able to improve the performance and resilience levels of a network infrastructure. Moreover, the devised methods are integrated in a freely available Traffic Engineering optimization framework able to be used by network administrators interested in this particular research field.

40|$|Gusset-plate and metal-plated {{connectors}} {{are commonly}} used in joints of upholstered furniture frames due to their high load resistance. To successfully introduce oriented strandboard (OSB) into furniture frames, basic data {{on the performance of}} the joints constructed of OSB members is needed. In this study, out-of-plane static moment capacity and rotational stiffness of T-shaped joints with gusset-plates and metal-plate connectors (MPC) were determined experimentally for different <b>configura-</b> <b>tions.</b> On average, gusset-plate joints exhibited about 80 percent higher out-of-plane static moment capacity than MPC joints. The rotational stiffness of gusset-plate joints without glue was similar to that of MPC joints; however, the stiffness of glued gusset-plate joints was, on average, 70 percent higher. Among MPC joints tested, those with two pairs of 2 - by 6 -in metal plates showed the highest unit resistance. For gusset-plate joints, an increase in length of the gusset plate from 4 to 8 inches increased the moment capacity for both glued and unglued joints, but a further increase of the length did not result in any significant increase in the strength. It can be concluded that for the studied joint geometry, the 8 -in gusset-plate presented the optimum design. Comparisons with previous in-plane bending tests on the joints of the same type and configurations showed that the in-plane moment capacity was 4 to 6 times higher than that out-of-plane.

For the second type, various designs for the reduction of PNS problems have been described, including local and whole-body gradient coil systems.

Robot systems face the same challenges as they may have hundreds of configurable parameters. Our work focuses on co-robotic systems, those in which robots and humans work closely together to augment each other’s capabilities. We aim to leverage the user’s knowledge about a system to help determine configuration errors. To accomplish this, users mark runtime failures while observing the system in operation. A marked error indicates the robot “did something when it should not have” or was “not doing something when it should have. ” In this thesis we have developed an approach that identifies predicates involving configuration parameters that may be relevant to each error type and can suggest adjustments based {{on the outcome of}} those predicates.

Those robots must collaborate to reach a sin- gle vertex that is unknown beforehand, and to remain there hereafter. Previous works on gathering in ring-shaped networks suggest that there exists a tradeoff between {{the size of the}} set of potential initial configurations, {{and the power of the}} sensing capabilities of the robots (i. e. the larger the initial <b>configura-</b> <b>tion</b> set, the most powerful the sensor needs to be).

Robots are assumed to be anonymous and oblivious, and the execution model is the non-atomic CORDA model with asynchronous fair scheduling. Our protocol allows the largest set of initial configurations (with respect to impossibility results) yet uses the weakest multiplicity detector to date. The time complexity of our protocol is O(n 2), where n denotes the size of the ring.
