5000|$|A second {{argument}} against retaining the UNSC veto power {{is that it}} is detrimental to balanced political decisions, as any draft text needs to be approved of by each <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> before any draft resolution can possibly be adopted. Indeed, several proposed draft resolutions are never formally presented to the Council for a vote owing to the knowledge that a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> would vote against their adoption (the so-called [...] "pocket veto"). Debate also exists over the potential use of the veto power to provide [...] "diplomatic cover" [...] to a <b>permanent</b> <b>member's</b> allies [...] The United States has used its veto power more than any other <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> since 1972, particularly on resolutions condemning the actions or policies of Israel.|$|R

5|$|The League Council {{acted as}} a type of {{executive}} body directing the Assembly's business. It began with four <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> (Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan) and four non-permanent members that were elected by the Assembly for a three-year term. The first non-permanent members were Belgium, Brazil, Greece, and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Division One of the Hampshire League {{was formed}} {{at the start}} of the 1929–30 season, and Andover were almost <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> of that division, winning their first title in 1934–35. The only slip was in 1936–37 when they were relegated, but they {{returned}} the following year after winning promotion from Division Two. The club remained active during the Second World War, winning the Hampshire League title in 1944–45.|$|E
5|$|India's bid for {{permanent}} member of UNSC is now backed by {{four of the}} five <b>permanent</b> <b>members,</b> namely France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States. On 15 April 2011, China officially expressed its support for an increased Indian role at the United Nations, without explicitly endorsing India's Security Council ambitions. However, recently China endorsed Indian candidacy as a permanent UNSC member provided that India revokes its support for Japanese candidacy.|$|E

5|$|Reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) {{encompasses}} five key issues: {{categories of}} membership, {{the question of}} the veto held by the five <b>permanent</b> <b>members,</b> regional representation, the size of an enlarged Council and its working methods, and the Security Council-General Assembly relationship. Member States, regional groups and other Member State interest groupings developed different positions and proposals on how to move forward on this contested issue.|$|E
5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> of the Security Council. There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, {{and none of them}} were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
5|$|As {{reinforcements}} {{from the}} 9th Battalion began to arrive, Newland {{was able to}} repulse a third attack by the Germans. Reorganising the 9th and 12th Battalions, a combined counter-attack {{was able to be}} launched and the line recaptured by approximately 11:00. The 12th Battalion had suffered 125 casualties during the engagement, with 66 killed or missing. Whittle and Newland were both subsequently awarded a Victoria Cross for their actions that day; the pair were the only two <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> of the Australian military to receive the decoration during the war.|$|E

500|$|In January 1920, {{when the}} League was born, Germany was not {{permitted}} to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. Soviet Russia was also initially excluded, as Communist regimes were not welcomed. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> of the Council, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria. Italy began as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> of the Council, but withdrew in 1937. Spain also began as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> of the Council, but withdrew in 1939. The League had accepted Germany, also as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> of the Council, in 1926, deeming it a [...] "peace-loving country", but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out {{when he came to}} power in 1933.|$|R
5|$|The {{existing}} <b>permanent</b> <b>members,</b> each {{holding the}} right of veto on Security Council reform, announced their positions reluctantly. The United States supported the permanent membership of Japan and India, and {{a small number of}} additional non-permanent members. The United Kingdom and France essentially supported the G4 position, with the expansion of permanent and non-permanent members and the accession of Germany, Brazil, India, and Japan to permanent-member status, as well as more African countries on the Council. China supported the stronger representation of developing countries, voicing support for India. Russia has also endorsed India's candidature for a permanent seat on the Security Council.|$|E
5|$|The two {{principal}} drafters and {{architects of the}} covenant of the League of Nations were Lord Robert Cecil (a British diplomat), and Jan Smuts (a South African statesman). Smuts' proposals included {{the creation of a}} Council of the great powers as <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> and a non-permanent selection of the minor states. He also proposed the creation of a Mandate system for captured colonies of the Central Powers during the war. Cecil focused on the administrative side, and proposed annual Council meetings and quadrennial meetings for the Assembly of all members. He also argued for a large and permanent secretariat to carry out the League's administrative duties.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, the British Army {{suffered}} a severe shortage of manpower. In {{an effort to}} downsize the army and consolidate as many men within as few formations as possible to maintain fighting strength and efficiency, the War Office began disbanding divisions, including the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division. As part of this restructure, {{the decision was made}} to retain division numbers familiar to the British public. On 1 September 1944, the 38th Division was recreated as the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division to replace the 80th as Western Command's training formation. The new 38th Division was commanded by Major-General Lionel Howard Cox, who had previously commanded the 80th Division. At this point, the divisional insignia was worn only by the <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> of the division.|$|E

5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{over the}} Security Council {{resolution}} were initially contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a draft resolution that included automatic invocation of Chapter VII, sanctioning {{use of military}} force if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement. Russia and China were opposed to any resolution that authorized enforcement under Chapter VII without a second vote of the Security Council. After further negotiations, on 26 September the five <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> of the UN Security Council reached agreement on an implementation and enforcement draft resolution. On the following day, just hours after the OPCW Executive Council approved a detailed implementation plan for the U.S./Russian Framework, Security Council Resolution 2118 was unanimously passed, making the OPCW plan binding on the Syrians.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposed}} change is to admit more <b>permanent</b> <b>members.</b> The candidates usually mentioned are Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan. They comprise {{the group of}} G4 nations, mutually supporting one another's bids for permanent seats. The United Kingdom, France and Russia support G4 membership in the U.N. Security Council. This sort of reform has traditionally been opposed by the Uniting for Consensus group, which is composed primarily of nations who are regional rivals and economic competitors of the G4. The group is led by Italy and Spain (opposing Germany), Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina (opposing Brazil), Pakistan (opposing India), and South Korea (opposing Japan), in addition to Turkey, Indonesia and others. Since 1992, Italy {{and other members of}} the group have instead proposed semi-permanent seats or the expansion of the number of temporary seats.|$|E
