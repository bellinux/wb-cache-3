40|$|Modern {{horticulture}} {{is driven}} by quality and yield, which are highly dependent on <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Today the grower can only react and intervene when symptoms become visible {{but in most cases}} with already irrecoverable damage. The challenge is to monitor the plant's physiological status in a continuous way to anticipate unfavourable environmental conditions more rapidly. The objective of the reported research was to develop real-time mathematical algorithms to monitor plant stress as a basis for an on-line early-warning system. Truss tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. 'Clothilde') were cultivated inside two greenhouse compartments. During the growing season several severe and moderate stress conditions such as an increased and decreased indoor temperature were applied alternately in between the two compartments. In total 17 stress experiments were executed, duplicated over two compartments. The stress intensity was function of the outdoor climate and the duration of the applied stressor such that the achieved minimal indoor temperature ranged from 12. 8 degrees C to 16 degrees C for the cold shock and the maximal indoor temperature ranged from 27. 6 degrees C to 36. 7 degrees C for the heat shock. Climate and plant variables were sampled every 20 seconds. Leaf temperature was measured as a plant response and was on-line modelled as function of climate variables with a black-box model approach. The <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> was evaluated by the calculated steady state gain of the black box model.

40|$|Willow (Salix spp.), a {{major source}} of biomass and {{renewable}} fiber production, {{is one of the best}} choices for short-rotation intensive culture (SRIC) in Canada. Since fungal communities play important roles in the <b>plant’s</b> <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> it is vital to understand their interactions with willows and their roles in the sustainability of SRIC. In this study, fungal diversity of the above-ground organs (stem/leaf) of healthy and diseased willow plants in western Canadian Prairies were assessed using cultural and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) techniques. Comparison of the mycoprofiles within established plantations vs. newly introduced cuttings revealed differences in the fungal communities. Ascomycota were mainly isolated, followed by Basidiomicota and Zygomycota. Willow genotypes seem have an influence on the abundance of fungal pathogens and disease severity; among them Charlie (Salix alba x gladfelteri) and SV 1 (S. eriocephala) cultivars demonstrated superior performances. Photosynthesis measurements and biomass compositions confirmed these findings. Potentially pathogenic fungi (Dothioraceae, Diaporthaceae, Glomeraceae, and Pleosporaceae) dominated in diseased or symptomatic willows, whereas potentially beneficial fungi (Coniochaetaceae, Hypoceraceae, Nectriaceae, Trichocomaceae, and Agaricaceae) prevailed in healthy plants. In-vivo and greenhouse assays showed that inoculation with potentially pathogenic fungi induced leaf necrosis, anthracnose and open cankers. However, suppression of the latter was still possible using fungal antagonists. Hence, assessment of stem/bark and leaf fungal communities with respect to willow genotypes, cuttings origin, and SRIC location, is useful for the design of an effective management strategy to increase the productivity of the SRIC-biomass systems...|$|R

To bring this technique a step further towards a practical plant diagnosis technique for greenhouse crop production, we have defined a numerical index named "Emission index" to evaluate VOC emissions from tomato plants isolated from ambient greenhouse air using an open-bottom chamber. The emission index of a VOC is a ratio of the concentration of the VOC in the air inside the chamber {{to that in the}} ambient greenhouse air and the index should be larger than one if the VOC is emitted by the plants in the chamber. Measurement of the emission indices of representative tomato VOCs proved that non-stressed tomato plants in a greenhouse emit n-hexanal, 2 -carene, beta-phellandrene, alpha-copaene, beta-caryophyllene and (3 E, 7 E) - 4, 8, 12 -trimethyl- 1, 3, 7, 11 -tridecatetraene (TMTT), do not emit (Z) - 3 -hexenol, and might absorb and/or adsorb n-hexanol. Another experiment proved that a routine crop maintenance operation, i. e. removal of old leaves from the lower part of plants and removal of side shoots, enhances the emissions of n-hexanal, (E) - 2 -hexenal, (Z) - 3 -hexenol, but does not enhance the emissions of alpha-copaene, methyl salicylate (MeSA) and TMTT.

As {{there is a general}} lack of updated standardized protocols for the detection of most of these bacteria, the most appropriate media for their isolation are reported along with serological reagents, PCR and real-time PCR protocols with comments on their accuracy for the analysis of these pathogens in plant samples. There are many selective media for isolation, especially for Agrobacterium spp., but fewer for Pseudomonas spp. and X. arboricola pv. pruni. Serological techniques are not very useful for these pathogens due to the current lack of specific antibodies commercially available. As to molecular methods, it is surprising to find so many PCR protocols for Agrobacterium species, very few and unspecific for the Pseudomonas species pathogenic to stone fruit trees, and several recent PCR protocols for X. arboricola pv. pruni.

By contrast, bacterial community dissimilarity increased and fungal community dissimilarity decreased in rhizosphere soils of diseased plants, while both bacterial and fungal community dissimilarity in roots showed no significant difference between healthy and diseased plants. Redundancy analysis at the phylum level showed that mycorrhizal colonization and soil texture significantly affected microbial community composition in rhizosphere soils, whereas shoot nutrition status had a significant effect on microbial community composition in root samples.

40|$|Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) is a high-value {{perennial}} {{vegetable crop}} that {{has shown a}} marked decline in productivity {{after many years of}} continuous harvesting. This decline is caused by an increase in both abiotic (autotoxicity, harvesting pressure) and biotic stresses [fungal infections, mainly Fusarium crown and root rot (FCRR) ]. To gain insight into disease development and possible mitigation strategies, we studied the effects of harvesting, time in the growing season, and field age on FCRR development, Fusarium species composition, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities in both a controlled field experiment and an ecological survey of commercial fields. In one experiment, a 3 -year-old asparagus field was subdivided into plots that were harvested or not and sampled throughout the growing season to assess short-term dominant Fusarium species shifts. In addition, diseased and healthy asparagus plants sampled from six commercial fields in the same geographical region were used to assess Fusarium and AMF communities in relation to different parameters. Fusarium and AMF communities were described by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) –denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) approach, and results were analyzed by mainly correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. Results showed that dominant Fusarium taxa assemblages changed throughout the growing season. Harvested plots had significantly more FCRR symptomatic plants {{at the end of the}} growing season, but this effect was not related with any trend in Fusarium community structure. Sampling site and plant age significantly influenced AMF community structure, whereas only sampling site consistently influenced the Fusarium community. Diseased and healthy plants harbored similar Fusarium and AMF communities. Shifts in Fusarium community might not be responsible for different disease incidence because they are ubiquitous regardless of <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> or harvesting regime. The different incidence noted might rather be related to plant physiology, antagonist microbial communities, or soil parameters. ...|$|E

We hy-pothesise that <b>health</b> <b>status</b> can be described as a quanti-tative event, and a poorer <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is associated with a higher probability of developing disease. <b>Health</b> <b>status</b> is influenced by social, psychological and biological factors [1 - 3].

40|$|Phytosanitary {{care as a}} part of {{environmental}} law consists of multiple actions and procedures which aim to guarantee <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> and favourable <b>status</b> of the environment. Mostly, we are talking about plant care related to various agricultural activities. It is necessary to achieve these objectives while keeping the crop yields and its quality on certain level. Regarding the above mentioned, it is desirable to keep looking for new technologies and options which are effective and ecological at the same time. Currently, the focus is on reduction of the chemical preparations use level which have an adverse effect on the environment including animals and plants exposed to their negative impact. As well as the impact on human health. To gather relevant information and data, long- term observations and measurements are crucial since the negative effects may occur long time after exposure to certain chemicals. Very important is also the role of research and analyses which determine subsequent procedures. Based on these inputs the important information may be spread via education and publishing means - this part is essential for enhancing and supporting general awareness of related topics. Public awareness is absolutely fundamental since phytosanitary issues are related to a great amount of people who can [...] ...|$|R
