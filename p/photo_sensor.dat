25|$|The {{standard}} German Army {{versions of}} the G36 are equipped with a ZF 3×4° dual optical sight that combines a 3× magnified telescopic sight (with the main reticle designed for firing at 200 m and bullet drop compensation markings for: 200, 400, 600 and 800 m crosshairs and a range-finding scale) and an unmagnified reflex sight (calibrated for firing at 100 m) mounted {{on top of the}} telescopic sight. The reflex sight is illuminated by ambient light during the day and uses battery powered illumination for use at night. Electric illumination is activated automatically by a built in <b>photo</b> <b>sensor</b> and can be manually activated to boost the brightness of the reticle in daytime low contrast situations.|$|E

50|$|Optical {{format is}} a {{hypothetical}} measurement approximately 50% {{larger than the}} true diagonal size of a solid-state <b>photo</b> <b>sensor.</b> The use of the optical format means that a lens used with a particular size sensor will have approximately the same angle of view {{as if it were}} to be used with an equivalent-sized video camera tube where the actual sensitive target is smaller than the overall size.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} Nikon lens mount, the camera's {{principal}} distinction is its 6.17 megapixel <b>photo</b> <b>sensor.</b> Known as the Super CCD, it {{is unique in}} having its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other DSLR cameras. This allows {{the use of a}} sophisticated interpolation system that produces an output image equivalent to 12.1 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lies somewhere between 6.17 megapixels and the 12.1 megapixel interpolated output.|$|E

50|$|Dowsing in psychic {{archaeology}} {{can take}} on many forms. One of the better publicized methods {{and the subject of}} psychic archaeologist Karen Hunt’s 1981 masters thesis at Indiana University involves dowsing for Electromagnetic Photo-Fields (EMPF) using two L-shaped Ferrous coat hangers bent about 17.8 cm from the end as electromagnetic <b>photo</b> <b>sensors.</b> Hunt stated that the electromagnetic <b>photo</b> <b>sensors</b> detect EMPF similar to a proton magnetometer detecting magnetic fields. Crossed dowsing rods indicated the crossing of an EMPF, which are said to be three-dimensional patterns generated by man-made objects left in place for at least six-months.There are other methods of dowsing employed in psychic archaeology with less inherent scientism than EMPF. Often conventional dowsers will offer their services to archaeologist with varying explanation for their methods.Straddling the border of dowsing and channeling is a technique known as map dowsing, in which a medium or psychic dangles a pendulum over a map of the area of a potential dig to divine ideal locations for test pits or excavation.|$|R
40|$|Uniformity of {{illumination}} is {{of prime}} {{importance in the}} designing of lighting system. Often it is achieved by measuring illuminance values on the target plane at predefined locations using luxmeter. To speed up the experimentation and to automate the measuring procedure, a portable test-jig is developed at work place. It acquires illuminance data from sixteen predefined locations on target surface simultaneously. The data is used for computing uniformity of illumination. The test-jig consists of <b>photo</b> <b>sensors,</b> Data Acquisition System (DAS) and control system. The <b>photo</b> <b>sensors</b> are fixed on a flex sheet which can be rolled. The sheet is spread over the surface whose uniformity is to be measured. The portable, automated test-jig gives the uniformity of illumination quickly. The test-jig is {{used to evaluate the}} performance of three luminaries viz. incandescent bulb, CFL and LED. Results confirm that LED bulbs are energy efficient than others giving more illuminance without hampering illumination uniformity. LED luminaire of 6 W illuminates 1 m X 1 m target surface having uniformity in the range of 0. 4 – 0. 73 for target-source distance of 50 cm – 170 cm. Dependence of uniformity on source wattage and view angle is also reported...|$|R
50|$|Each cell of a CCD {{image sensor}} is an analog device. When light strikes the chip it is held {{as a small}} {{electrical}} charge in each <b>photo</b> <b>sensor.</b> The charges {{in the line of}} pixels nearest to the (one or more) output amplifiers are amplified and output, then each line of pixels shifts its charges one line closer to the amplifier(s), filling the empty line closest to the amplifiers(s). This process is then repeated until all the lines of pixels have had their charge amplified and output.|$|E
50|$|The Digital HERO5 {{was first}} {{introduced}} on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still <b>photo</b> <b>sensor</b> and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed {{to work with the}} newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.|$|E
5000|$|The camera's {{principal}} {{distinction is}} its 23mm x 15.5mm <b>photo</b> <b>sensor.</b> Designated the Super CCD SR, it {{is unique in}} two ways. First, like its predecessors used in the earlier FinePix S1 Pro and FinePix S2 Pro, it has its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other DSLR cameras. This allows {{the use of a}} sophisticated interpolation system that produces an output image equivalent to 12.1 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lay somewhere between 6.17 megapixels and the 12.34 megapixel interpolated output.|$|E
50|$|One can {{reverse the}} {{traditional}} approach based on high speed cameras. Systems such as Prakash use inexpensive multi-LED high speed projectors. The specially built multi-LED IR projectors optically encode the space. Instead of retro-reflective or active light emitting diode (LED) markers, the system uses photosensitive marker tags to decode the optical signals. By attaching tags with <b>photo</b> <b>sensors</b> to scene points, the tags can compute not only their own locations of each point, but also their own orientation, incident illumination, and reflectance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Students {{majoring in}} {{mechanical}} engineering (ME) nowadays are required to study mechatronics at school as mechatronics {{plays an important role}} in modern product that often combines mechanical and electronic functions. However, most students have limited opportunities to be trained with hands-on experience in this field. This paper describes a team of ME juniors to accomplish an autonomous-guided vehicle (AGV) in a project-oriented mechanical design and practice course. An AGV is an automatically controlled vehicle that is often used in material transportation in an automated production line or in an automatic storage and retrieval system. It is a typical example of mechatronics as the vehicle is a mechanical device while controlled by electronics. A team of seven students is requested to complete the process of technical survey, design, analysis, parts machining, assembly as well as testing and refinement of an AGV in the two-semester course. The three-wheel AGV is driven by a DC motor, steered by a step motor, guided by two <b>photo</b> <b>sensors,</b> and position controlled by an array of three <b>photo</b> <b>sensors</b> with digital encoding. The AGV is controlled by a notebook computer with control algorithms designed and developed by students themselves. Students are not only highly appraised at the semester-end exhibition, but also fill with confidence in mechatronics after completing this course...|$|R
25|$|An optical {{keyboard}} technology utilizes {{light emitting}} devices and <b>photo</b> <b>sensors</b> to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and sensors {{are located in the}} perimeter, mounted on a small PCB. The light is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical keyboards require at least 2 beams (most commonly vertical beam and horizontal beam) to determine the actuated key. Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per row of keys (most commonly horizontal beam).|$|R

50|$|Trimpin has {{invented a}} gamelan whose iron bells are {{suspended}} in air by electronic magnets; a <b>photo</b> <b>sensor</b> {{prevents them from}} rising past a certain point, and since they don't touch anything, once rung they will sound with a phenomenally long decay. Another invention is an extra-long bass clarinet. Extra keys spiraled around the instrument allow a microtonal scale. A human blows through the mouthpiece; the dozens of extra keys are played via computer. In 1987 he met Conlon Nancarrow, composer of experimental player piano music unplayable by a human pianist. Trimpin already had the technology to convert Nancarrow's player piano rolls into MIDI information, thus saving their contents from potential deterioration and disaster.|$|E
50|$|The {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in late December 1991 was a serious blow to Leninist groups, but well into the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name RAF. Among these were the killing of Ernst Zimmermann, CEO of MTU Aero Engines, a German engineering company; another bombing at the US Air Force's Rhein-Main Air Base (near Frankfurt), which targeted the base commander and killed two bystanders; the car bomb attack that killed Siemens executive Karl-Heinz Beckurts and his driver; and the shooting of Gerold von Braunmühl, a leading official at Germany's foreign ministry.On 30 November 1989, Deutsche Bank chairman Alfred Herrhausen was killed with a highly complex bomb when his car triggered a <b>photo</b> <b>sensor,</b> in Bad Homburg.

30|$|The {{intensive}} {{red light}} emission of the Eu-shell fiber {{comes from the}} {{two of the three}} emission peaks of Eu. The two peaks are identified at the wavelengths of 592 and 617  nm. The 592  nm emission peak belongs to the 5 D 0 [*]→[*] 7 F 1 transition [17]. The 5 D 0 [*]→[*] 7 F 2 transition generated the 617  nm peak [18]. The hypersensitive transition at 617  nm should be the dominant emission peak [17]. Such an intensive red light emission behavior of the Eu-containing micro- and/or nanofibers is useful for a lot of important applications including chemical sensors, bio-imaging probes, road flares, and <b>photo</b> <b>sensors.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Winners in this {{competition}} aren't determined by whether their car is faster or more powerful, but how accurate their chemical reaction {{to stop their}} vehicle is. This is quite difficult, especially when the load the car must carry and distance it has to travel are unknown until {{the day of the}} competition. So teams must find a method that is flexible enough to fit a range of payloads and distances, and reliable enough so it doesn't fail with real world variables (temperature, humidity, track roughness, changes in elevation, etc.). Winners in the past have had a variety of ways of dealing with this problem, such as an [...] "iodine clock" [...] reaction. This reaction works by using two clear solutions (many variations) that change color after a time delay (the exact time can be found experimentally). When applied to the car, the team used a simple <b>photo</b> <b>sensor</b> that could tell when the solutions changed color, at which point the cars power would shut off by cutting the circuit. While the process itself is somewhat simple, accounting for the unknown variables like the payload and distance is quite difficult.|$|E

In addition, two fabricated devices with gate lengths of 20 and 30 nm are employed for verification.
