25|$|There are {{no major}} ski resorts on North Mountain. Much {{of the land}} on the {{mountain}} {{is part of the}} Pennsylvania State Game Lands, particularly State Game Lands Number 13. However, between 1964 and 1984, a ski slope did exist on North Mountain near Sonestown. The slope featured a J-bar lift. A <b>Poma</b> <b>lift</b> was also brought to the slope, but never installed. There were plans at one point to extend the ski slope to a height 1400 vertical feet, but these plans ran afoul of local zoning laws. As of 2008, the slope was well-maintained.|$|E
50|$|One type of platter lift is the {{detachable}} surface lift, {{commonly known}} as a <b>Poma</b> <b>lift,</b> after the corporation which introduced them.|$|E
50|$|In {{some areas}} <b>Poma</b> <b>lift</b> {{is used as}} a generic term for a platter lift, as this was the company's first and most popular product.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of <b>Poma's</b> <b>lifts</b> {{are used in}} ski areas in Europe and Asia, they have also installed installations in amusement parks, scenic locations, and industrial transportation applications.|$|R
50|$|Leitner-Poma of America, Inc. is a {{partnership}} between Poma and Leitner of Italy that builds <b>Poma</b> <b>lifts</b> in North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Leitner-Poma offers the full line of Poma products and manufactures most of the components at its headquarters in Grand Junction, Colorado.|$|R
50|$|A magic carpet is a {{conveyor}} belt installed {{at the level of}} the snow. Some include a canopy or tunnel. Passengers slide onto the belt at the base of the hill and stand with skis or snowboard facing forward. The moving belt pulls the passengers uphill. At the top, the belt pushes the passengers onto the snow and they slide away. They are easier to use than T-bar <b>lifts</b> and <b>Poma</b> <b>lifts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mountain}} is serviced by three double chairlifts, one quad lift, one triple lift, one <b>Poma</b> <b>lift,</b> two T-bar lifts and a towrope. The T-bar lifts {{are at the}} base of some Expert runs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ski area}} opened [...] in 1949 as Skyline, with two rope tows and a warming hut. A <b>Poma</b> <b>lift</b> was {{installed}} in 1958, and another in 1960. The first chairlift (double) {{was installed in}} 1966 which opened steeper terrain, and the current day lodge was built in 1968.|$|E
50|$|Gore Mountain has 107 {{trails and}} 15 lifts (nine chairlifts, one gondola lift, one J-bar lift, one <b>Poma</b> <b>lift,</b> and one magic carpet), and one snow train. Gore {{mountain}} {{has a wide}} variety of alpine terrain catering to alpine skiers of all levels. Gore also has 12 Nordic trails for cross country skiing.|$|E
50|$|The {{ski area}} {{originally}} opened in 1962 as King's Arrow. It operated irregularly for three decades, mostly as Arrowhead Skiway. Terrain for all abilities was available, served by two <b>Poma</b> surface <b>lifts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Ski & Snowboard Centre Cardiff, Fairwater - {{managed by}} Snowsport Cymru/Wales - {{consists}} of a floodlit 100 m dry ski slope, with an overhead <b>poma</b> ski <b>lift</b> and lubrication roller, to ensure good skiing and snowboarding conditions—even in dry weather.|$|R
50|$|Okemo {{was founded}} in 1955 {{by a group of}} local businessmen. Operations officially began January 31, 1956, with four inches (102 mm) of snow and trails {{serviced}} by two <b>Poma</b> surface <b>lifts.</b> The lower <b>poma</b> cost 20 cents per ride, while the upper one cost 60 cents. The early 1960s saw the introduction of four more Pomas. In these years, Okemo had a reputation of operating with all <b>Poma</b> platter <b>lifts,</b> while other ski areas used double chair lifts to serve advanced ski terrain. The first chairlift, the Sachem double, was introduced in 1965. Along with all of these improvements, Okemo began to offer slopeside lodging starting in 1961. In 1963, Okemo purchased its first groomer, a Tucker Sno-Cat model. Snowmaking was first used, starting with {{the lower part of the}} mountain, in 1966.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ski area}} has {{produced}} over 70 Olympians in both alpine and Nordic events. With a vertical drop of 134 m, {{it has one}} chairlift, two carpets, and one <b>Poma</b> <b>lift.</b> [...] The local youth ski team, the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club, practices at the area, along with various ski jumpers in training, including U.S. Ski Team Jumpers.|$|E
50|$|The {{ski area}} has a summit {{elevation}} of 7240 feet (2206 m) {{above sea level}} with a vertical drop of 700 feet (213 m).

500|$|Black Moshannon State Park was {{the site}} of a ski resort from the 1960suntil 1982. The state {{legislature}} authorized [...] "construction of ski facilities" [...] at the park in 1961, which were operational by 1965. Although managed by the state, a commercial operator was sought as early as 1969, and in 1980 it was leased to a private contractor, before being closed in 1982. The ski area was primitive by modern standards: skiers were lifted {{to the top of the}} slope by one of two tow ropes or <b>Poma</b> <b>lifts,</b> and the slopes had about [...] of vertical drop. As of 2008, the ski lodge, renamed Cabin 20, remains open and is rented out to park visitors, while the Ski Slope Trail is a [...] hiking trail that passes near the former ski slope. It begins at the beach parking lot, climbs Rattlesnake Mountain, and crosses Pennsylvania Route 504near a historical marker for the PhiladelphiaErie Turnpike.|$|R
50|$|The first ski lift, a J-Bar, was {{installed}} in 1956. Until 1957, the ski resort featured only one ski slope, Snakedance. In 1957, the resort installed a second lift—a <b>Poma</b> (platter) <b>lift.</b> Blake was for a time involved in the day-to-day management of the resort, answering the phone and telling prospective visitors whether the skiing {{was expected to be}} good in advance of weekend trips.|$|R
50|$|Hanmer Springs Ski Area, {{located on}} Mount Saint Patrick, South Island, New Zealand is a club skifield 17km (about 35 minutes' drive) {{from the town}} of Hanmer Springs.

50|$|Poma, {{also known}} as Pomagalski S.A. is a French company which {{manufactures}} cable-driven lift systems, including fixed and detachable chairlifts, gondola lifts, funiculars, aerial tramways, people movers, and surface <b>lifts.</b> <b>Poma</b> has installed about 7800 devices for 750 customers worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The Snow Factor indoor snow slope {{features}} a 168m main slope {{with an additional}} 2,500m2 dedicated beginners' area for ski and snow board lessons. Ideal for beginners who can practice on a quieter slope with others on the same level, fully supervised. On the main slope, two <b>Poma</b> button <b>lifts</b> give a drag tow {{to the top and}} can be exited either at the half way point on the slope or at the top station of the 200m slope. Rope tows are used on the beginners slope.|$|R
50|$|Best seen in {{the resort}} of Chamonix as well as gondolas and surface lifts (similar in design to <b>POMA</b> surface <b>lifts).</b> Though in recent years, due to {{the rapid growth of}} rivals POMA and Leitner in France, Montaz Mautino lifts are being {{replaced}} with faster and higher capacity lifts from it rivals. GMM still constructs surface lifts and a completely new design of 4 men chairlift. Many of the earlier installations are in need of modernising: they are jerky and uncomfortable and are an eyesore to the landscape compared to their new installations.|$|R
5000|$|Truckee {{reportedly}} {{had one of}} the nation's first mechanized {{ski lifts}} {{at the site of the}} Hilltop Lodge. The historic Hilltop Lodge was converted to a restaurant in the 1940s by the Crandall Brothers, and eventually became Cottonwood Restaurant and Bar. [...] There were possibly two rope tows and a <b>Poma</b> <b>lift,</b> which was installed in 1954. At the same location, there was a ski jump constructed during the early 1900s that was designed by Lars Haugen, a seven time Olympic ski jumping champion.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ski area}} {{had been unable}} to survive during the WWII years, but in late 1958 the Forest Service {{announced}} its intention to offer a permit for a new ski area at June Mountain. [...] W.C. [...] "Bud" [...] Hayward obtained the use permit and built a full-service ski area with a double chairlift and T-Bar, which opened in February 1961. During his tenure as owner of the ski resort until 1986, Hayward expanded the terrain and facilities including the addition of a rope tow, <b>poma</b> <b>lift,</b> and three additional double chairs.|$|E

5000|$|The CCC-built dam forming Black Moshannon Lake was {{replaced}} in the 1970s {{by the current}} structure. The park experienced major developments between 1971 and 1980. As of 2008, post-war facilities include the park office, six modern cabins, boat launches, showerhouses, and modern restroom facilities. A former CCC-built pavilion is now the Environmental Learning Center.There is a wastewater treatment plant near the dam for effluent from the park, airport, and some private homes.Black Moshannon State Park {{was the site of}} a ski resort from the 1960s until 1982.

The ski area was primitive by modern standards: skiers were lifted {{to the top of the}} slope by one of two tow ropes or <b>Poma</b> <b>lifts,</b> and the slopes had about 250 ft of vertical drop. As of 2008, the ski lodge, renamed Cabin 20, remains open and is rented out to park visitors, while the Ski Slope Trail is a 1.4 mi hiking trail that passes near the former ski slope. It begins at the beach parking lot, climbs Rattlesnake Mountain, and crosses Pennsylvania Route 504 near a historical marker for the Philadelphia - Erie Turnpike.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Doppelmayr, the Poma grips {{are single}} position. In such method, they are pressed down, which opens the jaws to detach the chair, {{and then the}} jaws close and the spring is released. The process is {{reversed}} for attachment. This design allows grip force to be measured as the grip travels through the contour, and for the lift {{to come to a}} stop before the grip is reattached to the haul rope if insufficient grip force is detected. Unlike Doppelmayr lifts that check grip force while a grip and carrier are leaving the terminal, most <b>Poma</b> detachable <b>lifts</b> are not built to operate in reverse because a grip force failed grip can be brought to a halt within the terminal.|$|R
50|$|Aerial lifts have {{a variety}} of {{mechanisms}} to ensure safe operation over a lifetime often measured in decades. In June 1990, Winter Park Resort performed planned destructive safety testing on Eskimo, a 1963 Riblet Tramway Company two-chair, center-pole fixed grip lift, as it was slated for removal and replacement with a high-speed quad <b>Poma</b> <b>lift.</b> The destructive testing attempted to mimic potential real-life operating scenarios, including tests for braking, rollback, oily rope, tree on line, fire, and tower pull. The data gleaned from this destructive safety testing helped improve the safety and construction of both existing as well as the next generation of chairlifts.|$|E
50|$|Since 2002 the {{ski resort}} has had {{continuing}} financial problems. This issue continues and affects {{the operation of}} the area. It suffers from a low population base in the local area and remoteness from major population areas. Sydney is 90 minutes away and Halifax 4.5 hours away. In 2006, the ski hill closed. Many years following that, volunteers from the Ski Cape Smokey Society, a non-profit care taker group, attempted to re-open the resort. After many unsuccessful attempts, Ski Cape Smokey was finally opened February 2011, with very limited parts of the mountain for local skiers using the lower mountain <b>poma</b> <b>lift.</b> Without snow making it cannot operate in the profitable Christmas/New Year holiday period.|$|E
50|$|During winter, {{the popular}} {{viewpoint}} known as Hurricane Ridge offers numerous winter sports activities. The Hurricane Ridge Winter Sports Club operates Hurricane Ridge Ski and Snowboard Area, a not for profit alpine ski area which offers ski lessons, rentals, and inexpensive lift tickets. The small alpine area is serviced by two rope tows and one <b>poma</b> <b>lift.</b> A {{large amount of}} backcountry terrain is accessible for skiers, snowboarders, and other backcountry travelers when the Hurricane Ridge Road is open. Winter access to the Hurricane Ridge Road is currently limited to Friday through Sunday weather permitting. The Hurricane Ridge Winter Access Coalition is a community effort to restore seven-day-a-week access via the Hurricane Ridge Road (the only park road accessing alpine terrain in winter).|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the Summit Triple lift (1995) was {{replaced}} by a brand new SkyTrac quad chairlift with a moving carpet loading area. The new lift will run at a faster speed than typical fixed grip lifts with a moving carpet that moves skiers into the loading area and assists with loading onto the faster moving chairs. The old <b>Poma</b> Summit Triple <b>lift</b> is being saved for a future install elsewhere on the mountain.|$|R
2500|$|The Lake District Ski Club, {{operate a}} <b>poma</b> style ski <b>lift</b> from pylons on Raise when weather {{conditions}} {{are suitable for}} skiing or snowboarding. The lift is over 300 metres long and the runs are in a natural snow bowl called Savages Gulley where snow drifts form. The Lake District Ski Club has operated for 75 years in 2011 and recently expanded their facilities to include the [...] "Powder room" [...] lavatory facilities attached to the engine hut.|$|R
50|$|For {{the winter}} of 2009, Selwyn Snow Resort {{comprised}} 45 ha, with 11 lifts including chair <b>lifts,</b> <b>pomas,</b> t-bars, a platter and a rope tow (as well as one snow tube lift). The resort also advertises 45 km of marked cross country trails. Selwyn is well suited to families and first timers, with 88% of terrain catering to beginners and intermediates, however the steeper gradient of the Racecourse Run provides some more challenging terrain for advanced skiers and boarders. In 2007 some terrain park features {{were added to the}} blue run known as Township.|$|R
