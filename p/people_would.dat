5|$|According {{to a local}} atlas, Mountain Grove Campground was semicircular in shape, with avenues {{radiating}} out {{towards the}} sides. An open space for worshiping was on the camp meeting site, and it was surrounded by more tents. When this area was filled up, more <b>people</b> <b>would</b> set up tents along the avenues that radiated outward from the camp.|$|E
5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such <b>people</b> <b>would</b> try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and <b>people</b> <b>would</b> acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore.|$|E

5|$|In ancient China and Korea, {{hair was}} {{regarded}} as a precious legacy from parents. Most <b>people</b> <b>would</b> never cut their hair after they became adults, and cutting off one's hair was a penalty for minor crimes. Both men and women would coil up their hair and many hair-coiling styles were developed.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have {{consumed}} {{at least}} 70% {{of their daily}} calories {{in the form of}} cereals and legumes. Puls (pottage) was considered the aboriginal food of the Romans. The basic grain pottage could be elaborated with chopped vegetables, bits of meat, cheese, or herbs to produce dishes similar to polenta or risotto.|$|E

5|$|ATLs {{story is}} {{loosely based on}} {{material}} by producers Dallas Austin and Tionne Watkins, who set out to describe their experiences growing up {{on the south side}} of Atlanta in the early '90s. Watkins and producer Jody Gerson approached James Lassiter with the idea of a story about a skating rink that many involved in the Atlanta music scene had started at, and how all of these <b>people</b> <b>would</b> attend the rink every Sunday night in their teen years.|$|E
5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E
50|$|Abaoji's {{success was}} {{in his ability to}} {{introduce}} innovations to Khitan society. Arguably the most important was the introduction of a dual administrative system in which nomadic steppe <b>peoples</b> <b>would</b> be governed by steppe traditions and sedentary populations in conquered Bohai and north China would be governed by a civil bureaucracy drawn largely on Chinese methods. While this did not receive universal support from tribal leaders due to the erosion of their own powers, this became the model that later steppe <b>peoples</b> <b>would</b> use to govern their diverse empires.|$|R

5|$|Camp {{meetings}} at the Mountain Grove Campground was held for seven to ten days each August. Several thousand <b>people</b> <b>would</b> attend the camp each year. By 1878, campground attendance on Saturdays had reached 4000 to 5000 people. The percentage of attendees who stayed for the whole duration of the camp meeting, as opposed to only part of it, also decreased during the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% {{of young people who}} may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young <b>people</b> <b>would</b> remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|Gaga further {{clarified}} {{the ideas}} behind The Fame, and her inspirations and visions for the album. She {{believed that the}} most important thing missing from contemporary pop music was the combination of the visual imagery of the artist with the music. Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> take notice of the performance art, which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a massive}} {{outbreak}} of famine in Northern China, starved out Northern Chinese marched out of {{most parts of}} modern-day Henan into Southern China for refuge. These groups of <b>peoples</b> <b>would</b> later be known as [...] "Hakkas".|$|R

50|$|What is {{particularly}} {{interesting about the}} Cowboy Wash site is that {{it appears to have}} been abandoned very quickly. Generally, the ancient <b>peoples</b> <b>would</b> have taken all salvageable materials with them, yet the excavators found everything had been left behind.|$|R
5|$|Historically the King of the Welsh <b>people</b> <b>would</b> travel, {{with his}} court, in a circuit, {{demanding}} tribute {{in the form}} of food from communities they visited as they went. The tribute was codified in the Laws of Hywel Dda, showing that people lived on beer, bread, meat and dairy products, with few vegetables beyond cabbages and leeks. The laws show how much value was put on different parts of Welsh life at the time, for example that wealth was measured in cattle; they also show that the court included hunters, who would be restricted to seasonal hunting sessions.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Luang Pu Sodh made an {{announcement}} {{that he would}} die soon, and instructed his students to continue their duties without him, especially to propagate Dhammakaya meditation. Two years later, {{he was diagnosed with}} hypertension. Luang Pu Sodh died in 1959. His body was not cremated, but embalmed, so that after his death <b>people</b> <b>would</b> still come and support Wat Paknam. In Wat Phra Dhammakaya a memorial hall was built in honor of Luang Pu Sodh, and in Wat Paknam, a charity foundation was started in his name.|$|E
5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones. As {{he stood in the}} circle, he had two thoughts: that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be talking about this in 100 years, {{and that it would be}} over when it rained. His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, triggering a higher level of consciousness.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{earliest}} times, the items which were prized by the peoples included jars, which were {{a symbol of}} wealth throughout South Asia, and later metal, salt and tobacco.

The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 <b>people</b> <b>would</b> die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years. These figures did not include the casualties from Flight 706.|$|E
5|$|Just {{months into}} his reign, Edward forced a {{constitutional}} crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Wallis Simpson. Although legally Edward could have married Simpson, as King {{he was also}} head of the Church of England, which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the <b>people</b> <b>would</b> never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage. As a constitutional monarch, Edward was obliged to accept ministerial advice.|$|E
5|$|Kamadhenu-Surabhi's {{residence}} varies {{depending on}} different scriptures. The Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata tells how she was given the ownership of Goloka, the cow-heaven located above the three worlds (heaven, earth and netherworld): the daughter of Daksha, Surabhi went to Mount Kailash and worshipped Brahma for 10,000 years. The pleased god conferred goddess-hood on the cow and decreed that all <b>people</b> <b>would</b> worship her and her children – cows. He also gave her a world called Goloka, while her daughters would reside on earth among humans.|$|E
