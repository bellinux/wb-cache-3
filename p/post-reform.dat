The rate of poverty decline has not been higher in the <b>post-reform</b> period (since 1991).

40|$|Short-term {{contracts}} {{have been}} deployed rapidly across Europe since the mid 90 s. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate both theoretically and empirically the effects of short-term contracts on individual welfare. By comparing the economy pre and <b>post-reforms,</b> we study the evolution of frms' and workers' dynamics, we identify the determinants behind the frms' decision to hire short-term, and we quantify the change in welfare for different categories of workers. We find that more productive workers fare better, while junior and less productive workers pay the cost of higher turnover and lower wages, conforming the presence of a dual economy. The study of potential policy interventions allows us to conclude that the longer the short-term contracts, the better the labor market outcomes. In addition, the comparison of the models pre and <b>post-reforms</b> with an American-style economy with a unique exible contract, seems to suggest that exibility has positive effects on the labor market for junior workers, but not necessarily on the one for senior workers...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the course}} of this report, we analyse both quantitatively and qualitatively the impact of the 2010 ­ 2013 reforms {{undertaken}} at the former Patents County Court (PCC), now the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court (IPEC). The reforms introduced a number of changes staggered over the period 2010 ­ 2013, including a cap on recoverable costs and damages, a reduction of the length as well as complexity of court actions, and a reconstitution of the PCC as the IPEC. In our quantitative case counts we find {{that there has been a}} large increase in the quantity of cases filed at the IPEC, <b>post-reforms,</b> while through a comparative study of the High Court (HC) and Patents Court (PHC) we show that with the exception of patent cases, there has not been a corresponding increase in cases at the higher level. We find quantitative and qualitative evidence that the costs cap and active case management by the IPEC judge have been the most influential reforms with respect to the large increase in cases filed at the IPEC <b>post-reforms.</b> We also note that case filings by SMEs have increased substantially following the reforms, fulfilling one of the key aims of the reforms. Importantly, we find that this effect is driven by changes at the extensive (more claimants) and intensive (more cases per claimant) margins of litigation behaviour at the IPEC. Finally, we provide a theoretical model that allows us to gauge the effect of the reforms on those IP disputes that never reach a court. Our theoretical predictions suggest that in addition to encouraging more IPEC case filings, the reforms have had the effect of increasing the quantity of out-of-court settlements as well...|$|R
2500|$|A study {{published}} in The American Journal of Medicine, [...] "Medical Bankruptcy in Massachusetts: Has Health Reform Made a Difference?", compared bankruptcy filers from 2007, before reforms were implemented, to those filing in the <b>post-reform</b> 2009 environment to see what role medical costs played. The study found that: 1) From 2007 to 2009, {{the total number of}} medical bankruptcies (defined as due to unpaid medical bills or to loss of income due to illness, with no distinction between those causes) in Massachusetts increased by more than one third, from 7,504 to 10,093; and 2) Illness and medical costs contributed to 59.3% of bankruptcies in 2007 and 52.9% in 2009. The researchers note that the financial crisis beginning in 2008 likely contributed to the increased number of bankruptcies, and Massachusetts' increase in medical bankruptcies over the 2007–2009 period was nevertheless below the national average rate of increase. Still, the researchers explain that health costs continued to go up over the period in question, and their overall findings are “incompatible with claims that health reform has cut medical bankruptcy filings significantly.” A 2015 study found that the law had [...] "modest effects" [...] on costs of outpatient care for people who were already insured.|$|E

Financial sector reforms in India are also aimed at improving efficiency, productivity and profitability of banks via increased competitiveness. An assessment based on a fairly general framework in the Indian context has found that cost inefficiency of domestic banks in the <b>post-reforms</b> period is not very high. Data also supports a declining trend in inefficiency over time. Slightly higher average inefficiency in public sector banks points to a need for granting more autonomy and instituting a pro-per incentive structure. Branch rationalisation may also lead to lowering their costs. However, as methodology for efficiency estimation is not fully settled, the need for testing robustness of the results through alternative formulations is stressed...|$|R

Apart from ownership, this paper takes into account firm heterogeneity and various other firm-specific factors while understanding firm-level export performance.

Rather firms acquire internationally competitiveness from imported raw materials, foreign technical know-how and local R&D. Further, firm heterogeneity {{measured in terms of}} sunk costs significantly impacts on firm-level export intensity.
