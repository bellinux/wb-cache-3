5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} {{of the city of}} Tapiocapolis was visually based on the city of Belo Horizonte in Brazil. His {{depiction of}} a public sculpture in the city was inspired by the work of sculptor Marcel Arnould, while the <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> he designed for the Tapiocapolis hotel in which Tintin and Haddock stay are {{based on the work of}} Serge Poliakoff.|$|E
5|$|Paintings {{of early}} modernist {{painters}} such as Damián Domingo often {{still had a}} religious association but the art of Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement. The first Philippine national artist Fernando Amorsolo used post-modernism to produce <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as Fernando Zóbel used both realistic and abstract techniques.|$|E

5|$|The English artist Henry Stacy Marks (1829-1888) took {{a special}} {{interest}} in birds and many of his paintings were based on birds in the London Zoo and a number of his works included depictions of greater adjutants. Some of his <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> include adjutants are Convocation (1878), Science is Measurement (1879), Half hours at the Zoo and An Episcopal Visitation.|$|E
5|$|The Rocketeer's {{attack on}} the Nazi Zeppelin was filmed near Six Flags Magic Mountain {{amusement}} park in Valencia, California over four months through pick-ups. Remaining visual effects footage took place at ILM's headquarters in San Rafael and Hamilton Air Force Base. There, they constructed a 12ft scale model of the Zeppelin, which was photographed against matte <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> resembled 1938 Los Angeles for intercutting purposes. The Zeppelin explosion special effect alone cost $400,000.|$|E
5|$|The book, {{illustrated}} artistically by Abbott Thayer, {{sets out}} the controversial thesis that all animal coloration has the evolutionary purpose of camouflage. Thayer rejected Charles Darwin's theory of sexual selection, arguing in words and <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> even such conspicuous animal features as the peacock's tail or the brilliant pink of flamingoes or roseate spoonbills were effective as camouflage {{in the right}} light.|$|E

5|$|Willie Gillis, Jr. (more {{commonly}} simply Willie Gillis) is {{a fictional}} character created by Norman Rockwell {{for a series}} of World War II <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> appeared on the covers of eleven issues of The Saturday Evening Post between 1941 and 1946. With the rank of private, Gillis was an everyman whose career was tracked {{on the cover of the}} Post from induction through discharge without being depicted in battle. Gillis and his girlfriend were modeled by two of Rockwell's acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme is art as a subject, but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.|$|E

5|$|It {{is one of}} the {{fourteen}} Black <b>Paintings</b> <b>that</b> Goya applied in oil on the plaster walls of his house, the Quinta del Sordo. The paintings were completed in secret: he did not title any of the works or leave record of his intentions in creating them. Absent of fact, Witches' Sabbath is generally seen by art historians as a satire on the credulity of the age, a condemnation of superstition and the witch trials of the Spanish Inquisition. As with the other works in the group, Witches' Sabbath reflects its painter's disillusionment and can be linked thematically to his earlier etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters as well as the Disasters of War print series, another bold political statement published only posthumously.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation brought {{changes in}} outlook and artistic {{expression}} as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery {{was shown in}} a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background. Pieter Bruegel the Elder, {{one of the few}} who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> were provisionally religious or mythological, and his genre scenes were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.|$|E
5|$|The stolen {{works were}} {{originally}} purchased by art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924) and {{intended to be}} left on permanent display at the museum {{with the rest of}} her collection. Since the collection and its layout are permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. Experts are puzzled by the choice of <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> were stolen, especially since more valuable artwork was untouched. Among the stolen works was The Concert, one of only 34 known works by Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting at over $200 million. Also missing is The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, Rembrandt's only known seascape. Other works by Rembrandt, Degas, Manet, and Flinck were also stolen.|$|E

5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E
5|$|Following the Walpole sale many artists, {{including}} James Barry and John Flaxman, {{had made}} renewed {{calls for the}} establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The British Institution, founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> were lent were often mediocre, some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings. One of the Institution's founding members, Sir George Beaumont, Bt, would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine a worst-case scenario in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made {{its way into the}} finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The {{first show}} of Tears of a Clown started four hours late, with the delay being caused by Madonna rehearsing. It {{consisted}} of Madonna singing acoustic versions of her songs while {{dressed as a}} clown, interspersed with the singer telling jokes and anecdotes. Tears of a Clown received positive reviews from critics who appreciated the stripped down, confessional nature of the singer's performance and {{the choice of the}} songs and the comedy. Madonna refuted reports of her being drunk on stage, calling them false and sexist. She revived the show on December 2, 2016, performing at Miami's Faena Forum as a benefit gala, to auction memorabilia and raise money for her Raising Malawi charitable foundation. Tickets were expensive, and the auctioned items included Madonna's tour dress and wedding photographs, as well as <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> she owned.|$|E
5|$|The red canopy {{bed in the}} King's bedchamber is a 1989 copy of a bed kept in the Château d'Azay-le-Rideau, {{thought to}} be {{very similar to the}} lost original. The portraits of kings Louis XIV and Louis XV of France in the library are copies made in 1950 of originals by Hyacinthe Rigaud kept in the Palace of Versailles. These 20th-century copies are {{replacements}} for the 18th-century copies of the same <b>paintings</b> <b>that</b> were destroyed during the French Revolution {{at the same time as}} the portraits of the prince-bishops in the Bishops' Hall (see above, History). The overdoor paintings in the antechamber of the prince-bishop are also 20th-century copies, replacing 18th-century copies of French Baroque masters such as Antoine Coypel, Charles Le Brun, and Charles de La Fosse, that were destroyed in 1944. These paintings represent biblical stories; the lost first copies were made in 1737–1740 in Versailles. The other paintings on the walls belong to the Musée des beaux-arts, including Louis XV offrant la Paix à L'Europe ("Louis XV presenting Peace to Europe", 1737) by François Lemoyne, on display in the Garde-robe du prince-évêque, and La déification d'Énée ("The Deification of Aeneas", 1749) by Jean II Restout, on display in the Chambre du prince-évêque.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{source of}} {{confusion}} with his <b>paintings</b> is <b>that</b> his signature {{can easily be}} read by the unwary as 'Doweraker', and in this guise 'A.M. Doweraker, fl.1920s-1940s' {{can be found in}} auction records.|$|R
