5|$|A <b>paternity</b> {{analysis}} of yellow-faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by the male of the nesting pair, with clear evidence for extra-pair <b>paternity</b> {{in the case}} of the remaining 44%. This conflicts with the usual pattern, where genetic monogamy is linked to the characteristics of strong social pairing, essential paternal contributions to brood rearing, and to sexual monomorphism; characteristics exhibited by the yellow honeyeater.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{profiling}} is {{also used}} in DNA <b>paternity</b> testing to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent {{of a child with}} the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test <b>paternity</b> while a mother is still pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} <b>paternity.</b> Multiple <b>paternity</b> {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may {{have as many}} as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch. Multiple <b>paternity</b> and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E
5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases <b>paternity</b> in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s <b>paternity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apollo tells Veronica that he {{actually}} does want the <b>paternity</b> test. Dick’s father, {{who was involved in}} a corporate crime, appears and berates him for going on the surfing trip in the summer. Apollo takes the <b>paternity</b> test, but the father doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that {{he actually}} was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his father was genuinely loving. The only reason the father did not show up to the <b>paternity</b> test was that he was detained for having the wrong license plates. Apollo and the father meet at the Sheriff’s office, where they have an emotional reunion. Dick angrily confronts his father, but the next time he is seen, he calls off his trip with Logan. Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm orchestrates {{a meeting}} between Savage, Barry, and Oliver. Savage demands they turn over Kendra and Carter or he will destroy both Central City and Star City with the Staff of Horus. Oliver has Barry perform a <b>paternity</b> test on William and it {{confirms}} that Oliver is William's father. Confronting Samantha, she agrees to let him see William on the condition he tell no one, including William himself, {{that he is the}} boy's father. Felicity learns of Oliver's <b>paternity</b> and feels betrayed because Oliver is still willing to keep secrets from her, so she ends their relationship.|$|E
5|$|He {{particularly}} admired Solomon Sharp, a {{young lawyer}} in his thirties in Bowling Green, with whom Beauchamp hoped to study. In 1820, Beauchamp became disenchanted with Sharp when rumors surfaced that he had fathered an illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter who lived in Bowling Green. Sharp denied <b>paternity</b> of the child, which was stillborn.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Bizet had fathered a {{child with}} the family's housekeeper, Marie Reiter. The boy was brought up {{to believe that he}} was Adolphe Bizet's child; only on her deathbed in 1913 did Reiter reveal her son's true <b>paternity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Morrison's {{tour manager}} Gigi Lee {{gave birth to}} a son, who she {{asserted}} was Morrison's and named after him. Lee announced the birth of the child on Morrison's official website but Morrison denied <b>paternity.</b> Lee's son died in January 2011 from complications of diabetes and Lee died soon after from throat cancer in October 2011.|$|E
5|$|In a test {{of worker}} policing, {{researchers}} examined the removal of worker-laid eggs in Vespula rufa, a wasp that has low <b>paternity.</b> Under the testing conditions, worker policing was not as efficient, {{and some of the}} drones appeared to be from worker-laid eggs.|$|E
5|$|In her autobiography, Rage to Survive, James recounted their meeting, {{writing that}} Wanderone neither {{confirmed}} nor denied his <b>paternity.</b> According to James, {{he told her}} that he did not recall the details of his life {{at the time of her}} conception well enough to know whether he could have been the father.|$|E
5|$|Kinsler married Tess Brady, {{his high}} school sweetheart, on November 18, 2006. Their daughter, Rian Brooklynn Kinsler, was born December 5, 2008. On June 8, 2011, his wife {{gave birth to a}} son, Jack Jamisson Kinsler. He was put on <b>paternity</b> leave due to the birth.|$|E
5|$|Mary Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's older sister, {{had earlier}} been {{recalled}} from France in late 1519, ostensibly for her affairs with the French {{king and his}} courtiers. She married William Carey, a minor noble, in February 1520, at Greenwich, with Henry VIII in attendance; soon after, Mary Boleyn became the English King's mistress. Historians dispute King Henry VIII's <b>paternity</b> of {{one or both of}} Mary Boleyn's children born during this marriage. Henry VIII: The King and His Court, by Alison Weir, questions the <b>paternity</b> of Henry Carey; Dr. G.W. Bernard (The King's Reformation) and Joanna Denny (Anne Boleyn: A New Life of England's Tragic Queen) argue that Henry VIII was their father. Henry did not acknowledge either child, as he did his son Henry Fitzroy, his illegitimate son by Elizabeth Blount, Lady Talboys.|$|E
5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified as the author of a work, known as the right of <b>paternity,</b> the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of <b>paternity</b> exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E
5|$|Although Greeley had {{requested}} a simple funeral, his daughters ignored his wishes and arranged a grand affair at the Church of the Divine <b>Paternity,</b> later the Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York, where Greeley was a member. He {{is buried in}} Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery. Among the mourners were old friends, Tribune employees including Reid and Hay, his journalistic rivals, and {{a broad array of}} politicians, led by President Grant.|$|E
5|$|Compulsory personal, {{social and}} health {{education}} {{was introduced in}} 2009. The Additional <b>Paternity</b> Leave Regulations 2010 provided parents with the option to split the year's maternity leave the mother could then take from her employment, allowing parents greater flexibility with childcare arrangements. An extension of 10–15 hours free nursery provision for disadvantaged 2-year olds was also carried out. Between 2008 and 2010, additional money was put into tax credits for families with children, while child poverty fell during Brown's last year as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Old Court {{supporters}} again {{raised the}} issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke. Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills that not only accused Sharp of fathering Cooke's child, but said that Sharp had denied <b>paternity</b> of the child {{on the grounds that it}} was a mulatto and the son of a Cooke family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been determined. Despite the allegations, Sharp won the election.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Sharp {{resigned}} {{to run for}} {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. During the heated campaign, opponents raised the issue of his alleged seduction of Anna Cooke. Old Court partisan John U. Waring had handbills distributed that alleged that Sharp had denied <b>paternity</b> of Cooke's illegitimate child because it was a mulatto and likely fathered by a Cooke family slave. Sharp won the election, defeating John J. Crittenden.|$|E
5|$|In June 2005, Urlacher {{filed suit}} to {{establish}} <b>paternity</b> {{of his son}} Kennedy. Genetic testing determined that he is Kennedy's father. Kennedy's mother, Tyna Robertson, was already well-known to the media, having made claims of sexual assault against famed dancer Michael Flatley and a doctor from Naperville, Illinois. Urlacher and Robertson maintain joint-custody over Kennedy. In 2017, Urlacher appealed to a Cook County court to remove Kennedy from Robertson's custody after her husband, Ryan Karageorge, {{was shot and killed}} in their residence.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his children with his wife, Sir William Wilde {{was the father of}} three children born out of wedlock before his marriage: Henry Wilson, born in 1838, and Emily and Mary Wilde, born in 1847 and 1849, respectively, of different maternity to Henry. Sir William acknowledged <b>paternity</b> of his illegitimate children and provided for their education, but they were reared by his relatives rather than with his wife and legitimate children.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1940s, Chaplin was {{involved}} in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image. The troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspirant actress named Joan Barry, with whom he {{was involved}} intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942. Barry, who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated, reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with Chaplin's child. As Chaplin denied the claim, Barry filed a <b>paternity</b> suit against him.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 2006, a {{judge in}} Cook County, Illinois, {{determined}} that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5million in a breach of contract claim. Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret. Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a <b>paternity</b> suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991. A DNA test showed Jordan was not {{the father of the}} child.|$|E
5|$|Specific mating {{courtship}} occurs {{more often}} in the Fall months and usually during the afternoon hours from 11:00 to 13:00 when many of the turtles {{are out in the}} population feeding. Mating is based on a male competitive hierarchy where a few higher ranked males gain the majority of mates in the population. Male wood turtles fight to gain access to female mates. These fights involve aggressive behaviors such as biting or chasing one another, and the males defend themselves by retreating their heads into their hard shells. The higher ranked winning males in the hierarchy system have a greater number of offspring than the lower ranked male individuals, increasing the dominant male's fitness. Female wood turtles mate with multiple males and are able to store sperm from multiple mates. Although the mechanism of sperm storage is unknown for the Wood Turtle species, other turtle species have internal compartments that can store viable sperm for years. Multiple mating ensures fertilization of all the female's eggs and often results in multiple <b>paternity</b> of a clutch, which is a common phenomenon exhibited by many marine and freshwater turtles. Multiple <b>paternity</b> patterns have been made evident in wood turtle populations by DNA fingerprinting. DNA fingerprinting of turtles involves using an oligonucleotide probe to produce gender specific markers, ultimately providing multi-locus DNA markers.|$|E
5|$|The Capobiancos {{argued that}} {{it takes more than}} mere biology to invoke the {{provisions}} of the ICWA, and under South Carolina law, a father must not only reside with the mother for the six-month period preceding the birth of the child but also contribute to pregnancy-related expenses in order to have <b>paternity</b> rights. However, the Court determined that the ICWA does not defer to state law, and the trial court properly determined that the ICWA grants Indian fathers greater rights than state law.|$|E
5|$|The male common {{chiffchaff}} {{is highly}} territorial during the breeding season, with a core territory typically 20metres (66ft) across, which is fiercely defended against other males. Other small birds {{may also be}} attacked. The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the stoat if they approach the nest, as well as egg-thieves like the Eurasian jay. His song, given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears {{to be used to}} advertise an established territory and contact the female, rather than as a <b>paternity</b> guard strategy.|$|E
5|$|With Carlos in prison, John {{assumes that}} he and Gabrielle will {{continue}} their relationship, but Gabrielle is livid after John told Carlos about their affair. Meanwhile, Carlos demands a <b>paternity</b> test if he and Gabrielle are {{to work on their}} marriage. Unwilling to actually take a test, Gabrielle obtains another patient's results and passes them off to Carlos as her own. Nevertheless, Carlos tells her that he still is not unsatisfied.|$|E
5|$|Yusef {{learns that}} Amira {{gave birth to}} Syed's {{daughter}} Yasmin, so persuades Zainab to take a holiday with him and Kamil in Pakistan. While there, he suggests that they move there permanently as a family. On their return to Walford, Yusef learns that Amira has been seeing Syed, so tells Amira {{that she is not}} wanted by the Masood family. Amira ignores him and Zainab meets Yasmin, and informs Yusef that she cannot leave Walford after becoming a grandmother. Yusef then puts doubt into the mind of Syed's boyfriend, Christian Clarke (John Partridge), about Syed's <b>paternity</b> of Yasmin. Christian then asks Yusef to perform a secret <b>paternity</b> test on Yasmin, however Yusef uses his own DNA for the test, creating a false result. However, his falsification is exposed, leaving the Masood family hostile towards him, and Zainab devastated. Later, Yusef tells Zainab that he told the lies to protect her. She is sceptical, but when Yusef revives Amy Mitchell (Natalia and Kamil Lipka-Kozanka) who has almost drowned, Zainab is impressed with Yusef's caring attitude, but says it does not change things.|$|E
5|$|Carl Probyn {{witnessed}} the abduction of his stepdaughter from {{within sight of}} their home. He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a <b>paternity</b> test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{matching}} mitochondrial DNA, geneticist Turi King continued {{to pursue a}} link between the paternally-inherited Y-DNA and that of descendants of John of Gaunt. Four living male-line descendants of Gaunt have been located, and their results are a match to each other. The Y-DNA from the skeleton is somewhat degraded, but proved not to match any of the living male-line relatives, showing that a false-paternity event had happened somewhere in the 19 generations between Richard III and Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort; work by Turi King and others has shown that historical rates of false <b>paternity</b> are around 1–2% per generation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the week}} before his death, {{he was dealing with}} two pending lawsuits, one a <b>paternity</b> case and the other a {{recording}} contract dispute that was due to be heard by a UK High Court the following week. He was also troubled with wanting to leave his manager, Michael Jeffery. Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe exhaustion caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and a persistent illness assumed to be influenza-related. Lacking trusting personal relationships, his insecurities about the future and disillusionment with the music industry contributed to his frustration.|$|E
5|$|His {{relationship}} with King Edgar is unclear, particularly given {{the uncertainty of}} Thored's <b>paternity,</b> Oslac being banished from England in 975, the year of Edgar's death. Richard Fletcher, who thought Thored {{was the son of}} Gunnar, argued that Thored's raid on Westmorland was caused by resentment derived from losing out on the ealdormanry to Oslac, and that Edgar thereafter confiscated various territories as punishment. The evidence for this is that Newbald, granted by Edgar to Gunnar circa 963, was bought by Archbishop Osketel from the king sometime before 971, implying that the king had seized the land.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 through 1988, {{while working}} in the CCMB, Singh {{established}} that this Bkm-derived probe {{could be used to}} generate individual specific DNA Fingerprints of humans for forensic investigations; and in 1988, he used that probe {{for the first time to}} solve a case of parentage dispute in India. In 1991, Singh produced the first DNA fingerprinting based evidence in an Indian Court to settle a disputed <b>paternity.</b> This was followed by DNA fingerprinting based resolution of hundreds of civil and criminal cases, including cases such as the assassination case(s) of Beant Singh and Rajiv Gandhi, Naina Sahni Tandoor murder case, Swami Premananda case, Swami Shraddhananda case, and Priyadarshini Mattoo murder case.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{character}} underwent {{a dramatic change}} in storyline when the role of Nick and Sharon's fourteen-year-old daughter Cassie was killed off after a car accident. This led Nick to seek comfort in the arms of another woman, Phyllis Summers, which resulted in an affair. Phyllis became pregnant with Nick's child, Summer Newman. Nick divorced Sharon and married Phyllis the following year. For years, however, Nick battled between his ongoing feelings with Sharon and Phyllis. His other storylines have included trying to seek independence away from his powerful father as well as multiple other relationships. In 2013, a storyline regarding Summer's <b>paternity</b> was visited, centered on speculation that she is actually the daughter of Jack Abbott, Phyllis' ex-husband.|$|E
5|$|Jereboam Beauchamp {{was born}} in Barren County, Kentucky, in 1802. Educated {{in the school of}} Dr. Benjamin Thurston, he {{resolved}} to study law at age eighteen. While observing the lawyers practicing in Glasgow and Bowling Green, Beauchamp was particularly impressed with the abilities of Solomon P. Sharp. Sharp had twice been elected to the state legislature and had served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Beauchamp became disenchanted with Sharp when, in 1820, a planter's daughter named Anna Cooke claimed Sharp was the father of her child, who was stillborn. Sharp denied <b>paternity,</b> and public opinion favored him. The disgraced Cooke became a recluse at her mother's plantation outside Bowling Green.|$|E

Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her MacPaint art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.|$|E
