50|$|PIR {{typically}} has an MDI/polyol ratio, {{also called}} its index (based on isocyanate/polyol stoichiometry to produce urethane alone), higher than 180.

Depending on the <b>product</b> <b>application</b> greater stiffness, chemical and/or thermal stability may be desirable. As such PIR manufacturers can offer multiple products with identical densities but different indices {{in an attempt}} to achieve optimal end use performance.|$|E
