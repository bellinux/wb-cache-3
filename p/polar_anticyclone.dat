50|$|The north area of Brazil embraces a {{great part}} of the Amazon Basin, {{representing}} the largest extension of hot and humid forest on the planet. The region has a low elevation (0 to 200 m) and is crossed by the Equator. There are four main systems of atmospheric circulation that act in the area, they are: system of winds of Northeast (NE) to East (E) of the Atlantic South and Azores, subtropical anticyclones, generally stable in nature; system of winds of West (W) of the mass equatorial continental (mEc); system of winds of North (N) of the Convergence Intertropical (CIT); and system of winds of South (S) of the <b>Polar</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> These last three systems are responsible for variability of the climate and for the rains in the area. With regard to temperatures, the climate is hot, with annual medium temperatures ranging from 24 to 26 C.|$|E

40|$|Sand and Dust storms {{are common}} {{phenomena}} in arid and semi-arid areas. West Asia Region, especially Tigris-Euphrates alluvial plain, {{has been recognized}} as one of the most important dust source areas in the world. In thispaper, a method is applied to extract SDS (Sand and Dust Storms) sources in West Asia region using thematicmaps, climate and geography, HYSPLIT model and satellite images. Out of 50 dust storms happened during 2000 – 2013 and collected in form of MODIS images, 27 events were incorporated as demonstrations of the simulated trajectories by HYSPLIT model. Besides, a dataset of the newly released Landsat images was used as basemap for the interpretation of SDS source regions. As a result, six main clusters were recognized as dust source areas. Of which, 3 clusters situated in Tigris–Euphrates plain were identified as severe SDS sources (including 70 % dust storms in this research). Another cluster in Sistan plain is also a potential source area. This approach also confirmed six main paths causing dust storms. These paths are driven by the climate system including Siberian and <b>Polar</b> <b>anticyclones,</b> monsoon from Indian Subcontinent and depression from north of Africa. The identification of SDS source areas and paths will improve our understandings on the mechanisms and impactsof dust storms on socio-economy and environment of the region...|$|R
40|$|This paper briefly {{reports the}} result of the weather {{analysis}} carried out on m/s SOYA during the relief operation of J. A. R. E. V in the Antarctic in the summer of 1960 - 1961. The synoptic data were collected through the interception of the wireless weather transmission listed in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The meteorological condition in the vicinity of Lutzow-Holm Bay in this season was quite favourable and was the best of the five summers from 1957 to 1961. The maximum wind velocity did not exceed 15 m/s and the amount of lower cloud was extremely small. The weather recorded on m/s SOYA is summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The frequencies of wind velocity and of the amount of lower cloud for this summer are compared with those for the previous summers, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The data in these figures are based on the observations at Syowa Base with respect to the common period for the five summers. The synoptic meteorological pattern, relating to the extraordinary good weather of this summer, was analysed through the weather maps prepared on m/s SOYA; and it was concluded as follows: a) In middle summer, from early January to middle February, the <b>polar</b> cap <b>anticyclone</b> was not powerful enough to control over the Antarctic coastal waters. The anticyclonic ridge, however, was apt to stagnate over the area of Queen Maudland with the meridional axis connecting the <b>polar</b> cap <b>anticyclone</b> with the meridional one. This ridge prevented developement of cyclones which ordinarily tend to appear over the waters around Bouvet Island and move southeastward to attack Lutzow-Holm Bay. Trajectories of the major cyclones in this summer are plotted in Fig. 4. It is noticed that the characteristic features of the trajectories resemble those in the summer of 1957 (Fig. 5 a), when we experienced another favourable weather in the area concerned. On the contrary, the trajectories in the summer of 1958, when the worst weather was experienced, revel a different character as the well-developed cyclones frequently crossed the line of latitude 65 °S approaching Lutzow-Holm Bay. The existence of the above mentioned anticyclonic ridge in this summer can be ascertained also through the five-day mean pressure distribution along the Antarctic coast from S. A. N. A. E. Base to Mirny Base, as shown in Fig. 6. b) In late summer of 1961, the <b>polar</b> cap <b>anticyclone</b> increased its intensity, expanding so widely that the coastal region of the Indian Ocean sector was completely covered with the fresh Antarctic continental air mass. At the same time, the hemi-spherical circulation showed a tendency of "High Index" type, which means a superior zonal circulation. The circum-polar cyclones were then accerelated to move along latitude line, having few southerly components. On account of this pattern, Lutzow-Holm Bay was protected from the cyclone path. Thus, throughout the whole period of the operation from 6 th January to 3 rd March, SOYA encountered with no severe storm in the vicinity of Lutzow-Holm Bay...|$|R
40|$|An {{extraordinary}} warming of {{the stratosphere}} in December-January 1976 - 77 {{was followed by}} tropospheric warming in the polar region and cooling in middle latitudes. During January 10 - 20, the associated <b>polar</b> <b>anticyclone</b> extended from the surface to 10 mb. Antecedents of the polar vortex breakdown are reviewed {{with the aid of}} results of zonal-harmonic analyses of planetary waves, for heights of the pressure surfaces (700 - 10 mb), temperature, and mean stratospheric temperature (the latter determined from satellite radiation measurements). Wave 1 in height and temperature played a dominant role in the stratosphere, attaining amplitudes of 1600 gpm and 25 C, respectively, at 10 mb. On the other hand, superposition of retrogressing wave 1 and quasi-stationary wave 2 in the height of the 300 -mb surface, with individual amplitudes exceeding 300 gpm, is judged to have been an important factor in the overall development...|$|E
40|$|The recent Voyager {{encounter}} established certain {{facts about}} Triton's atmosphere: the surface pressure {{is in the}} range 1. 5 – 1. 9 Pa (15 – 19 μbar); the surface temperature is 38 ± 3 K (ref. 2); molecular nitrogen is the dominant atmospheric constituent; hazes and clouds are visible {{not only on the}} limb but also against the surface; the wind in the southern hemisphere is to the northeast at low altitudes (as shown by streaks on the surface) and to the west at high altitudes (as shown by geyser-like plume tails). Triton rotates with a period of 5. 877 days in a right-hand sense about the south pole, where the season now is late spring 4. Here we argue that these features can be explained if Triton, like Mars, has a global, well-structured atmosphere in equilibrium with surface frosts. The subliming frost cap produces a <b>polar</b> <b>anticyclone</b> at low altitudes, with northeastward winds of ~ 5 m s^(− 1) within the Ekman boundary layer. The temperature contrast between the cold frost-covered pole and the warm unfrosted equator produces westward winds at high altitudes...|$|E
40|$|Melt season {{frequencies}} of the Beaufort Sea High (BSH) {{have a profound}} effect on western Arctic climate, making the interannual spatial and temporal monitoring of this <b>polar</b> <b>anticyclone</b> important. This manuscript presents two automated synoptic climatological analyses using a two-step cluster procedure to classify daily mean sea level pressure (MSLP) over 180 - 120 Â°W and 70 - 85 Â°N with an emphasis on identifying BSH patterns. Separate raw and anomaly MSLP circulation pattern (CP) classifications are compared in order to assess the spatial characteristics of the BSH and its monthly frequency changes during the melt season from 1979 to 2012. Analysis of both classifications shows clear advantages to using the anomaly approach in terms of assessing temporal and spatial changes, particularly in light of the documented recent atmospheric circulation changes that have been observed over the region. Associations between the June anomaly circulation pattern (ACP) 5, a + 4 hPa BSH pattern situated between 155 Â°W and 135 Â°W, and June indices of atmospheric teleconnections such as the Arctic Dipole and Arctic Oscillation are statistically significant. There is also a statistically significant link to the downstream Greenland Blocking Index; suggesting that the BSH may be intricately related to climatic variability outside the analysed domain as well. Further, ACP 5 occurred nearly 3 weeks more often during the melt season in recent massive Arctic Sea ice loss years (2007 - 2012) compared with the climatology (1979 - 2006). Recent increases in June ACP 5 frequencies account for a large proportion of this pattern's long-term frequency changes. Â© 2014 Royal Meteorological Society...|$|E
40|$|The {{simulation}} of Arctic sea ice and surface winds changes significantly when Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM 3) resolution is increased from T 42 (2. 8 °) to T 85 (1. 4 °). At T 42 reso-lution, Arctic sea ice is too thick off the Siberian coast and too thin along the Canadian coast. Both of these biases are reduced at T 85 resolution. The most prominent surface wind {{difference is the}} erroneous North <b>Polar</b> summer <b>anticyclone,</b> present at T 42 but absent at T 85. An offline sea ice model is used to study {{the effect of the}} surface winds on sea ice thickness. In this model, the surface wind stress is prescribed alternately from reanalysis and the T 42 and T 85 simulations. In the offline model, CCSM 3 surface wind biases have a dramatic effect on sea ice distribution: with reanalysis surface winds annual-mean ice thickness is greatest along the Canadian coast, but with CCSM 3 winds thickness is greater on the Siberian side. A significant difference between the two CCSM 3 -forced offline simulations is the thickness of the ice along the Canadian archipelago, where the T 85 winds produce thicker ice than their T 42 counterparts. Seasonal forcing experiments, with CCSM 3 winds during spring and summer and reanalysis winds in fall and winter, relate the Canadian thickness difference to spring and summer surface wind differences. These experiments also show that the ice buildup on the Siberian coas...|$|R
40|$|Zonal asymmetries in {{stratopause}} {{temperature and}} height are explored by considering a global climatology based on 7 years of Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite data, from 2004 to 2011. Stratopause temperature and height is interpreted {{in the context}} of the <b>polar</b> vortices and <b>anticyclones</b> defined by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) meteorological analyses. Multiyear, monthly mean geographic patterns in stratopause temperature and height are shown to depend on the location of the <b>polar</b> vortices and <b>anticyclones.</b> The regional temperature and height anomalies, which are due to vertical ageostrophic motion associated with vertically propagating baroclinic planetary waves, are climatological features. This climatology is reproduced using 40 years of output from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). WACCM is in excellent agreement with observations, except in the Antarctic vortex where the stratopause is ~ 10 K warmer and ~ 5 km higher compared with MLS, and the area of the vortex is 45 % smaller in the SH and 30 % smaller in the NH compared to GEOS. WACCM diabatic heating rates support the hypothesis that ageostrophic vertical motions are responsible for producing Arctic winter temperature anomalies. A composite of 15 elevated stratopause (ES) events based on WACCM is produced and shown to be in good agreement with the 2012 ES event observed by MLS. This analysis is the first to suggest that ES events are not pole centered. Finally, temperature observations during January and February 2006 from the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS), MLS, and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) satellite instruments are compared to illustrate the vertical range over which version 6 HIRDLS temperatures are scientifically useful. Though HIRDLS temperatures are consistently 5 - 10 K lower in the mesosphere, the horizontal temperature distribution is in good spatial and temporal agreement with MLS and SABER up to ~ 80 km. Gravity wave momentum flux and planetary wave- 1 amplitudes are derived from HIRDLS and are in agreement with previous studies. We use HIRDLS to show a ~ 30 K increase in stratopause temperature following enhanced gravity wave momentum flux in the lower mesosphere...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructions of monthly mean sea-level grid-point {{pressure}} from station pressure data over the Arctic region using an objective technique have revealed two serious {{errors in the}} gridded data. First, all gridded data (from the U. S. Historical Weather Map series) for the Arctic Ocean area away from the North Atlantic sector appears to be between 4 and 6 mb too high before about 1931. The semi-permanent Arctic high produced in the early historical map series {{was the result of}} a lack of basic station data, and the belief amongst many North American meteorologists of the 1920 s and 1930 s of the existence of a <b>polar</b> or glacial <b>anticyclone.</b> The second error affects only north-western North America for the years 1899 - 1909. Here pressure is again too high compared with reconstructed data. The cause of this error is not immediately apparent, but is probably the result of an erroneous correction to sea level for stations in the region. Both errors seriously affect the homogeneity of the gridded Arctic series. The objective scheme used to reveal the errors, can also be used to derive correction factors for the gridded data prior to 1931...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{mean values}} of heights and {{temperatures}} at the selected pressure surfaces are computed, using the aerological data obtained during the 4 th (1960) and the 5 th (1961) wintering observations at the Syowa Base, Antarctica. Main {{characteristics of the}} seasonal and yearly variations both in the antarctic troposphere and the stratosphere are investigated by means of these limited data. Four vertical time sections (from the surface to 30 mb) of Feb. May. Aug. Oct. -Nov., representing each season respectively, are made based on these data, and some notable features of seasonal circulation patterns in 1961 over the Syowa Base are briefly described. In addition, in supplementing this single station data analysis, IAAC 2 ̆ 7 s synoptic weather charts in microfilm are used to locate relative pressure systems, {{and at the same}} time, for rough estimation of circulation intensity, meridional temperature gradients between the Syowa Base and Marion Island in the middle latitude, together with difference in their annual variations, are utilized. Characteristics of the seasonal circulations in 1961 are summarized as follows : Summer : In the troposphere, weak anticyclonic systems predominate over the east continent and weak circulations of E-ly with slightly N and S components are seen. However, in the location and movement of these systems, W-ly wind circulation is also seen. Cyclonic activities are such that most of lows move on toward the east within the low pressure belt off the base, and, except at the surface, N or NE-ly winds by these systems are very weak in the upper layer, so there was little influence to the air over the base. For the layer from the lower to middle stratosphere, weak W-ly wind generally prevails but variation of the wind direction is also seen upon appearance of anabatic and katabatic fields. In the upper stratosphere, weak E-ly wind with N component can be seen. Autumn : For the layer from the middle troposphere to the lower stratosphere, S or SW-ly strong jets come to be observed due to the sharp southward extension of the middle latitude ridge which brings about a temperature rise in the air over the base. At the same time, in the lower layer near the surface, a shallow cold film of the <b>polar</b> <b>anticyclone</b> is formed and weak surface inversion develops up to about 500 m; subsequently weak anticyclonic circulation at the surface is maintained. On the other hand, cyclonic activities are intensified from the middle autumn and replacement of the air masses becomes more active. In case a moderate cyclone approaches, a strong NE-ly wind circulation is observed throughout the troposphere. In the upper stratosphere, with advancement of cooling process, a strong W-ly jet predominates following the formation of the polar vortex. Winter : Near the surface, weak SE-ly circulation predominates due to the control of the polar cold anticyclone with moderate surface inversion. In the polar night period, weak circulation of nearly E-ly wind prevails generally for the most part of the troposphere, but even in this period, the base region is attacked by an intensive cyclone of winter. Cyclone activities with strong NE-ly wind are further intensified especially in early and late winter. In some cases this NE-ly wind may persist for several days afterward, with a gradual decrease in its speed only, due to stagnation and filling of the low in the north of the base. There is also found a much more intensified influence of sharp ridge extension southward from the middle latitude anticyclone than autumn, and stronger SW-ly with circulation with a temperature rise is observed. Such an alternative appearance of the NE-ly and SW-ly wind circulation verifies that the antarctic atmosphere is markedly baroclinic in winter time. In the stratosphere, as the polar night cold vortex {{is in the midst of}} maximum development, strong W-ly jet more than 100 knots prevails continuously. Spring : Rapid spring-time stratospheric warming which begins with the uppermost layer is found for the period from late October to early November, followed by weakening of the circulation. The NE-ly wind by various-scaled cyclonic turbulence of short period nature is seen in the troposphere. On the other hand, strong SW-ly wind caused by the pressure pattern similar to those in autumn and winter also appears in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. Active replacement of the air masses takes place throughout the whole atmosphere, which is in process of a rapid transition into summer season...|$|E
