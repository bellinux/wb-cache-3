40|$|Abstract. The growing {{of goats}} has {{registered}} a sudden change. At {{the base of}} this situation is the production quality obtained from this specie. In these conditions, all the growing efforts of the economical efficiency obtained as a result for the breeding and exploitation for the local population must be intensified. Besides the intensification of the rising preoccupations for the productive level based on the application of different genetic improvement programs, the elaboration of new technologies {{can be one of}} the future priorities. This affirmation is based on the fact that in almost all the traditional regions of <b>breeding</b> <b>goats</b> are used traditional technologies, which often prove to be uneconomical. In the existing researches we have had as a priority objective the studying of the intensified possibilities of <b>breeding</b> <b>goats</b> for meat production...|$|R

The results were interpreted {{on the basis of the}} study of special literature and legislation about organic farming and ethology of goats. The data set of goat herd daily regime on farm was created. Winter daily regime and summer daily regime were compared. The conditions of <b>goat</b> <b>breeding</b> were then compared with requirements of legal rules in the Czech Republic and in the EU. The physiological and ethological needs of animals are satisfactory. It is due to modern technologies for stabling, milking, slaughtering and another handling with animals. Goats have the possibility to graze freely on pastures and they effect positively on the landscape management. They keep grasslands without woody plants and weeds...|$|R

40|$|Results of a 2 -year {{study on}} goats and sheep in {{northern}} Burkina Faso are reported. In both goats and sheep, females comprised more than 75 % of flock numbers. Intervals between parturitions in goats were 312 days overall but were significantly {{affected by the}} season of the previous birth: in sheep the interval was 280 days, this also being affected by season. There were 1. 08 kids born per litter in goats and 1. 06 lambs in sheep: litter size in sheep differed significantly between seasons and between years of parturition. Kids weighed 12. 8 kg at 150 days, there being differences due to season and parity: lambs weighed 14. 9 kg, this weight being affected by season, parity and litter size. Seasonal variations in weights of adult female goats and sheep were marked, being about 12 % below the overall annual average weight for each age class in June (end of dry season) and 12 % above the mean in November (post rains). Annual productivity was 22. 1 kg of live young per <b>breeding</b> <b>goat</b> per year, 874 g per kg of <b>breeding</b> <b>goat</b> per year and 2. 08 kg per kg metabolic weight of <b>breeding</b> <b>goat</b> per year.

50|$|The country's {{breeding}} stock was primarily Spanish criollo, although {{over the years}} considerable crossbreeding with English breeds and zebu cattle from Brazil had taken place. Although cattle were numerous in Paraguay, the country lacked {{a sufficient number of}} <b>pure-bred</b> <b>breeding</b> cattle. The livestock sector also suffered from a low calving percentage, a high mortality rate, and a long fattening period for steers. Artificial insemination was increasingly common. To a certain extent, cattle raising reflected the disparities in agriculture in general. There were numerous farmers who owned only a few head of relatively unproductive cattle that were slaughtered for the local market under relatively poor sanitary conditions. By contrast, extremely large cattle ranches typically were owned by expatriates and butchered more productive animals for both national and international markets.|$|R

In this study, a mixed herd was monitored to determine whether boer goats could induce return to cyclicity in sesonal <b>breeding</b> <b>goats.</b> All goats (n = 20) were pluriparous and kidded during January and February. During January a mixed group was formed (10 boer goats kept together with 10 domestic breed goats). At {{the same time a}} group of domestic breed goats (n = 12), kept in the same manner, 40 km away from the experimental group was used as controls. Blood samples were collected every 72 h to determine level of progesterone in both herds. Goats were monitored {{at the same time to}} observe for signs of oestrus. Progesterone concentrations in sera samples were determined using a RIA method. Data were analysed by ANOVA using Statistica software. We observed visual oestrus in all boer goats and in eight domestic breed goats from the mixed group during March and April. Progesterone concentrations confirmed the presence of functional corpora lutea between two visual cycles in these animals. No visual oestrus or increases in progesterone were observed in the control group of goats. In conclusion, continuous <b>breeding</b> boer <b>goats</b> induced oestrus in 80 % (n = 8) of seasonal <b>breeding</b> <b>goats</b> when kept in a mixed herd. Peer reviewe...|$|R

2500|$|Ancient {{breed of}} dogs was a term once {{used for a}} group of dog breeds by the American Kennel Club, but no longer. These breeds were {{referred}} to as [...] "ancient breeds", as opposed to modern breeds, because historically it was believed that they had origins dating back over 500 years. In 2004, a study looked at the microsatellites of 414 purebred dogs representing 85 breeds. The study found that dog breeds were so genetically distinct that 99% of individual dogs could be correctly assigned to their breed based on their genotype, indicating that <b>breeding</b> barriers (<b>pure-bred</b> <b>breeding)</b> has led to distinct genetic units. The study identified 9 breeds that could be represented on the branches of a phylogenetic tree which grouped together with strong statistical support and could be separated from the other breeds with a modern European origin. These 9 breeds had been referred to as [...] "ancient breeds", as opposed to the modern breeds. The study found that the Pharaoh Hound and Ibizan Hound were not as old as believed but had been recreated from combinations of other breeds, and that the Norwegian Elkhound grouped with the other European dogs despite reports of direct Scandinavian origins dating back 5,000 years.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the linkages between livestock and crop farming activities {{and provides a}} comparative analysis of the profitability of different livestock activities in the highlands of Ankara. The data was collected from 52 sample farms in the Nallıhan, Aya¸s, Güdül and Beypazarı districts of Ankara {{by way of a}} questionnaire, where the farms have, on average, 20. 7 ha of land and are thus regarded as small family farms. Insufficient irrigated land and working capital, weak market relations and the pressure of high population brings about a requirement to strengthen crop-livestock interaction. Production on the farms is generally carried out in extensive conditions, with goat, sheep and cattle husbandry in addition to crop production. Crop production makes up for 20. 8 % of the total gross production value on the farms. Of this figure, the entire yields of wheat, barley, pulses, straw and fodder crops are used for own consumption by the households, along with 74 % of the wheat and 77 % of the barley produced. The research results indicate that the current management systems may be defined as mixed farms in terms of crop–livestock linkages. The average total income of the households surveyed is 9, 412. 0 USD, of which 63. 4 % comes from farming activities. Every 1 USD invested in animal husbandry provides an income of 1. 12 USD from dairy cattle breeding, 1. 13 USD from Angora <b>goat</b> <b>breeding,</b> 1. 16 USD from sheep breeding and 1. 27 USD from ordinary <b>goat</b> <b>breeding.</b> It has been found that ordinary <b>goat</b> <b>breeding,</b> which provides the greatest relative profitability for the farms, offers many advantages, and that the transition from Angora <b>goat</b> <b>breeding</b> to ordinary <b>goat</b> <b>breeding</b> through the breeding of ordinary male goats into the Angora herd has occurred in recent years.
