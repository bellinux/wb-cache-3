The challenge deals with: the 'cross subsidisation' of EU 'C' sugar exports through the high prices maintained for EU 'A' and 'B' quota sugar production, which allow 'C' sugar to be exported at prices below the EU's costs of production; the exclusion of 1. 6 million tonnes of EU sugar exports (equivalent to the EU's <b>preferential</b> <b>imports,</b> largely from ACP countries) from the subsidy reduction commitments which the EU has made under the Uruguay Round. Brazil and Australia have repeatedly stressed that the challenge is not aimed at the EU's system of <b>preferential</b> <b>imports</b> from ACP countries.

40|$|In {{the event}} of a Brexit the UK would have to redefine its trade {{relationship}} with the EU and develop its own agricultural policy. We analyse the impacts of a UK-EU Free Trade Arrangement (FTA); a WTO MFN tariff rates scenario; and a UK Trade Liberalisation scenario (UK TL). In each scenario the effects of three different levels of direct payments to farmers are estimated: current levels, 50 per cent reduction and no direct payments. In the FTA and WTO scenarios, UK prices for agricultural products would increase due to the higher trade facilitation costs and the UK's loss of access to EU <b>preferential</b> <b>import</b> regimes, with positive impacts on producers but negative on consumers or users. In the UK TL scenario, prices for animal products tend to decline, while crop prices show an increase relative to the status quo. The effects on farm incomes reflect these changes in prices but incomes ultimately are strongly dependent on choice of agricultural policy with regard to direct payments. Full abolition of direct payments generally more than offsets the positive effects of output price increases on farm incomes. Direct payments of 50 per cent of current levels have more diverse impacts on farm incomes. </p...|$|E

Genes classified as putatively alien (pA) or putatively native (pN) were categorized according to the COG database. Among pA and pN genes, the distribution of COG functions and classes were studied for different groupings of prokaryotes. Groups were formed according to taxonomical relation or habitats. In all groups, genes related to class L (replication, recombination, and repair) were statistically significantly overrepresented in GIs. GIs of bacteria and archaea showed a distinct pattern of preferences. In archeal GIs, genes belonging to COG class M (cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis) or Q (secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism) were more frequent. In bacterial GIs, genes of classes U (intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport), N (cell motility), and V (defense mechanisms) were predominant. Underrepresentation was strongest for genes belonging to class J (translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis). Among single COG functions overrepresented in GIs were transferases and transporters. In both superkingdoms, HGT enhances genomic content by meeting demands that are independent of the studied habitats. These findings are {{in agreement with the}} complexity theory, which predicts the <b>preferential</b> <b>import</b> of operational genes.

We found that exogenously provided ectoine and hydroxyectoine also serve as protectants against these challenges. Transport studies with [14 C]ectoine revealed that both types of stress induced a high-affinity ectoine uptake activity in V. pantothenticus. By using an Escherichia coli mutant defective in osmoprotectant uptake systems, a functional complementation approach for osmostress resistance in the presence of ectoine was employed to retrieve a gene encoding an ectoine transporter from V. pantothenticus. The cloned gene (ectT) encodes a protein (EctT) that {{is a member of the}} BCCT (betaine-choline-carnitine-transporter) family of carriers. Osmoprotection assays demonstrated that the EctT carrier mediates the <b>preferential</b> <b>import</b> of ectoine and hydroxyectoine but also possesses minor uptake activities for the compatible solutes proline and glycine betaine. Northern blot analysis with RNA isolated from V. pantothenticus revealed that a rise in the external osmolality or a reduction in growth temperature strongly increased the transcription of the ectT gene. Primer extension analysis demonstrated that ectT was transcribed under these conditions from a SigB-type promoter. SigB is the master regulator of the general stress regulon of bacilli and provides protection to cells against various challenges, including high salinity and low temperature.

40|$|In a {{press release}} on July 10 th 2003 the European Commission {{condemned}} the Brazilian, Australian and Thai challenge to the EU's 'C' sugar exports, claiming it was 'nothing less than {{an attack on the}} EU's trade preferences for developing countries'. The Commission argued that the challenge risks 'undermining the benefits of the EU regime for many sugar-dependent developing countries, especially ACP countries'. EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy maintained that the WTO action could 'destabilise the sugar-dependent economies of small ACP countries', whilst merely deflecting attention form the real causes of depressed world market prices, namely the rapid expansion of Brazilian and Australian sugar exports (from 1. 6 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes in the case of Brazil). Comment: While the Commission maintains that EU exports of sugar are largely the result of the <b>preferential</b> <b>import</b> of 1. 9 million tonnes of sugar, {{the reality is that the}} EU has been exporting around 5 million tonnes per annum in recent years, with the system of quota administration within the EU encouraging overproduction. The Commission implies that the EBA preferences extended to LDCs are allowing increased sugar exports from developing countries. However the EU maintains in place a maximum-supply-needs ceiling which limits the total amount of preferential sugar imported into the EU. Increased LDC exports of sugar are thus at the expense of ACP beneficiaries of the special preferential sugar arrangement. This will remain the case until the EU raises the maximum-supply-needs ceiling or LDCs are given full duty-free access in 2009. While the European Commission maintains that the WTO challenge is likely to destabilise ACP sugar-dependent economies, the eventual extension of CAP reform to the sugar sector, involving a shift from price support to direct aid to farmers, is likely to profoundly affect the value of sugar preferences extended to ACP sugar suppliers. The prospect of sugar-sector reform may however have been deferred by the June 26 th 2003 decision to retain the vast majority of the funds generated by 'modulation' for investment in rural development rather than additional sectoral reform.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Bioethanol and {{biodiesel}} {{are currently}} the main biofuels. The United States of America and Brazil {{are the major}} bioethanol producers from maize and sugar cane respectively. European and Asian countries produce and consume biodiesel as transportation fuel. Generally, governments want to avoid importing biofuels, since this erodes the advantage of fuel security from growing fuel locally. There are however opportunities for many African countries to export to Europe and the United States of America, since they have <b>preferential</b> <b>import</b> tax exemption agreements with African countries. Sub-Saharan Africa has large potential to produce biomass. Inherently, South Africa has poor potential to produce biomass, due to the climatic conditions and water scarcity. However, South Africa has infrastructure, skills, commercial farmers and, importantly, government policy on biofuels. These advantages should be leveraged to optimise gains from a biofuel industry. A biofuels industry holds potential in terms of job creation and rural development gains, apart from the advantages of fuel security, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, stimulation of the agricultural sector, and reduced fuel imports with the balance of payment advantages. The South African government aims to develop rural communities in former homeland areas. If degraded land in these areas is recovered and used for production of biofuels, the environmental benefits are immediate and substantial. Fuel crop production in these areas does not compromise food security nor does it result in further deforestation. Creating jobs in rural areas can contribute to reduction of poverty. The Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) published its strategy in 2007. This excluded maize as permitted bioethanol feedstock, it sets a two per cent liquid fuels penetration target, and gave fuel tax exemptions for biodiesel and bioethanol. The biofuels would be distributed through voluntary low concentration blending into petroleum products by oil companies. The industry would be regulated and producers require licensing through the South African Revenue Service (SARS). The license conditions were mainly related {{to the type of}} feedstock, where it was produced, volumes produced, local consumption, environmentally friendliness, compliance with broad based black economic empowerment requirements and it should not compete with food sources. The strategy is up for review after the initial five years phase. Currently there are no commercial bioethanol fuel production plants in South Africa and only some small scale biodiesel production plants with very limited outlets to consumers. With all the apparent advantages, why is nothing happening in the industry? Business is not showing interest, proving that the economic conditions are not favourable. The government wants to control the production side to maximise the gains from it, but instead of assisting the industry, it has practically inhibited it from getting started. The consumers must also be prepared to accept the new fuels. Awareness, education and a culture of sustainable use are vital to create the required market. This is an exciting industry with potential benefits to South Africa and its society as a whole, but the fundamental elements of business must be in place in order for it to become self-sustainable...|$|E

This paper focuses on the impact of the EU Commissions sugar policy reform and the Everything But Arms initiative on the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the Least Developed Countries. Simulations are run with an empirical model structure comprising a partial equilibrium model for the world sugar market and a gravity model to replicate least developed countries bilateral trade with Europe. Particularly, the gravity approach is employed to model the abolition of import tariffs for sugar originating in least developed countries, subject to trade costs, while the partial equilibrium approach is employed to assess the effects of EU Commissions sugar policy reform and the Everything But Arms initiative on world markets. Results suggest that the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries will experience significant reduction in their export revenue, whilst the initial impact on least developed countries may be limited but increasing in the medium run.

40|$|Australia and Brazil are to {{initiate}} action in the WTO against the EU sugar regime, according to the Australian Trade Minister, Mark Vaile, on August 16 th 2002. Mr Vaile maintained that 'EU sugar subsidies have resulted {{in one of the}} least efficient producers becoming one of the largest exporters on the world market'. This he maintained resulted in the distortion of global market conditions and prices. Australia is seeking support from other members of the Global Sugar Alliance for the action it is pursuing through the WTO. The first stage of this action will involve mandatory consultations which should extend over a period of least 60 days, although it could run to over several months. On the basis of this consultation a decision as to whether to proceed with a formal request for legal adjudication will be made. Comment: This challenge, if successfully pursued in the WTO, is likely to result in stricter WTO limits on EU sugar exports, reducing the allowable refunded exports by an amount equivalent to the EU's <b>preferential</b> <b>imports</b> of ACP (plus Indian) sugar. This would not necessarily result in any pressure on the ACP quota, but it may simply (like similar developments in the rice sector) intensify pressure on EU member states to bite the bullet of sugar-sector reform, involving a shift from price support to direct aid payments. Any such process of reform would directly affect the value of ACP sugar preferences, with the European Commission having estimated that a 25 % reduction in the EU sugar price would result in income losses to ACP sugar exporters of around € 250 million a year.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a partial equilibrium simulation analysis of EU sugar market reforms with {{a version of}} the European Simulation Model (ESIM) addressing three issues: <b>preferential</b> EU <b>imports</b> are a function of the price differential between world market and EU price, EU supply functions are estimated based on FADN data, and the production of bioethanol in the EU {{and the rest of the}} world is taken into account as an important component in sugar beet and sugar cane demand. It is found that the current sugar market reform including the restructuring process until the end of 2007 is sufficient to allow the EU to comply with its WTO commitments only very narrowly. EU sugar supply is simulated to decrease from roughly 19 million tons in the base period to 15. 5 million tons by 2015 and the EU price remains at a level of about 450 €/t and thus significantly above the reference price. In case of full liberalization production in the EU is projected to decrease to 7. 5 million tonnes by 2015.

40|$|Preference erosion {{has become}} an {{obstacle}} to multilateral trade liberalization, as beneficiaries of trade preferences {{have an incentive to}} resist reductions in mostfavored- nation (MFN) tariffs. This study identifies middle-income developing countries that are vulnerable to export revenue loss from preference erosion. It concludes that the problem is heavily concentrated in a sub-set of preference beneficiaries-primarily small island economies dependent on sugar, banana, and-to a lesser extent-textile exports. Accordingly, measures to help mitigate the impact of preference erosion can be closely targeted at the countries at risk.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the question: Who bears the larger {{portion of the}} excess burden of a tariff-the country that imposes it, or a country that it trades with? For a country that can influence its terms of trade, {{there are two ways}} of approaching this question. This paper shows that under certain assumptions, the extra burden from a marginal change in the homecountry tariff is shared equally between the home and foreign country at a tariff rate equal to twice the optimal tariff for the home country. Also, the cumulative welfare effect of a tariff in the home country, relative to free trade, turns out to be equalized across countries when the home tariff equals four times its optimal tariff. The paper provides an application of these results and points policymakers to the types of data that are relevant if they want to negotiate over "burden sharing.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effects of {{reducing}} tariffs under the Doha Round on market access for developing countries. It shows that for many developing countries, actual preferential access is less generous than it appears because of low product coverage or complex rules of origin. Thus lowering tariffs under the multilateral system is {{likely to lead to}} a net increase in market access for many developing countries, with gains in market access offsetting losses from preference erosion. Furthermore, comparing various tariff-cutting proposals, the research shows that the largest gains in market access are generated by higher tariff cuts in agriculture.

40|$|Congo''s vital {{dependence}} on trade for development stands in contradiction with its trade policy. As {{a member of}} the CEMAC, Congo''s tariff scheme at least formally is guided by CEMAC''s 1994 trade regime agreement. This paper shows CEMAC''s customs code is restrictive relative to that of comparable regional integration groups. The paper also discusses a number of quantitative and qualitative barriers to trade applied by Congo that render its current regime complex, nontransparent, and relatively unpredictable, compromising efforts to develop the non-oil sector and the country''s export base. Moreover, Congo''s high tariffs and other taxes have not led to higher fiscal revenues, as the number of exemptions granted in recent years has surged and customs administration remains weak.
