5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> reacted adequately to other hypnotics, {{and who have}} persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used {{for people who have}} trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E

25|$|Herd {{immunity}} also decreases risk {{to people}} who have a compromised immune system. Some people who have a compromised immune system cannot get certain vaccines and thus are at increased risk if those around them are not vaccinated for those diseases. If the immunocompromised person is surrounded by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been vaccinated and have the disease, that person will likely contract the disease. The outcome for people with compromised immune systems who subsequently get infected is often worse than that of the general population. Herd immunity decreases this risk.|$|E

25|$|Kono Manga ga Sugoi! {{recommended}} Steel Ball Run as a {{good place}} to start for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> read previous parts, due to how it serves as a reboot of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, and appreciated how its move from Weekly Shōnen Jump to the monthly seinen magazine Ultra Jump enabled Araki to write longer stories and depict things that would have been difficult to do in a magazine aimed at children. Erkael of Manga-News called the manga one of the best in the series, and said that it does not disappoint the reader at any point.|$|E
25|$|Post-operative gastric bypass {{patients}} {{develop a}} lowered tolerance {{for alcoholic beverages}} because their altered digestive tract absorbs alcohol {{at a faster rate}} than <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> undergone the surgery. It also takes a post-operative patient longer to reach sober levels after consuming alcohol. In a study conducted on 36 post-operative patients and a control group of 36 subjects (who had not undergone surgery), each subject drank a 5 oz. glass of red wine and had the alcohol in their breath measured to evaluate alcohol metabolism. The gastric bypass group had an average peak alcohol breath level at 0.08%, whereas the control group had an average peak alcohol breath level of 0.05%. It took on average 108 minutes for the gastric bypass patients group to return to an alcohol breath of zero, while it took the control group an average of 72 minutes.|$|E

500|$|In May 2009, the Court of Appeal {{ruled that}} {{photographs}} collected by FITs of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> committed a criminal offence {{can no longer}} be kept. The ruling was made after Andrew Wood, an arms trade activist, was photographed after challenging the management of Reed Elsevier at their AGM over them organising arms trade exhibitions. Wood argued that police had harassed him and infringed his right to privacy by photographing him. Lord Collins of Mapesbury said that the police presence had a [...] "chilling effect" [...] on people who were protesting lawfully. FITs have not been banned but they must now justify the retention of photographs on a case-by-case basis. As a result of the ruling the Metropolitan Police's public order unit, CO11 was forced to delete 40% of the photos of protesters that it held.|$|E
500|$|Serious {{security}} gaps at Suvarnabhumi Airport became {{known to the}} public beginning in early 2007. [...] The International Air Transport Association (IATA) {{found that there were}} many spots in the passenger terminal where checked passengers can meet <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> passed through security checks and could receive unchecked objects and then carry them on board aircraft. [...] The IATA also suggested that AoT deploy its own security staff instead of contracting out the job to the Loxley-ICTS consortium. [...] AoT threatened the consortium with contract termination, but didn't follow through with its threat, even though the consortium {{failed to live up to}} its contract. [...] Six months later, AoT stated that it still couldn't make up its mind on how it should improve airport security. [...] AoT said it was open to all possible options, and has taken no action to upgrade the problem.|$|E

500|$|Fuji TV {{producer}} Akitoshi Mori said Psycho-Pass was {{the first}} work under his control. Early screenings of the series at the Noitamina Shop & Café attracted few viewers, which bothered Mori. However, as the series continued, the quantity of viewers increased. By the final episode, over 1,000 people had queued to watch the finale even though the venue could only accommodate seventy people. This made Mori happy because he realized how many fans were following and supporting the show; he wanted [...] to see a bigger audience at future screenings. DVDs and Blu-ray discs of the series achieved good sales. In April 2014, the series was nominated for the Seiun Award. In the Newtype anime awards from 2013, it was voted as fourth best title of the year. Episode 11 of the series was awarded [...] "Best Episode" [...] in the Noitamina 10th anniversary fan vote. Shinya Kogami, Akane Tsunemori and Shogo Makishima also appeared in such polls as winners of their own categories. Anime News Network also listed as the fifth most accessible anime series for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> watched Japanese animation.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{enjoyed the}} game's visuals. Entertainment Weekly Adam B. Vary thought the game {{did a good}} job at recreating {{the look and feel of}} the {{original}} manga. Walter called the game's visuals [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "striking", and thought that they were what would get people from places where the manga had not yet become popular interested in the game. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell described the visuals as distinctive, and at times reminiscent of Jet Set Radio. Smith called GioGio's Bizarre Adventure among the most faithful manga-to-video game adaptations he had seen, praising the 3D recreation of the manga's artwork, and said that its use of effects such as speed lines and visual katakana sound effects made it feel familiar. He noted that the environments looked [...] "a little crude" [...] and with blurry textures if one looked at details up close, but that they looked impressive from a distance. Reviewers at Famitsu also enjoyed how the game reproduced the look of the manga in 3D, but noted that the presentation of the story felt insufficient for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> read the Vento Aureo manga, and that it seemed mostly targeted towards people who already were fans of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.|$|E
500|$|The Everglades: River of Grass {{galvanized}} {{people to}} protect the Everglades and is compared to Rachel Carson's 1962 exposé of {{the harmful effects of}} DDT, Silent Spring, as both books are [...] "groundbreaking calls to action that made citizens and politicians take notice". Its impact is still relevant as it is claimed to be a major reason Florida receives so many tourists, and [...] "remains the definitive reference on the plight of the Florida Everglades". It has gone through numerous editions, selling 500,000copies since its original publication. The Christian Science Monitor wrote of it in 1997, [...] "Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature, it also reads like a blueprint for what conservationists are hailing as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world". The downside to the book's impact, according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades, is that her metaphor is so prevailingly dominant that it is inaccurate in describing the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades: [...] "River of Grass" [...] describes one. David McCally wrote that despite Douglas' [...] "appreciation of the complexity of the environmental system" [...] she described, popular conception of the Everglades shared by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> read the book overshadows her detailed explanations.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is little}} or no benefit to {{screening}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> had sexual contact. For example, United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends waiting at least three years after first sex. [...] HPV can be transmitted in sex between females, so those who have only had sex with other females should be screened, although they are at somewhat lower risk for cervical cancer.|$|E
2500|$|ESA can {{be either}} {{contributory}} or income-related. [...] If claimants have paid enough National Insurance they can claim contributory ESA for up to one year if they get the work-related activity component, or indefinitely if they get the support component. Income-related ESA is for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> paid enough National Insurance and is subject to a means test and certain other conditions (although the amount paid as contributions-based ESA can also be affected by financial circumstances). Income-related ESA is not time-limited.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{the male}} {{skeleton}} is more robust than the female skeleton {{because of the}} greater muscles mass of the male. Males generally have more pronounced brow ridges, nuchal crests, and mastoid processes. [...] It should be remembered that skeletal size and robustness are influenced by nutrition and activity levels. Pelvic and cranial features {{are considered to be}} more reliable indicators of biological sex. [...] Sexing skeletons of young <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> completed puberty is more difficult and problematic than sexing adults, because the body has not had time to develop fully.|$|E

2500|$|Ovarian {{cancer is}} related to {{the amount of time spent}} ovulating. Thus not having {{children}} is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, likely because ovulation is suppressed via pregnancy. [...] During ovulation, cells are constantly stimulated to divide while ovulatory cycles continue. Therefore, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have. A longer period of ovulation caused by early first menstruation and late menopause is also a risk factor. Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.|$|E
2500|$|Parents {{with the}} {{perspective}} of autism as a disorder (which is called the [...] "pro-cure perspective" [...] in the autism rights movement) believe that therapy {{with the intent of}} extinguishing stereotypically autistic behavior is in their children's best interests; they see this as a treatment that will reduce their children's suffering. These critics say ABA gives autistic children the best chance of success in adulthood, as they either do not believe it is possible that adult society could accommodate autistic <b>people</b> (<b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been trained by ABA to exhibit neurotypical behavior at all times) or they do not believe it is desirable to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Wizards and witches often Apparate {{to their}} destinations, {{which is quite}} similar to teleportation. It is quite {{difficult}} to Apparate; therefore underage wizards and witches are forbidden to do it. There are many examples of failed Apparition attempts made by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> passed their [...] "Apparition test", which is like a Muggle driving test. If not Apparating correctly, a person may lose a body part in the process, referred to as [...] "splinching". In Deathly Hallows, Ron gets splinched after being grabbed by Yaxley, a Death Eater. Hermione heals him with a liquid [...] essence of dittany [...] that she carried in her bag, a process which takes several days.
