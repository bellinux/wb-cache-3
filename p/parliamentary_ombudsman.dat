25|$|Following the {{discovery}} on 23 April, Peter Sunde's lawyer Peter Althin {{announced that he}} would request for a retrial. The Swedish <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> decided not to investigate the bias since the question had already been requested to be taken up in the Svea Court of Appeal. The court of appeal received the case on 18 May and assigned it to judge Ulrika Ihrfelt. On the question of bias, Ihrfelt stated {{she was a member of}} the Swedish Copyright Association in 2005 when working in the supreme court, but didn't consider herself biased because of this. The president of the court was requested to reassign the case, and on 20 May it was reassigned to three judges from another court of appeal department. The district court along with the prosecutor formally defended judges' memberships in these types of organisations as a way to gain knowledge on copyright issues. The court of appeal considered it a priority case, and ruled on 25 June that the judge's memberships do not constitute bias and that there would be no retrial in the district court.|$|E

50|$|The {{starting}} point {{of the work of}} the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsmen</b> today is based - as it was nearly two centuries ago - on the desire of individuals that any treatment they receive from the authorities should be lawful and correct in every other respect. The institution of the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsmen</b> today is a vital element in the constitutional protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of each individual.|$|R
50|$|Even though from a {{constitutional}} {{point of view}} monitoring the application of law by public authorities is the prerogative of the Riksdag, for reasons of principle it has been considered unacceptable to incorporate any political considerations into this supervision. For this reason the independent attitude adopted by the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsmen</b> has applied to {{their relationship with the}} Riksdag as well. For instance the Riksdag is not considered able to issue directives to the Ombudsmen about any individual case, nor can it express opinions retrospectively about how a case was dealt with or the final adjudication. Instead the authority of the Riksdag over the activities of the Ombudsmen finds expression in the instructions issued to the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsmen</b> and in the funds allocated to the Office. It is the Riksdag that decides on the budget for the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsmen</b> - not the government or the Ministry of Finance.|$|R
25|$|On 13 May 2009, several record {{companies}} again sued Neij, Svartholm, Sunde and also The Pirate Bay's main {{internet service provider}} Black Internet. They required enforcement for ending The Pirate Bay's accessory to copyright infringement that had not stopped despite the court order in April, and in the complaint listed several pages of works being shared {{with the help of}} the site. The suit was joined by several major film companies on 30 July. The Stockholm district court ruled on 21 August that Black Internet must stop making available the specific works mentioned in the judgment, or face a 500,000 SEK fine. The company was notified of the order on 24 August, and they complied with it on the same day by disconnecting The Pirate Bay. Computer Sweden noted that the judgment did not order The Pirate Bay to be disconnected, but the ISP had no other option for stopping the activity on the site. It was the first time in Sweden for an ISP to be forced to stop providing access for a website. A public support fund fronted by the CEO of the ISP was set up to cover the legal fees of an appeal. Pirate Party leader Rickard Falkvinge submitted the case for <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> review, criticising the court's order to make intermediaries responsible for relayed content and to assign active crime prevention tasks to a private party.|$|E

2500|$|The Swedish <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> also {{investigated}} the affair. In the 18-page summary {{dedicated to the}} case in the yearly report by the Ombudsman, Gillberg and Gothenburg University are criticized for violating the Freedom of Information Act and thus Kärfve's and Elinder's civil right to access to records belonging to the state. Both the lower court and the appeal court were unanimous in finding Gillberg guilty of breach of duty arising from failure to comply in regards to the release of documents; additionally, the Supreme Court of Sweden did not agree to retry Gillberg's breach of duty case. In response to the concerns raised by Gillberg at the trial that a situation had arisen for him whereby [...] "he was prevented by medical ethics and research ethics from disclosing information about the participants in the study and their next-of-kin", the Swedish <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> stated that [...] "the international declarations drawn up by the World Medical Association and also the European Convention [...] do not categorise them as undertakings that can be considered to take priority over Swedish law." [...] The <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> also stated that, [...] "it is not possible to make decisions on issues concerning confidentiality until the release of a document is requested. It follows therefore that the assurances of confidentiality cited above cannot take priority over the law as it stands or a court's application of the statutes".|$|E

Sir John, whose report was designed to compensate those who suffered [...] "disproportionately" [...] recommended a payment cap for each policyholder which would reduce total compensation to £400m - £500m. Hoban said compensation would follow recommendations of the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> report and would take Sir John's findings into account but might be affected by public spending cuts.

5000|$|The {{decision}} in 1975 {{to abolish the}} special right to waive prosecution {{was linked to the}} simultaneous reform of official accountability, which involved among other things major curtailment of the legal responsibility of public officials for their actions. In this context it was considered that there was no longer any need for the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsmen</b> {{to have the right to}} waive prosecution. Instead it was stipulated that in inquiries into cases the Ombudsmen were to be subject to the regulations that already applied to public prosecutors with regard to prosecution and the right to waive prosecution. Today, the 1986 instructions - the Act with Instructions for the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsmen</b> (1986:765) and the amendments added in 1989 - state that when undertaking the role of prosecutor the Ombudsmen are also to comply with the other statutory regulations applying to public prosecutors.

In addition the four Ombudsmen make inspections and any other investigations they consider necessary. The Ombudsmen are however - unlike normal official agencies - never obliged to consider the circumstances of every case submitted to them. Instead the Ombudsmen make their own assessment of which complaints to investigate and which require no further action. This presupposes, however, an ungrudging attitude {{on the part of}} the Ombudsmen to the complaints they receive so that all those that give grounds for suspecting that some error has been committed will be investigated. It can also happen that even though an Ombudsman finds no reason to inquire into a complaint itself, other aspects of the actions of a public authority will be appraised instead.|$|R
50|$|<b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> (Eduskunnan oikeusasiamies, Riksdagens ombudsman, Umboðsmaður Alþingis, Folketingets Ombudsmand, Norwegian: Sivilombudsmannen) is {{the name}} of the {{principal}} ombudsman institutions in Finland, in Iceland, in Denmark, in Sweden (where the term Justice Ombudsman - Justitieombudsmannen or JO - is also used) and in Norway.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of comparative administrative law, with particular attention to European jurisdictions and the United States. The underlying conceptual similarity that serves to organize the comparative analysis is the purpose, common to these systems, of rendering public administration both capable and expert, on the one hand, and accountable to a variety of liberal democratic actors, on the other hand. The chapter first discusses what historically was the principal legal tool for achieving neutrality and expertise—the legal guarantees of civil service employment—together with national variations in the professionalization of administration. It then turns to three important types of accountability and the different institutions, rules, and procedures used to achieve these forms of accountability in the legal systems under consideration: the contestation of administrative action before the courts; the involvement of organized interests in administrative policymaking; and informal accountability to the general public through <b>parliamentary</b> <b>ombudsmen</b> and transparency guarantees...|$|R
5000|$|The Office of the Ombudsman (in Māori: Tari o te Kaitiaki Mana Tangata) was {{established}} in 1962 under the <b>Parliamentary</b> Commissioner (<b>Ombudsman)</b> Act 1962.

The Ombudsman also has responsibility to protect whistleblowers and investigate the administration of prisons and other places of detention.|$|R

The other Finnish official charged with the supervision of public power is the Chancellor of Justice. The jurisdiction of the two offices overlaps, but the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>ombudsman</b> is the authority specially charged with the handling of complaints by military servicemen, conscripts, prisoners and other persons in closed institutions. He also regularly inspects prisons, garrisons and Finnish peacekeeping missions abroad.

The manner with which democratic control of bureaucracy will be ensured is a long-discussed phenomenon; principal-agent theory, representative bureaucracy approach, administrative procedures and politicization of bureaucracy can be recommended as solutions to this problem.

5000|$|In New Zealand, {{pressure}} {{began to}} grow for similar legislation and for the requirement for secrecy to be overturned. This process was assisted by the courts which made landmark decisions requiring {{more control over the}} exercise of political power. In 1962, this change of mindset manifested in the <b>Parliamentary</b> Commissioner (<b>Ombudsman)</b> Act which was an important first step towards the creation of more open government. It gave the Ombudsmen wide rights of access to departmental files and established that failure by a state agency to give reasons for any decision to refuse information as one of the grounds on which an Ombudsman could intervene. Also in 1962, a Royal Commission of Inquiry was held into the State Services in New Zealand. The Commission stated: [...] "Government administration is the public’s business, and the people are entitled to know more than they do of what is being done, and why". In 1964 the State Services Commission adopted this approach and directed that the underlying principle for Government agencies would be that information should be withheld only if there was a good reason for doing so.|$|R
