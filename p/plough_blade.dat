50|$|The head of {{the machine}} was 30 ft long and 7 ft wide and 8 ft high and {{weighted}} about 30 tons. The head had a <b>plough</b> <b>blade</b> for cutting the top part of the trench {{to a depth of}} about 2 ft, raising the excavated soil and pushing it to the sides of the trench. The lower part of the trench was cut to a depth of 2 ft by a cylindrical cutter superficially resembling the cutting blade of a cylinder lawnmower. Conveyors raised the excavated soil which was added to the plough's deposits {{at the side of the}} trench. The overall depth of the trench was 5 ft and the spoil provided an additional cover of about 2 ft.|$|E

25|$|It {{seemed an}} obvious {{progression}} to use Fowler’s latest steam-driven plough for normal ploughing, {{rather than just}} drainage channels. However normal ploughing was much lighter work that could be achieved perfectly well {{by a team of}} horses and in comparison the steam-driven plough was rather cumbersome. One way of improving the plough’s efficiency would be to design a plough that could plough in either direction without having to be turned round. Fowler achieved this by designing a frame for the plough that had two ploughs attached as a kind of see-saw. One of the two <b>plough</b> <b>blades</b> would be swung down to make contact with the soil, depending on the direction the plough was to travel. At the end of each furrow the anchored pulleys would be moved slightly ready for the next furrow.|$|R
40|$|The ledeburitic {{tool steels}} {{which used to}} be used mainly for cutting and shaping tools {{nowadays}} are frequently used for a manufacture of injection moulds, moulds for pressure castings of aluminium alloys and for moulds for ceramics processing. The article deals with findings of ledeburitic tool steels resistance against abrasive wear. For the tests there were prepared the test samples of ledeburitic tool steels 19 436 and 19 573 (both according to ČSN). Moreover there were prepared the samples from structural abrasion resistant material Hardox 450 and from unalloyed structural steel 11 373 (according to ČSN). A wear resistance was examined by means of a laboratory test with an abrasive cloth and the Bond’s device. Hereafter the article deals with a possibility of utilisation of ledeburitic alloyed steels for a manufacture of tools for a land processing. For the examination of a resistance against wear in land there was made a plough test in which the tested samples were mounted on <b>plough</b> <b>blades.</b> By means of both the laboratory and operational tests there was found multiple higher resistance against wear of ledeburitic tool steels rather than of structural steels.

50|$|Many modern land drains {{are created}} utilising rigid or {{flexible}} plastic pipes pierced with holes, laid in pea gravel. (The pea gravel is pea-sized pebbles without sharp points {{to damage the}} pipe.) Geotextile material can surround the gravel to keep out silt. This can be installed in an excavated trench. Specialised mole ploughs are available that can form the hole, insert the perforated pipe (and gravel if required), all in one simultaneous and continuous process. An extremely powerful (usually tracked) tractor is necessary. The flexible pipe is carried as a roll {{on the back of}} the machine. There is a sometimes a hopper for gravel which is kept topped up by an adjacent machine. The pipe and gravel go down apertures in the <b>plough</b> <b>blade</b> as the tractor proceeds along the desired route.|$|E
50|$|Initial designs envisaged a large {{circular}} cutter {{the diameter of}} the trench to be dug and operating in the manner of modern tunnel boring machines. However, the design evolved to a more efficient arrangement with a huge plough removing the top 2 ft of soil and a cutting cylinder rotating perpendicular to the line of the trench for digging out the lower 2 ft. The trench profile was then squared off by a number of blades. The spoil was deposited {{on either side of the}} trench, wings on the <b>plough</b> <b>blade</b> pushing the spoil away from the edge of the trench to prevent it from falling back in. Hopkins presented this conception together with a static model to Churchill via Sir Stanley Goodall. Churchill approved the scheme and gave permission for development of a prototype to begin with an initial grant of £1,000,000.|$|E
50|$|By {{removing}} {{large and}} moderate size stones {{from the surface}} and sub-surface, ploughing can take place with much less potential damage taking place to the <b>plough</b> <b>blade.</b> Stones also prevent the growth of plants where they physically block access to the soil and their removal allows for a greater surface area for crops to grow and to allow for plants to grow to their full potential; Stones also increase drainage and may therefore deprive plants of moisture. Stones were removed from fields {{to allow for the}} efficient use of hand tools, animal powered machines on such fields in the past and for tractors, etc. in more recent times. Some prehistoric clearance cairns may also contain burials. A few clearance cairns may have been additionally created as boundary markers. As ploughing developed and specialised the greater depth tilled and the increased power of mechanised ploughing resulted in more and larger stones being brought to the surface and these too had to be removed.Field clearance cairns sometimes survive long after cleared fields have fallen out of use and are often the only surviving evidence of past agricultural activity in areas of woodland, upland areas, etc. The existence of these cairns was once regarded as suggesting pastoral farming, many now consider them the result of arable or mixed agricultural exploitation enabling ploughing or hand tillage to work more efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Simple {{ballistic}} armor was sometimes constructed by criminals. During the 1880s, {{a gang of}} Australian bushrangers led by Ned Kelly made basic armour from <b>plough</b> <b>blades.</b> By this time the Victorian Government had a reward for the capture {{of a member of}} the Kelly Gang at £8,000 (equivalent to 2 million Australian dollars in 2005). One of the stated aims of Kelly was the establishment of a Republic in North East Victoria. Each of the four Kelly gang members had fought a siege at a hotel clad in suits of armour made from the mouldboards of ploughs. The maker's stamp (Lennon Number 2 Type) was found inside several of the plates. The armour covered the mens' torsos, upper arms, and upper legs, and was worn with a helmet. The suits were roughly made on a creek bed using a makeshift forge and a stringy-bark log as a muffled anvil. The suits had a mass of around 44 kg (96 lb), making the wearer a spectacular sight, but greatly hampering movement. In a police raid at Glenrowan, the Kelly Gang armour deflected many hits with none penetrating, but eventually was of no use as the suits lacked protection for the legs and hands.|$|R

Microhardness of individual structural components was also measured. The analysis was processed on a metallographic microscope. The individual tests of abrasive resistance are divided between interaction of two objects and a combination of abrasive erosive wear. Laboratory tests were performed on an abrasive cloth (ČSN 01 5084) and in Bond’s drum apparatus (this experiment is not standardized).

In a 4 - 1 mixer, calcium carbonate with mean size 45 mum was granulated using a 50 wt. % solution of glycerol and water as binding fluid, and particle movement was followed using a 600 -mum calcium hydroxy-phosphate tracer particle. In a 20 - 1 mixer, dry powder flow was studied using a 600 -mum resin bead tracer particle {{to simulate the}} bulk polypropylene powder with mean size 600 mum. Important differences were seen between particle {{flow patterns}} for wet and dry systems. Particle speed relative to blade speed was lower in the wet system than in the dry system, with the ratios of average particle speed to blade tip speed for all experiments in the range 0. 01 - 015. In the axial plane, the same particle motion was observed around each blade; this provides a significant advance for modelling flow in ploughshare mixers. For the future, a detailed understanding of the local velocity, acceleration and density variations around a <b>plough</b> <b>blade</b> will reveal the effects of flow patterns in granulating systems on the resultant distribution of granular product attributes such as size, density and strength.

40|$|Poor {{establishment}} {{is the most}} common reason for failure of pasture legumes sown into existing grass pastures on commercial farms in the sub-tropics. Although good {{establishment is}} recognised as critical to the long term productivity and persistence of legumes, most producers use low-cost and low-reliability establishment techniques such as broadcasting after either no or minimal pasture disturbance; one-pass cultivation with seed spread at the same time; or severe soil disturbance and a rough seed bed behind a <b>blade</b> <b>plough.</b> This paper reports the results of a study designed to test the impact of different fallow periods (medium – 4 months; short – 2 months; disturb at sowing and no disturbance); seedbed preparation cultivation or zero tillage); drilling or broadcasting seed and post emergence herbicides when establishing legumes into existing grass pastures. The most common, commercially used establishment techniques of sowing legume seed into grass pastures with no disturbance or single pass cultivation treatments at sowing all resulted in establishment failure. Spraying at sowing resulted in adequate numbers of legumes. Short or medium fallows resulted in similar densities of legumes between all treatments, however treatments with greater control of the grass and post emergence weed control grew better which resulted in more seedling recruitment in the subsequent year. At 25 months after sowing only fallowed treatments with Spinnaker® post-emergence weed control achieved legume numbers above benchmark figures for establishment success. The study demonstrates that agronomic practices commonly used for grain cropping (such as fallowing to store soil moisture) can improve the reliability of establishing legumes into existing grass pastures...|$|R
40|$|A plough is {{typically}} used by fine binders to trim a textblock to produce smooth, even edges. A book {{is placed in}} the press of the <b>plough</b> and a <b>blade</b> is drawn perpendicular to the book {{along the length of the}} textblock, slicing through it a few sheets at a time. For conservation purposes, a plough (or guillotine) is used to trim off the damaged spine of adhesive-bound books in preparation for rebinding using the double fan adhesive method (DFA). The DFA method deposits tiny amounts of glue on either side of individual pages, essentially tipping them to each other, therefore a smoothly trimmed spine edge is crucial for this binding’s success and mechanical stability. A DFA bound book has a very strong and flexible textblock that will remain more resilient than commercial adhesive bindings which are prone to failing, especially under heavy use. Hybrid or general collections labs that rebind large quantities of books using the DFA method will typically invest in a guillotine or plough which can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Working in a primarily special collections lab, the only opportunity I have to perform this type of rebinding is when one of our reference books becomes damaged and/or the original binding has failed. Therefore, I could not justify spending hundreds of dollars for a piece of equipment that may be used only a few times per year, regardless of how handy it would be.

Four hours of ploughing work {{was carried out}} continuously during morning session. Physiological responses such as heart rate (HR), pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (RR) per minute, ruminal motility (RM) per five minutes and rectal temperature (RT) in degree Fahrenheit were recorded before and after ploughing work.

40|$|Abstract]: Odour impacts from ‘broiler’ {{farms are}} a major issue facing the Australian meat chicken industry. Urban {{encroachment}} into traditionally rural areas, as well as intensification of the broiler farms in recent times, have exacerbated the problem. This issue is placing poultry producers under increasing pressure to control and reduce odour emissions. At present, there are three main categories which deal with the treatment or mitigation of the odour emissions from broiler sheds: 1. Using dispersion to dilute odour before reaching sensitive receptors; 2. Preventing odours from reaching the outside environment (eg: by using an odour treatment system); and 3. Preventing the production of odours at the source (ie: within the broiler house). Odour dispersion is used as the primary method for preventing odour impacts. When broiler farms are built, appropriate separation distances must be maintained between the farm and neighbours. If large separation distances are required, the costs for purchasing large parcels of land can be significant. Treatment of odour leaving the broiler shed is not currently a viable option due to excessive cost {{and a lack of}} available technology. Perhaps {{the most effective way to}} reduce odour impacts, at reasonable cost, is to prevent the generation of odours at the source, that is, within the broiler house. Aeration of the litter is one technique that may be able to reduce the generation of odours within the broiler house by preventing the formation of anaerobic zones within the litter. Anaerobic zones are believed to be responsible for significant odour generation. The aim of this project is to test the efficacy of an automated plough system to regularly disrupt and aerate the litter. Several plough designs were investigated. Two designs that were investigated in detail were a <b>blade</b> <b>plough,</b> which runs underneath the litter, and a paddlewheel plough, which rotates while moving through the litter and causes significant disturbance of the litter material. Both theoretical systems would be powered by an electric motor installed at one end of the shed connected to a fully reversible winch system to pull the plough through the litter. Each plough system was designed to meet the following requirements: • Ease of operation; • Low maintenance and cleaning requirements; • Minimal impact upon the chickens; • Compliance with workplace heath and safety requirements; • Low infrastructure and operating costs; and • Effective odour reduction. These systems were modeled using the solid modelling package ProEngineer, Wildfire V 2. 0 and engineering analysis was performed on each of the designs. Reduction of odour generation was not assessed during this investigation...|$|R
40|$|Permanent {{raised bed}} (PRB) farming systems combine several {{elements}} (e. g. reduced tillage, controlled traffic, stubble retention) of conservation agriculture. PRB systems {{have recently been}} introduced into irrigated areas {{but there is a}} lack of information on the agronomic and irrigation performance of these systems under these conditions. Three years of field research into the performance of irrigated PRBs was conducted in south east Queensland, Australia and north west Pakistan. These studies benchmarked the irrigation performance of variously sized PRB systems and explored the impact of bed renovation method (no tillage (NT), shallow cultivation (SC) and <b>blade</b> <b>ploughing</b> (BP)) on soil hydro-physical properties (bulk density, soil moisture storage, infiltration), irrigation performance, crop yield and input water productivity (WP). Irrigation management strategies to improve lateral infiltration and irrigation performance were also investigated. The initial benchmarking study was conducted on two farms with clayey Vertisol (Australia) and three farms with sandy clay loam, Alfisol, (Pakistan) soils. The results showed low irrigation performance with excessive deep drainage potential. The irrigation application efficiency (Ea) on the clayey Vertisol and sandy clay loam was as low as 68 % and 50 %, requirement efficiency (Er) 96 % and 77 % and distribution uniformity (DU) 86 % and 66 %, respectively. However, the majority of the narrow beds (66 cm furrow spacing) were over-irrigated on the sandy clay loam while the wide beds (132 cm furrow spacing) were under-irrigated. Inappropriate renovation and bed furrow dimensions, sub-optimal irrigation management and poor lateral infiltration were the main factors likely to affect WP of irrigated PRBs. The evaluation of bed renovation methods found that BP on the clayey Vertisol reduced (~ 6 %) the average seasonal bulk density of the surface 0 - 30 cm compared to the NT treatment. BP was found to produce higher lateral infiltration into the beds than either NT or SC. Freshly applied BP and SC produced a higher (~ 23 %) cumulative infiltration than NT but the effect was transient and was not significant in the following season when the PRB renovation treatments were not freshly applied. The SC beds slump more than the BP and NT beds. The soil water content in the beds indicated that there was increased water storage associated with BP. PRB renovation (i. e. SC or BP) was found to reduce irrigation performance on the clayey Vertisol when the irrigation was farmer managed. The volume of irrigation water applied to the fresh SC and BP treatments increased by up 13 % and 55 %, and Ea was reduced by up to 9 % and 29 % respectively, compared with NT during the 2010 wheat and 2011 corn seasons. NT produced a higher wheat yield and WP, but the lower wheat yield in the cultivated treatments was associated with poor crop establishment from a rough soil surface and inadequate seeder performance in this season. In the subsequent seasons, there was no significant difference in either the crop yields or WP between the bed renovation treatments. Field trials investigating the effect of bed renovation on infiltration were conducted on both soils. Significant differences in the amount of water infiltrated and stored in the bed shoulder and bed middle were found for periods of wetting consistent with normal irrigation practices. This suggests that the general assumption of uniform soil moisture distribution across the beds is not valid for wide PRB systems. The three different renovation methods also significantly affected lateral infiltration, suggesting tillage may be used as a management tool to improve bed wetting in low infiltration soils and subsided beds. Infiltration and soil-water movement were simulated using Hydrus 2 D. The simulations were found to be well correlated with the measured field data and an evaluation for the three PRB renovation methods confirmed that NT had the slowest, and BP the fastest, potential to wet the bed middle of the wide PRBs. Increasing the furrow water head from 4 cm to furrow full of water was also shown to reduce wetting time by more than 30 %. Lateral infiltration was poor in the sandy clay loam. The shortest wetting time (~ 15 hrs) required to wet the bed middle of a 132 cm wide bed to field capacity occurred when furrow full water head was applied to the BP treated bed. However, even this period of wetting may be difficult to achieve using current irrigation practices in Pakistan. The graphical model outputs developed can be used in developing guidelines to optimise bed width and irrigation management to ensure adequate lateral infiltration with different PRB renovation methods. Strategies to optimise irrigation management and field design while ensuring adequate lateral infiltration into the bed middle were evaluated using the surface irrigation model SIRMOD. Optimising the inflow rate (Q) and the time to cut-off (Tco) for the particular field length was found to produce up to a 38 % irrigation water saving compared with existing practices. However, the majority of the wide beds on the sandy clay loam required higher inflow volumes than currently applied, which increased Er but reduced Ea. Optimising furrow length indicated a further improvement in irrigation performance. Similarly, Q and Tco optimisation together showed up to 35 % irrigation water saving and up to 33 % improved Ea for the most sub-optimally managed BP treatment. Decreased furrow length improved irrigation performance for freshly renovated PRB, while irrigation performance of settled bed furrows tended to increase with increased furrow length. Relating optimum Tco to water advance to furrow tail end (Ta) was sensitive to furrow length, Q and soil infiltration functions. The decision support guidelines developed were helpful in improving existing irrigation performance under both soil conditions. This research has shown that the existing irrigation performance of PRBs is often low and highly variable. A key constraint is the potential for poor lateral infiltration into the beds and inadequate wetting to the centre of wide beds. However, this work has also highlighted that the adoption of appropriate bed renovation methods (particularly BP) and irrigation management practices (e. g. Q and Tco) can substantially improve irrigation performance and input WP. Although the applicability of the specific decision support tools developed is restricted to the soil types and field conditions encountered, the general understanding and insight into the basic principles of performance optimisation and for agronomic and irrigation interactions is expected to be beneficial in refining understanding and the promotion of sustainable crop production under a wider range of environmental conditions. ...|$|R
