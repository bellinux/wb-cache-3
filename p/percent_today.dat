25|$|The {{share of}} thermal {{participation}} in generation has increased since the mid-1990s. This {{has happened in}} response to the 1992/1993 crisis caused by El Niño-Southern Oscillation associated droughts and the high reliance of power generation on hydroelectric installations that lacked multi-year storage capacity. As a result of the new policies adopted by the country, the dominance of hydropower in the generation portfolio has been reduced from 80 percent in the early 1990s to less than 65 <b>percent</b> <b>today.</b> The expansion path involved adding 1,500 MW of new capacity, equally distributed between hydro and thermal sources, by 2011.

50|$|Much of {{the push}} to develop foreign markets for Pascual Boing {{products}} has come from competition inside Mexico from multinational companies.
