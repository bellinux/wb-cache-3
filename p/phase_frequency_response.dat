To study the dynamic testing performance of the system in the conditions of high natural frequency, one of the effective methods is establishing the mathematical model of dynamic response of test system. By improving specific algorithm of the conventional nonlinear modal fitting method, algorithm of transfer function which is aiming at this test system is deduced, and the transfer function of dynamic response is obtained by using amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> curve which is measured by using a piezoelectric test device and the curve is compared with the measured amplitude and phase frequency curve.

Laplace transform methods are employed to obtain temperature transfer functions (for pipes) and transfer matrices (for heat exchangers). Using a power series approximation {{for the individual}} transfer functions of a heat exchanger transfer matrix, Fourier transforms (in Euler form) are obtained for evaluation of frequency response. Using these models, analysis of multiple heat exchanger systems is {{described in terms of}} multiplication of a sequence of suitable transfer matrices (either geometric or causal). The effect of piping on temperatures in heat exchanger systems is shown to be negligible in the steady state and dependent on the static effectiveness of the individual heat exchangers of the system in the transient state. For analysis of load changes in process design, it is suggested that dynamics of heat exchanger systems be characterized by the overall steady state gain and a single time constant (for each transfer function) determined by evaluation of the <b>phase</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> of the heat exchanger system...|$|E
30|$|The {{method is}} based on {{comparisons}} between teleseismic surface wave records at a target station and those at multiple surrounding reference stations, from which we calculate three index parameters and evaluate in situ instrumentation conditions, including amplitude and phase responses against input ground motions. In our experiments, we applied the proposed method to F-net broadband seismometers covering the Japanese Islands, where station intervals are approximately 100  km. This allows us, through calculations of the index parameters, to evaluate instrumentation health at each station at least once every 60  days. Using our proposed method, we found that approximately 75 % of the evaluated index parameters distributed well around the standard values, and for most examined broadband seismometers, response anomalies are not detected at the period range of 50 to 200  s. However, instrumentation errors, such as gain decrease over the evaluated periods and gradual changes in amplitude and phase frequency responses (sometimes covering several years) were identified at a few stations. Additionally, overdamping errors at the STS- 1 seismometers, which experience significant amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> variations around the 360 -s corner, {{appear to have been}} common at several stations.

30|$|In this study, we {{systematically}} {{evaluate the}} F-net broadband seismometer responses over a 50 to 200 -s period range based on comparisons of seismic surface waves resulting from teleseismic earthquakes observed at a target station with those observed at multiple surrounding stations. In our proposed method, seismograms at {{stations around the}} target station are used as references to evaluate the seismometer condition at the target station. The target periods {{are included in the}} bandwidth used for F-net routine regional CMT analysis. The high station density of F-net enables us to correlate waveform data observed at multiple nearby stations in the period range. The availability of records from multiple surrounding stations provides multiple references that allow us to evaluate the target instrumentation response free from possible instrument response errors at a few surrounding stations. This method is independent of the synthetic waveform calculations (Ekström et al. 2006), that is, CMT solution estimations, which are difficult to obtain from regional network data alone, and the uncertainty of Earth’s model assumptions. Since background noise levels can be varied not only by deviations of instrument amplitude responses against input ground motions but also by deviations of the background noises themselves, including instrument noise, noise resulting from the installation of the instrument, and ambient seismic noise, it is impossible to infer the effects of observed noise level changes on ground motion record from noise monitoring (Ringler et al. 2010) alone. However, we can remove this ambiguity using seismic surface waves with significantly large amplitudes. In addition to verifying that most seismometers have responses that agree well with their reports, we could confirm that, at a small subset of stations, some types of instrument response errors have been issued for several years. Hereafter, among the revealed instrument errors, we will refer to the shift of amplitude frequency response curve (where the gain changes are constant over the evaluated periods) as the gain change and to the changes in the shape of amplitude and/or <b>phase</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> curves as the change in amplitude and/or phase frequency responses. We will also discuss the difference of the response errors between STS- 1 and STS- 2 seismometers.|$|E
