5|$|Following Chicken Fries' discontinuation, {{there was}} a call for the product's {{reinstatement}} from fans of the product on forums such as Reddit; Business Insider noted that {{they are one of}} the 17 most requested fast products that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see returned to menus. Fans of the product also established several social media accounts dedicated to Chicken Fries' return on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Additionally, a Change.org petition was created that called on Burger King to reinstate the product to its menu. Perez Hilton's web site declared that Chicken Fries are one product of many that will never come back, while comedian Daniel Tosh featured a skit during one of the segments of his show, Tosh.0, to the product's return. They were re-released in August 2014 as a limited time offering (LTO). The return of the product met with a favorable reaction from those who were advocating for Chicken Fries to return to the Burger King menu. There was disappointment from these groups as well because of the product's status as a limited time offering. In March 2015, Burger King permanently re-added Chicken Fries to the menu in a large, international menu expansion in thirty countries.|$|E

Facebook support for a presidential bid drew comparisons with Barack Obama's campaign for the American presidency. Norris topped multiple opinion polls as the person most Irish <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see as their next president (with the caveat that these polls have been taken before all candidates have declared). Internal research by Fine Gael also placed Norris ahead of all other potential candidates.|$|E

25|$|The {{complexity}} class P {{is often}} seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm. This hypothesis is called the Cobham–Edmonds thesis. The complexity class NP, on the other hand, contains many problems that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the Boolean satisfiability problem, the Hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem. Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. <b>People</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

500|$|An initial {{pilot of}} the show was ordered in 2003 by ITV, from {{production}} company FremantleMedia, and was commissioned by Claudia Rosencrantz, who was the controller of entertainment at ITV at the time. It was presented by Brian Conley, but was not broadcast; a series was not produced. Rosencrantz spoke of the pilot in 2011, [...] "I didn't believe <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see someone win a vast sum of money, with no skills at all involved. Second, gambling is not a spectator sport, you get an adrenaline rush from participating in it." [...] Richard Holloway, who worked with FremantleMedia {{at the time of}} producing the pilot, said, [...] "It was a novel idea, you could win a million pounds eventually, I was surprised it didn't go to series." [...] Rosencrantz left ITV in 2006, {{and there has been a}} significant turnover in staff since the pilot was originally put together.|$|E

Historian and {{television}} presenter Dan Snow described the show's modus operandi as [...] "one step above Blackadder, but that's fine... it plays to stereotypes, but it's fantastic as entry-level history." [...] Writing in The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe noted that [...] "As a grown-up you might quibble {{with the fact that}} they don't always distinguish between things that genuinely are true and the things that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be (sadly, there's no hard evidence that Aeschylus was brained by a tortoise dropped by an overflying eagle)", but added that [...] "children and adults alike should enjoy the gleefully anachronistic way in which the information is presented."

In his darkroom, Fellig shows Scully a photo of a dead woman with an odd fuzzy shape around her head, which the photographer claims is Death. When asked why he bothers to try to photograph Death, Fellig says that it is so he can look Death in the face and finally die. He claims to be 149 years old, and says he cannot kill himself. Scully points out that most <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> live forever, but Fellig says that he has experienced everything, and that even love does not last forever. Suddenly, he notices that Scully is gray, and says, [...] "Count your blessings." [...] When she asks about the science of his immortality, he says he was meant to die of yellow fever, but he refused to look Death in the face, so instead Death took the kind nurse who had taken care of him. [...] Fellig takes a photo just as Ritter enters and shoots. The bullet passes right through the camera and through Fellig into Scully, who collapses. While Ritter rushes to call an ambulance, Fellig asks Scully whether she saw Death and begs her to close her eyes. He covers her hand with his own. The color returns to Scully's hand as Fellig's turns gray. Looking up, he dies.|$|E

In the 2007 Japanese Newtype magazine poll, Ichigo was ranked {{one of the best}} male anime characters.

Wizard Entertainment considered Ichigo the best hero from 2007, commenting that he doesn't try to be a typical hero but he fights in order to protect his friends. He was also 20th in IGN's [...] "Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time" [...] with comments focused on his design and personality. Ichigo has also appeared twice in the Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking {{as one of the most}} popular male anime characters. At the first Seiyu Awards in March 2007, Masakazu Morita won in the category [...] "Best Rookie Actor" [...] for his role as Ichigo Kurosaki. Ichigo's voice actor in the English adaptation, Johnny Yong Bosch, has also been praised for his voice work on Ichigo's character by Anime News Network (ANN), which favorably compared Bosch and Morita's work. Various merchandise based on Ichigo's appearance has been created, including action figures, plush toys and key-chains. Since the series was released, replica models of Ichigo's Zanpakutō and Bankai have been produced for purchase by collectors and fans.|$|E

The events <b>people</b> <b>would</b> most <b>like</b> <b>to</b> forget are unpleasant and emotional. This study used a directed forgetting procedure with emotional and neutral pictures to examine whether people can intentionally forget emotional events as easily as mundane ones. When the to-be-forgotten list was neutral, participants showed successful intentional forgetting. But when the to-be-forgotten list was emotional, directed forgetting failed. Results contribute to understanding the ways that emotion constrains mental control by capturing mental processes including memory retrieval.

Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that [...] "Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all." [...] One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common. Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task. Groups prefer leaders who are elected, democratic, and prototypical of the group, and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation. A general aversion to autocratic leadership exists, although it may be an effective solution, possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption.|$|E
