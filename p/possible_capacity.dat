40|$|We define an {{aggregation}} {{function to}} be (at most) k-intolerant {{if it is}} bounded from above by its kth lowest input value. Applying this definition to the discrete Choquet integral and its underlying capacity, we introduce the concept of k-intolerant capacities which, when varying k from 1 to n, cover all the <b>possible</b> <b>capacities</b> on n objects. Just as the concepts of k-additive capacities and p-symmetric capacities have been previously introduced essentially to overcome the problem of computational complexity of capacities, k-intolerant capacities are proposed here for the same purpose but also for dealing with intolerant or tolerant behaviors of aggregation. We also introduce axiomatically indices to appraise {{the extent to which}} a given capacity is k-intolerant and we apply them on a particular recruiting problem...|$|R

40|$|I {{am trying}} to express my own concept of the {{solution}} to the European energy dependance, which has been constantly growing for several years. While analyzing the main resources of energy available at the time, I've come to a conclusion that nuclear energy and renewable resources tend to be the most proper sources of energy in order to stop or even decrease the energy dependance rate of the EU. After analyzing the economic use and <b>possible</b> <b>capacities</b> of the proposed resources, it has occured to me that even their further implementation would lead to a decline in above mentioned energy dependance rate of EU. At the same time, it would consequently reduce the prices of the energy in the European Union, not mentioning the ecological profits of such resources...|$|R
40|$|The system {{capacity}} of a flow network is the maximum flow from source to destination and is deterministic. If all the arcs and nodes of any network {{have a number of}} <b>possible</b> <b>capacities</b> and may fail then the probability that the maximum flow of a commodity is either greater or equal to a given demand is an important performance measure of the quality of such networks. The paper presents a continuous genetic algorithm to evaluate the reliability of such a multicommodity stochastic-flow network under budget constraints. The algorithm is based on generating all minimal capacity vectors satisfying the given demand and budget constraints, the system reliability is determined in terms of the minimal capacity vectors. The proposed algorithm can be easily applied to larger networks due to its better temporal efficiency...|$|R
