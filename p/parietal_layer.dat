25|$|A serous {{membrane}} (also {{referred to as}} a serosa) is a thin membrane that covers the walls of organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The {{serous membrane}}s have two layers; parietal and visceral, surrounding a fluid filled space. The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organ (the viscera), and the <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> lines the walls of the body cavity (pariet- refers to a cavity wall). Between the parietal and visceral layers is a very thin, fluid-filled serous space, or cavity. For example, the pericardium is the serous cavity which surrounds the heart.|$|E

50|$|A serous {{membrane}} (also {{referred to as}} a serosa) is one of the thin membranes that cover the walls and some organs of the thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities. Serous membranes have two <b>layers.</b> The <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> of the membranes line the walls of the body cavity (pariet- refers to a cavity wall). The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organs (the viscera). Between the <b>parietal</b> and visceral <b>layers</b> is a very thin, fluid-filled serous space, or cavity.|$|R
50|$|The {{peritoneum}} develops ultimately {{from the}} mesoderm of the trilaminar embryo. As the mesoderm differentiates, one region {{known as the}} lateral plate mesoderm splits to form two layers separated by an intraembryonic coelom. These two layers develop later into the visceral and <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> found in all serous cavities, including the peritoneum.|$|R
50|$|In Protostomes, the coelom forms by {{a process}} known as schizocoely. The archenteron {{initially}} forms, and the mesoderm splits into two layers: the first attaches to the body wall or ectoderm, forming the <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> and the second surrounds the endoderm or alimentary canal forming the visceral layer. The space between the <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> and the visceral layer is known as the coelom or body cavity.|$|E
50|$|The lateral plate {{mesoderm}} splits into parietal (somatic) and visceral (splanchnic) layers. The {{formation of}} these layers {{starts with the}} appearance of intercellular cavities. The somatic layer depends on a continuous layer with mesoderm that covers the amnion. The splanchnic depends on a continuous layer that covers the yolk sac. The two layers cover the intraembryonic cavity. The <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> together with overlying ectoderm forms the lateral body wall folds. The visceral layer forms the walls of the gut tube. Mesoderm cells of the <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> form the mesothelial membranes or serous membranes which line the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial cavities.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very young}} anther {{consists}} of actively dividing meristematic cells {{surrounded by a}} layer of epidermis. It then becomes two-lobed. Each anther lobe develops two pollen sacs. Thus, a two-lobed anther develops four pollen sacs situated at {{four corners of the}} anther.Development of pollen sacs begins with the differentiation of archesporial cells in the hypodermal region below epidermis at four corners of the young anther. The archesporial cells divide by periclinal division to give a subepidermal primary <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> and a primary sporogenous layer. The cells of the primary <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> divide by successive periclinal and anticlinal divisions to form concentric layers of pollen sac wall.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative {{description of the}} starch distribution in the anthers, microspores and pollen grains of Aechmea recurvata, Dyckia racinae and Tillandsia aeranthos. Flowers {{at different stages of}} development were processed according to plant microtechniques for observation by light microscope. Ten stages of embryological development were used as references for the comparative analysis of starch distribution and dynamics. The structural data showed a greater starch accumulation in the <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> and connective of D. racinae. It was observed that in the species studied, starch began to accumulate in microspore mother cell stage. The pollen grains in D. racinae and in T. aeran-thos present two amylo genesis-amylolysis cycles, while A. recurvata presents only one. One amylogenesis-amylolysis cycle occurs in the <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> and/or connective tissue in all three species. The pollen grains in the three species are dispersed without starch and are characterized as the starchless type. Starch dynamics {{presents a}} close relation to the development of sporangia, microspores and pollen grains. It is believed that differences in the starch distribution and accumulation are related to the abiotic factors where the species are found...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac tamponade is the {{phenomenon}} of hemodynamic compromise caused by a pericardial effusion. Following a myocardial infarction, the most common causes of pericardial fluid include early pericarditis, Dressler's syndrome, and hemopericardium secondary to a free wall rupture. On transthoracic echocardiography, pericardial fluid appears as an echo-free space in between the visceral and <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> of the pericardium. Pericardial fat has a similar appearance on echocardiography {{and it may be}} difficult to discern the two entities.

50|$|The visceral layer {{extends to}} the {{beginning}} of the great vessels (the large blood vessels serving the heart) becoming one with the <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> of the serous pericardium.

30|$|Hydrocele, an {{abnormal}} collection of fluid between the visceral and <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> of the tunica vaginalis and/or along the spermatic cord, {{is the most}} common cause of painless scrotal swelling in children. In the normal scrotum, 1 – 2 mL of serous fluid may be observed in the potential tunica vaginalis cavity and should not be mistaken for hydrocele. Virtually all hydroceles are congenital in neonates and infants and associated with a patent processus vaginalis, which allows peritoneal fluid to enter the scrotal sac [25]. Up to 50 % of acquired hydroceles are due to trauma [26], and hydroceles may occur in up to 25 % of patients with major trauma [27].|$|R

While vertical rectus abdominis muscle (V-RAM) flaps {{can fill}} the pelvic resection space with health tissue, their use {{has previously been}} described predominantly in association with laparotomy. Here, we describe a means of combination laparoscopic APR with V-RAM flap reconstruction that allows structural preservation of the entire abdominal wall throughout the oncological resection and of the deep <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> after V-RAM donation. Furthermore, a single port access device used at the end colostomy site allows a second senior surgeon assist with an additional two working instruments {{for the purpose of}} improved pelvic tissue retraction, especially useful in obese patients...|$|R
50|$|In anatomy, serous {{membrane}} (or serosa) is a smooth tissue membrane {{consisting of two}} layers of mesothelium, which secrete serous fluid. The inner layer that covers organs (viscera) in body cavities is called the visceral membrane; this inner layer of epithelial cells {{is followed by a}} connective tissue; after the connective tissue is the second layer of epithelial cells of the {{serous membrane}} called the <b>parietal</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pleural fluid is {{secreted}} by the <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> of the pleura and reabsorbed by the lymphatics in {{the most}} dependent parts of the parietal pleura, primarily the diaphragmatic and mediastinal regions. Exudative pleural effuisions occur when the pleura is damaged, e.g., by trauma, infection or malignancy, and transudative pleural effusions develop when there is either excessive production of pleural fluid or the resorption capacity is reduced.|$|E
50|$|The serous {{cavities}} {{are formed}} from the intraembryonic coelom and are basically an empty space {{within the body}} surrounded by serous membrane. Early in embryonic life visceral organs develop adjacent to a cavity and invaginate into the bag-like coelom. Therefore, each organ becomes surrounded by serous membrane - they do not lie within the serous cavity. The layer {{in contact with the}} organ is known as the visceral layer, while the <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> is in contact with the body wall.|$|E
3000|$|Hematoceles {{is similar}} to hydroceles, hematoceles are complex {{collections}} that separate the visceral and <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> of the tunica vaginalis. Like hematomas, they are acutely echogenic and become more complex and more hypoechoic with age. Subacute and chronic hematoceles may contain fluid-fluid levels or low-level internal echoes. Hematomas may occur in intra-testicular locations or in extra-testicular soft tissues such as the scrotal wall or epididymis. The lesions are usually focal, may be multiple, and may be hyperechoic (in acute bleeding) or hypoechoic (as the hemorrhage ages) and lack vascularity [...]. The fluid in a complex hematoma may be heterogeneous. Hematomas of the scrotal wall may appear as focal thickening of the wall or as fluid collections within the wall.|$|R
40|$|Pneumatosis intestinalis is a {{radiological}} {{sign that}} represents the presence of gas between the <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> of a bowel loop. Although frequently related {{to the presence of}} a necrotizing condition of the bowel, it can be found in benign conditions, and is classified as primary or idiopathic (15 % of cases) or secondary (85 % of cases) (1). In idiopathic pneumatosis intestinalis there are multiple thin walled cysts containing gas on the submucosa or subserosa of the bowel wall. Secondary conditions are related to the interaction of factors, such as loss of mucosal integrity, changes in bacterial flora and increased intraluminal pressure. Among the causes of secondary pneumatosis intestinalis, intestinal obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, ischemia or infarction, sepsis...|$|R
40|$|Abdominal wall leiomyomas are a rare {{finding and}} {{are thought to}} follow seeding {{following}} surgical resection of uterine fibroids. There is paucity of findings of isolated abdominal wall fibroids in the literature without previous surgeries for myomectomies or presence of uterine fibroids. We present {{a case of a}} 34 -year-old parous lady with no previous abdominal or gynecological surgeries presenting with a periumbilical lump of 1 year duration. The operative findings revealed a large mass in the <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> of the anterior abdominal wall attached to the right rectus sheath with no intra-abdominal attachments. Histopathology revealed features suggestive of a leiomyoma.

50|$|A serous {{membrane}} (also {{referred to as}} a serosa) is a thin membrane that covers the walls of organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities.

50|$|The cavum vaginale is {{the cavity}} of the tunica vaginalis. The {{testicle}} hangs suspended in a space, the cavum vaginale, from which is separated by the visceral {{layer of the}} tunica vaginalis. The latter is continued on to the epididymis, at the lateral margins {{of which it is}} reflected forward as the <b>parietal</b> <b>layer,</b> and as this is more extensive than the visceral layer, the cavum vaginale-named cavity results. The testicle is enclosed in a thick capsule of fibrous tissue, the tunica albuginea. The tunica albuginea sends prolongations inwards, dividing the testicle into lobules. Each lobule contains the seminiferous tubules, extending from the base where they end blindly, towards the apex.|$|E
30|$|The pericardial sac {{is formed}} by the pleuropericardial folds that grow from the lateral body wall in a coronal plane. These septae appear at the {{beginning}} of the fifth week of embryonic development as broad folds of mesenchyme that grow medially towards each other and eventually fuse to separate the pleural and pericardial cavities [4]. The pericardium contains the heart and juxtacardiac portions of the great vessels, and it is composed of an outer fibrous pericardium and an inner, double-layered sac, the serous pericardium [5]. The pericardial space lies between the visceral and <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> of the serous pericardium and contains approximately 15 – 50  ml of serous fluid produced by the mesothelial cells that line the serosa. This fluid facilitates freedom of movement of the heart within the pericardium.|$|R
40|$|AbstractConstrictive {{pericarditis}} {{is caused}} by adhesions between the visceral and <b>parietal</b> <b>layers</b> of the pericardium and progressive pericardial fibrosis that restricts diastolic filling of the heart. Later on, the thickened pericardium may calcify. Despite {{a better understanding of}} the pathophysiologic basis of the imaging findings in constrictive pericarditis and the recent advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, which has dramatically improved the visualization of the pericardium, the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis remains a challenge in many cases. In patients with clinical suspicion of underlying constrictive pericarditis, the most important radiologic diagnostic feature is abnormal pericardial thickening, which can be shown readily by computed tomography (CT) and especially by MRI, and is highly suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Nevertheless, a thickened pericardium does not always indicate constrictive pericarditis. Furthermore, constrictive pericarditis can occur without pericardial thickening...|$|R
40|$|The tapetal {{cells in}} trifoliate orange were studied prior to liberation of pollen grains under light and {{transmission}} electron microscopes. The tapetum was glandular or secretory type {{and consisted of}} two-layered flattened cells immediately below the 2 - 3 <b>layered</b> elongated <b>parietal</b> cells and anther wall. It surrounded the pollen sacs where numerous pollen grains were embedded freely. Many sporopollenin-like granules appeared throughout the tapetal zone releasing from the territory of tapetum and <b>parietal</b> <b>layers.</b> These granules moved through the intercellular spaces and found their ways towards the pollen grains which were finally absorbed by the bacula of grain walls. The multi-layered rough endoplasmic reticulum appeared near these absorption sites. The tapetal cells were devoid of distinct walls or they had only very thin envelopes. The tapetal cytoplasm contained highly dense, irregularly dense and less dense granules within different vesicles...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the third}} week, the neural tube, which is a fold of one of the layers of the trilaminar germ disc, called the ectoderm, appears. This layer elevates and closes dorsally, while the gut tube rolls up and closes ventrally to create a “tube on top of a tube.” The mesoderm, which is another layer of the trilaminar germ disc, holds the tubes {{together}} and the lateral plate mesoderm, the middle layer of the germ disc, splits to form a visceral layer associated with the gut and a <b>parietal</b> <b>layer,</b> which along with the overlying ectoderm, forms the lateral body wall. The space between the visceral and parietal layers of lateral plate mesoderm is the primitive body cavity. When the lateral body wall folds, it moves ventrally and fuses at the midline. The body cavity closes, except in the region of the connecting stalk. Here, the gut tube maintains an attachment to the yolk sac. The yolk sac is a membranous sac attached to the embryo, which provides nutrients and functions as the circulatory system of the very early embryo.|$|E
50|$|The lateral body wall folds, {{pulling the}} amnion in with {{it so that}} the amnion {{surrounds}} the embryo and extends over the connecting stalk, which becomes the umbilical cord, which connects the fetus with the placenta. If the ventral body wall fails to close, ventral body wall defects can resulst, such as ectopia cordis, a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located outside the thorax. Another defect is gastroschisis, a congenital defect in the anterior abdominal wall through which the abdominal contents freely protrude. Another possibility is bladder exstrophy, in which part of the urinary bladder is present outside the body. In normal circumstances, the parietal mesoderm will form the <b>parietal</b> <b>layer</b> of serous membranes lining the outside (walls) of the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities. The visceral layer will form the visceral layer of the serous membranes covering the lungs, heart, and abdominal organs. These layers are continuous at the root of each organ as the organs lie in their respective cavities. The peritoneum, a serum membrane that forms the lining of the abdominal cavity, forms in the gut layers and in places mesenteries extend from the gut as double layers of peritoneum. Mesenteries provide a pathway for vessels, nerves, and lymphatics to the organs. Initially, the gut tube from the caudal end of the foregut {{to the end of the}} hindgut is suspended from the dorsal body wall by dorsal mesentery. Ventral mesentery, derived from the septum transversum, exists only in the region of the terminal part of the esophagus, the stomach, and the upper portion of the duodenum.|$|E

All the above cells bind antimyosin-like antibodies. Considering the correspondence between the immunochemical and ultrastructural findings, it is suggested that the microfilaments located in TLC contain a 'myosin-like' protein...|$|E
50|$|The Bowman's capsule, {{also called}} the glomerular capsule, {{surrounds}} the glomerulus. It is composed of a visceral inner layer formed by specialized cells called podocytes, and a <b>parietal</b> outer <b>layer</b> composed of simple squamous epithelium. Fluids from blood in the glomerulus are filtered through the visceral layer of podocytes, resulting in the glomerular filtrate.|$|R
50|$|Initially the intraembryonic coelom is one {{continuous}} space. During development {{this space}} partitions {{to form the}} pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities. The diaphragm and the paired pleuropericardial membranes separate the coelomic cavity into four parts. From the splanchnopleura (the visceral mesodermal layer) develops the visceral pleura and from the somatopleura (<b>parietal</b> mesodermal <b>layer)</b> develops the <b>parietal</b> pleura.|$|R
50|$|The {{pericardium}} is a double-walled sac {{around the}} heart. The {{inner and outer}} (visceral and <b>parietal,</b> respectively) <b>layers</b> are normally lubricated by {{a small amount of}} pericardial fluid, but the inflammation of pericardium causes the walls to rub against each other with audible friction.
