40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we assess the {{benefits}} of using statistical techniques to ascertain the shareability of <b>protection</b> <b>channels</b> when computing shared mesh restored lightpaths in optical mesh networks. These optical networks support wavelength conversion everywhere as a byproduct of the electronic nature of the switching in the OEO optical cross-connect used. Current deterministic approaches require a detailed level of information proportional {{to the number of}} active lightpaths. Although this is not an issue for good size networks in the foreseeable future, these approaches are not practicable for distributed route computation involving larger networks. On the other hand, distributed approaches that do not make use of shareability information require a significant amount of additional capacity compared to a centralized approach with access to complete shareability information. With the proposed approach we show that even with less information, independent of the amount of traffic demand, it is possible to predict the shareability of <b>protection</b> <b>channels</b> with remarkable accuracy. In addition, we propose a local distributed channel assignment scheme that is used in conjunction with our distributed route computation proposal to assign shared channels when provisioning the backup path.

40|$|Multiple {{description}} {{codes are}} data compression algorithms designed {{with the goal}} of minimizing the distortion caused by data loss in packet-based or diversity communications systems. Recently, techniques that achieve multiple description coding by combining embedded source codes with unequal error <b>protection</b> <b>channel</b> codes have become popular in the literature. These codes allow for data reconstruction with any subset of the transmitted packets and achieve progressively better source reconstructions as more and more packets are decoded. The given methods may be applied to any embedded source description. While applicability to all embedded source codes provides great flexibility, this separation approach begs the question of whether better performance could be achieved by taking advantage of the internal structure of a particular embedded code. In this paper, we investigate an extremely simple method for using an embedded source code's internal state information in the construction of a multiple description code. In particular, we protect an embedded SPIHT bitstream by adding to that bitstream periodic descriptions of state information from the encoder, and we demonstrate how the state information can be used to recover lost bits. For low probabilities of network packet loss, the proposed algorithm achieves performance within 0. 35 dB of the performance of a more sophisticated channel coding algorithm when both algorithms are applied to same SPIHT embedded source code...|$|E

40|$|A {{telecommunication}} network is said survivable {{if it is}} still able to provide service after one of its components fails. Survivability is achieved by redirecting the data through other spans of the network where spare capacity was previously introduced. There are two important aspects {{to take into account}} while providing survivability to the network: fast recovery and low cost. pCycles are structures that were introduced to design the spare capacity of optical networks providing quick restoration. Representing the network as a 2 connected graph, a pCycle is a cycle composed of one preconfigured spare channel on each span (edge) it crosses. Each pCycle provides one <b>protection</b> <b>channel</b> (unit of demand) to each span it crosses and two protection channels to each span that is not in the cycle but its ending nodes are (straddling span). We deal here with the Spare Capacity Allocation (SCA) problem which requires protecting all working demands against any span failure with pCycles at minimum cost. We propose a greedy heuristic that builds a solution for this problem iteratively. At each step, a Genetic Algorithm builds a cycle trying to maximize the Actual Efficiency, which was defined in the literature for developing other heuristics for this problem. To achieve this, we propose to decode cycles from genes representing fundamental cycles of a basis of cycle space. We give two alternatives for fitness evaluation to treat disjoint cycles or closed walks with repeated nodes. Several computational experiments were performed and promising results were obtained...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project {{is intended to}} develop an efficient system for reliably transmitting image and video data over low bit rate noisy channels. The basic ideas behind the proposed approach are the following: employ statistical-based image modeling to facilitate pre- and post-processing and error detection, use spare redundancy that the source compression did not remove to add robustness, and implement coded modulation to improve bandwidth efficiency and noise rejection. Over the last six months, {{progress has been made}} on various aspects of the project. Through our studies of the integrated system, a list-based iterative Trellis decoder has been developed. The decoder accepts feedback from a post-processor which can detect channel errors in the reconstructed image. The error detection is based on the Huber Markov random field image model for the compressed image. The compression scheme used here is that of JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group). Experiments were performed and the results are quite encouraging. The principal ideas here are extendable to other compression techniques. In addition, research was also performed on unequal error <b>protection</b> <b>channel</b> coding, subband vector quantization as a means of source coding, and post processing for reducing coding artifacts. Our studies on unequal error protection (UEP) coding for image transmission focused on examining the properties of the UEP capabilities of convolutional codes.

The outcome of this investigation included the development of three algorithms for subband vector quantization.

40|$|Coastal zones {{which are}} known as the {{interface}} between continents and oceans are vital and important to human beings because {{a majority of the}} world's population live in such zones (Nelson, 2007). Coastal systems are among the most dynamic and energetic environments on earth and they are continuously changing because of the dynamic interaction between the oceans and the land. Dronkers (2005) described coasts as multiform, infinitely complex, quasi-fractal, always changing and unpredictable. Sediment process, especially fine sediment transportation is a very complicated feature in many coastal zones as it is affected by physical dynamics, tide, wave, wind and their mutual interactions. Waves and winds along the coast are both eroding rocks and depositing sediments continuously, and the rates of erosion and deposition vary considerably from day to day. Tidal currents also have great effects on sediment transportation. Sedimentation causes many problems in coastal systems. Fine suspended sediment affects local morphology in coastal rivers, estuaries and shelves environments. Fluid mud, a high concentration aqueous suspension of fine sediment, impedes navigation, reduces water quality and causes environmental damages (Sowed, 2008). So it is crucial and of great interests for coastal engineers and water managing authorities to improve understanding of the underlying sedimentation processes and then further to carry out plans for water management, coastal <b>protection,</b> <b>channel</b> maintenance, land reclamation and dredging of deepwater navigational channels, etc. Along the Dutch Coast, a lot of efforts have been made to improve the prediction and understanding of sediment transport processes. Process-based models such as SOBEK and Delft 3 D of Deltares have been proved to be useful in simulation of 2 D/ 3 D sediment processes in the Dutch coastal areas. Delft 3 D solves shallow water equations and transport equations for salinity and suspended particulate matter (SPM) numerically by using a finite-difference scheme. Delft 3 D was used to build both large-scale and small-scale models to predict SPM concentrations and siltation rates in the Dutch coastal zones. For example, Van Kessel et al. (2007) built model of the Southern North Sea and Li (2007) built a local model focused on the mouth of River Rhine. The results from both models were satisfactory. However, simulating sediment transportations with process-based models is often quite time consuming, which restricts process-based model for widely applications. More detailed information will be introduced in Chapter 1. 3. Data-driven models (DDM) have also been used in simulation of sediment processes (Bhattacharya et al., 2006). They are based on limited knowledge of physical processes and rely on the data describing input and output characteristics. Data driven techniques are used in building models to solve mathematical equations from the analysis of concurrent input and output time series instead of the analysis of physical processes. Solomatine and Ostfeld (2008) described that the model works on the basis of connections between the system state variables (input, internal and output variables) without considering too much on assumptions about the natural processes of the system...|$|E

One of the promising implementations of this paradigm is Cognitive Radio (CR), which enables Secondary Users (SUs) to opportunistically access frequency bands which have been exclusively allocated to Primary Users (PUs) without introducing harmful interference to the communication process of PUs. The dramatic growth of wireless applications leads to tremendous boost in the volume of communication traﬃc {{as well as the}} associated energy consumption. As a promising technology to implement DSA, CR is also envisioned to evolve to be energy eﬃcient. Cooperative spectrum sensing, which can profoundly improve the ability of discovering the spectrum opportunities, is regarded as an enabling mechanism for Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs). One of the most fundamental problems in cooperative spectrum sensing is how to assign SUs to sense diﬀerent primary channels such that SUs can achieve a good balance between sensing accuracy and the exploration of potential spectrum holes. In this thesis, the Cooperative Sensing Scheduling (CSS) problem for CRN is analyzed by taking both the performance and energy consumption of spectrum sensing into consideration. The CSS problem is investigated in the following three scenarios: (1) Both SUs and primary channels have homogeneous characteristics. (2) PU channels are heterogeneous in terms of <b>channel</b> <b>protection</b> criteria, <b>channel</b> idle probabilities and channel capacities while SUs possess identical sensing capability.
