40|$|Adenosine and {{guanosine}} are transported into Petunia hybrida pollen by a saturable, carrier-mediated mechanism. The energy poisons carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, 7 -chloro- 4 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole, and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide all inhibit uptake, suggesting {{an energy}} coupled (active) transport process. Transport takes place against a concentration gradient, strongly favoring an active transport mechanism. The purine nucleoside transport in Petunia pollen {{differs from that}} already reported for <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> in that it exhibits a significantly higher Km for nucleoside and is not so severely inhibited by the polyamine, spermine. Like that for the <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> uridine and cytosine, however, the system exhibits a broad pH optimum, is inhibited by sulfydryl-binding reagents, while the potent inhibitors of nucleoside transport in animal cells, nitrobenzylthioinosine and dipyridamole, have no effect. Transport of both purine and <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> in germinating pollen decreases steadily with time, a finding consistent with reports that RNA synthesis and DNA repair are early events of pollen germination and tube elongation. However, since these precursors are often used to demonstrate nucleic acid synthesis, it cannot be ruled out {{that the lack of}} precursor transport itself leads to scoring nucleic acid synthesis as negative. The results indicate that the newly synthesized pollen tube membranes contain little or no nucleoside transporters...|$|R

50|$|Dideoxy{{nucleoside}}s are analogues of nucleoside {{where the}} sugar ring lacks both 2´ and 3´-hydroxyl groups. Three {{years after the}} synthesis of zidovudine, Jerome Horwitz and his colleagues in Chicago prepared another dideoxynucleoside now known as zalcitabine (ddC). Zalcitabine is a synthetic <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleoside</b> analogue, structurally related to deoxycytidine, in which the 3´-hydroxyl group of the ribose sugar moiety is substituted with hydrogen.

5000|$|... of {{lamivudine}} can {{be traced}} back to the mid-1970s while Bernard Belleau was investigating sugar derivatives. Lamivudine was developed as the sulfur analogue of zalcitabine (see table 2). It was initially synthesized as a racemic mixture (BCH-189) and analysis showed that both positive and negative enantiomers of BCH-189 (2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine) had in vitro activity against HIV. Lamivudine is the negative enantiomer and is a <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleoside</b> analogue. The 3' carbon of the ribose ring of 2'-deoxycytidine has been replaced by a sulfur atom because it had greater anti-HIV activity and is less toxic than the positive enantiomer.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{gemcitabine}} is a FDA-approved <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleoside</b> analogue and a dCK activity based prodrug {{that has}} been used to treat pancreatic, breast, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer. Mechanistically, dCK, which uptakes preformed nucleosides, adds the first phosphoryl group on dFdC (gemcitabine's original form as a deoxycytidine analog) to convert it into dFdCMP, its monophosphate form. Cytidylate kinase or UMP-CMP kinase then adds the second phosphoryl group to form dFdCDP (gemcitabine diphosphate form), which can inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase or nucleoside kinase A adds the third phosphoryl group to form dFdCTP (gemcitabine triphosphate form) which is gemcitabine's active form which inhibits both deoxycytidylate deaminase and DNA polymerase. Although gemcitabine has widely used to treat solid tumors for over a decade, patients taking gemcitabine alone (monotherapy) have been observed to develop chemoresistance to the drug.|$|E
30|$|Similar to cereblon protein, {{a number}} of {{proteins}} contain such aromatic cages, suggesting that this protein is bound by other ligands (particularly endogenous ligands) (Chamberlain et al. 2014; Hartmann et al. 2014; Lupas et al. 2015). More recently, uridine, one of the <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleosides,</b> was identified as the cellular ligand of cereblon, and was shown to cause teratogenicity similar to IMiDs (Hartmann et al. 2014). However, other <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> such as cytidine or thymidine are shown to {{have no effect on}} teratogenicity in vivo (Hartmann et al. 2014). Uridine is structurally similar to the glutarimide moiety of IMiDs, implying that glutarimide- or uridine- like moieties induce teratogenicity. Considering the similarity of the ligand binding sites between cereblon and other proteins containing aromatic cages, other cationic ligands such as methylated lysine and/or arginine residues and the ligands containing quaternary ammonium groups could competitively bind to the IMiDs binding pocket of cereblon.|$|R

40|$|An adenosine-assimilating bacterium, Klebsiella sp. strain LF 1202, inducibly {{formed a}} novel {{nucleoside}} phosphorylase which acted on both purine and <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> when {{the cells were}} cultured in medium containing adenosine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen.

Besides purine nucleosides (adenosine, inosine, and guanosine), the purified enzyme also acted on <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> such as uridine, 2 '-deoxyuridine, and thymidine.

40|$|Transport of <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleosides</b> into germinating Petunia hybrida pollen is carrier-mediated, and, {{except for}} thymidine, is {{inhibited}} {{by the energy}} poisons N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 7 -chloro- 4 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Kinetic studies with analogs deoxyuridine and 5 -bromodeoxyuridine show that they too are taken up faster than thymidine and inhibited by the energy poisons. These and other analogs inhibit uridine and cytidine transport more than thymidine, as do the inhibitors parachloromercuribenzoic acid, N-ethylmaleimide, phenylarsine oxide, o-phenanthroline, ethylene diamenetetraacetate, and ethylene glycol-bis (β-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N′N′-tetraacetic acid. Citrate, phosphate, succinate, and tartrate inhibited uptake of all <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>nucleosides.</b> The specific inhibitor of nucleoside transport in animal cells, nitrobenzylthioinosine, has little effect on pollen transport. Uridine and deoxyuridine accumulate against a concentration gradient, suggesting active transport.

Until mutant plants are found which do not phosphorylate uridine, {{it is not possible to}} decide unequivocally between active and nonactive transport for uridine. However, consistent with a low level of DNA synthesis in germinating Petunia pollen, it is clear that thymidine transport is nonactive and relatively slow. It is apparent from these experiments that a more sensitive way to study DNA repair in this pollen would be to use 5 -bromodeoxyuridine or deoxyuridine instead of thymidine to label repaired DNA.
