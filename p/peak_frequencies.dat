50|$|A {{behavioral}} {{study conducted}} by Puechmaille et. al. (2014) revealed that the <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies</b> of echolocation calls emitted by male and female Rhinolophus mehelyi accurately reflect their body size and condition. In the experiment, larger males proved to have higher call frequencies that attracted females twice as often as males with lower call frequencies. In contrast, males appeared to choose females at random. This distinction suggests that females choose males based on their call frequency for the indirect benefits of having healthier and fitter offspring. The mating system is therefore comparable to a lek, making female mate choice a selection factor {{in the evolution of}} call frequency in males that may counter other selection pressures imposed by their ecological niche.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Ultrasonic {{guided wave}} {{inspection}} {{is much more}} efficient than traditional point-bypoint examination. Guided waves can propagate over long distances from a single position, and therefore is a good method of evaluating thickness degradation, especially for large-area structures such as pipes and vessels. In this paper, guided wave thickness measurement potential is studied utilizing a <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> approach. Because guided wave velocities are functions of {{the product of the}} frequency and the structure thickness, the dispersion curve of phase velocity vs. frequency will shift as the thickness changes, and the mode excitation frequency, which is called <b>peak</b> <b>frequency,</b> will also shift. The relationship between <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> shifts and thickness changes can be used for guided wave thickness measurement. Both Lamb waves and shear horizontal (SH) guided waves were studied. Experiments were carried out on plates with different thicknesses. Phase velocity dispersion curves and their changes with the thicknesses variations were calculated theoretically. <b>Peak</b> <b>frequency</b> shifting information was acquired experimentally by signal analysis for establishing an algorithm of calculating thicknesses from <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> shifts.

50|$|Dolphins (and other odontocetes) rely on {{echolocation}} {{to aid in}} detecting, identifying, localizing, and capturing prey. Dolphin sonar {{signals are}} well suited for localizing multiple, small targets in a three-dimensional aquatic environment by utilizing highly directional (3 dB beamwidth of about 10 deg), broadband (3 dB bandwidth typically of about 40 kHz; <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies</b> between 40 kHz and 120 kHz), short duration clicks (about 40 μs). Dolphins can localize sounds both passively and actively (echolocation) with a resolution of about 1 deg. Cross-modal matching (between vision and echolocation) suggests dolphins perceive the spatial structure of complex objects interrogated through echolocation, a feat that likely requires spatially resolving individual object features and integration into a holistic representation of object shape. Although dolphins are sensitive to small, binaural intensity and time differences, mounting evidence suggests dolphins employ position-dependent spectral cues derived from well-developed head-related transfer functions, for sound localization in both the horizontal and vertical planes. A very small temporal integration time (264 μs) allows localization of multiple targets at varying distances. Localization adaptations include pronounced asymmetry of the skull, nasal sacks, and specialized lipid structures in the forehead and jaws, as well as acoustically isolated middle and inner ears.|$|E

5000|$|A much desired {{feature of}} the Korg PS-3300 is its Resonators which {{is a set of}} three band-pass filters per PSU-3301 {{synthesizer}} unit. The frequency of each of the bands can be set with control knobs on the front panel or modulated with an LFO or an envelope to add animation to the sound and there is also a depth control for the level of resonance. These band-pass filters are in addition to the usual low-pass filters that are common to all analog synthesizers. It is these Resonators that partly gives the Korg PS-3300 its distinct sound and sonic flexibility. For example, large synthesized choir or orchestral type sounds (often referred to as [...] "pad" [...] sounds) can be made to sound more authentic and richer than those obtained with just a low-pass filter since the Resonators, when static, can be used as formant filters. There is also great scope for phased, spacey and abstract synthesizer sounds by modulating the <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the Resonators as previously described to produce sweeping effects, a much favoured technique used by Vangelis, for example on the track [...] "Chung Kuo" [...] from his album [...] "China" [...] where white noise was passed through the PS-3300's sweeping Resonators in the intro.|$|E

Both of these are very well {{established}} paradigms in BCI research, Research articles have shown that nearly all people with a healthy visual system can use these types of BCIs. Both of these approaches require the user {{to pay attention to}} a specific region of the monitor. In a P300 BCI, different items on the monitor (such as letters) flash while the user is instructed to silently count each time a target item flashes. The BCI can identify the target item by determining which flashes elicited brain signals reflecting attention to that item. One of the most distinct such signals is the P300, hence the name. BCIs that rely on steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) instead rely on items that flicker instead of flash. The user focuses on one of the flickering items, producing SSVEP activity at the same frequency as that item. SSVEP signals are often found at harmonics of the stimulation frequency as well, which most SSVEP BCIs (including intendiX) exploit to improve performance. Therefore, a BCI can determine the target item by identifying the <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the user's visual areas, which can only correspond to one of the many items on the monitor.|$|E
5000|$|In the North Pacific, {{what were}} called [...] "boings" [...] was first {{described}} in the mid-1960s from submarine recordings made off San Diego, California, and Kaneohe, Hawaii, in the 1950s. They consist of a brief pulse - called a precursor - {{with a duration of}} 0.28 seconds (range: 0.15 to 1.6 seconds) followed by a frequency and amplitude modulated long call - called the AM component - of 2.2 seconds duration (range: 1.4 to 4.2 seconds). Both had <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 1.4 kHz with harmonics of up to 9 kHz. These strange calls were recorded from October to May - peaking in March - and had a source level of about 150 decibels at a reference pressure of one micropascal at one metre.

In the early 2000s, it was suggested these sounds might originate from minke whales, based on their similarities to vocalizations produced by Southern Hemisphere forms. Finally, during a 2002 HICEAS (Hawaiian Islands Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey) survey, the R/V David Starr Jordan, using a towed hydrophone array, detected boings off the northwestern Hawaiian Islands on 7 November 2002 and discovered they came from a minke whale, which they photographed and biopsied.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} step in the {{reproductive}} cycle for Mozambique tilapia, males excavate a nest into which a female can lay her eggs. After the eggs are laid, the male fertilizes them. Then the female stores the eggs in her mouth until the fry hatch; this act is called mouthbrooding. [...] One of the main reasons behind the aggressive actions of Mozambique tilapias is access to reproductive mates. The designation of Mozambique tilapias as an invasive species rests on their life-history traits: Tilapias exhibit high levels of parental care as well as the capacity to spawn multiple broods through an extended reproductive season, both contributing to their success in varying environments. [...] In the lek system, males congregate and display themselves to attract females for matings. Thus, mating success is highly skewed towards dominant males, who tend to be larger, more aggressive, and more effective at defending territories. Dominant males also build larger nests for the spawn. [...] During courtship rituals, acoustic communication is widely used by the males to attract females. Studies have shown that females are attracted to dominant males who produce lower <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies</b> as well as higher pulse rates. At the end of mating, males guard the nest while females take both the eggs and the sperm into their mouth. Due to this, Mozambique tilapias can occupy many niches during spawning since the young can be transported in the mouth. [...] These proficient reproductive strategies may be the cause behind their invasive tendencies.|$|E
