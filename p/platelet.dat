5|$|The IgG {{antibodies}} form {{a complex}} with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream. The {{tail of the}} antibody then binds to the FcγIIa receptor, a protein {{on the surface of}} the <b>platelet.</b> This results in <b>platelet</b> activation and the formation of <b>platelet</b> microparticles, which initiate the formation of blood clots; the <b>platelet</b> count falls as a result, leading to thrombocytopenia.|$|E
5|$|HIT may be {{suspected}} if {{blood tests}} show a falling <b>platelet</b> count in someone receiving heparin, {{even if the}} heparin has already been discontinued. Professional guidelines recommend that people receiving heparin have a complete blood count (which includes a <b>platelet</b> count) {{on a regular basis}} while receiving heparin.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the <b>platelet</b> {{count in}} the blood falls below the normal range, a {{condition}} called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the <b>platelet</b> count will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in <b>platelet</b> count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, <b>platelets</b> are {{reported}} to promote liver, as well as bone regeneration and dermal wound healing. <b>Platelets</b> are required not only for thrombocytopenia treating but also for regenerative therapy. <b>Platelets</b> cannot be stored beyond three days, therefore, shortage of fresh <b>platelets</b> sometimes occurs. To preserve <b>platelets</b> for a long duration without degrading growth factors, a freeze-dried technique is required. We report here that <b>platelets</b> can be preserved by freeze-drying, using a programmed freezing method to avoid intracellular ice crystal formation. Freeze-dried <b>platelets</b> kept their morphological countenance and response with the agonist of thrombin was well maintained. Freeze-dried <b>platelets</b> stored adenine nucleotides, PDGF, and IGF- 1 {{the same as those}} of fresh <b>platelets.</b> Freeze dried <b>platelets</b> also preserved their proliferative effect on hepatocytes identical to that of fresh <b>platelets.</b> These results of our study suggest that freeze dried <b>platelets</b> will obviate the storage problem of fresh <b>platelets...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{study in}} humans {{showed that the}} {{transfusion}} of previously frozen human <b>platelets</b> after cardiopulmonary bypass, despite decreased survival, resulted in better hemostatic function than that of liquid-preserved <b>platelets</b> stored at 22 degrees C for 3 to 4 days. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, fresh, 3 - to 4 -day-old liquid-preserved, and cryopreserved human <b>platelets</b> were studied {{by the use of}} monoclonal antibodies directed against p-selectin, glycoprotein (GP) Ib, activated GPIIb/IIIa, and coagulation factor V in a three-color flow cytometric method. RESULTS: The fresh and liquid-preserved <b>platelets</b> had normal surface levels of GPIb, while the cryopreserved <b>platelets</b> were composed of distinct subpopulations of GPIb-normal and GPIb-reduced <b>platelets.</b> On the basis of the binding of factor V, both subpopulations of cryopreserved <b>platelets</b> exhibited greater surface binding of factor V than did fresh and liquid-preserved <b>platelets.</b> Activated GPIIb/IIIa was elevated on GPIb-normal <b>platelets,</b> but not on GPIb-reduced <b>platelets.</b> Baboon <b>platelets</b> frozen by a procedure identical to that used to freeze human <b>platelets</b> also had GPIb-normal and GPIb-reduced subpopulations after the freezing-thawing-washing procedure. Autologous cryopreserved baboon <b>platelets</b> labeled with biotin-X-N-hydroxysuccinimide showed a rapid removal of GPIb-reduced <b>platelets</b> during the 5 -minute postinfusion period, whereas GPIb-normal <b>platelets</b> had an in vivo recovery of 48 percent and a lifespan of slightly less than 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: Improved in vivo function of cryopreserved <b>platelets</b> {{may be related to the}} rapid hemostatic effect of the GPIb-reduced subpopulation secondary to increased binding of factor V and expression of p-selectin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: 'Natural' <b>platelets</b> are {{planar defects}} in { 001 } planes found in natural type-IaA/B diamonds. 'Man-made' <b>platelets</b> are <b>platelets</b> {{formed in the}} {{laboratory}} by annealing type-IaA diamonds at temperatures over 2500 degrees C. Careful study shows that the infrared (IR) spectra of the 'man-made' <b>platelets</b> {{are different from the}} IR spectra of 'natural' <b>platelets.</b> High-temperature (T {{greater than or equal to}} 2000 degrees C) annealing of <b>platelets</b> containing type-IaA/B diamonds modifies the IR absorption spectrum owing to the 'natural' <b>platelets</b> and makes it similar to the IR spectrum of the 'man-made' <b>platelets.</b> It is suggested that such high-temperature annealing changes the structure of the 'natural' <b>platelets.</b> The changes are too subtle to be detected by electron microscopy techniques. Topographic electron-energy-loss spectroscopy shows that <b>platelets</b> contain nitrogen at an average density of 0. 7 atoms per a(0) (2); however, high-temperature annealing does not seem to affect the concentration of the nitrogen in the <b>platelets...</b>|$|R
5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the <b>platelet</b> count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the <b>platelet</b> count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of warfarin necrosis in people with HIT who have low <b>platelet</b> counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the <b>platelet</b> count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E

40|$|Because {{of a close}} {{association}} between <b>platelets</b> and macrophages in early fatty streak lesions, the hypothesis was tested that <b>platelets</b> contribute to lesion progression by directly enhancing macrophage cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation. Both the rate of cholesterol esterification and the accumulation of CE were increased within 24 h of the co-culture of adherent macrophages with <b>platelets.</b> Maximum increases in esterification and CE accumulation were observed within 3 to 4 d of culture and were greater than 10 -fold over controls. Optimum accumulation of CE by 5 X 10 (5) was obtained with 5 X 10 (8) autologous <b>platelets.</b> When similar amounts of free cholesterol were supplied with <b>platelets,</b> red blood cells (RBC), RBC ghosts, or sonicated RBC, only <b>platelets</b> enhanced macrophage CE accumulation, which indicates specificity for <b>platelets.</b> Products released from <b>platelets</b> 30 min after thrombin stimulation were active as well.

5|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation, another {{complication of}} rhabdomyolysis {{and other forms}} of critical illness, may be suspected on the basis of unexpected bleeding or abnormalities in hematological tests, such as a decreasing <b>platelet</b> count or prolongation of the prothrombin time.

5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low <b>platelet</b> count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the <b>platelet</b> count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on <b>platelet</b> aggregation during the lifetime of the affected <b>platelet</b> (8–9 days).

40|$|Abstract. Though {{thrombocytopenia}} or dysfunction of <b>platelets</b> {{is common}} in dengue virus infection, the role of <b>platelets</b> has not been established. We enrolled 33 hospital-ized children with serologically confirmed dengue virus infection. Blood specimens were collected during hospitalization. <b>Platelets</b> and plasma were isolated from the whole blood. Detection of dengue virus in plasma and <b>platelets</b> {{was carried out by}} RT-PCR with primers that can differentiate different dengue serotypes simultaneously, and by electron transmission microscopy (EM). Dengue viral RNA was detected in the <b>platelets</b> and plasma by conventional RT-PCR. A significantly higher percentage of dengue viral RNA was detected in <b>platelets</b> than in plasma (p= 0. 03). <b>Platelets</b> isolated 5 days after onset of fever were most likely positive for viral RNA.

40|$|Background & Aims. We {{previously}} reported that <b>platelets</b> promote hepatocyte proliferation. In this study, {{we focused on}} the role of <b>platelets</b> in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in addition to their role in hepatocyte in liver regeneration. Methods. Immortalized human LSECs (TMNK- 1) were used. The LSECs were co-cultured with human <b>platelets,</b> and the proliferation of LSECs and the excretion of growth factors and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) were subsequently measured. The main factor from <b>platelets</b> which induced the excretion of IL- 6 from LSECs was determined using inhibitors of each component contained in the <b>platelets.</b> The need for direct contact between <b>platelets</b> and LSECs was investigated using cell culture inserts. The proliferation of human primary hepatocytes was measured after the addition of the supernatant of LSECs cultured with or without <b>platelets.</b> Results. The number of LSECs cocultured with <b>platelets</b> significantly increased. Excretion of IL- 6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increased in LSECs with <b>platelets.</b> JTE- 013, a specific antagonist for sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) 2 receptors, inhibited the excretion of IL- 6 from LSECs after the addition of <b>platelets.</b> When the <b>platelets</b> and LSECs were separated by the cell culture insert, the excretion of IL- 6 from LSECs was decreased. DNA synthesis was significantly increased in human primary hepatocytes cultured with the supernatant of LSECs with <b>platelets.</b> Conclusions. <b>Platelets</b> promote LSEC proliferation and induce IL- 6 and VEGF production. Direct contact between the <b>platelets</b> and LSECs and S 1 P, that are contained in <b>platelets,</b> were involved in the excretion of IL- 6 from LSECs.

25|$|Low <b>platelet</b> {{concentration}} is thrombocytopenia and {{is due to}} either decreased production or increased destruction.

25|$|<b>Platelet</b> {{conditions}} may be congenital or acquired. Some inborn <b>platelet</b> pathologies are Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, Bernard-Soulier syndrome (abnormal glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex), gray <b>platelet</b> syndrome (deficient alpha granules), and delta storage pool deficiency (deficient dense granules).

25|$|Tissue factor also binds {{to factor}} VII in the blood, which initiates the {{extrinsic}} coagulation cascade to increase thrombin production.

Families of three G proteins (Gq, Gi, G12) operate together for full activation. Thrombin also promotes secondary fibrin-reinforcement of the <b>platelet</b> plug. <b>Platelet</b> activation in turn degranulates and releases factor V and fibrinogen, potentiating the coagulation cascade.
