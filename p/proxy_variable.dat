Conversely, wild bootstraps are invalid, even when innovations and <b>proxy</b> <b>variables</b> are either independent and identically distributed or martingale difference sequences, and simulations show that their coverage rates for IRFs can be badly mis-sized.

We demonstrate that abnormal stock returns are related to corporate total assets growth rate (a <b>proxy</b> <b>variable</b> for exercising real investment options through contraction, abandonment or expansion), change in EPS (a <b>proxy</b> <b>variable</b> for the change in profitability after exercising investment options), and one-year lagged P/B ratio (a <b>proxy</b> <b>variable</b> for the value factor), conditional on one-year lagged market-to-book assets ratio (MBA ratio, a <b>proxy</b> <b>variable</b> for the level of investment opportunity). We utilize the panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model to examine the threshold effect of one-year lagged MBA ratio on abnormal stock returns. We find that there exists an efficient investment regime between two threshold values of 0. 4773 and 3. 2728. Our results are robust to predict, approximately 74. 42 %, the movement direction of abnormal stock returns in year 2008.

This paper follows Lambert and Shonkwiler (1995) in modelling technical {{change as a}} stochastic unobservable variable and tests this formulation against the alternative of using R&D and patent indices. This is done by fitting a system of share equations, derived from the dual profit function, to production data for South African agriculture. Each equation includes both unobserved technical change components and technical <b>proxy</b> <b>variables.</b> Variable deletion tests show that conventional <b>proxy</b> <b>variables</b> fail to explain the biases of technological change, while cointegration tests show that technical change is both stochastic and biased. The latent variables provide estimates of biases {{that are consistent with}} past studies and the historical record and can be explained by policy change in South Africa following WWII. The demonstration of high rates of return to R&D is not sufficient to justify R&D activity when biased technological change exacerbates input use and welfare distortions within and without the sector. * We thank the University of Pretoria for funding the study and the referees and delegates for many useful comments.

40|$|A {{theory of}} land market {{activity}} is developed for settings {{where there is}} uncertainty and private information about the security of land tenure. Land sellers match with buyers in a competitive search environment, and an illiquid land market emerges as a screening mechanism. As a consequence, adverse selection and an insecure system of property rights stifle land market transactions. The implications of the theory are tested using household level data from Indonesia. As predicted, formally titled land is more liquid than untitled land {{in the sense that}} ownership rights are more readily transferable. Additional implications of the theory are verified empirically by constructing a <b>proxy</b> <b>variable</b> for land tenure security and studying the differences between markets for unregistered land across Indonesian provinces.

In particular, we show that the economics of the firms static input choice contains the necessary identifying information to control for the endogeneity problem in the production function. From an econometric point of view, our estimation proceeds in a single GMM step, and thus standard asymptotic standard errors are available. We consider the identification and estimation of models with heterogeneity in both input and output prices, as well as heterogeneity in factor specific productivity. Our empirical results show that we control for more of the endogeneity problem than the <b>proxy</b> <b>variable</b> approach, resulting in estimates of labor productivity nearly half as small. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} human capital {{relevance}} to economic growth is becoming increasingly important taking into account its relevance {{in many of the}} Sustainable Development Goals proposed by the UN. This paper conducted a panel regression analysis of selected SE European countries and Scandinavian countries using the Granger causality test and pooled panel regression. In order to test the relevance of human capital on economic growth, several human capital <b>proxy</b> <b>variables</b> were identified. Aside from the human capital <b>proxy</b> <b>variables,</b> other explanatory variables were selected using stepwise regression while the dependant variable was GDP. This paper concludes that there are significant structural differences in the economies of the two observed panels.
