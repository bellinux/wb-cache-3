5|$|At some point, Cybi and Caffo parted company, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> of a {{disagreement}} between them, but <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> his brother Gildas had insulted Maelgwn, who then forced Cybi to dismiss Caffo – both versions {{appear in the}} manuscript accounts. Thereafter, Caffo moved towards the south of Anglesey, where {{he was killed by}} shepherds from the area now called Newborough, perhaps avenging the insult on their king.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{levels in}} the {{atmosphere}} are trending slightly downward globally, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> of fossil-fuel burning.|$|E
5|$|Chaptal did not {{consider}} his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, he put the condenser out of order, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> {{he did not want}} to leave an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.|$|E
50|$|Russia <b>possibly</b> banned <b>because</b> of state-sponsored doping program.|$|R
60|$|He stopped abruptly, {{because at}} that moment Paddy Flinders re-entered with the sugar; <b>possibly,</b> also, <b>because</b> he {{did not wish to}} reveal all his intentions.|$|R
5000|$|Fifty-five episodes were aired, from 3 October 1972 to 26 December 1974. The show <b>possibly</b> ended <b>because</b> of {{complaints}} by parents. In 2009, {{it made the}} [...] "Canon of Dutch Children's Television".|$|R
5|$|Queen Joanna of Castile, 16th century monarch who was {{declared}} mentally ill and confined, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> those around her (such as her father, Ferdinand of Aragon) wished {{to control her}} kingdom.|$|E
5|$|RNAi has varying {{effects in}} {{different}} species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). <b>Possibly</b> <b>because</b> their saliva and gut juice is better at breaking down RNA, the cotton bollworm, the beet armyworm and the Asiatic rice borer have {{so far not been}} proven susceptible to RNAi by feeding.|$|E
5|$|Simeon {{was married}} twice. By his first wife, whose {{identity}} is unknown, Simeon {{had a son}} called Michael, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> his mother was of inferior birth, he was excluded from the succession and sent to a monastery.|$|E
5000|$|Guy asks rhetorically, [...] "Which {{of the two}} {{languages}} spoken in Port-Olry {{do you think the}} Catholic missionaries learnt and used? Could that <b>possibly</b> be <b>because</b> it was easier than the other?" ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} not widely kept in captivity, which is <b>possibly</b> partly <b>because</b> {{it is not}} {{generally}} bred successfully outside of the Philippines. This species is {{on display at the}} following zoos outside the Philippines: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{performances}} are improvised: {{they can be}} quite loud, lengthy, dramatic, soothing, eerie, and <b>possibly</b> alarming. <b>Because</b> Soundscapes are often held {{as part of a}} rock concert, they can prove somewhat taxing on an unprepared audience.|$|R
5|$|The cantata was {{the last}} chorale cantata of the cycle, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> Bach lost a {{librettist}} who had inspired him. The work was chosen to open the first attempt to publish Bach's complete works, a century after his death.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{were tied}} with strings around the belly {{and kept in}} the house where they were raised as a food source {{alongside}} domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> they were killed while they were young. European visitors noticed the native women, especially those who lost their own children, would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs.|$|E
5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> of {{depletion}} of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor isoniazid {{increases the risk of}} hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E
50|$|The {{figure was}} {{imported}} <b>possibly</b> from Phoenicia <b>because</b> of its bronze, incorporating arsenic and zinc composition.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, the FTC {{successfully}} obtained {{an injunction}} {{to stop a}} hair analysis laboratory's false claims to the public, {{on the basis that}} it was [...] "inaccurate, worthless to consumers and <b>possibly</b> harmful <b>because</b> it might prevent patients from seeking proper medical attention".|$|R
25|$|Some things cannot <b>possibly</b> happen, <b>because</b> {{they are}} both too {{improbable}} and too perfect. The U.S. hockey team cannot beat the Russians in the 1980 Olympics. Jack Nicklaus cannot shoot 65 to win The Masters at age 46. Nothing else comes immediately to mind.|$|R
5|$|Gun {{armament}} of {{the class}} consists of two Bofors /70 Mk1 gun mounted on the bow and towards the stern. During the development phase, the designers planned on using French Exocet anti-ship missiles as the class's main weapon system. However, due to the high price the French asked for the missile, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> of political reasons, the project was changed and two Soviet P-20 (SS-N-2B) were used instead. Self-defense measures include two Wallop Barricade chaff launchers.|$|E
5|$|However, a Portia takes a {{relatively}} {{long time to}} see objects, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs and mantises, which a Portia often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
5|$|In 1254 or 1255, Henry III {{received}} an African elephant from Louis IX of France depicted by Matthew Paris in his ‘Chronica Majora’. A wooden structure {{was built to}} house the elephant, 12.2m (40ft) long by 6.1m (20ft) wide. The animal died in 1258, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> it was given red wine, but also {{perhaps because of the}} cold climate of England.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species is}} <b>possibly</b> extinct <b>because</b> the type locality, the place {{from where the}} type {{specimen}} of the species was collected, Alabaster Cave in El Dorado County, California, has been partially destroyed due to mining and has been sealed by concrete, making surveying impossible.|$|R
50|$|One phrase, {{towards the}} middle {{played by the}} clarinet, sounds closely related to one in the first {{movement}} of Carl Maria von Weber's Clarinet Concerto No. 1 in F minor. This was <b>possibly</b> inserted <b>because</b> when Brahms listened to Richard Mühlfeld at his recital, he was playing this concerto.|$|R
50|$|By 1957, Giménez had {{appeared}} in 24 films. At the age of 27 she committed suicide by throwing herself under a train. The reasons for killing herself are unclear, although she was <b>possibly</b> distressed <b>because</b> her lover Juan Carlos Barbieri had left her for another woman, the actress Inés Moreno.|$|R
5|$|Sponges {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less diverse in temperate waters than in tropical waters, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant in tropical waters. Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous sponges are abundant and diverse in shallower non-polar waters.|$|E
5|$|TgPVR21 mice have {{incorporated}} the human PVR at chromosome 13. These mice are {{less susceptible to}} poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> they express decreased levels of hPVR. TgPVR21 mice {{have been shown to}} be susceptible to poliovirus infection through intranasal inoculation, and may be useful as a mucosal infection model.|$|E
5|$|The {{neighboring}} Osages {{were not}} so affected, as they had access to arms smuggled by French traders from British territory in present-day Illinois. With superior weaponry, they drove between the Southern Pawnees and the Wichitas, pushing the latter group southward to the Red River. The Pawnees moved northward into Nebraska, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> of news that modern weapons were available from traders on the Platte.|$|E
50|$|The school's {{athletic}} {{teams are}} called the Flying Dutchmen (men) and the Flying Dutch (women). The school colors are blue and orange (<b>possibly</b> chosen <b>because</b> the Dutch royal family is the House of Orange-Nassau). The college sponsors club ice hockey and rugby {{in addition to a}} popular intramural sports program.|$|R
50|$|The idea {{to extend}} the canal may have <b>possibly</b> emerged <b>because</b> an {{irrigation}} system was felt necessary after a disastrous famine hit the Subcontinent in 1837-38 in which nearly ten million (one crore) rupees was spent on relief works, resulting in considerable loss of revenue to the British East India Company.|$|R
25|$|This {{article is}} based on the 1913 book The Snakes of Europe, by G. A. Boulenger, which is now in the public domain in the United States (and <b>possibly</b> elsewhere). <b>Because</b> of its age, the text in this article should not {{necessarily}} be viewed as reflecting the current knowledge of snake venom.|$|R
5|$|The {{results of}} archeological studies of 9th- and 10th-century gords in Greater Poland {{are at odds}} with the timing of this story. There was no Gniezno {{settlement}} in the 9th century; there was a pagan cult site there beginning only {{at the turn of the}} 10th century. The Gniezno gord was built around year 940, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> the location, of great spiritual importance to the tribal community, would rally the local population around its building and defense.|$|E
5|$|While Richard was at Mile End, the Tower {{was taken}} by the rebels. A force of rebels, {{separate}} from those operating under Tyler at Mile End, approached the castle, possibly in the late morning. The gates were open to receive Richard on his return and a crowd of around 400 rebels entered the fortress, encountering no resistance, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> the guards were terrified by them.|$|E
5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, <b>possibly</b> <b>because</b> 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E
50|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{flunitrazepam}} include dependence, {{both physical and}} psychological; reduced sleep quality resulting in somnolence; and overdose, resulting in excessive sedation, impairment of balance and speech, respiratory depression or coma, and <b>possibly</b> death. <b>Because</b> of the latter, flunitrazepam is commonly used in suicide. When used in pregnancy, it might cause hypotonia.|$|R

Boulenger, which is now in the public domain in the United States (and <b>possibly</b> elsewhere). <b>Because</b> of its age, the text in this article should not {{necessarily}} be viewed as reflecting the current knowledge of snake venom.|$|R
50|$|This ex-student, {{states the}} text, then marries {{a woman of}} equal birth, he {{deposits}} the fire, performs a Brahma-sacrifice {{for a day and}} night. Both Deussen and Olivelle consider this verse as obscure insertion and <b>possibly</b> corrupted, <b>because</b> neither does it fit with style nor does it follow the Sandhi rules of Sanskrit.|$|R
