5|$|The {{move towards}} {{standardisation}} is now reaching countries without {{a history of}} <b>prescriptive</b> codes, such as India, which approved its first national standard for ambulance construction in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers <b>prescriptive</b> advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities {{in a way}} that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing <b>prescriptive</b> advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.|$|E
5|$|The college's coat of arms, in heraldic terminology, is Vert, three stags trippant argent attired or. The {{arms are}} {{not those of}} Hugh Price. His arms, {{according}} to their depiction {{in the margins of}} his will, were gules (red) a chevron ermine between three fleurs-des-lis. The arms were not granted or authorised by the College of Arms, but the length of time for which they have been used has given them a <b>prescriptive</b> authority.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of {{what ought to be}} done in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented as a solution to the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases <b>prescriptive</b> rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E
5|$|American philosopher Louis Pojman has cited Pietism, {{political}} philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, {{the modern}} debate between rationalism and empiricism, {{and the influence}} of natural law as influences on the development of Kant's ethics. Other philosophers have argued that Kant's parents and his teacher, Martin Knutzen, influenced his ethics. Those influenced by Kantian ethics include philosopher Jürgen Habermas, political philosopher John Rawls, and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel criticised Kant for not providing specific enough detail in his moral theory to affect decision-making and for denying human nature. German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer argued that ethics should attempt to describe how people behave and criticised Kant for being <b>prescriptive.</b> Michael Stocker has argued that acting out of duty can diminish other moral motivations such as friendship, while Marcia Baron has defended the theory by arguing that duty does not diminish other motivations. The Catholic Church has criticised Kant's ethics as contradictory and regards Christian ethics as more compatible with virtue ethics.|$|E
5|$|The poet, {{of whose}} works I have {{undertaken}} the revision, may now begin {{to assume the}} dignity of an ancient, and claim the privilege of established fame and <b>prescriptive</b> veneration. He has long outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many years been lost; and every topic of merriment, or motive of sorrow, which the modes of artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity; but are read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or passion, they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners, and, as they devolved {{from one generation to}} another, have received new honours at every transmission.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} official languages (German, French, and Italian) have terms, {{not used}} outside of Switzerland, known as Helvetisms. German Helvetisms are, roughly speaking, {{a large group}} of words typical of Swiss Standard German, which do not appear either in Standard German, nor in other German dialects. These include terms from Switzerland's surrounding language cultures (German Billett from French), from similar term in another language (Italian azione used not only as act but also as discount from German Aktion). The French spoken in Switzerland has similar terms, which are equally known as Helvetisms. The most frequent characteristics of Helvetisms are in vocabulary, phrases, and pronunciation, but certain Helvetisms denote themselves as special in syntax and orthography likewise. Duden, one of the <b>prescriptive</b> sources for Standard German, is aware of about 3000 Helvetisms. Current French dictionaries, such as the Petit Larousse, include several hundred Helvetisms.|$|E
25|$|Easements by prescription, {{also called}} <b>prescriptive</b> {{easements}}, are implied easements granted after the dominant estate {{has used the}} property in a hostile, continuous and open manner for a statutorily prescribed number of years. <b>Prescriptive</b> easements differ from adverse possession by not requiring exclusivity.|$|E
25|$|The three {{principle}} {{strengths of}} Bayes' theorem {{that have been}} identified by scholars are that it is <b>prescriptive,</b> complete and coherent. <b>Prescriptive</b> {{in that it is}} the theorem that is the simple prescription to the conclusions reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning for the consistent decision maker.|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions, if the use is not hostile {{but given}} actual or implied consent by the legal {{property}} owner, the <b>prescriptive</b> easement {{may become a}} regular or implied easement rather than a <b>prescriptive</b> easement and immediately becomes binding. An {{example of this is}} the lengthy Irish Lissadell House rights of way case heard since 2010, that extended long-standing consents given to individuals into a public right of way.|$|E
25|$|The {{major change}} in the {{legislation}} was that it brought {{in the concept of}} risk assessment rather than <b>prescriptive</b> codes.|$|E
25|$|In other jurisdictions, such {{permission}} immediately converts the easement into a terminable license, or restarts {{the time}} for obtaining a <b>prescriptive</b> easement.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to therapy, clinical psychologists are also trained to administer and interpret psychological personality tests {{such as the}} MMPI and the Rorschach inkblot test, and various standardized tests of intelligence, memory, and neuropsychological functioning. Common areas of specialization include: specific disorders (e.g. trauma), neuropsychological disorders, child and adolescent, family and relationship counseling. Internationally, psychologists are generally not granted prescription privileges. In the US, <b>prescriptive</b> rights have been granted to appropriately trained psychologists only in the states of New Mexico and Louisiana, with some limited <b>prescriptive</b> rights in Indiana and the US territory of Guam.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, some {{grammatical}} authorities {{sought to}} introduce a <b>prescriptive</b> rule against the split infinitive. The construction is still the subject of disagreement, though modern English usage guides have dropped the objection to it.|$|E

25|$|Common modern {{practice}} favors performing Gregorian chant with no beat {{or regular}} metric accent, largely for aesthetic reasons.

25|$|Some blogs {{focus more}} on fashion advice, {{featuring}} how-to articles for the lay reader.

25|$|The Cambridge Camden Society {{did much}} {{to bring about a}} revival of medieval styles in the design and {{appointments}} of 19th-century churches, {{as well as in the}} restoration of older ones. Their notions were often highly <b>prescriptive,</b> inflexible and intolerant of diversity within the church. They were insistent upon revival rather than originality.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{surviving}} Sanskrit grammar is Pāṇini's Aṣtādhyāyī ("Eight-Chapter Grammar") {{dating to}} c. the 5th century BCE. It {{is essentially a}} <b>prescriptive</b> grammar, i.e., an authority that defines (rather than describes) correct Sanskrit, although it contains descriptive parts, mostly to account for Vedic forms that had already passed out of use in Pāṇini's time.|$|E
25|$|Although it is {{sometimes}} reported that a prohibition on split infinitives goes back to Renaissance times, and frequently the 18th century scholar Robert Lowth is cited as the originator of the <b>prescriptive</b> rule, such a rule {{is not to be}} found in Lowth's writing, and is not known to appear in any text before the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Graphemics {{examines}} {{the specifics of}} written texts in a certain language and their correspondence to the spoken language. One major task is the descriptive analysis of implicit regularities in written words and texts (graphotactics) to formulate explicit rules (orthography) for the writing system {{that can be used}} in <b>prescriptive</b> education or in computer linguistics, e.g. for speech synthesis.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} medical {{is the one}} before starting diving, as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists. The other important medicals are after some significant illness, where medical intervention is needed there {{and has to be}} done by a doctor who is competent in diving medicine, and can not be done by <b>prescriptive</b> rules.|$|E
25|$|On April 14, 1969, President Richard Nixon {{introduced}} {{two bills}} into Congress {{which would have}} also protected worker health and safety. The Nixon legislation was much less <b>prescriptive</b> than the Johnson bill, and workplace health and safety regulation would be advisory rather than mandatory. However, Representative James G. O'Hara and Senator Harrison A. Williams introduced a much stricter bill similar to the Johnson legislation of the year before.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} oneness of practice-enlightenment is {{considered}} so fundamental to Dōgen's variety of Zen — and, consequently, to the Sōtō {{school as a}} whole — that it {{formed the basis for}} the work Shushō-gi (修證儀), which was compiled in 1890 by Takiya Takushū (滝谷卓洲) of Eihei-ji and Azegami Baisen (畔上楳仙) of Sōji-ji as an introductory and <b>prescriptive</b> abstract of Dōgen's massive work, the Shōbōgenzō ("Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma").|$|E
25|$|This revised CIMS {{establishes}} a modular and scalable framework for consistent response {{at any level}} – from a small, single agency response to a larger, multi-agency response that may require co-ordination at the community or incident level or higher. CIMS enables agencies to plan for, train and conduct responses in a consistent manner, without being <b>prescriptive.</b> With this approach CIMS is an essential tool in New Zealand’s preparedness to effectively respond to emergencies.|$|E
25|$|The c-examples {{are cases}} of {{preposition}} stranding, which {{is possible in}} English, but not allowed in many languages {{that are related to}} English. For instance, preposition stranding is largely absent from many of the other Germanic languages and it may be completely absent from the Romance languages. <b>Prescriptive</b> grammars often claim that preposition stranding should be avoided in English as well; however, in certain contexts pied-piping of prepositions in English may make a sentence feel artificial or stilted.|$|E
25|$|In Congressional {{debate on}} the Act, critics charged that the law would create {{unnecessary}} regulatory burdens. Partly {{in response to these}} concerns, Congress included little <b>prescriptive</b> detail and simply directs the banking regulatory agencies to ensure that banks and savings associations serve the credit needs of their local communities in a safe and sound manner. Community groups only slowly organized to take advantage of their right under the Act to complain about law enforcement of the regulations.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} {{continuous}} {{use for a}} <b>prescriptive</b> easement to become binding is generally between 5 and 30 years depending upon local laws (sometimes based on {{the statute of limitations}} on trespass). Generally, if the true property owner acts appropriately to defend their property rights {{at any time during the}} required time period the hostile use will end, claims on adverse possession rights are voided, and the continuous use time period will be reset to zero.|$|E
25|$|The Fire Precautions Act had {{relied on}} codes and guides for its implementation, and the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations had changed {{that a little}} by {{introducing}} risk assessment {{as a way of}} complying, but because the requirement for a fire certificate was never repealed, the guides and codes were still used as a <b>prescriptive</b> means of applying the law. The RR (FS) O took this one step further and implemented fully a risk assessment based regime.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prescriptive</b> grammars of {{controlled}} natural languages define grammaticality {{as a matter}} of explicit consensus. On this view, to consider a string as grammatical, it should conform with a set of norms. These norms are usually based on conventional rules that form a part of a higher/literary register for a given language. For some languages, these norms are defined and periodically updated by an appointed body of experts whose rulings are occasionally questioned by the frustrated members of the public.|$|E
25|$|To {{support his}} {{position}} that methodological rules {{generally do not}} contribute to scientific success, Feyerabend provides counterexamples to the claim that (good) science operates according to a certain fixed method. He took some examples of episodes in science that are generally regarded as indisputable instances of progress (e.g. the Copernican revolution), and showed that all common <b>prescriptive</b> rules of science are violated in such circumstances. Moreover, he claimed that applying such rules in these historical situations would actually have prevented scientific revolution.|$|E
25|$|Corpus {{planning}} {{refers to}} the <b>prescriptive</b> intervention in the forms of a language, whereby planning decisions are made to engineer changes {{in the structure of}} the language. Corpus planning activities often arise as the result of beliefs about the adequacy of the form of a language to serve desired functions. Unlike status planning, which is primarily undertaken by administrators and politicians, corpus planning generally is performed by individuals with greater linguistic expertise. There are three traditionally recognized types of corpus planning: graphization, standardization, and modernization.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{vision of}} {{economics}} {{is that it}} cannot be unhinged from ideas about the individual and social life. Human activity and political organization must be incorporated into any analysis of trade and economies. In remaking the discipline, he calls {{for a return to}} the normative practice of classical economics but stripped of its necessitarian assumptions and typological references. The development of explanatory claims and <b>prescriptive</b> ideas are necessary. The discipline must connect the transformation of nature with that of society—the making of things with the reorganization of people.|$|E
