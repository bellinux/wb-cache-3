25|$|The {{small-scale}} LNG plant {{also allows}} localized <b>peakshaving</b> to occur—balancing {{the availability of}} natural gas during high and low periods of demand. It also {{makes it possible for}} communities without access to natural gas pipelines to install local distribution systems and have them supplied with stored LNG.|$|E
25|$|Small-scale {{liquefaction}} {{plants are}} suitable for <b>peakshaving</b> on natural gas pipelines, transportation fuel, or for deliveries of natural gas to remote areas not connected to pipelines. They typically have a compact size, are fed from a natural gas pipeline, and are located close to the location where the LNG will be used. This proximity decreases transportation and LNG product costs for consumers. It also avoids the additional greenhouse gas emissions generated during long transportation.|$|E

40|$|THis report {{analyzes}} how {{the seasonal}} profile {{of natural gas}} use may change over {{the next twenty years}} based on the outlook for significant growth in annual demand anticipated in the 1992 Edition of the GRI Baseline Projection. Changes in the seasonal profile of gas use are examined for each end-use energy sector, considering factors such as the impact of energy-effeciency improvements on peak-day and seasonal gas requirements and the seasonal load profiles of emerging gas markets including space cooling and electric power generation. The future requirements of the US gas industry for new seasonal delivery capacity are also assessed. The study concludes that new delivery capacity of all types, including annual delivery capacity, market-area storage services, and gas <b>peakshaving</b> will be required. Expectations regarding changing seasonal patterns of space-heating gas use suggest the potential for a renewed interest in gas <b>peakshaving</b> technologies...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{final test}} results of two near-factory naturally-aspirated GM 502 cubic inch desplacement engines, operated on natural gas fuel. This engine {{has the potential}} for use in high output <b>peakshaving</b> or chiller applications. Initially, engine performance was to be measured on both engines, followed by a 100 -hour durability test of the first engine and 500 -hour durability test on the second 502 engine. Power, efficiency, blowby, oil consumption, oil degradation, plug erosion, and valve recession were recorded during durability testing. Maintenance was performed as needed and recorded. The planned 1000 -hour durability test of the first GM 502 engine was aborted due to excessive oil consumption. Prior to testing the second engine, the piston assemblies were replaced with newly designed pistons, but the engine still demonstrated high oil consumption. The oil consumption was decreased by replacing the second compression rings of the newly designed pistons with a taper-faced oil-scraper desing. Results indicate that through proper engineering analysis and desing, the naturally-aspirated GM 502 cubic inch displacement natural gas engine could have the potent ial for use in high output <b>peakshaving</b> or chiller applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{economics}} of LNG, CNG, and diesel transit buses are compared. A 200 -bus fleet with existing diesel facilities is analyzed. Incremental (relative to current diesel) capital and operating costs are estimated {{in order to}} compare life-cycle costs of all options. Current (rather than future) costs for equipment such as NG engines are considered. Four LNG fuel supply scenarios are analyzed: onsite liquefaction, regional liquefier, <b>peakshaving</b> LNG, and imported LNG. One CNG bus case assumes that gas storage weight creates no bus range or passenger capacity problems, and another case assumes that extra buses are required. Future diesel buses are assumed to require low-emissions engines and cleaner diesel fuel. NOx emissions reduction credit sales enabled by NG bus engines are considered. ...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{energy prices}} and the {{greenhouse}} effect demand a more efficient supply of energy. More residents start to install their own energy generation sources such as photovoltaic cells. The introduction of distributed generation in the low-voltage network can have effects that were unexpected when the network was designed and {{could lead to a}} bad power quality. These developments ask for better insight in the effects of a planning for a fleet of households in a network. This paper presents the results of adding network models to planning strategies. Forward-backward load-flow calculations for a three phase low-voltage network are implemented to simulate the network. The results from load-flow calculations are used as feedback for demand side management. The results in this paper show that the implementation is both fast and accurate enough for integration purposes. Combining load-flow feedback and demand side management leads to improved worst-case voltage levels and cable usage whilst <b>peakshaving</b> optimization performance does not degrade significantly. These results indicate that load-flow calculations should be integrated with demand side management methodologies to evaluate whether networks support the effects of steering production and consumption. More sophisticated integration of network models are left for future work...|$|E
