5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
