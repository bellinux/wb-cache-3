A total of 6 types of plastic bags are tested at {{three levels of}} thickness and two levels of color (transparent and opaque white). <b>PE</b> <b>films</b> are immersed in deionized water, acidic, and alkaline solutions at 60 oC. Sorption curves show that once the maximum uptake is reached, the weight change of <b>PE</b> <b>films</b> started to decline. The films showing the highest weight uptake and loss are observed in opaque films in alkaline solution. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that during water immersion, both maximum weight uptake and loss are affected by colorant additive, with opaque films yielding the highest weight uptake and loss. During acid immersion, transparent films have significantly higher weight uptake than opaque films. The weight uptake during acid immersion is only affected by film thickness, with the thickest films showing the lowest weight uptake.

40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis comprises two separate topics: single-molecule spectroscopy and resonant Raman spectroscopy. The first part concerns single-molecule (SM) spectroscopy on polyethylene (<b>PE)</b> <b>films.</b> Ultra thin (200 nm) films of pure high density PE were produced by spincoating. By determining the position (accuracy 10 nm) and in-plane orientation (acc. 5 deg.) of single 2. 3, 8. 9 -dibenzanthanthrene (DBATT) guest molecules, by means of SM microscopy and spectroscopy respectively, we demonstrated that these thin <b>PE</b> <b>films</b> have a shish-kebab morphology, instead of the spherulitic morphology common in thicker <b>PE</b> <b>films.</b> We have also investigated the alignment process of individual quest chromophores by stretching thicker (50 um), low density <b>PE</b> <b>films.</b> Using SM spectroscopy, we have shown that individual guest chromophores are not better aligned along the stretch direction, as draw ratio increases. Instead alignment occurs suddenly, due to the destruction and (oriented) reformation of local crystalline regions and subsequent adsorption of chromophores. Each chromophore's orientation is determined by specific interactions with the oriented PE crystal surface. The second part of this thesis concerns a quantum-chemical analysis of the resonant Raman spectrum of the carotenoid spheroidene reconstituted in the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to demonstrate that the presence of ethanol in a solution containing two esters and two aromatic alcohols has several consequences on the sorption of these compounds into polyethylene (<b>PE)</b> <b>film.</b> First, sorption of ethanol into the <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> occurred {{at the same time as}} water and reached 8 kg m(- 3) using 12 % v/v of ethanol. This sorption was associated with an increase in PE crystallinity, which may have prevented the sorption of volatile compounds despite their strong affinity with <b>PE</b> <b>film,</b> as evaluated by Hansen solubility parameters. Moreover, increasing the ethanol concentration increased the solubility of the four volatile compounds. In the case of aromatic alcohols, the sorption was decreased in the presence of ethanol as expected. In the case of esters, as their hydrolysis was substantial in the presence of water, the consequence was a higher sorption into the <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> in the presence of ethanol than in its absence. Nevertheless, the sorption also depended on the concentration of ethanol and the heterogeneity of the ethanol water mixture as well as the presence of other volatile compounds, as in the case of 4 -ethylphenol.

The transmission of UV-C light through several plastic films used commercially in food packaging was measured. Effects of UV-C light treatment on both of food quality and films properties were investigated. <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> had the highest measured UV-C light transparency among the 15 films tested, at 76 %, followed by PP and OPP films, with 59 and 57 %, respectively. Exposure of <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> inoculated with E. coli k- 12 with UV-C light resulted in a 4. 6 log CFU/ml reduction after a dose of 164 mJ/cm² was applied. Reduction of E. coli k- 12 on inoculated bologna packaged in <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> was higher (1. 48 log CFU/g) compared to the other films (OPP and ClearTite®) following treatment with 406 mJ/cm 2 of UV-C. Inoculated packaged cucumber treated at 23 0 C for six min with UV-C (560 mJ/cm 2) resulted in a 1. 60 log CFU/g reduction. UV-C light treatment delayed the loss of firmness and yellowing of English cucumber up to 28 day at 5 0 C. Electron microscopy images show that UV-C light treatment influences the morphology of the E. coli cells. The surface-free energy of films was used as an indicator for changes to film surface properties. UV-C light exposure (560 mJ/cm 2) of PE, OPP and ClearTite® films at doses in this study had no significant effect (P≥ 0. 05) on the surface properties of the treated films, water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), or oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of the <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> used to package the cucumbers.

40|$|One {{important}} issue for greenhouse producers {{to deal with}} is the management of high humidity levels during the cold period of the year. High level of humidity is a factor that directly affects the fruit yield and quality of greenhouse crops by pre-disposing these crops to fungal diseases. Recent concerns about food safety, environmental pollution, worker's safety {{and the need for}} rational use of energy stimulated extensive research concerning the development of sustainable humidity management techniques. Such a technique is the use of anti-drip (AD) and anti-fog (AF) cover materials. Aim of this work was to study the effects of two AD PE cover materials on greenhouse microclimate and on growth and production of a hydroponic cucumber and tomato crop. The experiments were carried out from September to December 2006 and from February to May of 2007 in three similar greenhouses, covered by different cover materials. A standard polyethylene (<b>PE)</b> <b>film</b> covered one of the three greenhouses (C-PE).

The greenhouse and outside microclimate parameters along with crop growth and production were recorded. The results showed that the relative humidity levels were much higher in the AD-PE covered greenhouse. Furthermore, the temperature difference between the cover material and the dew point air temperature was more negative under the same greenhouse, leading in higher condensation rates over the <b>PE</b> <b>film.</b> The crop development and production was similar in the three greenhouses.

We conducted a study to measure the amount of <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> residue {{in a number of}} farmland soils(27 sites) previously subjected to long-term film mulching across five main agriculture production regions of Qingdao, China. The amount of film residue in soils was highly variable with the mean being 32. 3 &# 177; 15. 7 kg&# 183;hm - 2. Seven sites exceeded 40 kg&# 183;hm - 2 with the highest being 69. 3 kg&# 183;hm - 2. There was no evident correlation between the amount of film residue in soil and the type of cropping system or the number of years of surface mulching, but was related to the recovery rate of the film in the current season. About 1. 6 % of the recovered PE films was in pieces less than 2 cm 2, 7. 3 % was between 2 cm 2 and 20 cm 2, 19. 2 % was between 20 cm 2 and 100 cm 2, and the remainder (71. 9 %) was in pieces greater than 100 cm 2.

40|$|It is {{confirmed}} that {{a layer of}} vacuum-evaporated carbon {{on the surface of}} a preoriented ultrathin polymer film can lead to an oriented recrystallization of the polymer film. This has been attributed to a strong fixing effect of vacuum-evaporated carbon layer on the film surface of the polymer. To study the origin of the strong fixing effect of vacuum-evaporated carbon layer on the polymer films, the melting and recrystallization behaviors of the preoriented ultrathin <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> with a vacuum-evaporated carbon layer were studied by using atomic force microscopy, electron diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. We found that there exists some extent of chain orientation of carbon-coated polyethylene (PE) preoriented ultrathin film above its melting temperature. These oriented PE chain sequences act as nucleation sites and induce the oriented recrystallization of preoriented <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> from melt. Raman spectroscopy results suggest that new carbon-carbon bonds between the carbon layer and the oriented <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> are created during the process of vacuum carbon evaporation. As a result, some of the PE chain stems are fixed to the coated carbon substrate via covalent bond. Such a bonding has retarded the relaxation of the PE chains at the spot and, therefore, preserves the original orientation of the PE stems at high temperature, which in turn derives the recrystallization of the PE chains in an oriented structure. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Recent year's {{concerns}} about food safety, environmental pollution, worker's safety, {{resistance to chemicals}} {{and the need for}} rational use of energy stimulated extensive research concerning the development of alternative techniques in order to manage high humidity levels. Such a technique is the use of anti-drip (AD) and anti-fog (AF) polyethylene (PE) cover materials. Aim of this work was to study the effects of two AD PE cover materials on greenhouse microclimate and on growth and production of a hydroponic cucumber crop. The experiments were carried out from September to December of 2006 in three similar, heated greenhouses, covered by different cover materials. A standard greenhouse polyethylene (PE) cover film covered one of the three greenhouses (C-PE). The other two greenhouses were covered: the first by a <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> with anti-drip (AD) and anti-fog (AF) properties (AD+AF-PE) and the second one by a <b>PE</b> <b>film</b> with AD properties (AD-PE). The greenhouse and outside microclimate parameters along with crop growth and production were recorded. The results showed that the relative humidity levels were much higher in the AD-PE covered greenhouse. Furthermore, the temperature difference between the cover material and the dew point air temperature was more negative under the same greenhouse, leading in higher condensation rates over the <b>PE</b> <b>film.</b> The crop development and production was similar in the three greenhouses while the crop leaf area index values were slightly higher in the AD-PE covered greenhouse. Nevertheless, in order to control fungus development, the greenhouses covered by the C-PE and the AD-PE film needed about double fungicide applications, than the greenhouse covered by the AD+AF-PE film...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of bacterial-mediated polyethylene (PE) degradation in a two-phase microcosm experiment. During phase I, naturally weathered <b>PE</b> <b>films</b> were incubated for 6 months with the indigenous marine community alone as well as bioaugmented with strains able to grow in minimal medium with linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) as the sole carbon source. At the end of phase I the developed biofilm was harvested and re-inoculated with naturally weathered <b>PE</b> <b>films.</b> Bacteria from both treatments were able to establish an active population on the PE surfaces as the biofilm community developed in a time dependent way. Moreover, a convergence {{in the composition of}} these communities was observed towards an efficient PE degrading microbial network, comprising of indigenous species. In acclimated communities, genera affiliated with synthetic (PE) and natural (cellulose) polymer degraders as well as hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were enriched. The acclimated consortia (indigenous and bioaugmented) reduced more efficiently the weight of <b>PE</b> <b>films</b> in comparison to non-acclimated bacteria. The SEM images revealed a dense and compact biofilm layer and signs of bio-erosion {{on the surface of the}} films. Rheological results suggest that the polymers after microbial treatment had wider molecular mass distribution and a marginally smaller average molar mass suggesting biodegradation as opposed to abiotic degradation. Modifications on the surface chemistry were observed throughout phase II while the FTIR profiles of microbially treated films at month 6 were similar to the profiles of virgin PE. Taking into account the results, we can suggest that the tailored indigenous marine community represents an efficient consortium for degrading weathered PE plastics...|$|R
40|$|Plastic tarp (film) {{is usually}} {{used to reduce}} {{fumigant}} volatilization from soil. Several types of polyethylene (<b>PE)</b> <b>films,</b> virtually impermeable films (VIF), and semi-impermeable films (SIF) are being evaluated {{for their ability to}} reduce fumigant emissions. Quantifying fumigant mass transfer through films is important for the development of practical management practices to reduce fumigant volatilization losses from agricultural fields.

40|$|The {{ability of}} Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus subtilis (Bacillus species {{indigenous}} to the Niger Delta mangrove soil) to biodegrade polyethylene was studied. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) films were exposed outdoor for 24 weeks. The two isolates {{were able to}} grow on polyethylene (PE), forming visible biofilms. The plasmid pattern of the Bacillus species showed a similar pattern among the two Bacillus species, with one plasmid number and molecular weight around 25 kb, indicating a mega plasmid. The mean heterotrophic bacterial counts in the mangrove soil ranged between 2. 81 x 105 – 3. 20 x 108 CFU/g. The rate of degradation was determined by measurement of the residual weight of the <b>PE</b> <b>films.</b> Biodegradation in Erlenmeyer flasks by the bacteria after 60 days of incubation ranged between 8. 41 %- 23. 15 %. Biodegradation was confirmed by Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which showed introduction of carbonyl groups after natural weathering, which decreased after microbial treatment. Decrease in carbonyl index ranged between 10. 5 %- 13. 7 %. The result showed that certain Bacillus sp. indigenous to the Niger Delta mangrove soil are capable of growing on <b>PE</b> <b>films</b> and biodegrade them, after an initial abiotic degradation...|$|R
