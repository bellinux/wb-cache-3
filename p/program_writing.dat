Jones {{was inspired by the}} limited-animated series Roger Ramjet and The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, which he felt employed good character design, cohesiveness, jokes, and timing. He credited The Problem Solverz as the first seamless use of Flash for television animation, with conceptualization and the end result occurring in the same <b>program.</b> <b>Writing</b> was the longest aspect of production, taking up to several months for the crew to conceive the story and draft a script. Animation was comparatively quicker, with the team delivering work in only a few weeks given the digital approach; Jones felt that the animators could to play to the strengths of the fully digital animation process.|$|E
500|$|In an {{analysis}} of how the show has changed throughout its run, Channel Frederator argued that the main characters of SpongeBob–specifically Sandy, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Karen–have been reduced from multidimensional to reliant on single traits. According to this view, [...] "Karen is now a full-blown nag" [...] in newer episodes. This aspect of Karen's character has also been criticized by author Joseph J. Foy, in his book SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy. He considers this trope one of several harmful stereotypes present on the <b>program,</b> <b>writing</b> that [...] "the motif of the nagging wife is certainly an issue worthy of dissection in dealing with a young audience, along with the spoiled teen daughter [...] and the stupid best friend [...] ".|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{technological}} development {{particularly in the}} computer industry, many computer programming languages are being developed with many computer <b>programs</b> <b>written</b> in these languages. <b>Writing</b> good <b>programs</b> takes time and effort. It is therefore necessary that <b>programs</b> once <b>written</b> {{should be able to}} work together (interoperate) with each other so that a <b>program</b> <b>written</b> in one language can benefit from the advantages that may be associated with another <b>program</b> <b>written</b> in another language. One of the problems with interoperation of programs is the heterogeneity of the programs. This is because <b>programs</b> are <b>written</b> by different people, at different times, in different languages and with different interfaces. Agent-base Software Engineering is an attempt to facilitate the creation of software products that can easily interoperate in such settings...|$|R

2500|$|Although Jackson {{was one of}} {{the most}} liberal members of the Democratic Party, his {{position}} on abortion was originally more in line with pro-life views. Within one month after the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, legalized abortion, Jackson began a PUSH campaign against the decision, calling abortion murder and declaring that Jesus and Moses might not have been born if abortion had been available in ancient times. Jackson's strong rhetoric on abortion temporarily alienated one of his major supporters, T. R. M Howard, a black physician who made a living from performing abortions. In 1975, Jackson endorsed a plan for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. He also endorsed the Hyde Amendment, which bars the funding of abortions through the federal Medicaid <b>program.</b> <b>Writing</b> in a [...] 1977 National Right to Life Committee News report, Jackson argued that the basis for Roe v. Wade – the right to privacy – was also a premise that had been used to justify slavery and the treatment of slaves on the plantations. Jackson decried what he believed was the casual taking of life, and the decline in society's value system. However, Jackson later adopted a pro-choice view that abortion is a right and that the government should not prevent a woman from having an abortion.|$|E
