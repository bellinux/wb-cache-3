Its barometric <b>pressure</b> <b>recording</b> of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the most intense from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the most intense June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} continuous, non-invasive, beat-to-beat finger blood pressure monitoring on sleep in healthy men. DESIGN: After 1 night of habituation to the laboratory environment, which consisted of the placement of electroencephalographic equipment without recording, polygraphic sleep recordings were performed during two consecutive nights (nights 1 and 2) in 15 healthy men (mean +/- SD age 25 +/- 6 years). Blood pressure was recorded continuously for 24 h {{from the end of}} night 1 to the end of night 2. RESULTS: The blood <b>pressure</b> <b>recording</b> procedure caused a decrease in the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increased the duration of nocturnal awakenings. Consequently, sleep efficiency was decreased by approximately 5 %. The blood pressure measurements did not affect the duration of light and of deep sleep. Although the respective predominance of deep sleep and of REM sleep at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the sleep period were preserved during the night of blood <b>pressure</b> <b>recording,</b> the blood <b>pressure</b> <b>recording</b> procedure hampered the rise in REM sleep during the final two thirds of the sleep period. CONCLUSION: In healthy young men continuous, non-invasive, beat-to-beat finger blood pressure monitoring induced modest reductions in sleep efficiency of similar magnitude to those observed previously with non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

40|$|In July 1995 in {{the course}} of the Hot Dry Rock (HDR) site {{investigation}} studies in Soultz s. F. (France) multi rate hydraulic injection tests were conducted in the borehole GPK 2. The downhole <b>pressure</b> <b>records</b> obtained from the lowermost depth domain between 3211 m and 3876 m demonstrate non-laminar hydraulic behavior. Such behavior was also observed earlier during a similar set of flow step tests in the GPKl borehole Soultz.

The results show that the observed transient <b>pressure</b> <b>record</b> is well predicted by such a non-linear flow law. Conventional laminar flow models cannot reproduce these curves. An evaluation of the parameters resulting from both, steady state and transient analysis leads to assumptions on the geometry of the main fracture system.
