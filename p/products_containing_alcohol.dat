40|$|Allergy to wool {{alcohols}} What are {{wool alcohols}}? Wool alcohols are the principle component of lanolin in which allergens are found. Lanolin {{is a natural}} product obtained from the fleece of sheep. Sebum is extracted from the wool, cleaned and refined to produce anhydrous lanolin. This comprises 3 parts, wool alcohols, fatty alcohols and fatty acids. Currently the wool alcohols are considered the main sensitisers in lanolin but whether they are the sole sensitisers, needs further investigation. Nowadays there is also chemically modified lanolin that may be less sensitising than natural lanolin. Wool alcohols, wool fat, anhydrous lanolin, lanolin alcohol, wool wax and wool grease {{are just some of}} the terms used interchangeably with lanolin. In this article we will use wool alcohols, as it is this fraction of lanolin that is the main cause of contact allergies. What <b>products</b> <b>contain</b> wool <b>alcohols?</b> Lanolin is a good emulsifier; this means it binds well with water thus it is particularly useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations.

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{characteristics}} of sodium carboxymethyl chitosan (SCM-chitosan) as a fixative for eau de cologne product. Methods: SCM-chitosan was prepared by carboxymethylation reaction of chitosan with monochloroacetic acid. The solubility of SCM-chitosan was investigated in water and ethanol. Sixteen perfume compounds which consisted of four chemical types- alcohols, ketones, aldehydes and ethers- were selected for eau de cologne preparation. The turbidity of the products prepared was monitored over 21 -day aging period. Those showing no turbidity were selected for fixative studies with SCM-chitosan. The fixative effect of SCM-chitosan was evaluated by head space gas chromatography at different temperatures (25, 35 and 53 °C). Results: The prepared SCM-chitosan was soluble in water but insoluble in ethanol. The optimum ratio between water and ethanol that could completely dissolve 0. 1 % SCM-chitosan was 2 : 3 v/v. SCM-chitosan showed significant fixative effect (3. 9 - 92. 2 %) on p-cresyl methyl ether (10 % in dipropyleneglycol).

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{development}} of new methods for the synthesis of four classes of biologically relevant heterocycles: 2, 5 -trans-pyrrolidines, benzofused 1 -azabicyclo[3. 3. 0]octanes, benzofused 1 -azabicyclo[4. 3. 0]nonanes, and 3, 5 -cis and 4, 5 -trans isoxazolidines. This methodology inolves palladium-catalyzed carboamination reactions of alkenes bearing pendant heteroatom nucleophiles with aryl/alkenyl halides. The scope and limitations of these new methods are described; models for the stereochemical outcome of these transformations are presented. 	The synthesis of 2, 5 -trans-disubstituted pyrrolidines is accomplished via Pd-catalyzed carboamination reactions of 4 -(but- 3 -en- 1 -yl) oxazolidin- 2 -ones. The requisite substrates are synthesized in 5 to 8 steps from serine methyl ester, and can be generated in enantiopure form from the nonracemic amino acid. The carboamination reactions between these substrates and aryl or alkenyl halides afford tetrahydropyrrolo[1, 2 -c]oxazol- 3 (1 H) -one products with up to three stereocenters in excellent diastereoselectivity. The oxazolidinone can be cleaved to yield 2, 5 -trans-disubstitued pyrrolidines via either reduction or hydrolysis. These heterocyclic <b>products</b> <b>contain</b> an <b>alcohol</b> side-chain, which could be used for further synthetic manipulations. 	A tandem intramolecular N-arylation/carboamination process allows for the generation of benzofused 1 -azabicyclo[3. 3. 0]octanes and benzofused 1 -azabicyclo[4. 3. 0]nonanes from 1 -(2 -bromophenyl) hex- 5 -en- 2 -amine and 1 -(2 -bromophenyl) hept- 6 -en- 3 -amine derivatives. A straightforward one-pot reaction with a single catalyst effects the tandem coupling of these substrates with a variety of aryl chlorides. This affords tricyclic products in moderate to good yield and diastereoselectivity. These transformations illustrate the influence of amine nucleophilicity on the relative rates of carbon nitrogen bond forming reductive elmination vs. alkene aminopalladation of palladium(aryl) (amido) complexes. 	Finally, the synthesis of substituted isoxazolidines via Pd-catalyzed carboamination reactions of O-butenyl hydroxylamines is described. These reactions afford cis- 2, 5 -disubstitued products in excellent diastereoselectivities (up to > 20 : 1), which are considerably higher than those obtained in related carboetherification reactions of N-butenyl hydroxylamines. Studies on the influence of the nitrogen subsituent on the stereochemical outcome of both the carboamination and the carboetherication reactions are described, along with experiments that have led to an expansion in scope of previously described carboetherification reactions of N-butenyl hydroxylamines...|$|R
