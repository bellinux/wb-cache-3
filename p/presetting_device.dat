50|$|Airburst fuzes, using a <b>preset</b> timing <b>device</b> {{initiated}} by the gun firing, were the earliest type of fuze. They were particularly important in the 19th and early 20th Centuries when shrapnel fuzes were widely used. They again became important when cluster munitions became a major element in Cold War ammunition stocks, and the moves to multi-function fuzes in the late 20th century mean that in some western countries airburst fuzes are available with every shell used on operations.|$|R

5000|$|The {{alarming}} dosimeter {{could be}} most closely {{compared with the}} tachometer, as it alarms when the radiographer [...] "redlines" [...] or is exposed to too much radiation. When properly calibrated, activated, and worn on the radiographer's person, it will emit an alarm when the meter measures a radiation level in excess of a <b>preset</b> threshold. This <b>device</b> is intended to prevent the radiographer from inadvertently walking up on an exposed source.|$|R

40|$|Conserving {{electricity}} {{has become}} increasingly important as energy rates and shortages have increased. Consumers can find {{a number of ways}} to cut back on their electrical use, especially with appliances commonly found in the home. Any economy that wants to advance must therefore embrace time management and proper conservation of electrical power supply. This can be achieved through limiting wastage in the limited power supply. The programmable control timer can be use to put ON or OFF any electrical appliance connected to it while the user attends to other things knowing fully well that Electronic Assistance is available. The user can <b>preset</b> the <b>device</b> to a certain value. This is possible with the use of set button on the device. The set button must be pressed to enable the time input buttons to be pressed. After presetting a certain time value, which is shown on the digital display, a press on the count button makes the preset time to countdown to zero. After attaining a “ 000 ” value, the appliance connected to its output sockets goes either ON or OFF...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of a {{multislice}} CT (MSCT) neck scan protocol using z-axis dose modulation (DM). Methods: Neck MSCT {{studies with}} and without DM were performed in a cadaveric phantom using a 64 row scanner with different IN levels (SD 7. 5 - 30 HU) and scout scan doses (20 - 50 mA). Image quality indices were evaluated by two radiologists and radiation exposure parameters were calculated. The lowest dose scan protocol with diagnostic image quality was introduced into the clinical imaging routine and retrospectively evaluated in twenty age-matched patients undergoing neck MSCT with or without DM. Results: Changing IN level from 7. 5 to 20 HU allowed for reducing radiation exposure by 45 - 50 % without compromising image quality. Further dose reduction was achieved by low dose scout scans (4 %, Effective Dose) and modified lens protection usage (14 %, organ dose). Conclusions: Modification of dose modulation <b>presets</b> and protection <b>device</b> use may effectively reduce radiation exposure without compromising diagnostic image quality...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Currently, {{several new}} stent {{retriever}} devices for acute stroke treatment are under development and early clinical evaluation. Preclinical testing under standardized conditions {{is an important}} first step to evaluate the technical performance and potential of these devices. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the immediate recanalization effect, recanalization efficacy, thrombus-device interaction, and safety of a new stent retriever intended for thrombectomy in patients with acute stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The <b>pREset</b> thrombectomy <b>device</b> (4 × 20 mm) was evaluated in 16 vessel occlusions in an established swine model. Radiopaque thrombi (10 -mm length) were used for visualization of thrombus-device interaction during application and retrieval. Flow-restoration effect immediately after deployment and after 5 -minute embedding time before retrieval, recanalization rate after retrieval, thromboembolic events, and complications were assessed. High-resolution FPCT was performed to illustrate thrombus-device interaction during the embedding time. RESULTS: Immediate flow restoration was achieved in 75 % of occlusions. An increase or stable percentage of recanalizations during embedding time before retrieval was seen in 56. 3 %; a decrease, in 12. 5 %; reocclusion of a previously recanalized vessel, in 18. 8 %; and no recanalization effect at all, in 12. 5 %. Complete recanalization (TICI 3) after retrieval was achieved in 93. 8 %; partial recanalization (TICI 2 b), in 6. 2 %. No distal thromboembolic events were observed. High-resolution FPCT illustrated entrapment of the thrombus between the stent struts and compression against the contralateral vessel wall, leading to partial flow restoration. During retrieval, the thrombus was retained in a straight position within the stent struts. CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental study, the pREset thrombus retriever showed a high recanalization rate in vivo. High-resolution FPCT allows detailed illustration of the thrombus-device interaction during embedding time and is advocated as an add-on tool to the animal model used in this study...|$|R
40|$|Portable inhalers are {{divisible}} {{into those}} that deliver medication by patient triggering (pMDIs: a gentle slow inhalation) {{and those that}} use the patient’s inspiratory effort as the force for deaggregation and delivery (DPIs: a stronger deeper inspiratory effort). Patient confusion and poor technique are commonplace. The use of training tools has become standard practice, and unique amongst these is an inspiratory flow meter (In-Check) which is able to simulate the resistance characteristics of different inhalers and, thereby, guide the patient to the correct effort. In-Check’s origins lie in the 1960 s peak expiratory flow meters, {{the development of the}} Mini-Wright peak flow meter, and inspiratory flow assessment via the nose during the 1970 s– 1980 s. The current device (In-Check DIAL G 16) is the third iteration of the original 1998 training tool, with detailed and ongoing assessments of all common inhaler resistances (including combination and breath-actuated inhaler types) summarised into resistance ranges that are <b>preset</b> within the <b>device.</b> The device works by interpolating one of six ranges with the inspiratory effort. Use of the tool {{has been shown to be}} contributory to significant improvements in asthma care and control, and it is being advocated for assessment and training in irreversible lung disease...|$|R
