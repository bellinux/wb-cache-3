40|$|Introduction: The {{overall goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{evaluate}} the long-term prognosis of patients with childhood and juvenile absence epilepsy (CAE and JAE). In this context, we analyzed seizure freedom (terminal remission) as well as antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment covering a period of 5 years prior to the investigation. In addition, we analyzed the risk of recurrence of seizures (relapse) after drug withdrawal and identified predictors for terminal remission or relapse after drug withdrawal. Moreover, the aim was to determine whether patients with CAE and JAE differ in their prognosis and whether the classification into these two subsyndromes is justified. Methods: The study population comprised 147 patients with absence epilepsies lasting for a period of at least 20 years. Data was acquired either by a questionnaire or by evaluation of health records. Results: Mean duration of follow-up was 45 years. Roughly half of all patients had been free of any seizure regardless of type at follow-up for at least 5 years. The majority of these patients (71 %) were treated with AEDs. Predictors for lack of terminal remission were occurrence of generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) and younger age of patients at follow-up. Neither the predominant pattern of seizure recurrence (<b>pyknoleptic</b> vs. non-pyknoleptic absences) nor the age at seizure onset had any influence on the rate of remission. Approximately one third of all patients withdrew AED at least once during the course of their disease and roughly half of these patients relapsed. We identified the age at seizure onset of more than 10 years as well as the occurrence of GTCS as predictors for relapsing after AED withdrawal. Conclusion: The selective examination of two epilepsy subsyndromes (CAE and JAE) based on a study population with an extraordinary long duration of follow-up allowed us to achieve reliable results for the prognosis of patients with CAE and JAE that will be of high value for their future treatment and individual risk analysis. Childhood and juvenile absence epilepsy differ – and this is underlined by terminology – regarding age at manifestation, and additionally by pattern of seizure recurrence (<b>pyknoleptic</b> vs. non-pyknoleptic). The current findings on prognosis did not reveal any differences between the two subsyndromes regarding the rate of remission. This supports the assumption that childhood und juvenile absence epilepsy neurobiologically present an entity and that the age at manifestation is the predominant determinant for the different clinical seizure pattern...|$|E
40|$|Linkage {{analysis}} in separately ascertained families of probands with {{juvenile myoclonic epilepsy}} (JME) has previously provided evidence both for and against {{the existence of a}} locus (designated "EJM 1 "), on chromosome 6 p, predisposing to a trait defined as either clinical JME, its associated electroencephalographic abnormality, or idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Linkage analysis was performed in 19 families in which a proband and at least one first- or two second-degree relatives have clinical JME. Family members were typed for seven highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 6 p: D 6 S 260, D 6 S 276, D 6 S 291, D 6 S 271, D 6 S 465, D 6 S 257, and D 6 S 254. Pairwise and multipoint linkage analysis was carried out under the assumptions of autosomal dominant inheritance at 70 % and 50 % penetrance and autosomal recessive inheritance at 70 % and 50 % penetrance. No significant evidence in favor of linkage to the clinical trait of JME was obtained for any locus. The region formally excluded (LOD score < - 2) by using multipoint analysis varies depending on the assumptions made concerning inheritance parameters and the proportion of linked families, alpha-that is, the degree of locus heterogeneity. Further analysis either classifying all unaffected individuals as unknown or excluding a subset of four families in which <b>pyknoleptic</b> absence seizures were present in one or more individuals did not alter these conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{affecting}} 4 million Americans and 100 – 200 million persons worldwide, {{the precise}} molecular mechanisms of human epilepsies remain unknown. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) {{is the most}} frequent and, hence, most important form of hereditary grand mal epilepsy. In this epilepsy, electroencephalographic (EEG) 15 – 30 -Hz multispikes produce myoclonic and tonic-clonic convulsions beginning at 8 – 20 years of age. Moreover, EEG 3. 5 – 6 -Hz multispike wave complexes appear in clinically asymptomatic family members. We first studied 38 members of a four-generation LA-Belize family with classical JME but with no <b>pyknoleptic</b> absences. Five living members had JME; four clinically asymptomatic members had EEG multispike wave complexes. Pairwise analysis tightly linked microsatellites centromeric to HLA, namely D 6 S 272 (peak lod score [Zmax] = 3. 564 – 3. 560 at male-female recombination [θm=f] = 0 –. 001) and D 6 S 257 (Zmax = 3. 672 – 3. 6667 at θm=f = 0 –. 001), spanning 7 cM, to convulsive seizures and EEG multispike wave complexes. A recombination between D 6 S 276 and D 6 S 273 in one affected member placed the JME locus within or below HLA. Pairwise, multipoint, and recombination analyses in this large family independently proved that a JME gene is located in chromosome 6 p, centromeric to HLA. We next screened, with the same chromosome 6 p 21. 2 -p 11 short tandem-repeat polymorphic markers, seven multiplex pedigrees with classic JME. When lod scores for small multiplex families are added to lod scores of the LA-Belize pedigree, Zmax values for D 6 S 294 and D 6 S 257 are > 7 (θm=f =. 000). Our results prove that in chromosome 6 p 21. 2 -p 11 an epilepsy locus exists whose phenotype consists of classic JME with convulsions and/or EEG rapid multispike wave complexes...|$|E
