5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in <b>plant</b> <b>health.</b> This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E

Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using {{the measurement of}} the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits {{the fact that in}} those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E

Predatory nematodes can be bred by soaking a specific recipe of leaves and other detritus in water, in a dark, cool place, and can even be purchased as an organic form of pest control.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Brown, who had {{established}} {{a reputation as a}} strong environmentalist, was confronted with a serious medfly infestation in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was advised by the state's agricultural industry, and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> Inspection service (APHIS), to authorize airborne spraying of the region. Initially, in accordance with his environmental protection stance, he chose to authorize ground-level spraying only. Unfortunately, the infestation spread as the medfly reproductive cycle out-paced the spraying. After more than a month, millions of dollars of crops had been destroyed and billions of dollars more were threatened. Governor Brown then authorized a massive response to the infestation. Fleets of helicopters sprayed malathion at night, and the California National Guard set up highway checkpoints and collected many tons of local fruit; in the final stage of the campaign, entomologists released millions of sterile male medflies in an attempt to disrupt the insects' reproductive cycle.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, Bertness {{and colleagues}} (Bertness et al. 2014b) {{performed}} a field experiment excluding predators from plots on the grazing {{border of the}} marsh. Within one growing season, exclusion of top predators triggered die-off by increasing the abundances of Sesarma crabs {{and the intensity of}} herbivory. To further test the trophic cascade hypothesis, Bertness and colleagues used the spread of die-off into Narragansett Bay to assess all proposed drivers of die-off, including: 1) eutrophication decreases plant investment into belowground biomass causing plant collapse, 2) boat wakes erode creek banks, 3) pollution or disease affect <b>plant</b> <b>health,</b> 4) substrate hardness controls herbivorous crab distributions and 5) trophic dysfunction releases Sesarma from predator control. Nitrogen availability, wave intensity and plant growth did not explain any variation in die-off. However, herbivory explained over 70% of inter-site variation in die-off. (Bertness et al. 2014a) This work highlighted one particular example where top-down interactions were experimentally shown to be the primary driver of ecological community state change.|$|E

500|$|Soring is the {{practice}} of applying irritants or blistering agents to the front feet or forelegs of a horse, making it pick its feet up higher in an exaggerated manner that creates the movement or [...] "action" [...] desired in the show ring. Soring {{is an act of}} animal cruelty that gives practitioners an unfair advantage over other competitors. The Horse Protection Act is enforced by the Animal and <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> Inspection Service (APHIS), a branch of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Although violations of the law are seen most often in the Tennessee Walking Horse industry, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.|$|E
500|$|Little {{has been}} {{reported}} of its ecology. The flowering season is from May to July, and the seed is shed annually. When first published, Banksia acanthopoda was listed as [...] "Priority Three – Poorly Known Taxa" [...] on the Department of Environment and Conservation's Declared Rare and Priority Flora List. It has since been upgraded to [...] "Priority Two – Poorly Known Taxa". Threats to the species {{vary according to the}} location. In the Avon Wheatbelt, where the land is heavily degraded due to extensive clearing for agriculture, a number of threatening processes have been identified: loss of habitat due to land clearing and the encroachment of salinity results in both direct plant loss and population fragmentation; fragmentation in turn affects genetic diversity; grazing pressure affects <b>plant</b> <b>health,</b> as does competition from exotic weeds; and changes to the fire regime have the potential to eliminate entire generations. Further west, in the Jarrah Forest region, pathogens constitute the only identified threat to the species.|$|E
500|$|The showing, {{exhibition}} {{and sale of}} Tennessee Walking Horses and some other horse breeds is governed by the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA) due to concerns about the practice of soring, which developed during the 1950s and became widespread in the 1960s, resulting in a public outcry. Congress passed the Horse Protection Act in 1970, declaring the practice [...] "cruel and inhumane". The Act prohibits anyone from entering a sored horse into a show, sale, auction or exhibition, and prohibits drivers from transporting sored horses to a sale or show. Congress delegated statutory responsibility for enforcement to the management of sales and horse shows, but placed administration of the act with the Animal and <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Violations of the HPA may result in criminal charges, fines and prison sentences. The USDA certifies certain Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) to train and license Designated Qualified Persons (DQPs) to complete inspections. APHIS inspection teams, which include inspectors, investigators, and veterinary medical officers, also conduct unannounced inspections of some horse shows, and {{have the authority to}} revoke the license of a DQP who does not follow the standards of the Act.|$|E
