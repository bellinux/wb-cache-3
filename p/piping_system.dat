25|$|In August, TEPCO began {{considering}} {{changing the}} core injection method for the no. 3 reactor {{as it was}} requiring a much larger quantity of water to cool and the temperatures remained relatively high compared to the nos. 1 and 2 reactors which required far less water. TEPCO has hypothesized {{that this may be}} because some fuel is still present above the core support plate inside the pressure vessel of the no. 3 reactor in addition to the fuel that has fallen {{to the bottom of the}} pressure vessel. The fuel on the bottom would be easily cooled by the existing method, but as the pressure vessel is leaking, any fuel located on the support plate was likely only being cooled due to the steam generated by the cooling of the melted fuel at the bottom. TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core spray system pipes as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater <b>piping</b> <b>system.</b> A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core spray system pipes and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the core spray system piping. On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees Celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's temperature readings are between 70–80 degrees Celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3.|$|E

2500|$|Thermodynamic {{benefits}} are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated. [...] Major factors limiting the load output of a {{combined cycle power plant}} are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine {{and the heat}} recovery steam generator waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm-up times for the balance of plant and the main <b>piping</b> <b>system.</b> Those limitations also influence the fast start-up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times. And waiting gas turbines consume gas. The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if we have heat storage, allows us to preheat the steam to the required conditions. That is, the plant is started faster and we consume less gas before achieving operating conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Deep-sea photography, {{recovered}} artifacts, and {{an evaluation}} of her design and operational history permitted a Court of Inquiry to conclude Thresher had probably suffered {{the failure of a}} salt-water <b>piping</b> <b>system</b> joint which relied heavily on silver brazing instead of welding; earlier tests using ultrasound equipment found potential problems with about 14% of the tested brazed joints, most of which were determined not to pose a risk significant enough to require a repair. High-pressure water spraying from a broken pipe joint may have shorted out one of the many electrical panels, causing a shutdown ("scram") of the reactor, with a subsequent loss of propulsion. The inability to blow the ballast tanks was later attributed to excessive moisture in the submarine's high-pressure air flasks, moisture which froze and plugged the flasks' flowpaths while passing through the valves. This was later simulated in dock-side tests on Threshers sister sub, [...] During a test to simulate blowing ballast at or near test depth, ice formed on strainers installed in valves; the flow of air lasted only a few seconds. Air dryers were later retrofitted to the high-pressure air compressors, beginning with Tinosa, to permit the emergency blow system to operate properly.|$|E

40|$|Piping systems {{represent}} {{a vital part}} of energy industries, e. g. petrochemical, oil & gas and chemical plants, where they are often employed to transport dangerous goods like oil and gas. A single failure in such systems may cause serious accidents both to the environment and human lives. During past earthquakes, <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> and their components suffered significant damages causing severe consequences, as reported in several publications. Thus, seismic assessment/evaluation of these structures has become an imperative for their proper design to safeguard them against seismic events. Nevertheless, there exists an inadequacy of proper seismic analysis and design rules for petrochemical <b>piping</b> <b>systems,</b> and designers have to follow seismic standards conceived for other structures such as buildings and nuclear plants. Moreover, the modern performance-based design approach is still not widely adopted for <b>piping</b> <b>systems,</b> where the allowable design method is the customary practice. Along these lines, this paper presents a performance-based seismic analysis of petrochemical plants through two case studies. Initially, main issues on seismic analysis and design of industrial <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> and components are addressed followed by a discussion on the selection of proper seismic inputs. The current allowable stress and strain based seismic verification methods are presented afterward. Then, nonlinear finite element analyses of two typical petrochemical <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> under modern design earthquake levels are presented. Finally, performance of these <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> is commented by comparing the maximum stress and strain levels -found from the analyses- with the allowable design values that exhibited a favourable behaviour of the analysed systems under earthquake limit state levels...|$|R

As processes are terminated or brought off-line, facilities are placed on the inactive list, and facility managers and site contractors are required to assure a safe and reliable decommissioning and transition of these facilities to a clean final state. Decommissioning of facilities requires extensive reliable characterization, decontamination {{and in some cases}} dismantlement. Characterization of <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> throughout the DOE complex {{is becoming more and more}} necessary. In addition to decommissioning activities, characterization activities are performed as part of surveillance and maintenance (S&M). Because of the extent of contamination, all inactive facilities require some type of S&M. These S&M activities include visual assessment, equipment and material accounting, and maintenance.
