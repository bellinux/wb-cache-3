The tariffs for imported foreign cars and trucks were increased to a minimum 50% and 100%, respectively. The tariffs are linked to engine size of the vehicle. The increased duties led to protests in Russian cities, most notably in Vladivostok, as the import of Japanese cars is an important sector of the city's economy.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, western child welfare and {{protection}} {{has been subjected}} to many reforms. This is no different in Flanders - the Dutch speaking part of Belgium - where child welfare and protection has been reconstructed by integrating the various child welfare and protection services into one shared organisational framework. This reform has been defined as a way forward to a more emancipatory and needs-driven instead of supply-driven youth care system and even has been called a Copernican Revolution towards more responsive social work, stressing the welfare logic above the <b>protectionistic</b> logic. In order to realize this Copernican Revolution, the Flemish government invested to a great extent in the enhanced introduction of more and better information and registration tools to better capture and respond to the needs of children and families. In this presentation we draw on preliminary results of an empirical study where we performed 1) a conventional qualitative content analysis of policy documents relating to the subject of information and registration tools in child welfare and protection and 2) qualitative semi-structured interviews with key policy actors in the field of Flemish child welfare and protection in order to gain insight into the governmental logics and goals for installing information and registration tools. These results show that there are various “underlying” governmental logics regarding the use and installation of these information and registration tools. In this oral presentation, we will argue that these various underlying logics raise severe questions concerning the development a Copernican revolution towards responsive social work, as these instruments are mainly driven by a <b>protectionistic</b> logic rather than child welfare logic...|$|E
40|$|The article {{refers to}} the most {{important}} problems of contemporary international economic relations, with special attention paid to the causes and consequences of growing <b>protectionistic</b> and discriminatory tendencies in international trade. The growth of protectionism is the outcome of growing competition {{on the part of}} Japan and newly industralized countries as well as of instability of monetary conditions. Over- and undervalue of currencies give rise to employment problems and difficulties in balances of payment, leading to the intensification of <b>protectionistic</b> trade policy and to the growth of restrictions in international trade exchange. The analysis of the problems of contemporary order in world trade in regional and branch aspects leads to several conclusions. Firstly, administrative methods of control and stabilization of export income and prices in developing countries are for the most part inefficient Developing countries may gain more profit from liberalization rather than regulation of trade. Secondly, if the socialist countries introduce appropriate changes in their economies, they may achieve profits from the specialization of production also by increasing their "openness". Thirdly, agricultural and textile sectors belong to the most "regulated" ones. Reducing the degree of regulation of these two sectors is difficult not only because basic controversies occur between developed and developing countries but also among the countries belonging to the first of the two groups. The increase in prospective efficiency of GATT makes it necessary to adjust its rules to contemporary tendencies in international economic relations. In particular, it is indispensable to coordinate financial and monetary aspects of macroeconomic policy between main trade and political organizations. Moreover, structural adjustment of developed countries in traditional sectors is also indispensable. GATT should also provide for the exceptions to its own rules in order to present the development of uncontrolled restrictive regulations in international exchange...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is, through a {{comparative}} analysis of the legal state {{in a number of}} different legal systems, namely the Common law, French law, German law, and the laws of the Nordic countries, to see how these systems differ in their approaches towards interference with contractual relations. Do the different systems find the phenomenon of interference with contractual relations a problem and, if so, in what way and which methods or techniques are used to handle the matter? The purpose is, therefore, also to examine whether different legal systems can, through different approaches, find different solutions to a problem such as interference with contractual relations, and if these solutions have the same effect regarding legal protection. Furthermore, the purpose is to study why and how come the different legal systems have chosen to deal with the matter in different ways. Is there an underlying interest which is approached with a different degree of <b>protectionistic</b> enthusiasm? If so, what are the consequences...|$|E
40|$|Guilds and the French Revolution: Three Examples from Lille. Under Napoleon, {{the attempt}} of three guilds, {{those of the}} bakers, the dry-goods merchants, and the linen thread spinners, to {{reimpose}} guild-like regulations on Lille's economy suggests that {{the abolition of the}} guilds did not necessarily serve the interests of the bourgeoisie. Members of the Napoleonic Chamber of Commerce, as well as local officials including the mayor and prefect, wished to restore crucial functions the guilds had played in the old regime, such as protecting local markets, controlling the quality of textiles produced for export, and securing the urban fax base. Thus, the laisser-faire position of the central government, which generally refused to sanction most of these <b>protectionistic</b> practices, did not represent the interests of important segments of Lille's bourgeoisie. The government's liberal policy, however, did facilitate the economic centralization of the state. Bossenga Gail. La Révolution française et les corporations : trois exemples lillois. In: Annales.

In last time foreign trade policy has been strongly affected by the force of the world economic crisis. Trade distortions revenues and protectionism played important roles in the politics of political parties. What indicates the importance and innovativeness of the research is the presentation of the new aspects of the political economy models of the foreign trade policy and trade interests in the political economy. First of all it must underline that in the new theoretical terms in the demand for trade policy very important is factor specificity. The low specificity of factors means that factor returns are equalized throughout a region’s economy. On the other hand, the Ricardo-Viner assumes that some factors are stuck in their present uses; therefore, factor returns are not equalized throughout a region’s economy, but are industry specific. Trade policy coalitions should form along the lines of exporting versus import-competing industries. The main objective of the research task is to give a comprehensive analysis of the political economy models of foreign trade policy, trade interests indicated by export orientation and import sensitivity, <b>protectionistic</b> pressures in different political system and different types of authoritarian regimes. It must be emphasis that on a theoretical level, understanding the choice of trade policies between liberalizm and protectionisme is very important.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine whether four-to-eight year old children need media education. The thesis is that media education may help reduce or counteract the negative influences of the media and as such is derived from the <b>protectionistic</b> "impact mediation model" of television literacy. Using a psycho-sociological research framework this study aims to achieve an increased understanding of the impact of a wide range of entertainment media on infant children's everyday experiences. The research blends together conventional quantitative methods of data gathering and alternative qualitative data-gathering approaches. Parental and teacher perceptions of four-to-eight year old children's relationship with the entertainment media were obtained using a questionnaire. Infant children were interviewed individually or in small groups using a structured interview schedule. In addition, infant children were observed in their normal home environment while viewing regular television programs and a choice of two prescribed videos. The main findings of the study are: that infant children are frightened by all forms of entertainment media, although the electronic audio-visual media are more likely to induce fears than other forms of media; media education does not reduce children's media fears; most children had a good understanding of television's representation of reality and fantasy; media education did not help younger children differentiate between advertisements and television programs; children in this study did not imitate the antisocial content of television and other media - according to parents, teachers and self-reports. The need for media education - based on the media effects model, was questioned...|$|E

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of social {{clause in the}} scope of the OMC, as form to eliminate lower conditions of work in the developing countries, is subject that comes exhaustingly being argued inside of the international relations of the commerce. The developed countries accuse the social developing countries with “dumping” and advocate for restrictions in the international trade to the countries that do not consecrate a minimum standard of requirements for the working class. The developing countries accuse the developed countries of waking use of this speech as form to protect their domestic markets. The arguments of both are reasonable, therefore, it is necessary to find an term intermediate, that interrelates OIT and OMC in the direction of protecting the involved workers in the process of production for the international market, at the same time, that it hinders the developed countries of tanking advantage of the social clause to impose <b>protectionistic</b> barriers, harming the developing countries.

40|$|The ongoing trade {{liberalisation}} has reduced tariffs and {{barriers to trade}} significantly and has opened up markets to foreign actors. The globalisation has {{in the same time}} increased the effects of the {{trade liberalisation}} by the disappearance of national borders and the facilitation of cross-border transactions. The debate of further international cooperation in the field of competition is based on the fear that the effects of the trade liberalisation will be consumed by governmental and private anticompetitive behaviour, which will constitute new forms of barriers. Admittedly, nations have a tendency to direct their behaviour by mainly national welfare considerations and this increases the likelihood that nations use anticompetitive practices to limit the result of the trade liberalisation. After all, competition is a means to attain higher national economic efficiency and this makes the fear of rent shifting practices even more justified. The inability of nations to evaluate their actions in a wider spectrum, and to work towards global welfare as the predominant goal, makes the process towards any convergence of nations’ competition laws very difficult and time-consuming. The process is also complicated by the different positions the US and the EC, the two largest economies in the world, have taken. The consequence has been a polarised debate with, on the one hand the far reaching approach of the EC, which is opting for the adoption of some core principles within the WTO, {{and on the other hand}} the more limited view of the US, which believes the best way to achieve international convergence in competition matters is by voluntary bilateral agreements. The standpoint is taken from the cases Boeing/McDonnell Douglas and GE/Honeywell. The cases illustrate the possibility to arbitrarily take into consideration industrial policy reasons but openly defend this by the application of the nation’s competition law. Not saying this was the case in the two mergers, even if some authors are of that opinion, it is obvious that differences in competition authorities’ assessment may constitute a <b>protectionistic</b> measure or at least provoke accusation of protectionism...|$|E

Paper I constitutes {{an illustration of}} PERT and PEST policies in analyzing the potential economic impacts of bST adoption and dairy <b>protectionistic</b> patterns across OECD countries.

In the theoretical framework, the ex-ante analysis incorporates a producers 2 ̆ 7 political resource constraint indicative of their lobbying contributions. The bST is introduced in the ex-post framework via a yield enhancement function to account for milk increases {{from the use of}} bST. The Basic Linked System (BLS) of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis is used to examine the impacts of bST adoption across selected countries under various policy and adoption scenarios;Paper II focuses on the economic and welfare effects of bST adoption across industrialized and developing countries. Some eco-ethical issues involved in the development and adoption of bST are discussed. The implications of inter-country exchange are then incorporated into a conceptual framework of the interactions among proponents and opponents of the technology as well as the politicians, highlighting public choice foundations of policy formulation and its effects across countries. The BLS model is used to ascertain the impacts of bST adoption under a number of scenarios regarding adoption rates and yield increases;Paper III examines the impacts of a parasite control, Ivomec, on pig average daily gains and feed efficiency. The experiment was conducted over a two-year period at an Iowa farm. Results indicate significant performance gains for treatment pigs during the grower phase in both years. In the first year, control groups outperformed treatment groups in overall average daily gains. Housing facilities comparisons indicated improved performance in case of groups weaned to grower 3 in both years. Results for seasonality analysis were mixed.

40|$|In general, {{data and}} {{scientific}} information on farmers’ cooperatives are very rare in Switzerland. There is no official statistic that collects {{the number and}} types of existing cooperatives in Switzerland. In view of the little information interviews with experts and an internet search has additionally been conducted. Collective actions of farmers have a long tradition in Switzerland. The earliest forms of collective actions in agricultural {{can be traced back}} to the management of common land and forest areas in early Germanic times. Like in most other European countries, the cooperative movement emerged in the second half of the 19 th century in Switzerland and experienced a rapid diffusion. Due to the <b>protectionistic</b> agricultural policy and guaranteed prices and incomes after the Second World War, only few farmers put much effort in building up / developing further selfhelp structures. The recent policy changes provide a new basis for cooperative actions. However, new collective initiatives are to a lesser extent a selfhelp measure, but rather a business strategy to improve the competitiveness of individual farms. Nowadays, there are a wide range of different collective farmers’ marketing initiatives. The importance of these initiatives various greatly and depends highly on the commodity. They play for example a very dominant role in the milk, cereal and oilseed sector. In contrast to this, collective farmers’ marketing initiatives are less dominant in the meat, vegetable and fruit sector. In total, five different forms have been identified as the main ones in Switzerland. These are: independent producer cooperatives, united cooperatives / federations of producer cooperatives, producer pools, producer interest groups, regional marketing initiatives. Each form was described by a case example. From the Swiss perspective, the following key criteria seem to be appropriate for a classification of collective actions of farmers: actors involved in the initiative (are nonfarmers also members/shareholders/partners), degree of involvement/collectivity, relationship to other supply chain actors, aims and activities of the initiatives. Collective initiatives are particularly a suitable approach for the Swiss mountain area, which are characterised by their natural and cultural heritage. Since consumers are willing to pay higher prices for authentic quality food, such products produced by COFAMIs may successfully compete on the market against cheap products from agroindustrial companies. However, in order to increase the production of high quality food (organic products, PDG/PGI, etc.) in Switzerland, it would be necessary that more agricultural products are exported. Currently, there are two programmes which offer funds for specific collective actions. The future direct payment policy, however, could have a strong impact on the attractiveness of collective actions of farmers. If the production of food becomes economically less important than the provision of public goods and services, the necessity for collective action will rather be reduced...|$|E
40|$|The author, Director of the Max Planck Institute for International Patent, Copyright and Competition Law in Munich {{considers}} {{the influence of}} full uniformization of the EEC market after 1992 on the protection of industrial property and on free flow of goods within the Community. He pays {{much attention to the}} relations between the internal legal systems regulating the protection of patents, trademarks, designs and copyrights to the law of the Community. Both in the present {{as well as in the}} past — 1992 prospective regulation of the EEC law a departure from the protection granted by internal (national) legal systems seems not only undesirable but also impossible. Much time is needed for common European protection laws to supersede the coexisting protection provided by internal systems. The analysis of particular industrial property rights allows the author to formulate the conclusion that the greatest progress in that respect has been achieved in the EEC patent law; European patents granted on the strength of the Munich Convention of 1973 are much in demand. It should be stressed that the creation by the end of 1992 of uniform internal EEC market is a strong incentive for intensifying the works on the uniformization of industrial property protection. The author also analyses the decisions of the EEC Court with respect to the law on industrial property and free flow of goods on the EEC market, paying special attention to decisions based on Art. 36 of the Treaty of Rome. As to the relation between the principle of free flow of goods and the restrictions resulting from internal systems of industrial property law hitherto existing decisions of the EEC Court will fully remain in force also after 1992. The Court adopted a principle, well known in German law since long, of exhaustion of a right to trademark. This principle allows neither to divide the Common Market by means of national trademarks nor to isolate it from goods produced or reimported from the outside of the Common Market as long as such goods have been provided with a trademark by an authorized person. Circulation restrictions are to maintain arificially high prices for trademarked goods. Towards the end of his article the author points out that there is a danger of changing that situation once the European trademark law comes into force. Recently, under the pressure of industrial lobbies, views have been expressed that this law should regulate only the institution of „European" and not „exterritorial" exhaustion of a right. Such a short-sighted and economically unjustified regulation could lead to the <b>protectionistic</b> isolation of the Community from the rest of the world. The author is strongly for retaining the conception of exterritorial exhaustion of a right to a trademark...|$|E
