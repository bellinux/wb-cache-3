The postincubation stress modified significantly the hypokinesis effect. Findings recorded in birds differed considerably from findings obtained in laboratory mammals, in which the hypokinesis induced significant changes in endocrine functions, body weight decrease and proteosynthesis disorders.

Probable risk factors for A(H 5 N 1) transmission to human have been demonstrated in several studies or epidemiological reports. However, transmission patterns may differ according to {{demographic characteristics of the}} population and local practices. This article aggregates these data from three studies with data collected in the previous surveys in 2006 and 2007 to further examine the risks factors associated with presence of anti-A(H 5) antibodies among villagers residing within outbreak areas. Methods We aggregated 5 -year data (2006 – 2010) from serology survey and matched case-control studies in Cambodia to further examine the risks factors associated with A(H 5 N 1) infection among villagers in the outbreak areas. Results Serotesting among villagers detected 35 (1. 5  % [0 – 2. 6]) positive cases suggesting recent exposure to A(H 5 N 1) virus. Practices associated with A(H 5 N 1) infection among all ages were: having <b>poultry</b> <b>cage</b> or nesting area under or adjacent to the house (OR: 6. 7 [1. 6 – 28. 3]; p[*]=[*] 0. 010) and transporting poultry to market (OR: 17. 6 [1. 6 – 193. 7]; p[*]=[*] 0. 019).

40|$|ASBTRACT Betaine {{is one of}} feed {{additive}} as a donor of methyl groups (CH 3) and can release the group at a transmethylation reaction to synthesize a variety of important metabolic substances such as carnitine, creatine, and lecithin. Betaine is a tertiary amine formed from the oxidation of choline (Wang et al., 2004) and is involved in methionine sparing, osmoprotective and fat distribution (Metzler- Zebeli et al., 2009). Methionine is an essential amino acid required for protein synthesis and fat metabolism. According to Wang et al. (2004), {{when the number of}} methionine on feed is inadequate, methionine supplementation is used for protein synthesis, while more efficient betaine as a methyl donor involved in the synthesis of carnitine, which is essential for beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids. Based on this, the effect of betaine supplementation can be seen by looking at the levels of protein and fat in the blood profile.

40|$|Samples of {{drinking}} water from <b>poultry</b> <b>cages,</b> which can be collected conveniently and noninvasively, provide higher rates of infl uenza (H 9 N 2) virus isolation than do samples of fecal droppings. Studies to confi rm the usefulness of poultry drinking water for detecting infl uenza (H 5 N 1) should be conducted in disease-endemic areas. Pandemic influenza originates from influenza viruses of birds (1). Live poultry markets {{play a crucial role}} in maintenance, amplification, and dissemination of avian influenza viruses (2 – 4) and are a risk factor for zoonotic transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H 5 N 1) viruses to humans (5, 6). Maintaining surveillance of live poultry markets for influenza viruses is therefore important. In routine surveillance of live poultry markets, handling birds for collecting tracheal or cloacal swabs is often unacceptable to the bird sellers. Because avian influenza viruses were believed to be transmitted primarily by the oral–fecal route (7), fecal droppings were therefore regarded as the noninvasive specimen of choice for surveillance purposes (8). However, emerging evidence from experimental studies indicates that H 9 N 2 (9) and H 5 N 1 (10) subtypes are shed in higher titers in the upper respiratory tract. We tested the hypothesis that sampling drinking water is a convenient, noninvasive, and sensitive method for conducting avian influenza surveillance in live poultry markets. Because vaccine-derived Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is also commonly isolated from poultry in Hong Kong, we used NDV isolation rates for comparison. As part of our ongoing surveillance in live poultry markets in Hong Kong, 51 – 67 poultry stalls in 8 poultry markets were sampled monthly from August 2004 through July 2005. Typically, several poultry of the same type share a cage, and all birds in the same cage share a drinking water trough, which is intermittently filled from the municipal water supply.

In the year 2009, egg production counted for 6, 211 million pieces of which 95. 73 % hen eggs, by 25 % less than in 1990 because of the decline in poultry stock and average egg production. As a result, in 2009, only 289 eggs per capita were achieved compared to 347 pieces in 1990. In consequence, the demand/offer ratio has been an unbalanced one and only 50 % of domestic production was able to cover market needs. The EU requirements concerning <b>poultry</b> welfare (<b>cage</b> modernization etc), new growing methods friendly with the environment and food safety have led to a decline of the number of laying hens, to the closing of some poultry farms and to an increase of production cost because of the new investments. In addition, cereal increased purchasing price has deeply influenced farm input cost and egg price.

5000|$|Battery cages are {{a housing}} system used for various animal {{production}} methods, but primarily for egg-laying hens. The name {{arises from the}} arrangement of rows and columns of identical cages connected together, sharing common divider walls, as in the cells of a battery. Although the term is usually applied to <b>poultry</b> farming, similar <b>cage</b> systems are used for other animals. Battery cages have generated controversy between advocates for animal rights, and industrial producers. Battery cages are the predominant form of housing for laying hens worldwide. They reduce aggression and cannibalism among hens, but are barren, restrict movement, prevent many natural behaviours, and increase rates of osteoporosis. As of 2014, approximately 95% of eggs in the US were produced in battery cages.In the UK, statistics from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) indicate that 50% of eggs produced in the UK throughout 2010 were from cages (45% from free-range, 5% from barns). [...] However, introduction of the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC which banned conventional battery cages in the EU from January 2012 for welfare reasons, means the number of eggs from battery cages in the EU states is rapidly decreasing.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Airborne dust in poultry {{housing is}} known {{to be one of the}} primary means by which disease-causing organisms are spread {{throughout}} a house. An electrostatic space charge system (ESCS) was used to reduce airborne dust in a small-scale broiler breeder house. The system used ceiling fans to distribute negatively charged air throughout the room and to move negatively charged dust downward toward the grounded litter where most of it would be captured. The system significantly (P < 0. 0001) reduced airborne dust by an average of 61 %, ammonia by an average of 56 % (P < 0. 0001), and airborne bacteria by 67 % (P < 0. 0001). Earlier studies with an ESCS have resulted in significant reductions of airborne dust, bacteria, and airborne transmission of disease in <b>poultry</b> hatching cabinets, <b>caged</b> layer rooms, and in controlled environment disease transmission cabinets. The ESCS was shown to be a reliable and easily maintained system for reducing airborne dust, ammonia, and bacteria in a small broiler breeder house. Results of this study combined with the results of related ESCS studies suggest that the system could probably be scaled up to full-sized production houses for poultry or other animals for dust reduction, pathogen reduction, and possibly ammonia reduction.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the adoption possibility of Maize- Mucuna-Fertiliser (mineral) System (MMFS), for soil fertilisation {{in the southern part}} of Togo, 52 farms from three representative villages of the region were analysed and classified into three types according to their adoption potential for the innovation: type A characterised by heads of farm being in majority land owners; type B whose head of farm are young, literate and in majority land tenants; and type C whose heads are old mainly land tenants. Participatory surveys, based on contingent ranking of the constraints, conducted with homogenous groups of farmers chosen according to three types of farm, helped to sort out the major constraints to the adoption of MMFS. These constraints, having a high degree of severity (≥ 45 %), were in order of importance: the lack of money/loan, the land problem (lack of arable lands and insecurity on rented ones), the suppression of mixed cropping by the MMFS and the non availability of mucuna seed. For the farmers of type A, the non availability of mucuna seed and the lack of money/loan presented a degree of severity of 100 % each. For those of type B and C, the land problem was the most important: it presented a degree of severity of 100 % for the farmers of type B and 80 % for those of type C. Sixty growing rabbits were housed at densities of 6. 7, 10, 13. 3, 16. 7 and 20 rabbits/m 2 in wood and <b>poultry</b> wire mesh <b>cages</b> for six weeks and fed a common diet of 22. 6 % CP and 2600 kcal/kg ME. Parameters measured were feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, body condition, fur condition and body bites. Stocking density significantly (P< 0. 05) affected feed intake and weight gain but not feed conversion ratio of rabbits. Rabbits stocked at densities of 6. 7, 10 and 13. 3 rabbits/m 2 had higher average daily gain than those stocked at higher densities. Feed intake was higher at higher densities. The trend shows a significant decrease in feed intake by individual rabbits as stocking density increases in week 1 - 2 and 3 - 4. Feed conversion ratio was poorer at higher densities (16. 7, 20 rabbits/m 2) than at lower densities (6. 7, 10, 13. 3 rabbits/m 2). There was no definite relationship between stocking density and mortality rate of rabbits.
