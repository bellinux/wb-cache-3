40|$|Nonstructural protein 5 A of the {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) is {{a highly}} <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>molecule</b> implicated in multiple interactions with the host cell and most likely involved in RNA replication. Two phosphorylated variants of NS 5 A have been described, designated according to their apparent molecular masses (in kilodaltons) as p 56 and p 58, which correspond to the basal and hyperphosphorylated forms, respectively. With the aim of identifying a possible role of NS 5 A phosphorylation for RNA replication, we performed an extensive mutation analysis of three serine clusters {{that are involved in}} phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation of NS 5 A. In most cases, alanine substitutions for serine residues in the central cluster 1 that enhanced RNA replication to the highest levels led to a reduction of NS 5 A hyperphosphorylation. Likewise, several highly adaptive mutations in NS 4 B, which is also part of the replication complex, resulted in a reduction of NS 5 A hyperphosphorylation too, arguing that alterations of the NS 5 A phosphorylation pattern play an important role for RNA replication. On the other hand, a deletion encompassing all highly conserved serine residues in the C-terminal region of NS 5 A that are involved in basal phosphorylation did not significantly affect RNA replication but reduced formation of p 56. This region was found to tolerate even large insertions with only a moderate effect on replication. Based on these results, we propose a model of the role of NS 5 A phosphorylation in the viral life cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} chaperone Hsp 27 exists as a distribution of large oligomers that are disassembled by phosphorylation at Ser- 15, - 78, and - 82. It is controversial whether the unphosphorylated Hsp 27 or the widely used triple Ser-to-Asp phospho-mimic mutant {{is the more}} active {{molecular chaperone}} in vitro. This question was investigated here by correlating chaperone activity, {{as measured by the}} aggregation of reduced insulin or α-lactalbumin, with Hsp 27 self-association as monitored by analytical ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, because the phospho-mimic is generally assumed to reproduce the <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>molecule,</b> the size and chaperone activity of phosphorylated Hsp 27 were compared with that of the phospho-mimic. Hsp 27 was triply phosphorylated by MAPKAP- 2 kinase, and phosphorylation was tracked by urea-PAGE. An increasing degree of suppression of insulin or α-lactalbumin aggregation correlated with a decreasing Hsp 27 self-association, which was the least for phosphorylated Hsp 27 followed by the mimic followed by the unphosphorylated protein. It was also found that Hsp 27 added to pre-aggregated insulin did not reverse aggregation but did inhibit these aggregates from assembling into even larger aggregates. This chaperone activity appears to be independent of Hsp 27 phosphorylation. In conclusion, the most active chaperone of insulin and α-lactalbumin was the Hsp 27 (elongated) dimer, the smallest Hsp 27 subunit observed under physiological conditions. Next, the Hsp 27 phospho-mimic is only a partial mimic of phosphorylated Hsp 27, both in self-association and in chaperone function. Finally, the efficient inhibition of insulin aggregation by Hsp 27 dimer led to the proposal of two models for this chaperone activity...|$|E
40|$|Integrin-mediated cell {{adhesion}} stimulates {{a cascade of}} signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, migration, and survival, mostly through tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules. p 130 Cas, originally identified as a major substrate of v-Src, is a scaffold molecule that interacts with several proteins and mediates multiple cellular events after {{cell adhesion}} and mitogen treatment. Here, we describe a novel p 130 Cas-associated protein named p 140 Cap (Cas-associated protein) as a new tyrosine <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>molecule</b> involved in integrin- and epidermal growth factor (EGF) -dependent signaling. By affinity chromatography of human ECV 304 cell extracts on a MBP-p 130 Cas column followed by mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight analysis, we identified p 140 Cap as a protein migrating at 140 kDa. We detected its expression in human, mouse, and rat cells and in different mouse tissues. Endogenous and transfected p 140 Cap proteins coimmunoprecipitate with p 130 Cas in ECV 304 and in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and associate with p 130 Cas through their carboxy-terminal region. By immunofluorescence analysis, we demonstrated that in ECV 304 cells plated on fibronectin, the endogenous p 140 Cap colocalizes with p 130 Cas in the perinuclear region {{as well as in}} lamellipodia. In addition p 140 Cap codistributes with cortical actin and actin stress fibers but not with focal adhesions. We also show that p 140 Cap is tyrosine phosphorylated within 15 min of cell adhesion to integrin ligands. p 140 Cap tyrosine phosphorylation is also induced in response to EGF through an EGF receptor dependent-mechanism. Interestingly expression of p 140 Cap in NIH 3 T 3 and in ECV 304 cells delays the onset of cell spreading in the early phases of cell adhesion to fibronectin. Therefore, p 140 Cap is a novel protein associated with p 130 Cas and actin cytoskeletal structures. Its tyrosine phosphorylation by integrin-mediated adhesion and EGF stimulation and its involvement in cell spreading on matrix proteins suggest that p 140 Cap plays a role in controlling actin cytoskeleton organization in response to adhesive and growth factor signaling...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the phosphotyrosine binding SH 2 domain, many classes of phospho-recognition domains have been described which mediate many of the diverse cellular functions of protein kinases. Among those, FHA domains are unique in their ability to exclusively recognise pThr epitopes. The genome of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes 5 FHA domains, along with 11 Ser/Thr protein kinases. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, it is shown that Ser/Thr protein kinase PknB phosphorylates a threonine residue in an intrinsically unstructured region of protein FhaA. FhaA contains an FHA domain through which it interacts with and presumably inhibits MviN, a muropeptide flippase essential for cell-wall synthesis. Upon phosphorylation, the FHA domain binds the pThr epitope in an intra-molecular interaction occluding the MviN binding surface and alleviating its inhibition. Although the pThr-FHA interaction is relatively weak and nonspecific, the <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>molecule</b> nonetheless assumes a ‘closed’ conformation 99 % of the time and is therefore able to outcompete the 2 orders of magnitude stronger bimolecular FHA-MviN interaction. In the second part, the phospho-binding capabilities of the human PIH 1 D 1 protein were characterised. PIH 1 D 1 has been shown to interact with a central chaperone assembly comprising the R 2 TP complex and Hsp 90. It has also been shown to interact with co-factor Tel 2 in a phospho-dependent manner essential for the stability of the ‘giant’ PI 3 -kinase-like kinases mTOR and SMG 1. PIH 1 D 1 is shown to function as a novel phospho-reader domain with a consensus binding sequence of D-pS-D-D, agreeing well with the substrate specificity of casein kinase 2. A mutant that abolishes phospho-binding was identified and used in binding experiments which showed that PIH 1 D 1 interacts with the chaperone complex phospho-independently and that its phospho-binding capacity is utilised to recruit a subset of CK 2 substrates to the chaperone complex...|$|E
40|$|Background A {{number of}} {{experiments}} have previously indicated that Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (pRBC) {{were able to}} sense host environment. The basis of this ability to detect external cues is not known but in screening signalling molecules from pRBC using commercial antibodies, a 34 kDa <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>molecule</b> that possesses such ability was identified. Methods The pRBC were exposed to different culture conditions and proteins were extracted for 1 D or 2 D gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot. The localization of 34 kDa protein was examined by biochemical fractionation followed by Western blot. High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis of immune precipitants was used to identify this protein and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used for detecting mRNA expression level. Results The 34 kDa protein was called PfAB 4 has immediate responses (dephosphorylation and rapid turnover) to host environmental stimuli such as serum depletion, osmolality change and cytokine addition. PfAB 4 is expressed constitutively throughout the erythrocytic lifecycle with dominant expression in trophozoites 30 h post-infection. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment induced a transient detectable dephosphorylation of PfAB 4 in the ItG strain (2 min after addition) {{and the level of}} expression and phosphorylation returned to normal within 1 – 2 h. PfAB 4 localized dominantly in pRBC cytoplasm, with a transient shift to the nucleus under TNF stimulation as shown by biochemical fractionation. High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis of immune precipitants of AB 4 antibodies revealed a 34 kDa PfAB 4 component as a mixture of proliferating cellular nuclear antigen- 1 (PCNA 1) and exported protein- 2 (EXP 2), along with a small number of other inconsistently identified peptides. Different parasite strains have different PfAB 4 expression levels, but no significant association between mRNA and PfAB 4 levels was seen, indicating that the differences may be at the post-transcriptional, presumably phosphorylation, level. A triple serine phosphorylated PCNA 1 peptide was identified from the PfAB 4 high expression strain only, providing further evidence that the identity of PfAB 4 is PCNA 1 in P. falciparum. Conclusion A protein element in the human malaria parasite that responds to external cues, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF have been discovered. Treatment results in a transient change in phosphorylation status of the response element, which also migrates from the parasite cytoplasm to the nucleus. The response element has been identified as PfPCNA 1. This sensing response could be regulated by a parasite checkpoint system and be analogous to bacterial two-component signal transduction systems...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF PRESSURE-STIMULATED CANCER CELL SIGNALING by CHRISTINA DOWNEY June 2010 Advisor: Dr. Marc Basson, MD, PhD Major: Cancer Biology Degree: Doctor of Philosophy Increased {{extracellular}} pressure stimulates cancer {{cell adhesion}} by a mechanism that {{is dependent upon}} beta- 1 -integrin activation, an intact cytoskeleton, and FAK and Src activation. By a different mechanism, increased extracellular pressure modulates cancer cell proliferation {{in a manner that}} is regulated by protein kinase C, but not Src or an intact cytoskeleton. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that paxillin is a necessary mediator in the pathway by which pressure stimulates adhesion; however, it had not been determined whether paxillin acts simply as a scaffold, or participates in diverse signaling events. I therefore hypothesized that paxillin phosphorylation mediates pressure stimulated adhesion and further asked whether the independent pathway by which pressure induces proliferation is modulated by NF-kB. Finally, I postulated that increased pressures of the circulation activate cancer cells to increase adhesion, proliferation and overall tumor burden in vivo. My data illustrate that paxillin phosphorylation at tyrosines 31 and 118 is necessary for pressure stimulated adhesion, but tyrosine 81 phosphorylation is not. The phosphorylation events at tyrosine 31 and 118 form a docking site for the adaptor molecule Crk, which has a binding site for the highly <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>molecule</b> Cas. Each member of the paxillin/Crk/Cas complex is necessary for pressure stimulated adhesion. Furthermore, this complex promotes the activation of the small GTPase, Rac 1. Next, I evaluated whether Rac 1 was necessary for pressure induced proliferation, and found that it is not. However, it was found that this pathway is dependent upon NF-kB activation. Increased extracellular pressure increases NF-kB activation in colon, breast and prostate cancer cells. This increase is abolished in the presence of NF-kB inhibitors. Further studies showed that increased pressure activates protein kinase C alpha/beta increases IKK and IkB phosphorylation, cyclin D 1 expression and increased S-phase fractions. Immunohistochemical staining for NF-kB, IkB and cyclin D 1 increased in the high pressure center of human tumors and decreased toward the periphery. Finally, I determined that increased pressures of the circulation activate cancer cells in vivo by phosphorylation of beta- 1 -integrin, FAK and Src. Pre-treatment with pressure prior to systemic injection did not increase metastasis. However, in a local metastasis model, increased tumor burden and decreased long term survival occurred when cells were pre-treated with pressure. These increases were abolished when cells were pre-treated with FAK or Akt inhibitors prior to injection. In summary, my data suggests pressure activation of malignant cells promotes tumor development and impairs tumor free survival. Preoperative inhibition of paxillin, NF-kB, or other interventions aimed at blocking pressure-induced integrin activation may abolish this effect...|$|E

About 1 – 10 % of all crustal phosphorus is estimated to have been in schreibersite during the Hadean, making the long-term reaction of this mineral with organic-laden water plausible for many years.

Autophosphorylation of Thr- 197 occurs in Escherichia coli and in vitro but is an inefficient intermolecular reaction catalyzed primarily by active, previously <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>molecules.</b> In contrast, the Thr- 197 phosphorylation of newly synthesized protein kinase A in intact S 49 mouse lymphoma cells is both efficient and insensitive to activators or inhibitors of intracellular protein kinase A. Using [35 S]methionine-labeled, nonphosphorylated, recombinant catalytic subunit as the substrate in a gel mobility shift assay, we have identified an activity in extracts of protein kinase A-deficient S 49 cells that phosphorylates catalytic subunit on Thr- 197. The protein kinase A kinase activity partially purified by anion-exchange and hydroxylapatite chromatography is an efficient catalyst of protein kinase A phosphorylation {{in terms of both}} a low Km for ATP and a rapid time course. Phosphorylation of wild-type catalytic subunit by the kinase kinase activates the subunit for binding to a pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor of protein kinase A. By both the gel shift assay and a [γ- 32 P]ATP incorporation assay, the enzyme is active on wild-type catalytic subunit and on an inactive mutant with Met substituted for Lys- 72 but inactive on a mutant with Ala substituted for Thr- 197. Combined with the results from mutant subunits, phosphoamino acid analysis suggests that the enzyme is specific for phosphorylation of Thr- 197...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe 48 -kDa protein, a major protein of rod {{photoreceptor}} cells, is soluble in {{the dark}} but associates with the disk membranes when some (5 – 10 %) of their rhodopsin has absorbed light and if this rhodopsin is additionally phosphorylated by ATP and rhodopsin kinase. If rhodopsin has been phosphorylated and regenerated prior to the protein binding experiment, the binding of 48 -kDa protein depends on light but {{no longer on the}} presence of ATP. Another photoreceptor protein, GTP-binding protein, associates with both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated rhodopsin upon illumination. Excess GTP-binding protein thereby displaces 48 -kDa protein from phosphorylated disks; this indicates competition between these two proteins for binding sites on illuminated <b>phosphorylated</b> rhodopsin <b>molecules...</b>|$|R
40|$|The NS protein of {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus {{is the only}} phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein. The amount of NS phosphorylation appears to regulate {{the activity of the}} protein in the transcription of the virus genome. Several methods have been used to separate NS subspecies containing different amounts of phosphate, but the relationships among the subspecies separated by different workers have been unclear. We report that the isoelectric points of NS molecules were abnormally acidic in some commercial ampholytes, but favorable ampholytes resolved multiple phosphorylated NS subspecies with isoelectric points ranging from pH 6. 8 to 7. 2. The most highly <b>phosphorylated</b> NS <b>molecules</b> had more acidic isoelectric points, and they exhibited greater electrophoretic mobilities in two previously employed electrophoretic systems...|$|R
40|$|AimsCardiac {{hypertrophy}} is elicited by endothelin (ET) - 1 as well {{as other}} neurohumoral factors, hemodynamic overload, and oxidative stress; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) were shown to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy partly via the anti-oxidative stress. One of their common intracellular pathways is the phosphorylation cascade of MEK signaling. Pin 1 specifically isomerizes the phosphorylated protein with Ser/Thr-Pro bonds and regulates their activity through conformational changes. There is no report whether the Pin 1 activation contributes to ET- 1 -induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and whether the Pin 1 inactivation contributes to the inhibitory effect of statins. The aim {{of this study was to}} reveal these questions. Main methodsWe assessed neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy using ET- 1 and fluvastatin by the cell surface area, ANP mRNA expression, JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation, and [3 H]-leucine incorporation. Key findingsFluvastatin inhibited ET- 1 -induced increase in the cell surface area, ANP expression, and [3 H]-leucine incorporation; and it suppressed the signaling cascade from JNK to c-Jun. The phosphorylated Pin 1 level, an inactive form, was decreased by ET- 1; however, it reached basal level by fluvastatin. Furthermore, Pin 1 overexpression clearly elicited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which was inhibited by fluvastatin. SignificanceThis is the first report that ET- 1 -induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is mediated through the Pin 1 activation and that the inhibitory effect of fluvastatin on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy would partly be attributed to the suppression of the Pin 1 function. This study firstly suggests that Pin 1 determines the size of hypertrophied cardiomyocyte by regulating the activity of <b>phosphorylated</b> <b>molecules</b> and that statins exert their pleiotropic effects partly via Pin 1 inactivation...|$|R

Neurturin preferentially binds to the GFRα2 co-receptor. Upon assembly of the complex, specific tyrosine residues are <b>phosphorylated</b> within two <b>molecules</b> of RET that are brought together to initiate signal transduction and the MAP kinase signaling pathway.|$|R

The method combines 1 D NMR diffusion filter experiments and small monolayer-protected nanoparticles as high-affinity receptors. Once {{bound to the}} nanoparticles, the diffusion coefficient of the analyte decreases in such way that spectral editing based on diffusion filters can separate its signals from those of other mixture components. Using nanoparticles functionalized with Zn(2 +) -triazacyclonane complexes, detection and identification of <b>phosphorylated</b> organic <b>molecules</b> can be achieved. Diphenyl phosphate can be detected at 25  micromolar concentration with good selectivity. The selectivity toward organic carboxylates is enhanced at pD= 3. 75.
