500|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{introduces}} Career mode Challenges, {{that are}} either tied to specific songs, or allow players to select a song to meet the Challenge requirement in [...] "open gigs". These were created by Neversoft to allow the developers {{to take advantage of}} unique features of many of songs and provide another layer of gameplay, according to Neversoft's Brian Bright. Each Challenge features three possible completion levels—Gold, Platinum, and Diamond, mimicking the music recording sales certification levels—with Diamond being the most difficult to complete. The song-specific challenges include both instrument-specific challenges, such as correctly vocalizing the repeated [...] "Fame" [...] lyric at the end of David Bowie's [...] "Fame" [...] as it moves down in pitch, and more general scoring or performance challenges on either specific instruments or for the whole band. Open gig Challenges are presented by sponsors within the game, and are based on <b>performance</b> <b>aspects</b> such as scoring a certain amount of points using Star Power or using the guitar controller's whammy bar continuously for a length of time. These allow the player to select any song to complete, with some songs potentially being better suited for completing that challenge. The progress towards these Challenges is shown in-game by a record meter that appears when the challenge is active, and fills up similarly to the overall scoring meter as the player successfully completes towards the challenge. Higher completion levels, particularly Diamond, may only be possible by playing the Expert difficulty of a song, but players {{can take advantage of the}} mid-song difficulty adjustment feature to complete these if needed.|$|E

The announcement was made {{on the same day that}} Ford Motor Company unveiled its newest iteration of the Ford GT supercar, along with a broader line of high-performance vehicles. Ford and Microsoft have entered into an exclusive agreement that will make the 2017 Ford GT the cover car for the game, and the GT and other newly revealed cars, such as the newest model of the Ford F-150 Raptor and the Ford Mustang GT350, available in the game. According to Henry Ford III, the executive in charge of the GT's development, the arrangement is part of Ford's view that video games are [...] "a new avenue for us to reach our customers". Similarly, the deal gave Turn 10 Studios direct access to Ford's design teams as the new GT was in development. Staffers with Turn 10 were some of the few people outside of Ford that knew of the GT's existence. According to Turn 10's John Wendl, [...] "this is the first time we've been able to launch a car and a game at the same time". Certain design and <b>performance</b> <b>aspects</b> of the Ford GT were first revealed through the game including the car’s active rear wing which automatically changes its angle in different conditions, such as under braking.|$|E

Recently, manyresearchers have investigated low  cost adsorbents (from agricultural wasteproducts, biomass and various solid substances) as alternative cheap adsorbentsto remove pesticides. However, the presence of waxes and other impuritiesdecrease the active surface area of these adsorbents; hence, theseunprocessed adsorbents have a poor removal of pollutants compared toactivated carbon. Thus, these adsorbents can only show their low cost aspectand cannot guarantee their high <b>performance</b> <b>aspect</b> for removal pesticides.
