40|$|AbstractProject success, {{both the}} {{determination}} and the achievement, {{is a widely}} discussed subject. Literature seems to agree on one thing: whether a project is considered a success depends on the perspective taken to judge it. But how the public project manager determines {{the success of his}} project is not clearly discussed in literature. In 2013 we conducted a research using Q-methodology to reveal which success criteria are important to Dutch public project managers who are in charge of construction projects. In the follow up research, described in this paper, we will extend the research to several European countries. Within the European Union national governments are the largest initiators and clients of large infrastructure projects, which are <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>tender</b> in an international market. In this international context it is essential for private companies, consultancies or contractors, to better understand their public client, in order to come up with internationally competitive bids, successfully collaborate and complete complex projects. The objective of this follow up research is to expose managerial viewpoints on project success in different European countries. The respondents in the research performed early 2014 are governmental project managers, who are responsible for the execution of an internal assignment and who are the representative of the client to the contractor. The position of the respondents in the government organization is similar to the research already carried out in the Netherlands. Based on the research (Hofstede, 2001) into differences in the national culture of countries variations between these countries can be expected. This paper describes the set-up of the study and hypotheses, based on literature, influences of culture on the perception of project success...|$|R

50|$|The Second Authority issues {{licenses}} for commercial television and regional radio stations by <b>putting</b> those services <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>tender</b> and selecting operators from the tender responders. The Authority established {{the first commercial}} television station in Israel, Channel 2, in November 1993 {{after several years of}} test broadcasts. Three franchisees were selected to operate the channel in the initial tender, Keshet, Reshet, and Telad, each of which were reserved certain broadcast days during the week and collected ad revenues for those days. Also, a fourth company was established, the Israeli News Company which is responsible for producing the daily news broadcasts shown on Channel 2. The channel has become successful and has provided a good return on investment to the three operators.|$|R
40|$|Policy makers {{aiming to}} get private landholders to provide non-marketed {{environmental}} services {{need to provide}} efficient economic incentives. Two ideas have been explored to achieve this: linking contract payments to environmental outcomes and <b>putting</b> the contracts <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>tender.</b> This paper investigates whether there are any gains to be had by combining the benefits of both approaches. Landholder risk aversion may offset incentive effects if the fall in participation outweighs any increases in individual effort. Using controlled lab experiments in two countries and across four subject groups, and systematically varying {{the rate at which}} payments are linked to uncertain outcomes, this paper clarifies the conditions under which incentives overcome risk-aversion – a parameter which was also measured. Results show that for risk averse landholders the most efficient approach is in general to tender contracts only moderately linked to environmental outcomes – that is, using a balanced combination of fixed input payments and of payments linked to uncertain outcomes. This paper also highlights how experiments can complement the inherent limitations of a purely theoretical analysis.
