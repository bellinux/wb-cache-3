2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Wilton {{came out as}} a lesbian, which gave her {{a strong sense of}} {{identity}} and politics as well as informing her intellectual work, although she never felt completely accepted by lesbians who had come out earlier in life because of her personal history of heterosexuality. She wrote in 1993, [...] "the <b>positionality</b> of [...] "lesbian" [...] offers a potent site from which to investigate the social, cultural and political interlocution of gender and sexuality". She saw herself as having a distinctly lesbian perspective on the issues she researched in a way that challenged the assumptions of colleagues and gay men, particularly in relation to gendered behaviour. In the lesbian edition of Sexualities (3, May 2000), Wilton noted the marginalisation of lesbian issues within sexuality studies and the journal. This conflictual approach was contra-punctuated by a warms in her personal relationships, which embodied a strong sense of solidarity with co-workers on sexuality, especially with gay men. She was keen to rework the debates on the relationship between gender and sexuality, and sought to integrate them as a focus for interdisciplinary study that included health policy, film theory, sociology of sexuality, as well as feminist and queer theory. Wilton's writing was aimed at both academic and lay audiences. Her published material reflected theoretical work on sexuality aimed at academics, a book designed for practitioner training, an introductory text for policy makers, discussion about the self-fashioning required by women who transition from heterosexuality to lesbianism, books for lay members of the communities involved in her research, and an edited volume on lesbians and film.|$|E

40|$|My thesis {{examines}} how belonging (and not-belonging) is expressed amongst Filipino migrant workers resident in Israel: an ethno-national settler state with no general mechanisms for non-Jewish migrant naturalisation and incorporation. While nationhood and ethnicity have been exaggerated in past social research with migrants, I question proposals to expunge them entirely {{in favour of}} the study of other migrant identities linked primarily to public life. Instead, I aim to document and understand the emergence of varied forms of belonging, national and otherwise, in the analysis of 52 narrative interviews and other everyday events with Filipino participants. I employ the intersectional heuristic of "translocational positionality" (Anthias 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008), in doing so adopting a distinctive methodology to avoid the analytic privileging of anyone category of social analysis. This methodology ensures that migrants who are not organizationally involved are included in the sample, and limits recruitment from any single source. Secondly, categories of relevance to belonging are not pre-determined but are allowed to arise in interviews. I find that politicised nationhood and ethnicity are relatively rare referents for narrative <b>positionalities</b> amongst participants in this study. The Israeli-Philippine migration context generally downplays the revision and reinforcement of political Filipino nationalist or ethnic sentiment. Yet, other <b>positionalities</b> of belonging (and not-belonging) arise for particular people. These express specific kinds of national, class, gendered and religious themes that are complex, co-existent and overlapping. These motifs contextually inflect and are inflected by one another. Such <b>positionalities</b> are regularly linked to factors located in everyday life in Israel to which participants may give particular weight in the context of structural biographies, despite exclusion from and mistreatment in other Israeli social domains. <b>Positionalities</b> are often contradictory both within individual narratives and across them as a whole. The thesis concludes that to address the over-ethnicisation of migrant lives in social research requires moving away from the study of narrow identities and to recognise that no forms of belonging can be privileged or ruled out in advance of analysisEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

For example, Katherine Hagedorn uses this technique in Divine Utterances: The Performance of Afro-Cuban Santeria. Throughout her description of her fieldwork in Cuba, Hagedorn remarks how her <b>positionality,</b> through her whiteness, femaleness, and foreignness, afforded her luxuries out of reach of her Cuban counterparts. Her <b>positionality</b> also put her in an “outsider” perspective on Cuban culture and affected her ability to access the culture as a researcher on Santeria. Her whiteness and foreignness, she writes, allowed her to circumvent intimate inter-gender relations centered around performance using the bata drum. Unlike her Cuban female counterparts who faced stigma, she was able to learn to play the bata and thus formulate her research.|$|E

This juxtaposition between teacher and student presents distinctive challenges that are seldom captured in existing research. One such challenge is the task to facilitate classroom dialogues on issues of race, ethnicity, and culture. While GTIs are charged with the labor of instructing university classrooms full of diverse student populations, {{it is common for}} them to instruct these courses without ever having instructional training on culturally responsive teaching. It is also possible that GTIs are not comfortable discussing issues of race, ethnicity, and culture because they may have not critically examined their own <b>positionalities,</b> or the impact these <b>positionalities</b> can have on their instructional/classroom communication strategies and behaviors. This paper offers an autoethnographic account of the awakening of my own critical consciousness during a semester long community-based learning project at a predominantly African American high school. In reflecting on this experience, I offer suggestions for GTIs on becoming more culturally responsive teachers...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of improved environmental or sustainable aspects in forest management is often {{affiliated with the}} rise of market-driven governance systems, such as forest certification. In terms of forest resource peripheries, like North-Karelia, Finland, these are often attributed to environmental business and consumer demands from the green Central European markets. While acknowledging these aspects related to the supply chains of wood-based products, this study evaluates the actual perceptions about environmental forest governance and its spaces in the resource peripheries themselves. It displays the perceived changes and practices in forestry by comparing private and corporate ownership and their governance networks. This is accomplished by a qualitative, interview based case study of North Karelian and Finnish forestry actors. Transnational forest governance is hereby treated as a relational space, with forest certification systems as possible technologies used to achieve improved, sustainable forest management. Utilizing the North-Karelian forestry sector, the varying <b>positionalities</b> of actors and institutions within such a relational space shape the knowledge networks, perceptions and decision-making. The study evaluates how these local-global <b>positionalities</b> of actors and individuals shapes their understanding, and guide the direction of sustainable forest management in Finland while it (re-) produces opposing regimes of practice. With the discourse on forest certification being twofold, a more complex picture emerges if aspects of even- versus uneven-aged forest management in Finland are integrated. Shaped by the actor’s <b>positionalities</b> and related knowledge networks, perceptions regarding the quality of forest management practices and technologies used to achieve sustainability differ and thereby shape governance processes. The green markets are not perceived as the main driving force and a strong governmental influence, particularly related to private ownership aspects, is noted in the Finnish case. Forest certification systems, and other political technologies for sustainable forest management, are embedded in or strongly restricted by these aspects...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the interrelated {{concepts of}} diasporic postmemory {{and how they}} apply to the oral narratives {{of a small group}} of second generation Chileans and Argentineans living in the UK, whose parents were political exiles and economic migrants linked to the Chilean (1973 - 1990), and Argentinean (1976 - 1983) dictatorships. Diasporic postmemory as a ‘multidirectional’ theory is used to discuss these narratives in a ‘delocalised’ context where it is argued that two central memory fields overlap: the first being the field of the ‘politics of memory’ in the Southern Cone, and the second the ‘diaspora field’. It will be argued that these narratives occupy a mobile and situated diasporic ‘in-between’ space, indicative of ‘translocational positionalities’ that shift between a UK context and abroad. By presenting these postmemory narratives together, we can come to explore how the legacies of the dictatorships in Chile and Argentina continue to have resonances beyond the stable boundaries of the field of the politics of memory in those countries. As such, they hold the possibility to move beyond the direct victims of state terrorism and their kin, encompassing a wider ‘affective community’ of diasporic <b>positionalities</b> and subjectivities tied to wider societal responses to the legacy of state terrorism and trauma. Furthermore, I will also discuss how in this diaspora space, the <b>positionalities</b> of the researcher and interviewees are intertwined, and form part of subjectivities that can become ethical and reflexive subjects of postmemory, in mutually articulating alternative possibilities for more diversified and collective forms of multidirectional memories to emerge...|$|R
