50|$|Until {{the second}} half of the 20th century when it moved {{operations}} to the Northern Hemisphere and transformed itself into a conglomerate the major portion of Dalgety's business was the Australasian wool trade pioneered by John Macarthur in New South Wales. Dalgety depended on the woolgrowers. Soon after F G Dalgety went into business on his own account Australia's sheep numbers had reached around 20 million. Thirty years later there were more than 100 million but by 1903 by prolonged drought flocks had almost halved and numbers did not come back to 100 million until 1926. By that time UK took about 50 per cent of Australia's total wool exports. UK demand rose during the Second World War but as the war ended it was found the UK government held 10.4 million bales. In conjunction with officials from Australia New Zealand and South Africa a joint arrangement was made in 1945 to ensure its orderly sale and the sale was completed in 1951. Later the same year American demand generated by the outbreak of the Korean War <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> prices up to nine times the UK contract price of five years earlier but the following year Australia's returns from wool were halved.Wool prices continued to fall but bottomed in 1971 when there were a record 180 million sheep, the sheep numbers to some extent compensating for low wool prices. Price stabilisation schemes were organised with Australian government support. That support was withdrawn in 1999.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wool used in {{this study}} was {{collected}} from Falahi sheep after shearing and from Falahi hides after unhairing process by both chemical and enzymatic treatments. The underlying study investigates the possibility of increasing the percent of <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> via blending with wool. Unhairing process using enzyme treatment not only considered as environmentally friendly but also gives better <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> compared with chemical one. As much as we increase <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> in the blend, the profit tended to increase while yarn strength and yarn regularity tended to decrease. <b>Pulled</b> <b>wool</b> percentage is reasonable at 25 %, risky at 50 % and not favorable at 75 %. Yarns from <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> is preferable to use in hand made fabric, which needs 100 % wool and low yarn quality compared with mechanical textile. Chemical unhairing treatment significantly decrease the wool content of amino acids, sulfur content as sulfur ion and as sulfur amino acid (Methionine), as well as some physical properties like staple and yarn strength, yarn elongation and yarn regularity expressed by increasing number of fine and thick places as well as number of nodes.

40|$|Abstract Many {{factors such}} as {{production}} methods fibre quality and structural parameters have distinctive influence on the quality and performance of a hand woven carpet. Because the most common fiber used for producing handmade carpet is wool this experiment was aimed to identify virgin and <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> characteristics of Tunisian sheep breeds. A total of 84 sheep and 15 samples of commercial <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> were used in this study. Samples of fiber were analyzed using standard objective measurements for staple length SL mean fiber diameter MFD coefficient of variation of fiber diameter FDCV fine fiber contain FC Breaking strength and Elongation. Results showed that Tunisian wool {{can be considered as}} medium wool. By conducting well-planned sorting Fine Queue of west sheep breed can supply the wool needed for textile industries. The wool of other sheep breeds can be used in handmade carpets. Also staple strength as one of the important wool characteristic affected significantly by alkali treatment during chemical unhairing process compared with wool collected by shearing process. Great attention must be paid to know the real characteristics of <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> before using it in handmade carpet industry...|$|E
