40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{development}} of whey beverages including whey wine {{has been an}} area of whey utilization research. One study to produce a commercially salable wine from sweet whey, particularly cheddar whey, was undertaken. It included developing a process to clarify the naturally cloudy wine, monitoring the physical and chemical changes which occurred during the wine making process, comparing the sensory differences in the unclarified and <b>clarified</b> <b>wine,</b> and incorporating the wine sediment in a food product. The criteria for the clarification process were simplicity, legality, reasonable cost, minimal usage of energy and equipment, and maintenance of the wine character and quality. Existing procedures <b>for</b> <b>clarifying</b> grape <b>wine</b> such as filtration, centrifugation, {{and the addition of}} fining agents, casein, Cold Mix Sparkolloid, gelatin, tannin, and bentonite were investigated. Also investigated were techniques used to separate the proteins from whey; specifically pH adjustment (with potassium carbonate) and precipitation (with sodium hexametaphosphate). It was found that the most feasible clarification procedure was the addition of 0. 20 - 0. 50 percent bentonite on a dry weight basis followed by a polishing filtration. Determinations for lactose, protein, fat, ash, and total solids and tests for Brix, pH, titratable acidity, and alcohol content were performed to monitor the effects of fermentation, aging, and clarification. The changes noted during fermentation and aging were primarily due to alcoholic and lactic acid fermentations. Bentonite fining had a dilution effect but did increase the ash content of the wine. Triangular difference tests with blindfolded tasters indicated that there was no significant taste difference between cloudy wine and bentonite-fined and filtered wine. A cursory gas-liquid chromatographic analysis revealed only a slight difference in the gross volatile components of unclarified and <b>clarified</b> <b>wines.</b> The wine sediment was dried to a paste and substituted at the five and ten percent levels for nonfat dry milk in a commercial sugar cookie recipe. A preference test showed that the sediment decreased the acceptability because of its "acid" taste. It is likely that the sediment could successfully be utilized in a fermented or cultured dairy product...|$|R
40|$|The {{clarification}} of natural juice {{has been studied}} using commercial Pectolytic enzymes produced by Coniothyrium diplodiella and Aspergillus niger. Commercial pectolytic enzymes contains polygalacturonase and pectinesterase. These two enzymes could not cause the {{clarification of}} citrus juice alone, whereas a mixture of them was capable of clarifying the juice almost completely. The clarifying activity of an enzyme preparation depended on the activities of polygalacturonase, pectinesterase and the ratio of these two enzymes. On the juice of Mandarin orange, the clarifying activity of the enzyme preparation was effectiveness in the ranges of PG= 90 Pgu, PE= 60 Peu, and the ratio of PG/PE=O. 6. The increasing of this value of PG/PE improved the clarification. The clarifying activity of the enzyme preparation on the juice of Natsudaidai was very limited {{in the range of}} PG/PE= 1. 6 ～ 3. 1, and was also required above the level in the activities of PG= 280 Pgu and PE= 175 Peu. On this reason, we could be understand that {{it is very difficult to}} developing of more effective pectinase <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> the <b>clarifying</b> of Natsudaidai juice...|$|R
25|$|To <b>clarify</b> <b>wine,</b> it is {{necessary}} to wait for particle deposition {{at the bottom of the}} wine container but this can be accelerated by the use of oenological adhesives. These additives bind to the insoluble particles and fall to the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Sodium {{silicate}} flocculant {{properties are}} also used to <b>clarify</b> <b>wine</b> and beer by precipitating colloidal particles. As a clearing agent, though, sodium silicate (water glass) is sometimes confused with isinglass which is prepared from collagen extracted from the dried swim bladders of sturgeon and other fishes. Eggs preserved in a bucket of waterglass gel, and their shells, are sometimes also used (baked and crushed) to clear wine.|$|R
50|$|Grape {{and wine}} {{proteins}} tend to aggregate and form hazes and sediment in finished wines, especially white wines. Haze-causing proteins can persist in wine due to low settling velocities or charge repulsion on individual particles. Fining agents, such as bentonite clays, {{are used to}} <b>clarify</b> <b>wine</b> by removing these proteins. Also, proteinaceous agents such as albumin, casein, or gelatin are used in wine clarification to remove tannins or other phenols.|$|R
2500|$|While fining <b>clarifies</b> <b>wine</b> by binding to {{suspended}} particles and precipitating out as larger particles, filtration works by passing the wine through a filter medium that captures particles {{larger than the}} medium's holes. Complete filtration may require a series of filtering through progressively finer filters. Many white wines require the removal of all potentially active yeast and/or lactic acid bacteria {{if they are to}} remain reliably stable in bottle, and this is usually now achieved by fine filtration.|$|R
50|$|Chitosan is {{also useful}} in other {{filtration}} situations, where one {{may need to}} remove suspended particles from a liquid. In combination with bentonite, gelatin, silica gel, isinglass, or other fining agents, {{it is used to}} <b>clarify</b> <b>wine,</b> mead, and beer. Added late in the brewing process, chitosan improves flocculation, and removes yeast cells, fruit particles, and other detritus that cause hazy wine. Chitosan combined with colloidal silica is becoming a popular fining agent for white wines, because chitosan does not require acidic tannins (found primarily in red wines) with which to flocculate.|$|R
2500|$|The Age of Enlightenment saw an {{increase}} in the study and application of winemaking methods with University sponsored studies and treatise on wine related topics. In 1756 the Academy of Bordeaux invited students to write papers on the topic of <b>clarifying</b> <b>wines</b> and the advantages or disadvantages of using egg whites as a fining agent. In Burgundy, the Academy of Dijon sponsored study on ways {{to improve the quality of}} Burgundy wine. [...] In the vineyards, vignerons began focusing more on which grape varieties performed best in different areas and augmenting their plantings to capitalize on their findings.|$|R
