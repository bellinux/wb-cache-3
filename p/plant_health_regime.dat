30|$|Although the EU now has {{policies}} that address several region-wide environmental issues (e.g. climate change, pollution by chemicals), {{it has not}} yet created legislation to address the full range of invasive species and their pathways. Instead, there are several regimes and directives that address some invasive species or some pathways of introduction. We give two examples here. First, Council Regulation 708 / 2007 sets procedures and standards for aquaculture within the EU with the goal of reducing the risks that non-native fish, or the diseases they carry, will become established and invasive. Second, the <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Regime</b> addresses the introduction and spread of invasive plants and plant pests, but has been used primarily to address pests of agriculture. Plants that pose risks of environmental harm, although they may arrive through the same pathways, are generally not covered.|$|E
40|$|The British Government has {{announced}} that the entire body of EU law will be adopted into UK Law through the ‘Great Repeal Bill’ {{at the moment of}} withdrawal from the European Union (EU) with ‘unnecessary legislation’ then gradually repealed. However, many commentators have pointed out the enormity and complexity of this task as well as the political, economic and constitutional hurdles to legislative reform. For plant biosecurity, a crucial issue taken into account when shaping the current EU <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> <b>regime</b> through the Directive 2000 / 29 /EC ('Plant Health Directive') was the need to embrace the single market. Furthermore, the UK was influential in safeguarding plant health in the single market through the adoption of this Directive. The impact of Brexit on protection from invasive species damaging habitats and wildlife (EU Regulation 1143 / 2014) should also be considered. With the Brexit White Paper published and with the Article 50 Bill passing through Parliament, the following questions should be asked: •	Will Directives as well as EU Regulations be included in Great Repeal Bill? •	If so, will Directive 2000 / 29 /EC be regarded as 'unnecessary' given UK’s likely departure from the single market and what might replace it? •	Will existing rulings of the ECJ be taken into account in implementation of laws originating from the EU? •	Will risks of introduction of harmful organisms and invasive species increase or lessen if the UK’s borders retract to her national boundaries? •	What will happen with plant passporting? It will also be necessary {{to take into account the}} impact of Brexit on legislation on plant protection products/pesticides because plant health is a component of the EU Farm-to-Fork food safety strategy. Consequently, another question to be addressed is: •	Will the UK continue to implement the farm-to-fork strategy after Brexit strategy or will it be abandoned in favour of a narrower sectoral approach...|$|E

40|$|The United Kingdom has a {{long history}} of <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> {{programs}} and policies. The first legislation granting direct statutory authority (at that point to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) for <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> protection was the Destructive Insects Act of 1877, which had the objective of preventing the introduction and establishment of the Colorado Beetle. Early <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policy was aimed at specific pests considered to be of particular concern due to the potential damage and the apparent threat of entry. Some measures were created for specific pests but then expanded to include other species of concern. The current European-wide programme incorporates a notification and pest management regime for over 472 harmful organisms that have entered into European Union (EU) 1 jurisdiction 2. Most countries have followed a similar course of focusing a <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policy on pests of particular concern, and eventually creating more general authorities and methodologies for protecting national <b>plant</b> <b>health.</b> In the United Kingdom, the <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> Act is the primary legislative vehicle for ensuring the sound delivery of optimal <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policy.

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>health</b> {{is a key}} {{condition}} for a sustainable land use and rural economy. Drawing on a Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) -funded project on the growing risk of plant diseases in the UK, current and future challenges to <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> are discussed. It is well recognized that farmers {{have an important role}} in shaping <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> policies at a time of major structural changes in agricultural industries. However, the role of consumers has also much potential to improve sustainability of plant disease management options. The phytosanitary legislation is catching up with the many recent developments in <b>plant</b> <b>health,</b> but needs to be integrated with policies aimed at achieving animal and human health. Interdisciplinary approaches in research on <b>plant</b> <b>health,</b> as well as an increasing involvement of stakeholders in the management of plant epidemics, are to be welcomed. Plant diseases also influence (and are influenced by) land use and environmental regulations in general. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency and magnitude of new plant disease outbreaks, particularly when combined with globalization of trade, intensification of land use and structural evolution of the agricultural sector. To tackle the many challenges to <b>plant</b> <b>health,</b> it is mandatory to ensure long-term funding for interdisciplinary <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> research and managemen...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> barometer, an instrument to measure the general phytosanitary situation {{on a national level}} (Belgium) and on a yearly basis and to monitor its evolution over time, is described. The elaboration of a set of 13 <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> indicators (PHI’s) {{as the basis for the}} <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> barometer is discussed. These indicators were weighted by experts - including scientists, policy makers and agroindustrial representatives - to determine their relative impact in the barometer. The result of the barometer is expressed as a comparison with the previous year. Based on the results of the 13 PHI’s, it is concluded that the general <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> in Belgium shows a positive evolution from 2007 until 2010 and a negative evolution from 2010 until 2012. The <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> barometer provides a overview of the phytosanitary situation of plants and plant products in Belgium and is a tool to communicate in an intelligible, comprehensible manner on aspects of <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> to consumers and professional stakeholders in the plant production chain. Together with the food safety barometer and the animal <b>health</b> barometer, the <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> barometer is one of the three instruments to provide a overview on the general status of the safety of the food chain in Belgium.

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>health</b> is a {{frequently}} used but ill-defined term. However, {{there is an}} extensive literature on general health definitions and health criteria in human medicine. Taking up ideas from these philosophical debates, concepts of <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> are reviewed and a framework developed to locate these concepts according to their position in several philosophical controversies. In particular, (i) the role of values in defining <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> in a naturalist versus a normativist approach; (ii) negative and positive definitions of plant health; (iii) reductionist versus holistic perspectives; (iv) the focus on functionality versus resilience, i. e. {{the ability of the}} plant to perform under stress with or without human interference; (v) materialist versus vitalist approaches; and (vi) biocentric versus anthropocentric views, are surveyed. The ways in which these perspectives relate to mainstream and alternative approaches to plant protection are explored and we suggest how the contradicting views might be reconciled. It is argued that none of these perspectives is without inherent contradictions, but that by combining contrasting approaches it is possible to provide a comprehensive though fuzzy concept. Rather than giving a new definition of <b>plant</b> <b>health,</b> a conceptual framework is developed that suggests what questions may be answered in debates on <b>plant</b> <b>health</b> issues and how such debates could be organized. ...|$|R
