50|$|Heat can {{be applied}} to the tip of a plastic <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> to seal the {{solution}} and create a liquid-tight storage.|$|E
50|$|Pasteur pipettes, {{also known}} as {{droppers}} or eye droppers, are used to transfer small quantities of liquids. They are usually glass tubes tapered to a narrow point, and fitted with a rubber bulb at the top. The combination of the <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> and rubber bulb has also {{been referred to as}} a teat pipette. Pasteur pipettes come in various lengths and are sold in boxes of hundreds. They are named after the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who was known to have used a variant of them extensively during his research. The purpose of <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> is invented as in laboratory, the sterile condition of samples is the most concerned. In the past, there is no equipment to transfer a chemical solution without exposing to the external environment. The hygiene and purity of chemical compounds is necessary for the expected result of each experiment. The <b>pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> both glass and plastic types are sterilized and plugs with rubber bulb at the open end of the pipette preventing the contamination from the atmosphere. Generally, they are considered cheap enough to be disposable, however, so long as the glass point is not chipped, the <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> may be washed and reused indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|Broken <b>pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> {{should be}} {{disposed}} of in an appropriate glassware container.|$|R
50|$|Plastic <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> {{are often}} used in biology where most media are aqueous and solvent {{resistance}} is not important. (Most organic solvents, such as hexane and acetone cannot be used in plastic <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> as the solvent can dissolve the plastic.) The pipettes are also hard to wash and are usually discarded with other biohazard waste after each use.|$|R
50|$|The first simple {{pipettes}} {{were made}} in glass, such as <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes.</b> Large pipettes continue {{to be made in}} glass; others are made in squeezable plastic for situations where an exact volume is not required.|$|R
50|$|The name {{eye dropper}} also may refer to early models of fountain-pens, which {{have to be}} {{refilled}} {{with some kind of}} <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sample may be {{sonicated}} or agitated to aid dissolution, and solids {{are removed}} via filtering through a plug of celite in a <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette,</b> {{directly into the}} NMR tube.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays, the {{two types}} of glass that are used mainly in the {{laboratory}} and in using the <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> are the Borosilicate Glass and the Soda Lime glass. Borosilicate Glass is a widely used glass for laboratory apparatus, as it can withstand chemical and temperature used in most laboratories. Borosilicate Glass is also more economical since the glass can be fabricated easily comparing to the other types. Soda Lime glass, although not chemically resistance as Borosilicate Glass, are suitable as a material for inexpensive apparatus such as the <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette.</b> It is not as resistance and can be very hard to repair if broken.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pasteur</b> <b>{{pipettes}}</b> are {{plastic or}} glass pipettes used to transfer {{small amounts of}} liquids, but are not graduated or calibrated for any particular volume. The bulb is separate from the <b>pipette</b> body. <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> are also called teat pipettes, droppers, eye droppers and chemical droppers. The proper handling of the pipettes is by holding the rubber bulb between the {{thumb and index finger}} and controlling the glass by holding it between the ring finger and the pinky. The middle finger is not used.|$|R
50|$|With {{a bit of}} skill, <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> {{may also}} be used for {{microscale}} column chromatography. With appropriately fine silica gel, the bulb may be squeezed for microscale flash column chromatography.|$|R
50|$|Transfer pipettes, {{also known}} as Beral pipettes, are similar to <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> but are made from {{a single piece of}} plastic and their bulb can serve as the liquid-holding chamber.|$|R
50|$|A phlebotomist {{collects}} {{the sample}} through venipuncture, drawing the blood into {{a test tube}} containing an anticoagulant (EDTA, sometimes citrate) to stop it from clotting. The sample is then transported to a laboratory. Sometimes the sample is drawn off a finger prick using a <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> for immediate processing by an automated counter.|$|E
50|$|Medical Laboratory {{required}} {{high efficiency}} and precision for drug test and observation of diseases. <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b>  is {{commonly used in}} the medical lab because of its essential accuracy.The designation of the Pasteur pipettes allows for high effective performance in the medical lab. It contains the same size drop for every drop in the experiment.This reduce the concern of remained liquid in the pipette.|$|E
50|$|Rubber bulbs {{are used}} in {{chemistry}} laboratories, by placing them {{on top of a}} glass or plastic tube. It serves as a vacuum source for filling reagents through a pipette or <b>pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> and also help control the flow of liquid from the dropping bottle. By using rubber bulb, the contact of the mouth to the chemicals can be avoided. These rubber rods come in different shapes, sizes and colors.|$|E
50|$|The {{constriction}} {{toward the}} tip of the <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> may be plugged with a bit of tissue paper or cotton wool to filter off solids from small amounts of liquids. The bulb can be attached and squeezed to help viscous solutions filter more rapidly.|$|R
30|$|Kinetic {{studies were}} carried out on the {{transesterification}} reaction using the catalyst with the highest biodiesel yield. The experimental setup was the same as in section  2.4 and 1  mL samples were taken with glass <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> every 20  min from the core of the reactor during 2  h of reaction time. The samples were left to settle down and taken for GC analysis to determine their FAME content.|$|R
50|$|Plastic <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes,</b> also {{referred}} to as transfer pipettes, have their stems and bulbs {{in the form of a}} single piece made of plastic. They commonly come in 1, 2, 3, and 5 ml which comes with a specific drop size of 10, 20, 25, 35, and 50 µl. The volumes are usually marked on the stem, though the markings are rather crude and are not particularly accurate.|$|R
50|$|Pasteur {{pipettes}} {{can also}} be used for microscale distillation. The liquid to be distilled is placed into a small reaction tube along with a boiling chip and heated to reflux one-half to two-thirds of the way up the inside of the tube. After squeezing the bulb to expel air, a <b>pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> is inserted into the tube just below the level of the ring of refluxing liquid (into the vapor). The vapor is then drawn into the relatively cold pipette tip, causing it to condense and accumulate inside of the pipette.|$|E
50|$|Papain {{can be used}} to dissociate {{cells in}} the first step of cell culture preparations. A ten-minute {{treatment}} of small tissue pieces (less than 1 mm cubed) will allow papain to begin cleaving the extracellular matrix molecules holding the cells together. After ten minutes, the tissue should be treated with a protease inhibitor solution to stop the protease action. Left untreated, papain activity will lead to complete lysis of the cells. The tissue must then be triturated (passed quickly up and down through a <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette)</b> to break up the pieces of tissue into a single cell suspension.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fountain}} pen is a nib pen that, unlike its predecessor, the dip pen, contains an internal reservoir of liquid ink. The pen draws ink from the reservoir through a feed to the nib and deposits it on paper via {{a combination of}} gravity and capillary action. Filling the reservoir with ink may be achieved manually, via {{the use of a}} <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> (eyedropper) or syringe, or via an internal filling mechanism which creates suction (for example, through a piston mechanism) to transfer ink directly through the nib into the reservoir. Some pens employ removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges.|$|E

The replacement of <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> with precision samplers for all serum and red cell dispensing has resulted in improvement in the reproducibility and standard-isation of technique. The major advantages are improved sensitivity, shortened incubation time, and simplicity of technical performance. In recent years, a number of workers have reported the advantages of using low ionic strength saline (LISS) suspended red cells forantiglobulin tests(AGT...|$|R
50|$|It is not {{recommended}} to use pasteur pipettes for work involving accuracy since pasteur pipettes are not designed to measure specific volume; however, {{it can be used}} to add drops of reagents. Before using a <b>pasteur</b> <b>pipette,</b> the tip should be carefully examined for cracks. To increase accuracy, the pipette is to be rinsed with the reagent. To use the pipette, squeeze the bulb to expel air out of the pipette and submerge the tip of the pipette to the solution vertically. Gently relax the bulb to draw the solution up and make sure that the solution does not overshoot into the bulb contaminating it. To dispense the reagent, hold the tip against the side of the target container at a 30 to 45 degrees angle.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, the pen's design {{evolved to}} feature tubes of ink that {{were filled with}} a <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> or from a narrow spout on a special bottle of ink. Such pens {{frequently}} came in sets of various sizes, and several pen points which were installed into the holders that also contained a filled fountain, which in turn would be screwed into a handle. The construction and number of parts varied depending on the company, and the parts were not cross-compatible in most cases. Some later designs (like the Staedtler MarsMatic700) had specially designed channels to allow better air flow in between {{the wall of the}} external grip and the point assembly. This made ink flow more reliable. The general drawback of this group of pens is that they have to be frequently and carefully cleaned to remove all ink from the tubing, otherwise it would set and could not be removed.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, the {{accuracy}} of a graduated pipette was {{not as good as}} that of a volumetric pipette (accuracy of 3 significant fig); however, with improved manufacturing methods, the accuracies listed by the manufacturer can equal volumetric pipettes. Graduated pipettes are considered to be more precise than <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette.</b> They have +/- tolerances that range from 0.6% to 0.4% of the nominal volume when measured at [...] It works by creating a partial vacuum above the liquid-holding chamber and releasing the partial vacuum created to draw up or deliver liquid. Graduated pipettes are manufactured according to ISO specifications for accuracy and the arrangement of the graduations. Grade A and AS pipettes have the highest accuracy and S stands for swift delivery. It has identical error limits as the DIN EN ISO standards. Grade B pipettes generally have twice the error as compared to grade A and AS pipettes.They commonly come in 5, 10, 25 and 50 mL volumes. A variety of propipetters have been developed, both entirely manual and electrically assisted. Originally pipettes were made of soda-lime glass but, currently many are made of borosilicate glass; disposable graduated pipettes are often made of polystyrene.|$|E
50|$|Pacific oyster {{broodstock}} in hatcheries {{are kept}} in optimum conditions so the production of large amounts of high quality eggs and sperm can be achieved. Pacific oyster females are very fecund, and individuals of 70-100g live weight can produce 50-80 million eggs in a single spawn. Broodstock adults are held in tanks at 20-22 °C, supplied with cultured algae and with salinities of 25-32 ppt. These individuals can be induced to spawn by thermal shock treatment. Yet, it is more common for the eggs from {{a small sample of}} females (about six) to be stripped from the gonads using <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> and fertilized by sperm from a similar number of males.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to isolate gram-negative {{bacteria}} infected metacarpal of Panthera tigris sumatrae trapped in Subulussalam, Aceh Province. Swab sample {{was obtained from}} metacarpal injury of P. tigris sumatrae. Swab sample was cultured to nutrient broth media using sterile cotton swabs or <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes,</b> and incubated at 37 °C temperature for 24 hours. Culture was spared on MacConkey media and incubated again at 37 °C temperature for 24 hours. Determination of bacteria colony growth {{on the surface of}} MacConkey media based on shape, colour, surface, size, and viscosity (consistency).

30|$|Neurons were {{isolated}} from the DRG of adult rats according to aforementioned description (Chen et al., 2005). Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with ether and decapitated. Ganglia were dissected from the L 3 –L 5 lumbar region. The trimmed ganglia were digested with collagenase type IV (2.67 mg/mL, Sigma, USA) and trypsin type I (1 mg/mL, Sigma, USA) at 37 °C for about 30 min. Single cells were dissociated mechanically {{with a series of}} fire-polished <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes,</b> plated on glass slides which covered with Poly-D-Lysine (PDL), then placed into dishes. The cells were cultured for 2 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM F 12; Gibco, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Invitrogen). Culture dishes were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2.|$|R

Moreover, shake and ultrasonic extractions were found to give lower extract yields, amounting respectively to 1. 8 and 1. 9 mg/g dry weight, than pipette Pasteur extraction (3 mg/g). This method may be applied to extract the soluble organic matter of any kind of solid sample such as sedimentary rocks, coals, aerosols, food, and biological substances, prior molecular analyses such as gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry...|$|E
30|$|Precipitates were {{analysed}} as powders. The historic inks {{were applied}} on filter paper, to be analysed by Raman spectroscopy and colorimetry, and glass slides, to be analysed by infrared spectroscopy, {{with the aid}} of a <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipette</b> (ca. 50  μL per 1  cm 2). The historic inks were prepared and measured five times each to assess reproducibility.|$|E
30|$|The {{nanowires}} were dispersed in ethanol {{and laid}} on the Si wafer. After sterilization by ethanol and UV light, {{the surface of the}} nanowires was chemically modified by a poly-l-lysine (PLL) coating for cell adhesion. Hippocampal neurons were then cultured on the nanowires. Briefly, the hippocampal neurons were isolated from 16 - to 18 -day-old fetal Sprague–Dawley rats and incubated with 0.25 % trypsin Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then mechanically dissociated with fire-polished <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> by trituration and plated on prepared substrata in a 24 -well-plate culture dish. Cells were maintained in Neurobasal/B 27 medium containing 0.5 mMl-glutamine, 25 μM glutamate, 25 μM 2 -mercaptoethanol, 100 units ml− 1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml− 1 streptomycin. 50, 000 cells were incubated with a substrate deposited in a well of the 24 -well plate at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 incubator.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for measuring RNA associated with chloroplast thylakoid membranes. Washed thylakoids are incubated with ribonucleases A and T 1, under low Mg 2 + conditions, to release hydrolyzed RNA into solution. After removing the membranes by centrifugation, the mono- and oligonucleotides are adsorbed by Dowex 1 -X 2 in miniature columns made from <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes,</b> and then eluted with 2 n HCl. RNA is estimated from the absorbance of the eluate at 260 nanometers, with corresponding values {{obtained by the}} orcinol reaction for pentose. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of extracted RNA indicate that our current procedures for preparation of thylakoids results in material containing variable and often significant levels of RNA from 80 S ribosomes. Thus values for total RNA cannot {{be used as a}} valid estimate for the level of 70 S ribosomes associated with these membranes, unless an additional procedure is used to estimate the per cent contamination by 80 S ribosomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{inability}} to define accurately the cytological characteristics associated with fertile mammalian ova is due, {{at least in}} part, to difficulty in obtaining and preparing adequate numbers of these cells for critical morphological studies. This communication describes a method which has proved useful in preparing single bovine ova for study using both light and electron microscopy. Bovine ova were recovered by follicular aspiration immediately following slaughter. Aspiration was accomplished with a 20 -gauge hypodermic needle and a 2 -ml syringe (PL 1, Fig. 1). The follicular fluid {{was placed in a}} watch-glass(PL 1, Fig. 2) and scanned, using a stereomicroscope in order to locate the ovum. Following location, the ovum was transferred with a micro-pipette from the follicular fluid to a fixation ampoule suspended in an ice water bath (PL 1, Fig. 3). The fixation ampoules were prepared from 6 - to 9 - in. disposable <b>Pasteur</b> <b>pipettes</b> which had been scored and broken in order to shorten the narrow portion. The narrow tip of the pipette was sealed by flaming. This design (PL 1, Fig. 4) restricted the ovum to a small volume of fixative after it settled into the narrow tip of the fixation ampoule.
