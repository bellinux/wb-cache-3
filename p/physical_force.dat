Although Johner unsuccessfully attempts to dominate her sexually, Wren dominates her with <b>physical</b> <b>force</b> and a dehumanizing attitude. In a 2013 Total Film interview, writer Joss Whedon expressed discontent with the casting of J. E. Freeman; the character was intended to have a mysterious element in his unscrupulous activities, which was overshadowed by typecasting.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA's {{objective}} is a united Ireland by forcing {{the end of}} British sovereignty over Northern Ireland {{through the use of}} <b>physical</b> <b>force.</b> The organisation rejects the Mitchell Principles and the Good Friday Agreement, comparing the latter to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty which resulted in the partition of Ireland. The organisation aims to uphold an uncompromising form of Irish republicanism and opposes any political settlement that falls short of Irish unity and independence.|$|E
5|$|Maltese courts became British {{subject on}} 5 October 1813, {{months before the}} Treaty of Paris of 1814, when Malta became a Crown colony. At this point the British, under Governor Thomas Maitland, adopted a {{codification}} of a mixed system of Civil Law, which included Roman Law, Code Napoléon and continental law. Crown Advocate Adrian Dingli was trusted {{with the task of}} reforms. These reforms remain the basic of Maltes law today. By 1814 all forms of torture were abolished, however any freedom possibly leading to a revolt could be suppressed with <b>physical</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{extension}} to battery {{was given in}} Wilkinson v Downton, where emotional distress was considered a possible battery despite no <b>physical</b> <b>force</b> being used. The defendant told the claimant (as a practical joke) {{that her husband had}} been seriously injured. As a result, the claimant suffered a nervous disorder and was thought to be suicidal for a time. It was held that such an action will be valid under battery where it is calculated to cause physical damage and does so. The principle was extended by Khorasandjian v Bush, in 1993, where there was a risk that the defendant's actions would cause physical or psychiatric damage. The tort set down in Wilkinson is normally considered a separate tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.|$|E

Areas of the ocean with common <b>physical</b> <b>forcing</b> (ecological provinces) may be expected to have phytoplankton communities that respond in a similar fashion to changes in local forcing, and with ecophysiological rate parameters that are predictable from local environmental conditions. In modelling the marine ecosystem, relevant parameters may be assigned according to a partition into ecological provinces. To the extent that <b>physical</b> <b>forcing</b> of the ocean is not constant within or between years, the boundaries of the provinces should be considered as dynamic. The dynamics and the associated changes in taxa can be revealed by remote sensing...|$|R
25|$|Swedish author Henning Mankell {{reported}} that the capture of the Free Mediterranean took place about {{an hour after the}} raid on the Mavi Marmara. Israeli soldiers boarded the ship from three speedboats, and managed to bypass barbed wire that had been placed around the ship. The passengers formed a human ring on the bridge to block the soldiers, and Israeli troops responded by using <b>physical</b> <b>force,</b> electric shocks, plastic and rubber bullets, paintballs, and tear gas. A reporter for the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that Israeli soldiers approached passengers with guns drawn and tasered a 65-year-old person from a distance of ten centimeters. All of the passengers were handcuffed and subjected to body searches and had their passports confiscated. Those who refused to cooperate were reportedly met with <b>physical</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

50|$|It {{is pointed}} out by W.T.

40|$|How {{a unique}} {{three-dimensional}} structure is rapidly formed from the linear sequence of a polypeptide {{is one of}} the important questions in contemporary science. Apart from biological context of in vivo protein folding (which has been studied only for a few proteins), the roles of the fundamental <b>physical</b> <b>forces</b> in the in vitro folding remain largely unstudied. Despite a degree of success in using descriptions based on statistical and/or thermodynamic approaches, few of the current models explicitly include more basic <b>physical</b> <b>forces</b> (such as electrostatics and Van Der Waals forces). Moreover, the present-day models rarely take into account that the protein folding is, essentially, a rapid process that produces a highly specific architecture. This review considers several physical models that may provide more direct links between sequence and tertiary structure in terms of the <b>physical</b> <b>forces.</b> In particular, elaboration of such simple models is likely to produce extremely effective computational techniques with value for modern genomics...|$|R

25|$|Hence, {{with respect}} to an {{inertial}} frame, an object or body accelerates only when a <b>physical</b> <b>force</b> is applied, and (following Newton's first law of motion), {{in the absence of}} a net force, a body at rest will remain at rest and a body in motion will continue to move uniformlythat is, in a straight line and at constant speed.
