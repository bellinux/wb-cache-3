In this issue, Girardi and colleagues (2014) extend their previous work and demonstrate that this mutagenic metabolism of LCs is indeed mediated by preferential {{expression of the}} cytochrome P 450 enzyme CYP 1 B 1, but that LCs cells exert their pro-carcinogenic effects also independently of CYP 1 B 1...|$|R
25|$|Experts {{predicted}} {{marine life}} could suffer pollution from the Prestige {{for at least}} ten years due {{to the type of}} oil spilt, which contain light fractions called <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> These toxic chemicals could poison plankton, fish eggs and crustaceans, leading to carcinogenic effects in fish and of course to humans as well.|$|E
25|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs, also <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> or polynuclear {{aromatic hydrocarbons}}) are hydrocarbons—organic compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen—that {{are composed of}} multiple aromatic rings (organic rings in which the electrons are delocalized). Formally, the class is further defined as lacking further branching substituents on these ring structures. The simplest such chemicals are naphthalene, having two aromatic rings, and the three-ring compounds anthracene and phenanthrene.|$|E
25|$|The {{classes of}} CYPs most often {{investigated}} in non-human animals are those either involved in development (e.g., retinoic acid or hormone metabolism) or {{involved in the}} metabolism of toxic compounds (such as heterocyclic amines or <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons).</b> Often {{there are differences in}} gene regulation or enzyme function of CYPs in related animals that explain observed differences in susceptibility to toxic compounds (ex. canines inability to metabolize xanthines such as caffeine). Some drugs undergo metabolism in both species via different enzymes, resulting in different metabolites, while other drugs are metabolized in one species but excreted unchanged in another species. For this reason, one species's reaction to a substance is not a reliable indication of the substance's effects in humans.|$|E

2500|$|Organic {{chemical}} pollution contained in sediments of the Clyde estuary {{have been evaluated}} by British Geological Survey. Surface sediments from the Glasgow reaches of the Clyde, Cunningar to Milton, contained <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAH) from 630µg/kg to 23,711µg/kg and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) {{in the range of}} 5 to 130.5µg/kg which classifies these sediments as non-toxic. However, a later study showed PCB concentrations as high as 5,797µg/kg which is above published threshold levels for the chlorinated compounds. Comparison of individual PAH compounds with different thermal stabilities shows that the source of PAH pollution in the Clyde changes downriver. PAH in the inner Clyde (Cunningar to Milton) are from combustion sources (vehicle exhaust, coal burning) whereas PAH in the outer Clyde are from petroleum spills ...|$|E
2500|$|Oil spill model {{systems are}} used by {{industry}} and government to assist in planning and emergency decision making. Of critical importance for the skill of the oil spill model prediction is the adequate description {{of the wind and}} current fields. There is a worldwide oil spill modelling (WOSM) program. [...] Tracking the scope of an oil spill may also involve verifying that hydrocarbons collected during an ongoing spill are derived from the active spill or some other source. [...] This can involve sophisticated analytical chemistry focused on finger printing an oil source based on the complex mixture of substances present. [...] Largely, these will be various hydrocarbons, among the most useful being <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> [...] In addition, both oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic hydrocarbons, such as parent and alkyl homologues of carbazole, quinoline, and pyridine, are present in many crude oils. [...] As a result, these compounds have great potential to supplement the existing suite of hydrocarbons targets to fine-tune source tracking of petroleum spills.

Crystal structures of this fragment with benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene, triphenylene and coronene are described, alongside their solution NMR spectroscopic data. The ligands map out a systematic increase in size of the aromatic subunit, and represent an approach to the limiting case of coordination to a graphene surface.

40|$|A multivariate {{approach}} {{was used to}} evaluate the significance of synthetic oil-induced perturbations in the functional activity of sediment microbial communities. Total viable cell densities, ATP-biomass, alkaline phosphatase and dehydrogenase activity, and mineralization rates of glucose, protein, oleic acid, starch, naphthalene, and phenanthrene were monitored on a periodic basis in microcosms and experimental ponds for 11 months, both before and after exposure to synthetic oil. All variables contributed to significant discrimination between sediment microbial responses in control communities and communities exposed to a gradient of synthetic oil contamination. At high synthetic oil concentrations (4, 000 ml/ 12 m 3), a transient reduction in sediment ATP concentrations and increased rates of oleic acid mineralization were demonstrated within 1 week of exposure. These transient effects were followed within 1 month by a significant increase in rates of naphthalene and phenanthrene mineralization. After initial construction, both control and synthetic oil-exposed microbial communities demonstrated wide variability in community activity. All experimental microbial communities approached equilibrium and demonstrated good replication. However, synthetic oil perturbation was demonstrated by wide transient variability in community activity. This variability was primarily the result of the stimulation of <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> mineralization rates. In general, microcosms and pond communities demonstrated sufficient resiliency to recover from the effects of synthetic oil exposure within 3 months, although <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> mineralization rates remained significantly elevated...|$|R
40|$|A {{model system}} {{comprising}} microbial degradation of naphthalene {{in the presence}} of cadmium has been developed to evaluate metal toxicity associated with <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> biodegradation and its reduction by the use of unmodified and surfactant-modified clays in comparison with a commercially available chelating resin (Chelex 100; Bio-Rad). The toxicity of cadmium associated with naphthalene biodegradation was shown to be reduced significantly by using the modified-clay complex and Chelex resin, while unmodified clay has no significant impact on this reduction. The degree of metal toxicity reduction can be quantitatively related to the metal adsorption characteristics of these adsorbents, such as adsorption capacity and selectivity...|$|R

50|$|Decomposition of <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs). Triethylamine (TEA) was {{utilized}} to solvate and extract the <b>polyaromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs) found in crude oil. By solvating these PAHs, TEA can attract the PAHs to itself. Once removed, TiO2 slurries and UV light can photocatalytically degrade the PAHs. The figure shows the high {{success rate of}} this experiment. With high yielding of recoveries of 93-99% of these contaminants, this process has become an innovative idea that can be finalized for actual environmental usage. This procedure demonstrates the ability to develop photocatalysts that would be performed at ambient pressure, ambient temperature, and at a cheaper cost.|$|E

Normal scanning provided structural information for a 1. 3 ng injection of a model adduct, while 1. 3 ng of each of a mixture of adducts was sufficient to determine their molecular weights by monitoring the constant neutral loss of deoxyribose.

These studies suggest that the strength of the binding of the metal to the hydrocarbon surface is controlled by the electronic demands of both the metal (16 -electron configuration) and ligand (maximum retention of aromaticity). In cases where these two factors can be satisfied simultaneously an energetically isolated equilibrium structure emerges and haptotropic shifts are blocked.
