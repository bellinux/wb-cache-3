40|$|The title {{compound}} {{was prepared}} crystallizing together the co-formers namely, 2, 4 -diamino- 6 -phenyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (DAPT) and <b>phenylthioacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (PTAA) in methanol. The compound crystallized in the orthorhombic space group Pca 21 with a = 12. 384 (2) Å, b = 18. 698 (3) Å, c = 7. 0428 (11) Å, V = 1630. 8 (5) Å 3, and Z = 4. The compound existed as a 1 : 1 cocrystal. The dihedral angle {{between the two}} formers is 50. 89 (9) °. The primary and secondary interactions between DAPT and PTAA form two different discrete chains C(3) that link the DAPT ribbons in adjacent layer. Mass spectra indicate the transfer of a carboxylic acid proton to form PTAA to the nitrogen of DAPT...|$|E
