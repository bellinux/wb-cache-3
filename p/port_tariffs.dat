40|$|Based on {{quantitative}} and qualitative data, this paper attempts to identify the main reasons why cargo dwell time in Durban port has dramatically reduced {{in the past decade}} to a current average of 3 - 4 days. A major customs reform; changes in <b>port</b> storage <b>tariffs</b> coupled with strict enforcement; massive investments in infrastructure and equipment; and changing customer behavior through contractualization between the port operator and shipping lines or between customs, importers, and brokers have all played a major role. The main lesson for Sub-Saharan Africa that can be drawn from Durban is that cargo dwell time is mainly a function of the characteristics of the private sector, but it is the onus of public sector players, such as customs and the port authority, to put pressure on the private sector to make more efficient use of the port and reduce cargo dwell time.

If ready cash not in hand, then next option is {{to go for a}} long term or short term loan if no private investors or shares were issued to find equity. Last one and half decades Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has borrowed nearly 550 Million US$ to develop the Port of Colombo mainly by container terminals, roads etc. The money has been borrowed from Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) through Sri Lanka Government. The first loan was in 1980 and the amount of loan is continuously increasing since. And the repayment too is proportionality but dramatically uphill. This study is mainly focused to ascertain the impact of these loans repayment components to Port financial structure, with a view of forecasting the future profitability. In case of Sri Lanka Ports and Harbor field is very narrow and it is much specified comparatively to the others such as roads, electricity, irrigation etc. Hence, a broad introduction of <b>Port</b> Revenues, <b>Port</b> <b>tariff</b> etc were discussed prior to reach to analysis part of this report. Owing to the fact that SLPA as a body composed of not only Colombo but Galle and Trincomalee as well, profit and losses at all these Ports has to be equitably shared. As only Port of Colombo is running at a profit, the other two Ports are more or less parasites sucking off Port of Colombo. Hence, according to a necessity SLPA as a whole or Port of Colombo and other two ports data also analyzed. Among the three ports mentioned above, main revenue earning component of the Port of. Colombo is cargo handling which container traffic is the major one. But, present capacity of the Port of Colombo will be saturated in the year 2001. If no further development take place before the year 2001, then the stagnating revenue, and increasing fixed cost and variable cost will divert the financial situation to a crisis. New development projects to the Port of Colombo or new developments to Galle and or Trincomalle are the most important factors to be considered at this stage, to over come the said financial crisis in future...|$|R

With this method, efficient unit profits can be obtained for the services offered and their margins of sensitivity can be found. This allows port authorities to determine what actions should be taken with regard to tariffs and/or variable costs in order to optimise their economic results. At the same time, shadow prices of port resources and their limits of sensitivity can be obtained, thus providing port authorities with orientation regarding which resources should be augmented and by how much. In the early 90 's, this methodology was applied to all Spanish commercial ports and results were obtained for sixteen of them.

25|$|From 1895, {{following}} the Hamidian massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire; Cretan Christians, then under Ottoman domination, demanded self-government on their island {{under the protection}} of the great powers. Massacres of Christians by Muslims led Greece to intervene, first by accepting the departure of volunteers from its shores, then by more and more directly sending part of its fleet, followed by troops at the beginning of 1897 just when Cretans themselves declared enosis (union with Greece). The intervention of the European powers (France, Great Britain, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary and Germany) forced Greece to back down. The opposition criticised the feebleness and indecisiveness of the government, which declared war on the Ottomans at the beginning of April.

40|$|M. B. A. Competitiveness is defamed as {{ensuring}} that the port and transportation system can {{meet the requirements of}} its users. For the port to compete successfully for business in both domestic and international markets, it must have the ability to move people and cargo efficiently, reliably, and at a reasonable cost, without infrastructure impediments or congestion delays. Competitiveness is the key aspect that influences the meaningful participation and survival of the South African port system within the global environment. For exporters and importers, competitiveness translate into a demand for intermodal services that provide speedy and efficient movement of cargo through ports and terminal transfer facilities to land side transportation. It also translates into a demand for ready access to the transportation information that is needed by all players within the maritime environment. There is a strong belief and a sense of urgency among some port stakeholders in South Africa, who maintain that there is not enough spending on construction, operations and maintenance for ports. The following capacity issues will influence the future competitiveness of the port system and infrastructure: • Technological advancements in terms of processes and systems; • Hinterland connections; • Infrastructure usage in and around the ports; • Increasing dredging requirements. Thus, {{there is a need to}} improve the productivity, throughput capacity and accessibility to meet the expected growth in international trade.

40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on the pricing of seaport infrastructure which includes port charges {{on the use of}} access channels and berth facilities. A closer examination of published <b>port</b> <b>tariffs</b> reveals that the port entry and berth use-related <b>port</b> <b>tariffs,</b> often referred to as channel dues and berth occupancy charges, are differentiated based on vessel volume (Gross Tonnage, Gross Registered Tonnage and Length Over All), ship type (container ship, general cargo ship, tanker) and traffic type (foreign-going vessels and coastal vessels). These two charges are one of the main revenue sources for a port authority; however knowledge of the design and imposition of these charges is currently opaque, but nevertheless very useful to port users. This thesis explores the determinants of port infrastructure charges that underpin port pricing policies in world ports. The main objectives of the study are: (a) Identify and conduct an econometric analysis of the effect of various factors on seaport infrastructure charges. (b) To assess the applicability of competing pricing models (pricing approaches) currently used by seaports in different countries and regions in the world. (c) To assess the determinants of port infrastructure tariff design and practices in world seaports and discuss their implications for port management. This thesis brings to notice that, despite the discussion on port pricing theories such as cost-based, market based and cost-benefit theories, the empirical research on this topic remains very limited. Thus, with identified research gaps such as the determination of the level of knowledge that port authorities have in tariff design and their applicability, the thesis investigates the underlying factors influential to the design and practice of port infrastructure tariffs using both quantitative and qualitative research approaches. First, the determinants of port infrastructure charges are studied empirically using data from 159 ports worldwide by employing the ordinary least square and simultaneous equation system method with channel dues and berth occupancy charges as the dependent variables. The result indicates that the pricing of seaport infrastructure is primarily cost-based but other factors are also relevant to the port pricing models currently used by seaports. Among those factors in particular, demand and the type of port management and governance model have been found to significantly impact the level of port infrastructure charges. Second, to complement and triangulate some of the results found in the quantitative model, this thesis examines the primary data collected through an online survey of 67 international seaports to focus on the practical processes and strategic issues in infrastructure tariff design and practice. The questionnaire was sent to higher level seaport managers working in the areas of <b>port</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The contact details of port managers were obtained from the official port websites of respective port organisations. SPSS and AMOS statistical software were employed to analyse the data. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to identify the factors influential to the selection of infrastructure tariff models, the tariff level and the tariff revision process. The results showed that the influential factors in infrastructure tariff design are: a) demand, b) knowledge of pricing theories, c) pricing objectives, d) port cost considerations, and e) dynamics of port and shipping sectors (competition and ship size). Further, an analysis into the factors influential in infrastructure tariff practices of seaports suggested that tariff policies, transparency in tariff setting, tariff regulation and stakeholder participation in tariff affairs are highly significant. Third, the content analysis of two open-ended questions included in the questionnaire to seaport authorities revealed that tariff revision practices vary substantially across ports and regions in the world. Some ports revise tariffs regularly while others seldom do so. Furthermore tariff revision procedures and the parties involved in the process also vary across ports; some ports have highly bureaucratic procedures for tariff revision and others determine their tariff revision decisions independently. Many seaport authorities are not aware of all the basic pricing approaches and their applications, and expressed a wish to receive training and support in tariff design and revision. Based on the results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis, the implications for port management and governments are discussed and, given the exploratory nature of the study, the implications for future research and its limitations are also presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{lengthening}} of {{a specialized}} reefer ship {{has been investigated}} {{in order to determine}} if it is economically viable or not. The ship type considered is the Crown class specialized reefer ships, where the Crown Topaz and the Crown Ruby are used as reference ships for this study. In order to determine whether a lengthening is economically viable or not, a conceptual design of the lengthened ship has been done. Costs related to the conversion and income due to the increased cargo capacity are calculated and compared in order to determine when the investment for the conversion reaches break-even. The ship is lengthened by an open-top section of 28 m, a lengthening from 152 m to 180 m. This results in an increased displacement of the ship which results in a greater cargo capacity. The extension allows for 108 extra FEU high cube refrigerated containers with a gross weight of 30 tonnes. The open-top section and necessary reinforcements are dimensioned according to the requirements of the Classification Society NKK in order to calculate the added weight and costs for the conversion. The result shows an increase in resistance of about 15 % for a cruising speed of 19 knots and loaded to 80 % of DWT, which is the most common load case for the reference ship. The fuel consumption thereby increases by 15 % for a cruising speed of 19 knots. The extra cargo capacity of 108 containers corresponds to an increase in container capacity of 154 % and about 31 % of the total paying cargo capacity, while the increase in fuel consumption for the main machinery is about 15 % for a cruising speed of 19 knots and the extra auxiliary engine contributes to an increase of 40 % in fuel consumption for the auxiliary engines. Costs for the conversion and loss due to off-hire time are summarized to 5. 025 M. USD. The extra income for the containers is calculated to 7715 USD per day with a freight rate of 2500 USD per container. With the fuel oil price of today of 595 USD/tonne and the increased <b>port</b> <b>tariffs</b> due to the conversion, the investment will reach break-even in 4 years. Even if the fuel oil price increases about 8. 7 % to 647 USD/tonne the investment will reach break-even after 4 ½ years in operation. If the ships operates within a trade similar to the Coman-trade and with an income of 3000 USD per container the investment will reach break-even after about 2 ½ years with a fuel oil price of 595 USD/tonne and 3 years with a fuel oil price of 647 USD/tonne. Since the Crown class fleet has an average age of 16 years today, the conversion has to be implemented early to make the investment profitable before the ships are ready to be scrapped...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a study on}} {{an extension of the}} port of Klaipeda, Lithuania. The Klaipeda State Seaport Authority (KSSA) {{is in charge of the}} management and the provision of efficient hinterland connections. It considers increasing the depth to - 18 m CD at the quays necessary for attracting more cargo. This maximum depth is governed by the largest vessels that can enter the Baltic Sea. The port, therefore, wants to know the surplus value of this extra depth. The following questions are raised in this study: 1. what cargoes are likely to be captured with an extra depth of - 18 m CD? 2. where can the extra deepening be realised? 3. is a depth of - 18 m CD needed? A study on the present traded cargo and future expectations of cargo pointed out that the most important growth markets will be container trade and coal trade. The coal will be used for the supply of energy. The present energy supply of Lithuania is produced by a nuclear power plant close to Ignalina. This is a plant of the Tjernobyl type. The safety at this power plant is not optimal and the lifetime of the plant ends by 2005 - 2010. Therefore a new power plant which is coal fired is assumed in this study. The possibilities of using the existing port for the deepening are investigated and it is concluded that the deepening of the complete existing port seems rather expensive because of the present quay structures and the total volume of dredging works. The existing quay structures must be improved in case the port is deepened because its fundaments do not reach deep enough and stability cannot be guaranteed. Further, the space in the port is limited for constructing the associated terminals and the presence of the city obstructs efficient through transport to the hinterland. Another problem for the expansion of the existing port for larger depth is the width of the present entrance channel. The present entrance channel is narrow and widening is difficult because of the presence of the breakwaters. The largest vessels which can enter the Baltic Sea cannot enter the port of Klaipeda, unless the breakwater layout is adjusted, which is rather expensive. In order to calculate whether the depth of 18 meter is justified, four transportation schemes are discussed. Four alternatives are used for transporting the total volume of coal using different depth in the entrance channel and port. For the four alternatives the total cost of transporting the coal from the sending port to the power plant is calculated. These costs consist of cost of chartering the vessels which are needed for transporting the 15 million tons of coal, construction of the port which will determine the <b>port</b> <b>tariffs</b> and the through transport costs from the port to the power plant. These costs are described in table i by Sea for the sea transport, by Port for the port tariff and Land for the overland transport cost. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|With {{containerized}} shipping, {{maritime transport}} has changed profoundly. Among other things, it {{has shifted from}} labor-intensive to more capital-intensive activities, including larger specialized ships that require substantial investments in port infrastructure and equipment. Integrated transport chains have reduced transport costs so much that a shipper may find a distant port cheaper than a closer one. Modern ports must be competitive on times and prices for their services. Seaports must be integrated within logistical chains to serve their many functions. An efficient seaport requires infrastructure, superstructure, equipment, adequate connections to other modes of transport, a well-motivated management, and qualified employees. The public sector {{has been an important}} port organizer in the past, but private participation in port operations and infrastructure could make ports significantly more competitive. The authors provide an overview of changes in maritime activity, discuss concession contracts (a key instrument of privatization), and analyze how regulatory mechanisms affect such factors as seaport <b>tariffs,</b> <b>port</b> congestion, port safety, the quality of cargo handling, and relevant indicators of performance, finances, and factor productivity. They describe how an optimal seaport system should allocate tasks between the various institutions involved, including the port authority. The degree of a seaport's decentralization, they conclude, depends on a country size, the number of ports it has, and its legal tradition.

This paper presents a fully operational interstate CGE model implemented for the Brazilian economy that examines how the distribution of the economic activity may change as the country opens up to foreign trade. Among the distinctive features embedded in the model, modeling of scale economies, port efficiency and land-maritime transport costs provides an innovative way of dealing explicitly with theoretical issues related to integrated regional systems. In order to illustrate the role played by the quality of infrastructure and geography on the country’s foreign and interregional trade performance, a set of simulations are presented where import barriers are significantly reduced. The relative importance of import <b>tariffs,</b> <b>port</b> efficiency and maritime transport costs for the country trade relations and regional growth is then detailed and quantified. A final set of simulations shed some light on the spatial effects of scale economies, where the manufacturing sector in the state of São Paulo, taken as the core of industrial activity in the country, is subjected to different levels of increasing returns to scale at the firm level. Core-periphery effects are then traced out suggesting the prevalence of agglomeration forces over diversion forces could rather exacerbate regional inequality as import barriers are removed up to a certain level. Further removals can reverse this balance in favor of diversion forces, implying de-concentration of economic activity as the country opens up to foreign trade, a result quite in line with recent advances in NEG models...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, 2003. 1. Introduction and Context Oil as {{a source}} of energy is an undisputed reality of the age in which we live. The oil and {{petroleum}} industry is an essential and valuable part of the South African economy. It follows then that transportation in this industry is of crucial importance. Simply put, without the efficient transportation of the various crude and petroleum products, the energy requirements of the country could not be met. While there are various modes of transportation within South Africa servicing this industry, this study will concentrate on the carriage of crude oil and petroleum products by sea, and its handiing in the associated ports. The main objective will be to examine the pricing structure raised by the ports of South Africa against the oil industry for th'a transportation of the crude and petroleum products moving through the various ports. 1. 1 Background During this researcher's tenure as a shipping agent on behalf of the oil majors in the ports of South Africa, the pori authorities' charges were dealt with on a regular basis. The inherent problems with the charges and the resulting conflicts created between the port authorities and the oil majors became quite familiar to the researcher during her years of working with the two parties. 1. 2 Objectives of the Study This study will start by looking at the economic theory and principles of port pricing structures. Chapter Two will work toward outlining the optimal port pricing structure a port authority should adopt, in order to ensure it is working according to sound economic principles as well as meeting the various objectives of the stakeholders utilising the port's infrastructure, superstructure and services. Chapter will focus on the South African oil industry and the importance of crude oil and its petroleum derivates as an energy source. The industry will placed in larger context of SADC, the various role players will be identified and the modes of transport used for the carriage of crude and petroleum products will outlined. The chapter will close with a presentation of the product costing for the petrol price South African consumers' pay at the petrol pumps. Chapter Four presents an overview of the ports South Africa, their facilities, their management arrangements and their pricing structures. A brief. history of the ports will be followed by a discussion of the need a restructuring process and an outline the proposed privatisation process will be Following this, the current management structure related pricing tariffs will be detailed. Chapter Africa and will explore the relationship ben. veen of the ports of South oil industry. history of this relationship will be set out, followed by the current dynamics affecting it. The study will then move on to examine the oil industry infrastructure found in these ports in terms of ownership management of <b>Port</b> <b>tariffs</b> and the question of who actually pays what will be addressed. The that created and continue to create tensions between oil majors and the ports of South Africa will highlighted. The chapter will conclude by presenting an ideal pricing structure, which could work towards resolving some of these issues. Chapter Six will discuss two different international models based on energy demand and supply similar to South African situation. The port pricing structure of these models will then be compared to that of South African ports in order to present a best-working practice. The purpose of this is to bring in an international perspective for the ideal pricing structure presented with the conclusion in Chapter Seven. 1 Methodology of the study The researcher initially used interviews with the various bodies as a means of gathering information. These data were then verified against textual information sources. Statistical figures were gathered and correlated into formats, which could then verify -, or disprove [...] different hypotheses put forward in the study...|$|E
40|$|This thesis project {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a Cost-Benefit Model (CBM) for shipping in the Arctic, considering the requirements outlined in the newly adopted Polar Code. The model is constructed to provide a live feasibility decision making tool for comparing vessels transit times, expenses, operational limitations and need for icebreaker escort; on either the Northwest Passage, Northern Sea Route, Suez Canal Route, or the Panama Canal Route. The model inputs ship parameters, ice conditions, and economic factors including: additional insurance premiums, canal tolls & transit <b>tariffs,</b> <b>port</b> fees, competent crew costs, bunker price, and unexpected maintenance costs due to ice damage. The model was developed using relevant information gathered from literature on both economic feasibility studies and ship-ice interactions, as well as from interviews with ship owners and operators with invested interests in Arctic shipping. The CBM is used to run a research simulation for two cases studies representing the highest and lowest cost differentials between the southern and northern routes. From these two case studies, it was found that fuel costs are the largest contributor to total voyage expense and that this cost is directly influenced by the ship speed in ice calculation routine. A Polar Class 4 and Finnish-Swedish 1 A ice class ships were compared within the research simulation. The results show that either ship on the northern routes is a feasible option as the interpretation of the CBM results must be considered from both a time-saved and revenue earned perspectives. The CBM results are dependent on the ice data input, the accuracy of the voyage, operational and capital inputs as well as the market conditions according to which the results are to be analyzed and compared under...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyIntroduction The Caribbean {{is largely}} {{made up of}} small and {{specialised}} open island economies, which import {{a large proportion of}} their consumer goods. In addition, any local production of goods and services is heavily dependent on the import of raw materials and unfinished parts. In 1996, the Caribbean's level of foreign trade, as a proportion of GDP, was 78 per cent, compared with 25 per cent for Latin America for the same period (Hoffmann, 1997);. Based on these figures, it can be inferred that Caribbean countries are more dependent on foreign trade than other regions. Maritime transport is the primary mode of commercial transport for the Caribbean. For island States such as these, trade in goods is conducted either by air or by sea. However, from an economic standpoint, air transport is only feasible for certain types of products and, as such, maritime transport remains the sole mode of transport for most goods. From this, it can be concluded that Caribbean countries are more dependent on maritime transport than other regions. Most Caribbean countries export only a few commodities such as bananas, sugar or bauxite [...] commodities for which a buyer can easily choose alternative sources of supplies. This means that countries in the region must accept prices determined by the international market for their export products. Moreover, these products have a low value and high transport costs, which {{have a significant impact on}} regional exporters. High shipping costs will even impede trade of any commodity once a competing country can offer the same product, inclusive of transport costs, at a lower rate. Thus, the industries of a country with high shipping costs experiences difficulties in exporting their products. Moreover, any dollar spent to transport a commodity directly to the market reduces the income of the Caribbean exporter and, as a result, firms in such countries might be forced to pay lower wages to compensate for higher transport costs, in order to be able to compete on world markets. It also increases the price of imported consumer goods and commodities. Thus, the whole economy of a country would benefit from any savings that result from the lowering of the transport costs. In summary, it can be said that high transport costs have a direct negative impact on trade and foreign investment. This relationship was identified in a recent World Bank Study (1994);. Similarly, Radelet and Sachs (1998); concluded that 'countries with lower shipping costs have had faster manufactured export growth during the past thirty years than countries with higher shipping costs'. For the Caribbean, especially, maritime transport costs are still high in comparison to other countries. For countries in the region, transport and insurance costs as a percentage of the value of their imports are as much as three times higher than the world average (Hoffmann, 1997);. There are diverse reasons for higher transport costs, that is, economies of scale in ports and in shipping, the degree of competition, <b>port</b> dues and <b>tariffs,</b> waiting times in ports or insurance premiums. Knowledge of the potential factors that influence these costs is essential. Hence this document, which seeks to analyse maritime transport and the possible determinants of its costs. To examine maritime transport and its costs, the analysis has been divided into three parts. Firstly, an overview of Caribbean foreign trade is given and the impacts on maritime transport and its costs for this region are considered. This analysis was done using import and export data for Barbados, Dominica, St. Lucia and Trinidad & Tobago for the period 1999. (1); The information was obtained from a prototype of a trade and transport database, which has been created by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC); Subregional Headquarters for the Caribbean. These countries were chosen as representative of the Caribbean: Dominica and St. Lucia Â- representing small open economies with dependency on a few export commodities; and Barbados and Trinidad & Tobago [...] representing larger economies with a more diversified product structure. The second part of this document is a detailed analysis of the determinants that impact on maritime transport costs. Data used in this part of the study was obtained from various sources, namely ports, shipping lines and agents, as well as other research studies. However, it must be noted at this juncture that because of a lack of statistical information, no comprehensive analysis could be undertaken on the factors having an impact on transport costs and, as such, selected samples were used. The final section of this document provides governments, regional and international organizations, such as the Association of Caribbean States (ACS); or the Caribbean Shipping Association (CSA);, with a few preliminary recommendations of possible areas for future activities, aimed at facilitating foreign trade and maritime transport. The key purpose of this section is to highlight what could be done by the public sector to promote trade, reduce transport costs and generally to assist the private sector involved in shipping.
