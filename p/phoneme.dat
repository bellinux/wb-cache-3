5|$|The {{research}} into {{the reconstruction of the}} consonants of Middle Mongol has engendered several controversies. Middle Mongol had two series of plosives, but there is disagreement as to which phonological dimension they lie on, whether aspiration or voicing. The early scripts have distinct letters for velar plosives and uvular plosives, but as these are in complementary distribution according to vowel harmony class, only two back plosive phonemes, */k/, * (~ *, *) are to be reconstructed. One prominent long running disagreement concerns certain correspondences of word medial consonants among the four major scripts (UM, SM, AM, and Ph, which were discussed in the preceding section). Word medial /k/ of Uyghur Mongolian (UM) has, not one, but two correspondences with the three other scripts: either /k/ or zero. Traditional scholarship has reconstructed */k/ for both correspondences, arguing that */k/ got lost in some instances, which raises the question of what the conditioning factors of those instances were. More recently, the other obvious possibility has been assumed, namely that the correspondence between UM /k/ and zero in the other scripts points to a distinct <b>phoneme,</b> /h/, which would correspond to the word-initial <b>phoneme</b> /h/ that is present in those other scripts. /h/ (sometimes also called /x/) is sometimes assumed to derive from *, which would also explain zero in SM, AM, Ph in some instances where UM indicates /p/, e.g. debel > Khalkha deel.|$|E

5|$|Whorf and Sapir both drew {{explicitly}} on Albert Einstein's {{principle of}} general relativity; hence linguistic relativity {{refers to the}} concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing a frame of reference as a medium through which observations are made. Following an original observation by Boas, Sapir demonstrated that speakers of a given language perceive sounds that are acoustically different as the same, if the sound comes from the underlying <b>phoneme</b> and does not contribute to changes in semantic meaning. Furthermore, speakers of languages are attentive to sounds, particularly if the same two sounds come from different phonemes. Such differentiation {{is an example of how}} various observational frames of reference leads to different patterns of attention and perception.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{word order}} is, {{as in most}} Germanic languages, V2, {{which means that the}} finite verb (V) appears in second position (2) of a declarative main clause. Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. There are two genders, no grammatical cases (except for pronouns), and a distinction between plural and singular. Older analyses posit the cases nominative and genitive and there are some remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well. Adjectives are compared as in English, and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, a highly variable consonant <b>phoneme.</b>|$|E
25|$|A related finding {{regarding}} statistical cues to phonological acquisition is {{a phenomenon}} known as the perceptual magnet effect. In this effect, a prototypical <b>phoneme</b> of a person’s native language acts as a “magnet” for similar phonemes, which are perceived as belonging to {{the same category as}} the prototypical <b>phoneme.</b> In the original test of this effect, adult participants were asked to indicate if a given exemplar of a particular <b>phoneme</b> differed from a referent <b>phoneme.</b> If the referent <b>phoneme</b> is a non-prototypical <b>phoneme</b> for that language, both adults and 6-month-old infants show less generalization to other sounds than they do for prototypical phonemes, even if the subjective distance between the sounds is the same. That is, adults and infants are both more likely to notice that a particular <b>phoneme</b> differs from the referent <b>phoneme</b> if that referent <b>phoneme</b> is a non-prototypical exemplar than if it is a prototypical exemplar. The prototypes themselves are apparently discovered through a distributional learning process, in which infants are sensitive to the frequencies with which certain sounds occur and treat those that occur most often as the prototypical phonemes of their language.|$|E

25|$|In {{a classic}} experiment, Richard M. Warren (1970) {{replaced}} one <b>phoneme</b> {{of a word}} with a cough-like sound. His subjects restored the missing speech sound perceptually without any difficulty and could not accurately identify which <b>phoneme</b> had been disturbed. This {{is known as the}} phonemic restoration effect. Another basic experiment compares recognition of naturally spoken words presented in a sentence (or at least a phrase) and the same words presented in isolation. Perception accuracy usually drops in the latter condition. Garnes and Bond (1976) also used carrier sentences when researching the influence of semantic knowledge on perception. They created series of words differing in one <b>phoneme</b> (bay/day/gay, for example). The quality of the first <b>phoneme</b> changed along a continuum. All these stimuli were put into different sentences each of which made sense with one of the words only. Listeners had a tendency to judge the ambiguous words (when the first segment was at the boundary between categories) according to the meaning of the whole sentence.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} found that two {{converging}} bimodal stimuli can produce a perception that is not only different in magnitude {{than the sum of its}} parts, but also quite different in quality. In a classic study labeled the McGurk effect, a person's <b>phoneme</b> production was dubbed with a video of that person speaking a different <b>phoneme.</b> The end result was the perception of a third, different <b>phoneme.</b> McGurk and MacDonald (1976) explained that phonemes such as ba, da, ka, ta, ga and pa can be divided into four groups, those that can be visually confused, i.e. (da, ga, ka, ta) and (ba and pa), and those that can be audibly confused. Hence, when ba – voice and ga lips are processed together, the visual modality sees ga or da, and the auditory modality hears ba or da, combining to form the percept da.|$|E
