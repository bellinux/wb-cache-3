On 19 August, a brigade of the Polish 1st Armoured Division linked up with forces of the 90th U.S. Infantry Division, sealing off some 50,000 German troops in the pocket. By 21 August, German attempts to reopen the gap had been thwarted, and all German troops trapped in the pocket surrendered to Allied forces, effectively <b>putting</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the German 7th Army.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, {{apparently}} {{distressed by}} the imperial approval {{given to the}} actions of Satsuma and Chōshū, fled Osaka aboard the Kaiyō Maru, withdrawing to Edo. Demoralized by his flight and by the betrayal by Yodo and Tsu, Shogunate forces retreated, making the Toba-Fushimi encounter an Imperial victory, although it is often considered the Shogunate forces should have won the encounter.

Vernescu, Gheorghe Apostoleanu and Alexandru Papadopol-Callimachi. Kogălniceanu's other measures as minister included: the establishment of Bucharest University, the introduction of identity papers, the establishment of a national police corps (comprising Dorobanți units), the unification of Border Police.|$|E

5|$|After <b>putting</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the {{internal}} strife, Basil II launched a counter-campaign against the Arabs in 995. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the Empire's {{position in the}} east, and the gains of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with Aleppo besieged and Antioch under threat. Basil won several battles in Syria, relieving Aleppo, taking over the Orontes valley, and raiding further south. Although {{he did not have}} the force to drive into Palestine and reclaim Jerusalem, his victories did restore much of Syria to the empire — including the larger city of Antioch which was the seat of its eponymous Patriarch.|$|E
5|$|Andrianampoinimerina dethroned Andrianjafy in {{a violent}} {{conflict}} that ended in 1787.

To consolidate support for his rule, Andrianampoinimerina mobilized representatives of the numerous noble castes {{to participate in the}} most extensive effort yet to expand and fortify Ambohimanga. He ordered the construction of new city walls, gates and defensive trenches, as well as a rosewood palace called Mahandrihono, which he had built in the traditional style.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, the {{distinguished}} Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson promoted {{the ideas that}} Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer-priests. These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by Heinrich Berlin, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, and Yuri Knorozov. With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, and {{the view of the}} Maya as peaceful could no longer be supported. Detailed settlement surveys of Maya cities revealed the evidence of large populations, <b>putting</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the vacant ceremonial centre model.|$|E
5|$|Speer's {{supporters}} {{maintained a}} continual call for his release. Among those who pledged support for Speer's sentence to be commuted were Charles de Gaulle, U.S. diplomat George Ball, former U.S. High Commissioner John J.

Willy Brandt {{was a strong}} advocate of Speer's, supporting his release, sending flowers to his daughter {{on the day of}} his release, and <b>putting</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the de-Nazification proceedings against Speer, which could have caused his property to be confiscated. A reduced sentence required the consent of all four of the occupying powers, and the Soviets adamantly opposed any such proposal.

5|$|Talks {{began on}} 30 April 1634, and the Treaty of Polyanovka {{was signed in}} May, <b>putting</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> hostilities. The treaty {{confirmed}} the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity (20,000 rubles in gold), while Władysław agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow. Jasienica notes that from the Russian perspective it was likely that Władysław's abnegation of his claim was more important, {{in terms of the}} subsequent increase in internal stability, than the loss of disputed borderland. Despite not winning militarily, the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph. Other authors, such as Hellie, support this interpretation.|$|E

5|$|To resolve {{an endless}} cycle of vendettas between two clans, Hanpu {{managed to make}} both parties accept a new rule: from then on, {{the family of a}} killer would {{compensate}} the victim's relatives with a gift of horses, cattle, and money. Historian Herbert Franke has compared this aspect of Jurchen customary law to the old Germanic practice of Wergeld. As a reward for <b>putting</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> the feuds, Hanpu was married to a sixty-year-old woman who then bore him one daughter and two sons.
