50|$|Legend has it {{just before}} World War II the oil {{refineries}} office was visited {{by the local}} Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in full dress whites and demanded the program manager fire all calorics at the plant {{in support of the}} pending war. The manager was said to reply “That is a good idea!….. one I had not thought of…. give me the week end to think it over and I will let you know on Monday.” Monday morning the group returned to find the refinery was closed and the gate had a <b>pad</b> <b>lock</b> on it. The manager had moved himself and his family out of town on the Saturday train. After this closure the population was said to have dropped by 1000 within a month.|$|E

5000|$|... “The Silver Hen” is a {{story of}} Dame Penny and how she finds her lost silver hen. Dame Dorothea Penny is a schoolteacher and teaches twelve {{children}} out of her house. She has a beautiful silver hen that goes missing from a <b>pad</b> <b>locked</b> coop in her backyard one day. Dame Louisa, who lives next door to Dame Penny, has the most beautiful Christmas trees that line the path in her front yard. Every year, the Christmas trees sprout with strands of popcorn, fruit, candy, and wax candles. This season, however, they are dead and Dame Louisa blames the silver hen.|$|R

[...] "Since I came here I have heard tales of crews having freed {{themselves}} in the night, and fallen upon the Christians, but for my part I {{do not believe in}} them. I have thought, as I suppose every one of us has thought, how such a thing could be done; but as far as I know no one has hit on a plan yet. Now and then men have managed to become possessed of a file, and have, by long and patient work, sawn through a chain, and have, when a galley has been lying near our own shore, sprung overboard and escaped; but for every attempt that succeeds there must be twenty failures, for the chains are frequently examined, and woe be to the man who is found to have been tampering with his. But as to a whole gang getting free at once, it is altogether impossible, unless the key of the <b>pad</b> <b>locks</b> could be stolen from an overseer, or the man bribed into aiding us." ...|$|R

50|$|The Door Control Unit is {{responsible}} for controlling and monitoring various electronic accessories in a vehicle's door. Since most of the vehicles {{have more than one}} door, generally DCUs are present in each door separately. A DCU associated with the driver's door has some additional functionalities. This additional features are the result of complex functions like locking, driver door switch <b>pad,</b> child <b>lock</b> switches, etc., which are associated with the driver's door. In most of the cases driver door module acts as a master and others act as slaves in communication protocols.|$|R
5000|$|However, this {{conclusion}} raised another {{question as to}} how Saulin {{managed to get the}} train moving again. A fail-safe mechanism on the cars locks the brakes in the on position if the valve is closed. The only way to start the train again is to re-open the valve or manually unlock each brake pad. SNCF policy requires to call for an engineer to examine the train (who would have probably found the closed valve). However, Saulin, anxious to continue the trip, enlisted the help of Boveé to work along opposite sides of the train unlocking each brake. Saulin believed the cause of the problem to be a common condition known as an [...] "air lock". When the emergency brake is activated, an [...] "air lock" [...] {{is the result of the}} compressed air filling up the brake pipes, clogging them and preventing the brakes from working. The brake <b>pads</b> <b>lock</b> as part of the fail-safe mechanism when an air lock occurs. To fix this problem, the trapped air must be bled out of the pipe to release the brakes. Nevertheless, Saulin had no idea of what he had done, and stated that the pressure gauge in his cab was marking the correct measure, which is why he thought all the braking systems were in working order. Unbeknownst to him, he had closed the main valve, isolating the front carriage from the rest of the train. Thus the gauge only showed the pressure of the first carriage's brakes.|$|R

5000|$|The book {{opens with}} brief {{descriptions}} {{of the state of}} some characters, describing them as [...] "a girl" [...] or [...] "a boy" [...] but can be determined who it is told about. It first describes Marina standing {{on the edge of a}} cliff in a dream. In The Fate of Ten she was left unconscious after a fight with Setrákus Ra. She sees Setrákus Ra taking the appearance of Eight, convincing her to let go and be with Eight, but she refuses and chooses to continue to fight. Next a scene is described of Five in a <b>padded</b> cell, <b>locked</b> up by Nine and John. Setrákus Ra also comes to him in a dream to convince him to come back on his side. Five refuses. The next scene is Mark walking the football field of his old school in Paradise, clutching a photo of Sarah. He is met by Setrákus Ra who tries to tell Mark he can bring Sarah back and they can fight together.|$|R
50|$|The Sentry {{finds the}} base in his memories, {{but it is}} destroyed. As he enters, the third voice in his mind grows louder and louder, telling him {{that none of this}} is real, that he is a murderer, and that he is not a hero. As he enters the base, the Sentry {{suddenly}} finds himself sitting in <b>locked,</b> <b>padded</b> room, frothing at the mouth, and in a straight jacket. Suddenly, a man's voice through a loud speaker tells him that he is actually a mental patient who has undergone shock therapy and has awakened from a deep slumber, and that his name is John Victor Williams.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1967, {{a number}} of {{additional}} changes were incorporated to accommodate stricter safety regulations and US emission laws. The safety improvements included a collapsible steering wheel and padded wheel hub, concave control knobs, elastic black rubber heater levers (instead of rigid colored translucent plastic), and softer, rounded dash top <b>padding.</b> Door handles, <b>locks,</b> and window cranks were modernized and less protruding, the door pockets were elastic, the rear-view mirror frame was chrome instead of black plastic, and the side view mirrors became more angular. Essentially, the 1967 250 SL retained the more classic [...] "chrome" [...] interior of the 230 SL, whereas the 1968 250 SL introduced the modernized [...] "safety" [...] interior of the 280 SL.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the course}} of play many {{offensive}} and defensive players run close to each other, and during tag plays, the defensive player must touch the offensive player. Although baseball is considered a non-contact sport, a runner may be allowed to make potentially dangerous contact with a fielder {{as part of an}} attempt to reach base, unless that fielder is fielding a batted ball. (Noted exceptions to the dangerous contact rule are found throughout amateur competitions, including youth leagues, high school, and college baseball.) A good slide is often more advantageous than such contact, and [...] "malicious" [...] contact by runners is typically prohibited as offensive interference. The most common occurrence of contact of this nature is at home plate between the runner and the catcher, as the catcher is well <b>padded</b> and <b>locked</b> into position that completely blocks home plate from the runner, and the runner will often try to knock the ball out of the catcher's hand by running him over. Since the catcher is seen (symbolically and literally) as the last line of defense, it seems natural that the more physical play happens here.|$|R
40|$|Hyperthreaded (HT) and {{simultaneous}} multithreaded (SMT) processors are {{now available}} in commodity workstations and servers. This technology is designed to increase throughput by executing multiple concurrent threads on a single physical processor. These multiple threads share the processor’s functional units and on-chip memory hierarchy {{in an attempt to}} make better use of idle resources. Most OpenMP applications and runtime libraries have been written assuming an Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP), not an SMT, model. Threads executing on the same physical SMT processor have interactions on data locality and resource sharing that do not occur on traditional SMPs. This work focuses on tuning the behavior of an OpenMP runtime library to improve the performance of applications executing on SMPs with SMT processors. First we implement and evaluate three techniques that have been asserted as important on HT processors: the use of pause instructions in spin loops, incorporation of per-thread stack offsets in slave threads, and <b>lock</b> <b>padding.</b> After implementing these techniques in the Omni OpenMP runtime library, we discover that both pause instructiosn and <b>lock</b> <b>padding</b> show noticible improvements, while stack offsets show negligible gains. We then propose three adaptive loop schedulers: a region-based scheduler, a loop-based scheduler and hardware counter based scheduler. These novel schedulers determine effective hierarchical schedules for individual parallel regions or loops to exploit the unique nature of SMPs with HT processors. We compare the performance of our three proposed schedulers against several standard schedulers using the SPEC and NAS OpenMP benchmark suites. We show that schedule selection must be done at the granularity of loops not regions, and that our loop-based adaptive schedulers outperform all other approaches on average, increasing speedup on average by over 25 % when all thread contexts are used.

5000|$|Navigation keys or cursor keys {{include a}} variety of keys which move the cursor to {{different}} positions on the screen. Arrow keys are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the Page Up and Page Down keys, scroll the page up and down. The Home key is used to return the cursor {{to the beginning of}} the line where the cursor is located; the End key puts the cursor at the end of the line. The Tab key advances the cursor to the next tab stop.The Insert key is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The Delete key discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position [...] "back" [...] towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The Backspace key deletes the preceding character.Lock keys lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numeric <b>pad.</b> The <b>lock</b> keys include Scroll lock, Num lock (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and Caps lock.|$|R

To {{access the}} cave, {{a similar way}} to Batman Begins, tapping three keys on the piano will reveal a now modernly built {{elevator}} which takes the passenger straight to the cave. The newest addition to the cave is [...] "The Bat", a flying tank aircraft built by Wayne Enterprises' Applied Science Division and an upgraded Batcomputer as well numerous landing <b>pads</b> and a <b>locking</b> case which contains the Batsuit. Added features included that the bridges used {{to gain access to}} different sections can be submerged as well as the platforms as a form of security measures in case anyone gains unauthorized access to the cave. While submerged the only visible object is a Batcomputer terminal which can only be accessed by either Bruce or Alfred's fingerprints and an access code. The cave from The Dark Knight appears as well, which contains weapons, supplies, and a back-up Batsuit. After Bruce Wayne is declared legally dead, his will is amended so that John Blake inherits GPS coordinates that lead him to the Batcave.|$|R
