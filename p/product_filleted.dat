After soaking, the soaked fillets were partially dried to about 44 % moisture. Three effective hurdles like low pH (by using 7 % acetic add and 1 % propionic acid), low water activity (by using 20 % salt and partially drying the fillets) and preservative (1 % propionic add), were used to prepare a shelf-stable product at room temperature. The dried product was sprayed with 0. 0 5 % BHA in 50 % alcohol and further dried for 10 minutes to remove added water and alcohol, thereby another hurdle (preservative) against fat oxidation. The product was packed in 300 gauge polythene bags and stored in transparent screw cap plastic jars. Fortnightly samples were drawn and subjected to biochemical, bacteriological and organoleptic evaluation to study its storage characteristics. The product was in good acceptable form up to 4 months at ambient temperature. The product needed one hour soaking in water with two changes of water in between to make it free from excess salt and acid smell...|$|R

The study reveals a high degree of species mislabeling in fish <b>fillet</b> <b>products.</b> In particular, this study shows that the labels of only 32 / 200 fish fillet samples provided comprehensive information relating to commercial designation, scientific name, geographical area, production method and whether previously frozen. The labeling of other samples was not compliant with European legislation. Indeed, the scientific name, which must also be indicated from 1 st January 2012, according to Article 68 of EU Commission Implementing Regulation No. 404 / 2011, was missing in 157 / 168 samples, the geographical area was missing in 152 / 168, while the commercial designation and the production method were reported in all samples. Furthermore, results from molecular investigations reveal a high occurrence of incorrect species declaration in fish <b>fillet</b> <b>products.</b> The commercial and/or scientific name declared failed to match the species identified in 164 / 200 (82 %) samples.

The {{results show that the}} choice of FU has little influence on the outcome: four out of five FUs yield the same ranking of the animal-based food products: impact potentials decrease in the order minced pork > chicken fillet > minced beef > milk. The plant-based food products score considerably lower than the animal-based food products, regardless of FU. Notably, impact potentials of beef are lower than of chicken and pork, regardless of FU, contrary to typical carbon footprint and land use results for meat products.

40|$|To {{develop a}} {{practical}} methodology for the authentication of organic salmonid <b>products,</b> 130 <b>fillet</b> samples of trout and salmon originating from organic and conventional aquaculture {{as well as}} wild stocks (salmon) were collected from the German market over one year. Combined stable isotope analysis of d 15 N and d 13 C in defatted dry matter allowed differentiation of organically farmed from conventionally farmed salmon and brown trout, whether raw, smoked or graved. For the additional distinction of organic and wild salmon, a second analysis of d 13 C in fish lipids was required. Fatty acid analysis completely differentiated the three production types of salmon just by the linoleic acid content in the fish lipids, which was lowest in wild and highest in conventional salmon. Moreover, the elevated myristic acid content allowed organic to be distinguished from wild and conventional salmon. Furthermore, organic and conventional brown trout could be distinguished by combining the oleic acid and gondoic acid contents. Analysis of the free astaxanthin isomeric pattern allowed a clear distinction of conventional and wild salmon, but organic salmon showed variable patterns that did not consistently allow the authentication of their origin. While a special feed composition is required in organic aquaculture, the composition of conventional aquaculture feed has changed considerably within the last decade. Consequently, the percentages of animal and vegetable components, which clearly vary between the production types, result in distinctive features in terms of stable isotope or fatty acid composition that are utilisable for the authentication of organic salmonid products. To account for potential changes in aquaculture feeding practices, the established distinctive limits should be traced and possibly adapted in future...|$|R

About 371 customers of a supermarket in the city of Amsterdam filled in a questionnaire, which included a subset of three copy tests. The results showed that many consumers did not realize that the organic logo already covers all the standards. They were inclined to underestimate the distinctive advantage of the logo; products with logo and details got higher ratings of positive attributes but were also considered more expensive.

Moreover, food authentication might affect the diet of certain groups of consumers, such as followers of religious practices. Considering the authentication of fish products {{is one of the key}} issues in food safety, quality and sustainability, the aim of this work was to investigate the prevalence of mislabelling in sole (Solea solea), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and hake (Merluccius merluccius) fillets from markets and supermarkets located in Apulia (Southern Italy) using DNA barcoding. The results of the molecular investigations reveal that 42 / 98 (42. 8 %) fillet samples were not correctly labelled. In particular, 12 / 27 (44. 4 %) fillets of sole (Solea solea) were identified as belonging to Solea senegalensis.

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsThis study {{analyses}} {{price transmission}} from Norwegian export prices of fresh salmon to retail prices of consumer salmon products in France and UK. For different reasons, changes in salmon export prices {{do not need}} to be fully transmitted to retail prices of salmon products based on Atlantic salmon from Norway. This study tries to shed light on these price links between different levels in the value chain. Specifically, this study attempts to quantify the degree of price transmission on a broader set of consumer salmon products than has been analyzed in earlier studies. Moreover, this is the first study that analyzes differences in price transmission between branded products and supermarkets’ private label salmon products. The results from this study show a high degree of price transmission from Norwegian export prices to retail prices of natural fresh <b>products</b> such as <b>fillets,</b> steaks and whole. However, price transmission to retail prices decreases as more processing are involved; for fresh whole salmon price transmission is complete, while in highly value added products such as fresh ready main meal the price transmission can be close to zero. The econometric results further suggest that the transmission is higher from the Norwegian export price to the retail prices of private label salmon products compared to prices of branded salmon products. Again, this is an indicator that there are higher marketing costs for branded products. The increasing range of salmon products marketed to satisfy the different consumer tastes therefore reduces transmission from salmon export price to retail prices. Nonetheless, supermarkets’ private label products appear to have the opposite effect on price transmission...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of discards {{will only be}} achieved, if more effective methods of catch selection will be developed and used. In principle, the unavoidable by catch of commercial fish {{should be used for}} human consumption, independent of the requirements for minimum length and existing catch quotas. The amount of such bycatch should be charged to the total catch quota and preferably be used for processing of fish portions with skin (carcasses with skin), because this kind of processing results in higher yields and nutrional advantages compared to fillet processing. Unfortunately, nowadays, in the German fishery and fish trade this traditional form of supply is only of minor importance because of the predominance of <b>fillets</b> and <b>fillet</b> <b>products.</b> However, cooperation between fishing industry and fish trade and a good advertising of processed fish portions with skin could overcome this problem. In the pelagic fishery of herring, mackerel and other similar pelagic species the bycatch of small sized specimen of these species can be a problem. These small sized fish can principally be processed to traditional fish products, but the processing costs for them are much higher. The prospects for processing of the bycatch into minced fish meat, fish protein concentrate or fish protein hydrolysate are very poor under the existing regime in the German fishing industry. A further way for processing of the bycatch, which can not be used for human consumption, is the production of fishmeal. However, only three German factory ships dispose of fish meal plants. Under the current economic conditions, i. e. because of limited storage capacity, the Ger-man trawler and cutter fleet is not able to transport the bycatch for fish meal production ashore...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Hydrolytic and {{oxidative}} rancidity development {{and its effect}} on quality loss were studied in frozen mackerel (Scomber scombrus) by biochemical and sensory indices. The effect of the lipid content on fish damage during a commercial freezer temperature (- 20 ºC) was studied for up to 12 months; thus, mackerel caught at two different times of the year (May and November) was checked, being May included in the period of minimum lipid content, while November is known to correspond to the maximum lipid content time. The study was also focused to two different kinds of fish products (whole fish and fillets). An increasing lipid hydrolysis was observed for all kinds of samples during the frozen storage; no differences (p> 0. 05) between whole fish and fillets were found for free fatty acid formation; however, mackerel from May showed a higher (p< 0. 05) hydrolysis development than its counterpart from November. An increasing lipid oxidation (peroxide value and thiobarbituric acid index) was observed for all kinds of samples during the frozen storage. Fillet lipid oxidation was found higher (p< 0. 05) than in whole fish. Fattier mackerel (November fish) showed a higher (p< 0. 05) oxidation development than its counterpart from May in the case of <b>fillet</b> <b>products.</b> Fluorescence assessment related to interaction compound formation showed to be higher (p< 0. 05) in fillets than in whole fish, although was bigger (p< 0. 05) in May samples.

Members {{of the family}} Anisakidae belonging to the genera Anisakis and Pseudoterranova are implicated in human infections caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked fish. Adequate cooking will kill anisakid larvae, however, killed or inactivated larvae can still cause sensitization and immunoglobulin E-dependent hypersensitivity in human. This work describes the development of DNA-based tests to detect and quantify the presence of Anisakis spp. and Pseudoterranova spp. larvae in fish and fish-derived <b>products,</b> including fish <b>fillets,</b> surimi, fish sticks, canned fish, and baby food. Primers and TaqMan MGB probes recognizing only Anisakis spp. and Pseudoterranova spp. were designed on the first internal transcribed spacer 1 regions of rDNA for a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. A commercial probe for 18 S rDNA was used to detect and quantify the total eukaryotic DNA of the samples. The specificity and sensitivity of the assays were tested using reference samples prepared from mixtures made of Anisakis larvae in different quantity of codfish, and subsequent dilutions. Studies were performed to assess {{the ability of the}} test to detect and quantify anisakids in various products. Results showed that this test is able to detect anisakid DNA contained in a proportion of 1 : 10 (5) in 1 ng of total DNA. The high prevalence of anisakids reported in main fishery species was confirmed by frequently detecting anisakids DNA in fish muscle and fish-derived products. A partial correlation was found between the number of larvae present in the viscera and the level of contamination of fish fillets. In conclusion, this molecular test is useful to detect the presence of Anisakis spp. and Pseudoterranova spp. in fish and fish-derived products and to quantify the level of contamination along the food chain, with potential applications for fish farms, fish markets, and food producers...|$|R

40|$|Sparing {{fish oil}} (FO) in aquafeeds, {{especially}} diets intended for marine carnivores, {{is essential for}} the continued economic and environmental sustainability of aquaculture. Plant- and animal-derived lipids may successfully replace FO so long as diets are otherwise formulated to contain adequate amounts of essential fatty acids, including the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) required by many marine carnivorous species. Whereas growth performance may not be affected by these alternative lipids, tissue fatty acid profiles, including that of the edible <b>fillet</b> <b>products,</b> are often distorted and contain less of the LC-PUFAs many seafood consumers desire. Saturated fatty acid (SFA) -rich lipids, such as fully hydrogenated soybean oil (SO), tend to have a less overt effect on fillet composition and LC-PUFA loss in comparison with alternative lipids rich in C 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (C 18 PUFAs). However, SFA-rich lipids may be somewhat less digestible. To address this digestibility limitation, two studies were conducted to evaluate 1) increasing inclusion levels of partially hydrogenated SO (a monounsaturated fatty acid [MUFA]-rich lipid with presumably higher digestibility) in place of fully hydrogenated SO, and 2) supplementing fully hydrogenated SO-based feeds with emulsifiers as a means of enhancing diet utilization, growth performance, and fillet LC-PUFA retention in California Yellowtail (Seriola dorsalis). In both studies, diets containing only fully hydrogenated SO yielded tissues with equivalent levels of LC-PUFAs in comparison to diets containing menhaden FO. Replacing 60 % of fully hydrogenated SO with partially hydrogenated SO resulted in numeric increases in production performance (weight gain and specific growth rate [SGR]), with minimal accumulations of trans fats in edible tissues. Whereas emulsifiers including casein, whey protein, and monoglycerides can be added to SFA-rich fully hydrogenated SO diets to potentially improve digestibility, no production performance benefit was realized in California Yellowtail; the addition of mixed bile acids, however, significantly impaired performance. In summary, the use of SFA-rich fully hydrogenated SO is an effective strategy for minimizing the negative effects of FO sparing on California Yellowtail fillet composition, but limitations associated with reduced SFA digestibility must be addressed in order to optimize utilization and effectiveness of SFA-rich aquafeeds...|$|R

Considerable research focuses on the control of microbial growth and biochemical reactions to improve fish quality and extent shelf life. Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) is a Mediterranean fish of high commercial value due to its desirable characteristics. <b>Products</b> like chilled <b>fillets</b> from marine cultured Mediterranean fish have high commercial potential if their shelf life can be extended through packaging or minimal processing. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate and model the effect of osmotic treatment (40 - 60 % maltodextrin plus 5 % NaCl, 0 - 360 min, 15 - 37 °C) and its combination with modified atmosphere packaging (20 - 80 %CO 2), antimicrobial agents (0. 5 % carvacrol, 0. 5 % glucono-δ-lactone, 1 % citrox, 2 ? 104 IU/ 100 g osmotic solution) and alternative osmotic solutes (trehalose, glucosamine) on the quality characteristics of gilthead seabream and to investigate the potential of using osmosis as a minimal treatment to extend the shelf life of fish products. Osmotic pretreatment caused substantial water loss (12. 3 - 77. 0 %) and solid enrichment (2. 5 - 34. 1 %) with higher solution concentrations showing the highest values of mass flow. A second degree polynomial model described successfully mass transfer during osmotic process. The indices that could more consistently be correlated to storage time and temperature of the products were Pseudomonas sp. growth for aerobically packed fillets and lactic acid bacteria for MAP samples and the chemical index TVB-N, showing high correlation with sensory scores, as also indicated by their similar Ea values. Shelf life at 5 °C was 4 days for untreated fillets and 9, 11 and 13 days for fillets treated with 40, 50 and 60 % maltodextrin, respectively. Osmotic pre-treatment with the addition of nisin in combination with MAP was the most effective treatment resulting in significant shelf life extension of gilthead seabream fillets (48 days compared to 10 days for the control at 0 °C). The results of the study show the potential of using osmotic pretreatment in combination with modified atmosphere packaging, antimicrobial agents or alternative osmotic solutes and superchilling storage to extend the shelf life and improve the commercial value of fresh chilled fish products. The proposed models can be a reliable tool for predicting the shelf life of minimally treated and MA packed gilthead seabream fillets during refrigerated storage...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters of quality regarding meat both from mammals and fish is texture. The post mortem degradation of muscle and connective tissue proteins during tenderization of meat from warm-blooded animals is unwanted in fish due to a loss of <b>product</b> quality. Soft <b>fillet</b> and gaping are common problems both in wild and farmed cod and have huge impact on the quality and the consumers’ perception of the products. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the changes in texture are not known, but endogenous proteolytic enzymes seem {{to play an important role}} in the process. A muscle cell contains several proteolytic systems. Among these are the multicatalytic proteasome, lysosomal cathepsins, cytosolic calpains and metalloproteinases. It has been shown that calpains are important in the degradation process resulting in tender meat in warm-blooded animals. In fish, the calpains and cathepsins have been suggested to act in cooperation resulting in the observed post mortem degradation of muscle proteins. Many of the cathepsins and calpains have been shown to be able to degrade myofibrillar proteins in vitro systems. Such systems have traditionally been a main strategy when studying protein degradation post slaughter in fish muscle. A weakness in such systems is that grinding of muscle tissue and isolation of proteins from the homogenate leads to a loss of the internal control system in the muscle. Another problem by using such systems is that the conditions are often highly optimized and therefore very different from normal post mortem muscle. The temperature and pH is often different from normal post mortem muscle. In this thesis cathepsin D, one of the candidate enzymes being responsible for post mortem muscle degradation in cod has been studied. The enzyme was purified from cod liver, and an antibody specific against the enzyme was produced in mouse. The isolated enzyme had lower tolerance towards temperature than a similar commercial available enzyme isolated from bovine. The antibody detected cathepsin D in extracts from several other fish species. Further, the degradation of myosin heavy chain (MHC) was studied. The degradation of MHC in isolated myofibrils occurred at the highest rate at high temperature (20 ºC) and low pH (5. 5), but degradation occurred even when stored on ice and at relevant muscle-pH. For comparison, intact muscle was stored prior to isolation of myofibrils. The results showed that the MHCdegradation occurred in a similar pattern in intact muscle, however less prominent. It was also shown that cathepsin D was associated with the myofibrils, and the enzyme could not be completely removed even after several washing steps. A model system was established, that made it possible to study how small changes in pH and inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes influence on the MHC-degradation in intact muscle tissue post slaughter. A low muscle-pH (6. 05 - 6. 3) did lead to degradation of MHC, while the protein stayed unchanged at pH 6. 9. Inhibitors of cysteine and aspartic acid proteinases were obviously more efficient in preventing MHC-degradation than inhibitors of serine and metalloproteinases. A surprising observation was that EDTA, an inhibitor of metalloproteinases, increased the degradation of MHC. The conlusion of this thesis is that lysosomal cathepsins of the cysteine- and aspartic acid-types are responsible for the MHC-degradation in intact muscle. The new model system will be suitable when studying how other muscle proteins are degraded in intact muscle tissue post slaughter, and which enzymes that are involved...|$|R

The fillets via salting in 15 % NaCl by a ratio of 1 : 2 (w/w) were immersed in high-salt kasu-paste (Shoashing-vinasse: water: salt: sugar: rice-wine＝ 100 : 50 : 30 : 30 : 30 w/w, HSKP) with a ratio of 1 : 2 (w/w) and fermented at room temperature (high temperature high salt kasu-zuke; HTHSK). Changes in components of fish and kasu-paste were determined. The contribution of vinasse protease during kasu-zuke was also investigated. The results obtained were as follows: 1. Inter components transfer between tilapia fillet and vinasse occurred during kasu-zuke. No difference in components of the fillets from after 6 days HTHSK was observed. However off-flavor occurred on LTLSK fillet. Six days was a optimal time for kasu-zuke by Shoashing- vinasse. 2. NaCl content of HTHSK and LTLSK samples were 10 % and 2. 2 %, total bacterial counts(TBC) were 10000 and 100000 CFU/g for HTHSK and LTLSK, respectively. Alcohol, reducing sugar, and free amino acid were 3. 5 %, 62 mg/ 100 g, 15. 07 umol/g for HTHSK, and 3. 0 %, 92 mg/ 100 g, 3. 44 umol/g for LTLSK. Formic acid was the major organic acid (60 mg/ 100 g) in both HTHSK and LTLSK tilapia meat. VBN contents were 110 mg/ 100 g for HTHSK and 18 mg/ 100 g for LTLSK. Only putrescine, histamine and tyramine were detected in biogenic amines and their contents were 0. 57, 22. 21, 0. 22 mg/ 100 g for HTHSK and 0. 49, 6. 4, 2. 11 mg/ 100 g for LTLSK, respectively. From the results, LTLSK was better than HTHSK to obtain high quality products. 3. The optimum conditions of Shoashing-vinasse protease were pH 3. 0, 20 ℃, 2 % alcohol and less than 2 %NaCl. The heat inactivation rate constant (Kd) was 9. 4 × 100000 /sec, while the △E, △H, △S and △G were 17. 10 kcal/mole, 16. 52 kcal/mole, 2. 3 e. u and 15. 85 kcal/mole for 20 ℃, respectively. The enzyme was sensitive to salt and heat, contribution of vinasse to kasu- zuke products resulted from the components of vinasse itself and enzymes contained in fish meat rather than protease action. 4. The tilapia fillets obtained from LTLSK and HTHSK could be packaged and labeled with cooking method as a low temperature distribution products. The products via preparation and sterilization could also be distributed at normal temperature as directly edible products. 中文摘要 本研究以省產吳郭魚及紹興酒粕為材料，將魚片與低鹽酒粕 混合糊(米酒：水：鹽：糖：酒粕 = 30 ： 50 ： 4. 5 ： 30 ： 100 w/w) 以 1 ： 2 (w/w) 的比例於 4 ℃ 下進行低溫低鹽粕漬(low temperature low salt kasu-zuke；LTLSK) ；或將鹽漬魚片(魚肉： 15 % 鹽水 = 1 ： 2 w/w) 與高鹽酒粕混合糊(米酒：水：鹽：糖：酒粕 = 30 ： 50 ： 30 ： 30 ： 100 w/ w) 以 1 ： 2 (w/w) 的比例於室溫(23 - 28 ℃) 下進行高溫高鹽粕漬(high temperature high salt kasu-zuke；HTHSK) 。檢測粕漬過程中魚肉及粕 糊之成分，此外亦探討酵素對製品之貢獻。所得結論如下： 1. 粕漬期間 ，魚片與粕糊成分有互相移動現象，HTHSK 粕漬 6 日後，魚片所 含 成分差異不大；LTLSK 粕漬時間過長時魚片會有不良氣味產生，兩者之粕 漬時間均以 6 日為宜。 2. 粕漬 6 日後魚片之含鹽量 HTHSK 為 10 %， LTLSK 為 2. 2 %；總菌數分別 為 10000 、 100000 CFU/g；酒精、還原糖 及游離胺基酸含量HTHSK 分別為 3. 5 %、 62 mg/ 100 g 及 15. 07 umol/g ；LTLSK 則分別為 3. 0 %、 92 mg/ 100 g 及 3. 4 umol/g ；有機酸含量方 面以甲酸含量最高，兩者皆約 60 mg/ 100 g；VBN 含 量則依序為 110 、 18 mg/ 100 g；生物胺含量方面putrescine、histamine及 tyramine可偵測，HTHSK含量依次約為 0. 57 、 22. 2 及 0. 22 mg/ 100 g， LTLSK 依次為 0. 49 、 6. 40 及 2. 11 mg/ 100 g。綜合而言，LTLSK 法於 魚肉品質之保 持上較為有利。 3. 酒粕酵素之最適作用條件為 pH 3. 0 、 20 ℃、 2 % 酒精及食鹽含量低於 2 %。 其熱失活速率為 9. 4 × 100000 /sec(20 ℃) ， 20 ℃ 下之 △E、△H、 △S及 △G 分 別為 17. 10 kcal/mole、 16. 52 kcal/mole、 2. 3 e. u 及 15. 85 kcal/mole。此 酵素對鹽 及熱敏感，無論 LTLSK 與 HTHSK 法均易失活，故粕漬過程 中蛋白質分解酵 素所提供之作用無多，粕漬之效果主要應來自粕本身 之成分及魚肉自身所含酵 素之作用。 4.

40|$|Introduction: Tea {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{frequently}} consumed beverages in the world and its consumption dates back to more than 2000 years in China and then spread to other areas including Japan and later on to Europe (Zhao et al., 2014). Green tea is produced from Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze leaf infusion and is well known for its pleasant flavour and is associated with positive health effects. The biological activity of green tea is related with the considerable amount of catechins and other phenolic compounds, in particular flavonols and phenolic acids, present in its composition (Zhao et al., 2014). These phenolic compounds prevent the oxidative damage through their antioxidant activity and also reduce the risk of cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases (Lorenzo et al., 2014). The process of oxidation {{is one of the}} most common mechanisms of degradation of foodstuffs and it can alter food texture and colour, decrease nutritional quality, develop off-odours and also produce possible toxic compounds. As a consequence, the shelf-life and commercial acceptability of the food products decrease. Currently, one of the major concerns of the consumers is the impact of food on health. In line with this, food industry is trying to substitute synthetic additives by natural compounds. These can be directly added to food or incorporated in food packaging with the aim of being controlled released throughout the product shelf life. This concept is so-called Active packaging and allows the packaging to positively interact with foods to increase food shelf-life. This interaction can be due to the intended release of compounds from packaging to the foods or to their headspace, or due to the scavenging of compounds by the packaging from the packaged foods. Due to the antioxidant capacity of green tea, its extract can be proposed as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants (Giménez et al., 2013). In fact, it has already been applied in active food packaging. Material and Methods: The present review focuses on the application of green tea extract in active packaging. In this regard, an extensive bibliographic research was carried out in order to evaluate the polymers already used to incorporate green tea extract, as well as the mechanical and barrier properties and efficiency of these packaging systems in contact with foods. Results and Discussion: The chemical composition of tea leaves on active compounds with antioxidant activity is well documented. Bioactive constituents of the tea leaves include catechin gallates such as epigallocatechin gallate and gallocatechin gallate (López de Dicastillo et al., 2011). However the levels of these compounds depend on many factors, such as the edaphoclimatic conditions and drying conditions of the Camellia sinensis leaves. Moreover the extraction and analysis methods can also have a great influence in their content. Green tea extract has already been incorporated into different polymers. In fact, most of them are edible such as proteic films from distilled dry beans (Yang et al., 2016), agar (Lacey et al., 2014), chitosan (Siripatrawan et al., 2012; Siripatrawan et al., 2010) and gelatine (Hong et al (2009). Green tea extract (GTE) can offers protection against oxidation, significantly reducing rancidity and thereby extending the shelf-life of packaged foods. Moreover the sensory analysis also demonstrated that packaged food was unaffected by GTE (Carrizo et al., 2016). According to Yang et al. (2016), the incorporation of the GTE did not alter the physical properties of the films. According to Siripatrawan et al. (2010), the incorporation of GTE improved the mechanical and water vapour barrier properties. In general, GTE provides a very positive impact in the reduction of oxidation of all types of food, from aqueous to fatty (López de Dicastillo et al., 2011), although most of the studies selected meat (e. g. pork, pork sausages, pork loins), or fish <b>products</b> (e. g. <b>fillets</b> of hake, salted sardines) to test the efficiency of the active films. Conclusion: Green tea has great potential of application in active food packaging due to its antioxidant capacity. Therefore, in the near future, is it possible that new food packaging based on GTE will arise in the market. However, more studies are require to elucidate about the concentrations of GTE that do not affect or affect positively the mechanical or barrier properties of the packaging and that are effective as oxidation inhibitors of packaged foodsThis work was supported by the research project “Development of methodologies for the evaluation of polymeric food packaging components and determination of their structural and mechanical properties” (2016 DAN 1289) funded by the National Institute of Health Dr Ricardo Jorge, I.

40|$|Farmed Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) (Thunnus maccoyii) is an {{important}} export product for South Australia (SA). It is exported to Japan, China, Korea and the United States for the sushi and sashimi markets. The primary purpose of SBT farming in SA is to fatten wild-caught juvenile fish (2 - 4 years of age with initial mean weights between 12 - 20 kg) {{over a period of}} approximately five months by feeding a selection of baitfish types. Farmers, farm managers and consumers of SBT all have an interest in managing chemical residues that have the potential to biomagnify in the fatty tissue of the farmed SBT fillets. Of particular interest are chemical residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins / dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). This research presents the investigations and experimental validation of a predictive model {{that can be used to}} address the levels of residues in the fillets of farmed SBT at harvest from feeding (as the source) when applied to SBT aquaculture. An additional industry-focussed aim of this research was to determine if a Longer Term Holding (LTH) farming period, with a duration of an extra 12 months after a typical farming period of approximately five months, could produce SBT with higher condition index (CI) and lipid content, while keeping levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs low, compared to the typical farming period. The justification for this research is that an adequate quantitative model is essential to help industry achieve targeted concentrations in the final <b>fillet</b> <b>product</b> by making scientific-based decisions on baitfish selection (baitfish strategies for the feeding of SBT), and longer term, to confidently demonstrate to local markets and importing countries that Australia is actively managing levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in farmed SBT, to ensure a high quality and safe product is delivered to the consumer. The novelty of this research is underpinned by four integrated stages, and the criteria for an adequate model established. The important criteria included: accurate predictions versus observed data demonstrated through the analysis of residual plots, potential physiological interpretation of model coefficients, parsimony – the model should be as simple as possible (but no simpler) and that the model should be easy to use. Firstly, a logical starting point was the development of a risk framework for residues in SBT. The developed framework was based on conventional principles of microbiological risk assessment highlighted in Codex Alimentarius. The risk framework consists of five governing principles: hazard identification, hazard characterisation, exposure assessment, risk characterisation and model validation. The advantages of the risk framework is that it provides a systematic research approach and permits information to be handled unambiguously, especially important for the niche SBT industry where chemical residue research is carried out for the first time. Secondly, because of a lack of available scientific data in context of this research, commercial-scale experimental field data for levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in typical farmed SBT as affected by feeding and growth were collected over 17 months at seven time intervals from Farm Delta Fishing Pty Ltd in 2005 / 06 (n = 50). Field data from another commercial company, Farm Alpha Fishing Pty Ltd, was collected over the typical farming period specific to this company, spanning 15 weeks at three time intervals in 2006, for validation work (n = 15). The data obtained from Farm Delta Fishing Pty Ltd revealed that whole weight of farmed SBT increased from 18. 5 kg to 30. 3 kg for a typical farming period, and subsequently to 41. 0 kg by the end of the LTH farming period. A maximum mean CI of 24. 0 ± 0. 5 kg. m⁻³ and a maximum mean lipid content of 17. 6 ± 0. 5 % was achieved at the third time interval of the typical farming period, for the baitfish types and ratios used as feed. There were no significant differences in the CI and lipid between the final harvests of the typical farming and LTH periods, i. e. even after an additional 12 months of farming. PCB and PCDD/F concentrations, however, increased between the final harvests of the typical farming and LTH periods. The data indicated that a typical farming period was sufficient to achieve a maximum CI and lipid content with lower concentrations of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in the fillets relative to the LTH farming period. For the third stage of this research, a quantitative model was synthesised and applied to the PCB and PCDD/F (2, 3, 7, 8 -TeCDF) data detected in farmed SBT fillets. Assimilation efficiencies for PCBs and 2, 3, 7, 8 -TeCDF in the fillets of SBT were obtained. An assimilation efficiency, or percentage retention (efficiency expressed as a percentage), in the fillet of SBT is a measure of the uptake of a chemical residue from food (baitfish) to the SBT fillet. For the WHO-PCBs, assimilation efficiencies based on SBT fillets ranged between 19. 1 – 35. 3 % with the exception of PCB 169. The highest assimilation efficiency of 35. 3 %, with a range of 30. 4 – 40. 3 % (at the 95 % confidence level) was attributed to the most toxic PCB congener, PCB 126. An assimilation efficiency of 39. 2 % was determined in SBT fillets for the congener 2, 3, 7, 8 -TeCDF, which was higher than the assimilation efficiencies determined for the WHO-PCB congeners. A residual plot as predicted value versus observed value indicated that the predictive model was neither under- or over-parameterised. However, when the predictive model was assessed against the data set from Farm Alpha Pty Ltd, the model over-predicted the actual PCB and PCDD/F concentrations. The over-prediction is attributed to possible overfeeding of SBT farmed by Farm Alpha Fishing Pty Ltd. From a food safety point of view, in the absence of ideal predictions because of a lack of ideal validation data sets, an over-prediction instead of under-prediction is preferred. In the fourth stage, the practical application of the predictive model was demonstrated. Because SBT fillets are retailed as tissue group-specific, i. e. akami (low fat), chu-toro (medium fat) and otoro (high fat) fillets, PCB and PCDD/F analyses were carried out on the three tissue groups for selected SBT (n = 7). Dietary modelling on SBT consumption in humans was carried out using findings from the predictive model and tissue-specific data. The baitfish strategy employed for the feeding of farmed SBT consequently affects dietary exposure to SBT consumers. Exposure to PCBs and PCDD/Fs is approximately seven times lower for the consumption of a skin-free, boneless akami fillet than for a comparable otoro fillet of the same size. This dietary exposure assessment accounted only for consumption of SBT tissue-specific fillets. The experimental field study and modelling work on PCB and PCDD/F concentrations in farmed SBT (fillets) outlined in this thesis importantly directs the need to re-evaluate a specific model to better cater for SBT farming practices where SBT fillets are produced for human consumption. Because conditions that normally pertain to commercial farming of wild-caught fish were studied, findings should be of interest to industries where other species of fish (for food) are farmed in sea-cages in the open ocean.
