25|$|The {{marriage}} contracts {{represented a}} {{protection for the}} women, {{both in terms of}} financial security if anything were to happen to them or their husband, and in terms of having the liberty to annul the <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> if the man they had chosen proved incompatible. A substantial number of the filles du roi who arrived in New France between 1669 and 1671 cancelled marriage contracts; perhaps the dowry they had received made them disinclined to retain a fiancé with whom they found themselves dissatisfied.|$|E
25|$|Byzantine {{diplomatic}} {{policy towards}} the steppe peoples generally consisted of {{encouraging them to}} fight among themselves. The Pechenegs provided great assistance to the Byzantines in the 9th century in exchange for regular payments. Byzantium also sought alliances with the Göktürks against common enemies: in the early 7th century, one such alliance was brokered with the Western Tűrks against the Persian Sasanians in the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. The Byzantines called Khazaria Tourkía, and by the 9th century referred to the Khazars as 'Turks'. During the period leading up to and after the siege of Constantinople in 626, Heraclius sought help via emissaries, and eventually personally, from a Göktürk chieftain of the Western Tűrkic Qağanate, Tong Yabghu Qağan, in Tiflis, plying him with gifts and the <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> to his daughter, Epiphania. Tong Yabghu responded by sending a large force to ravage the Persian empire, marking {{the start of the}} Third Perso-Turkic War. A joint Byzantine-Tűrk operation breached the Caspian gates and sacked Derbent in 627. Together they then besieged Tiflis, where the Byzantines may have deployed an early variety of traction trebuchets (ἑλέπόλεις) to breach the walls. After the campaign, Tong Yabghu is reported, perhaps with some exaggeration, to have left some 40,000 troops behind with Heraclius. Though occasionally identified with Khazars, the Göktürk identification is more probable since the Khazars only emerged from that group after the fragmentation of the former sometime after 630. Sasanian Persia never recovered from the devastating defeat wrought by this invasion.|$|E
500|$|The {{piece is}} one of Gilbert's humorous spoofs {{of the law and}} the legal profession, based on his short {{experience}} as a barrister. It concerns a breach of <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> suit. The defendant argues that damages should be slight, since [...] "he is such a very bad lot," [...] while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks [...] "substantial damages." [...] After much argument, the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself.

500|$|During {{the siege}} of Constantinople, Heraclius formed an {{alliance}} with people Byzantine sources called the [...] "Khazars", under Ziebel, now generally identified as the Western Turkic Khaganate of the Göktürks, led by Tong Yabghu, plying him with wondrous gifts and the <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> to the porphyrogenita Eudoxia Epiphania. Earlier, in 568, the Turks under Istämi had turned to Byzantium when their relations with Persia soured over commerce issues. Istämi sent an embassy led by the Sogdian diplomat Maniah directly to Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk {{as a gift to}} Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct Chinese silk trade desired by the Sogdians.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Bramwell Booth {{informed}} me that there exists a class of young men, {{most of them in}} the employ of tradesfolk, who habitually amuse themselves by getting servant girls into trouble, often under a <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> Then, if the usual results follow, it is common for these men to move away to another town, taking their references with them and, sometimes under a new name, to repeat the process there. She was of opinion that the age of consent ought to be raised to eighteen at least, a course for which there is much to be said. Also she thought, and this is more controversial, that when any young girl has been seduced under <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> the seducer should be liable to punishment under the criminal law. Of course, one of the difficulties here would be to prove the <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> beyond all reasonable doubt.|$|E

Denzio included the daughter's ineffectual fiancé and Don Giovanni's cowardly servant besides other characters that originate in the Don Juan dramas of Tirso and Cicognini.
