These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E
