The team currently plays in the ninth division of the German football league. Since July 2016, the club is managed via a webpage, where the fans can make their decisions about, for example, the starting line-up or the prices for the jersey. For a small amount of money once a month, the fans become “team managers” (not members of TC Freisenbruch) on this webpage and are a part of Germany’s most exciting football project. They get exclusive information about the team, video and <b>photo</b> <b>material</b> and of course also data from performance tests or training sessions. It is also the decision of the fans to dismiss the manager of the club. At the moment, the team is trained by Mike Möllensiep.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} sludge, {{collected}} after processing different makes of steel, is of big {{interest for the}} research of chip formation while grinding. Together with hard- and software it helps to establish qualitative and quantitative interconnections between geometry features of sludge and technological factors. The article deals with studying the influence of chemical composition of steel grinding makes {{on the results of}} photometrical analysis of chips after grinding. For this reason, the <b>photo</b> <b>material</b> obtained with the electronic scanning microscope JSM 6460 LV (JEOL, USA) was studied visually and some chips were geometrically measured. As the most apparent (explicit) form of chips is the globular ones which allow fulfilling the exact geometric measurements, the analysis of chips of this particular form is given in the article...|$|E
40|$|Imec is {{currently}} driving the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) <b>photo</b> <b>material</b> development within the imec {{material and equipment}} supplier hub. EUV baseline processes using the ASML NXE 3300 full field scanner have been setup for the critical layers of the imec N 7 (iN 7) BEOL process modules with a resist sensitivity of 35 mJ/cm 2, 40 mJ/cm 2 and 60 mJ/cm 2 for metal, block and vias layer, respectively. A feasibility study on higher sensitivity resists for HVM has been recently conducted looking at 16 nm dense line-space at a targeted exposure dose of 20 mJ/cm 2. Such a study reveals that photoresist formulations with a cost-effective resist sensitivity are feasible today. Moreover, recent advances in enhanced underlayers are further offering novel development opportunities to increase the resist sensitivity. However, line width roughness (LWR) and pattern defectivity at nano scale are the major limiting factors of the lithographic process window and further efforts are needed to reach a HVM maturity level. We will present {{the results of the}} <b>photo</b> <b>material</b> screening and we examine in detail the lithography patterning results for the best performing photoresists. We further discuss the fundamental aspects of photo materials from a light-matter interaction standpoint looking at the photo emission yield at the EUV light for different photo materials towards {{a better understanding of the}} relation between photon efficiency and patterning performance. Finally, as metal containing resists are becoming part of the EUV material landscape, we also review the manufacturing aspects of a such class of resists looking at metal cross contamination pattern and defectivity on the process equipment. © (2017) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|Corrosion is {{the main}} problem in Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC). RC usually absorbs carbon dioxide from surrounding environment in operational period. This carbon dioxide reacts with the calcium oxide, which is already present in RC and forms a calcium carbonate an acidic compound that enhances corrosion {{on the surface of}} the reinforcement.   Addition of <b>photo</b> catalytic <b>materials</b> to the RC structure during its construction phase could reduce the corrosion problem of RC materials.   This material hinders calcium oxide to form acidic compound and creates a complex compound. In combination with light, this complex compound is oxidized, and residual compound will exist in or surface of RC material. In this study it is aimed to find out the proper <b>photo</b> catalytic <b>material</b> adjustable with RC material for reducing corrosion problem and enhancing oxidization process of volatile organic compounds. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Given {{a picture}} taken {{somewhere in the}} world, {{automatic}} geo-localization of that image is a task that would be extremely useful e. g. for historical and forensic sciences, documentation purposes, orga-nization of the world’s <b>photo</b> <b>material</b> and also intelligence applications. While tremendous {{progress has been made}} over the last years in visual location recognition within a single city, localization in natural envi-ronments is much more difficult, since vegetation, illumination, seasonal changes make appearance-only approaches impractical. In this work, we target mountainous terrain and use digital elevation models to extract representations for fast visual database lookup. We propose an auto-mated approach for very large scale visual localization that can efficiently exploit visual information (contours) and geometric constraints (consis-tent orientation) at the same time. We validate the system on the scale of a whole country (Switzerland, 40 000 km 2) using a new dataset of more than 200 landscape query pictures with ground truth...|$|E
40|$|The reader {{looks at}} the meaning of (everyday) {{photographs}} for ethnography and cultural studies. It deals with the methodological implications of both the photograph as a research object and the taking of photographs as a research method. Some contributions describe selected methods—for example, photo archiving or photo interpretation. Most chapters reconstruct photo practices in everyday life (i. e. the work of photo studios in department stores or sanatoriums) or present the results of photo analyses (e. g., family photo albums, photo collections of companies, or photo contributions of magazine readers). The book covers a whole conference and delivers 21 exciting, but fairly heterogeneous chapters; it would have benefited from a tighter structure.

50|$|Inorganic {{semiconductor}} nanoparticles used in hybrid cells include CdSe (size {{ranges from}} 6-20 nm), ZnO, TiO, and PbS. Common polymers used as <b>photo</b> <b>materials</b> have extensive conjugation {{and are also}} hydrophobic. Their efficiency as a photo-material {{is affected by the}} HOMO level position and the ionization potential, which directly affects the open circuit voltage and the stability in air. The most common polymers used are P3HT (poly (3-hexylthiophene)), and M3H-PPV (poly5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-p-phenylenevinylene)). P3HT has a bandgap of 2.1 eV and M3H-PPV has a bandgap of ~2.4 eV. These values correspond with the bandgap of CdSe, 2.10 eV. The electron affinity of CdSe ranges from 4.4 to 4.7 eV. When the polymer used is MEH-PPV, which has an electron affinity of 3.0 eV, the difference between the electron affinities is large enough to drive electron transfer from the CdSe to the polymer. CdSe also has a high electron mobility (600 cm2·V−1·s−1).|$|R
