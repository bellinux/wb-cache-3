40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} simulation of gas flow and reactive species distribution in a <b>parallel-plate</b> single-wafer isothermal <b>reactor</b> was conducted. The oxygen plasma etching of polymer under high pressure (- 1 torr), high fre-quency (13. 56 MHz) conditions {{was chosen as}} a model system for analysis with emphasis on chemical etching. Etching rate and uniformity were examined {{as a function of}} reactor geometry and operating conditions. A maximum in etching rate with flow rate was observed, and this maximum shifted to higher flow rates as the power increased. The pressure de-pendence of the etching rate was complex, but in genera] a broad maximum in etching rate with pressure xisted, which shifted to higher pressures as the flow rate increased. Etching rate increased but etching uniformity degraded as the wafer reactivity increased. A shower adius at least equal to the wafer radius, and a plasma radius slightly greater than the wafer radius were found to give the best etching rate and uniformity results under the conditions examined. Two novel reactor designs were also studied, namely, a reactor with a graded gas velocity at the shower, and a pulsed-plasma reactor. When compared to the conventional reactor, the new designs can yield improved uniformity and etching rate (the etching rate of the pulsed-plasma reactor was prorated by the duty cycle). Plasma-assisted etching and deposition of thin films using reactive gas glow discharges is currently in wide...|$|R
40|$|Apresentação em posterCapacitively coupled {{radio-frequency}} (ccrf) discharges in N 2 -H 2 mixtures {{are becoming}} increasingly popular. Discharges operated in mixtures of hydrogen and nitrogen are nowadays used {{as a source of}} active species for various kinds of applications from etching of low-k materials to modifications of polymer surfaces for biomedical applications. Moreover, these discharges are also being used for studies of planetary atmospheres. This work presents the modelling of 13. 56 MHz ccrf discharges in N 2 -H 2 mixtures, produced within a cylindrical <b>parallel-plate</b> <b>reactor</b> (with 69 mm radius and 33 mm inter-electrode distance), similar to a GEC reference cell surrounded by a lateral grounded grid, for pressures from 0. 2 to 1. 5 mbar and RF coupled powers up to 30 W. Simulations use a 2 D (r, z) time-dependent fluid-type code to describe the transport of electrons and positive ions in the reactor under study, coupled to a very complete 0 D kinetic code for the nitrogen-hydrogen mixture. The fluid code solves the charged particle continuity and momentum transfer equations, the electron mean energy transport equations, and Poisson's equation for the rf electric potential. The kinetic code solves the electron Boltzmann equation and the rate balance equations of vibrational excited states and electronic excited states of the N 2 and H 2 molecules, yielding a set of electron transport parameters and rate coefficients for the processes involved in the charged particle production and destruction. The latter include (i) electron-impact ionisation from ground-state; (ii) electron-impact ionisation and associative ionisation involving excited states; (iii) ion conversion; and (iv) electron recombination with ions. The electron parameters are used within the fluid code, allowing for a self-consistent solution to the charged particle transport model by adopting the local mean energy approximation. Model results are systematically compared to measurements of the self-bias potential, the effective rf power (accounting for circuit losses), the average electron density (obtained by resonant-cavity measurements), and the intensities of radiative transitions with the nitrogen SPS and with atomic lines emitted by argon traces (obtained by Optical Emission Spectroscopy diagnostics) ...|$|E
40|$|Three novel {{diagnostic}} {{techniques were}} developed for plasma-enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} (PECVD), {{an important step in}} integrated-circuit manufacture. Results are presented for the deposition of amorphous hydrocarbon films from methane-argon plasmas. The plasma was formed between the powered and grounded electrodes of a 13. 56 -MHz <b>parallel-plate</b> <b>reactor.</b> A 5 -to- 1 mixture of methane/argon was fed to the reactor at 15, 30, 60, or 90 sccm. Pressure was held at either 0. 1 or 0. 5 torr, while rf power was set at 25, 50, 75, or 100 W. ^ The three diagnostic techniques used were molecular-beam mass spectrometry, microprobe mass spectrometry, and Langmuir probing. Molecular-beam mass spectrometry was used to measure stable and radical species concentrations at a fixed point on the grounded electrode. Mole-fraction measurements were made for nine stable (CH 4, H 2, C 2 H 2, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 4, C 3 H 6, C 3 H 8, and Ar) and three radical species (H, CH 2, and CH 3); upper-bound estimates were made for five additional radical species (CH, C 2 H, C 2 H 3, C 2 H 5, C 3 H 3). By applying microprobe mass spectrometry, distinctive in the study of plasma chemistry, detailed one- and two-dimensional spatial profiles of stable species (CH 4, H 2, C 2 H 2, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6, and Ar) were measured. Particular interest was focused on the entrance region. Langmuir probing was used to determine one-dimensional profiles of electron-energy distribution functions (eedfs). From the measured eedfs, electron densities and average electron energies were determined; furthermore, dissociation rate constants were calculated by integrating the product of the eedf and the dissociation cross section. ^ Rate and rate-constant information were analyzed and correlated. By applying a transport analysis to the axial-centerline microprobe data, spatial rates of convection, diffusion, and reaction were determined. By using electron-density and electron energy profiles along with the reaction-rate profiles, energy-dependent rate constants were determined. A CSTR analysis was applied to bulk-plasma measurements to determine rate coefficients, and the results were compared to the transport-analyzed rate constants. Using a 23 factorially designed experiment, the effect of operating conditions (pressure, rf power, and flowrate) on the plasma chemistry and the deposition rate was explored. ...|$|E

L'ETUDE DE LA DECHARGE Y EST MENEE SUR UNE GAMME ETENDUE DE FREQUENCES D'EXCITATION, DE PRESSIONS DU GAZ ET DE TENSIONS RF APPLIQUEES. UN BON ACCORD EST OBSERVE ENTRE LES PREVISIONS DU MODELE ET LES MESURES EXPERIMENTALES DU POTENTIEL PLASMA ET DE LA PUISSANCE ELECTRIQUE COUPLEE AU PLASMA.

THIS WORK PRESENTS THE MODELLING AND THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CAPACITIVELY-COUPLED RADIO- FREQUENCY DISCHARGES IN HYDROGEN, PRODUCED WITHIN A CYLINDRICAL <b>PARALLEL-PLATE</b> <b>REACTOR.</b> THE DISCHARGE CHARACTERIZATION COVERED A WIDE RANGE OF EXCITATION FREQUENCIES (13, 56 - 80. 0 MHZ). GAS PRESSURES (0. 2 - 6 TORR) AND APPLIED RF VOLTAGES (50 - 800 V), AND USED A STATE OF ART TWO-DIMENSIONAL FLUID MODEL (TO DESCRIBE THE DYNAMICS OF ELECTRONS, POSITIVE IONS H+, H 2 +, H 3 + AND NEGATIVE ION H- IN THE REACTOR), SELF-CONSISTENTLY COUPLED TO A HOMOGENEOUS COLLISIONAL-RADIATIVE MODEL FOR HYDROGEN (INCLUDING A VERY COMPLETE KINETIC SCHEME INVOLVING VIBRATIONALLY EXCITED MOLECULAR SPECIES AND ELECTRONICALLY EXCITED ATOMIC SPECIES). THERE IS A GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN CALCULATED RESULTS AND EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS FOR THE COUPLED ELECTRICAL POWER AND THE PLASMA POTENTIAL. HOWEVER, MODEL PREDICTIONS FOR THE ELECTRON DENSITY AND THE SELF-BIAS VOLTAGE SHOW ONLY A QUALITATIVE AGREEMENT WITH EXPERIMENT, WITH CALCULATED VALUES UNDERSTIMATED WITH RESPECT TO MEASUREMENTS. THIS QUALITATIVE DISAGREEMENT IS ONLY SLIGHTLY DEPENDENT OF THE KINETIC SCHEME ADOPTED, AND PROBABLY IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE HOMOGENOUS MODEL DESCRIBING THE TRANSPORT OF NEUTRAL SPECIES. TO CLARIFY THIS, A TWO-DIMENSIONAL HYDRODYNAMIC GAS MODEL IS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION SYSTEM PLUS A MULTICOMPONENT REACTIVE MASS TRANSPORT MODULE. THIS INNOVATIVE MODEL IS THE KEY PART OF A POWERFUL PREDICTIVE TOOL, TO BE USED IN THE OPTIMISATION OF PLASMA REACTORS FOR MATERIAL PROCESSING.
