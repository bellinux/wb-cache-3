40|$|Abstract Background Current Canadian {{evidence}} {{illustrating the}} health benefits and cost-effectiveness of caregiver-friendly workplace policies is needed if Canadian employers are to adopt and integrate caregiver-friendly workplace policies into their employment practices. The goal of this three-year, three study research project is to provide such evidence for the auto manufacturing and educational services sectors. The research questions being addressed are: What are the impacts for employers (economic) and workers (health) of caregiver-friendly workplace <b>policy</b> <b>intervention(s)</b> for full-time caregiver-employees? What are the impacts for employers, workers and society of the caregiver-friendly workplace <b>policy</b> <b>intervention(s)</b> in each participating workplace? What contextual factors impact the successful implementation of caregiver-friendly workplace <b>policy</b> <b>intervention(s)</b> ? Methods Using a pre-post-test comparative case study design, Study A will determine the effectiveness of newly implemented caregiver-friendly workplace <b>policy</b> <b>intervention(s)</b> across two workplaces to determine impacts on caregiver-employee health. A quasi-experimental pre-post design will allow the caregiver-friendly workplace <b>policy</b> <b>intervention(s)</b> to be tested with respect to potential impacts on health, and specifically on caregiver employee mental, psychosocial, and physical health. Framed within a comparative case study design, Study B will utilize cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis approaches to evaluate the economic impacts of the caregiver-friendly workplace <b>policy</b> <b>intervention(s)</b> {{for each of the}} two participating workplaces. Framed within a comparative case study design, Study C will undertake an implementation analysis of the caregiver-friendly workplace <b>policy</b> <b>intervention(s)</b> in each participating workplace in order to determine: the degree of support for the intervention(s) (reflected in the workplace culture); how sex and gender are implicated; co-workers’ responses to the chosen intervention(s), and; other nuances at play. It is hypothesized that the benefits of the caregiver-friendly workplace <b>policy</b> <b>intervention(s)</b> will include improvements in caregiver-employees’ mental, psychosocial and physical health, as well as evidence of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness for the employer. Discussion The expected project results will provide the research evidence for extensive knowledge translation work, to be carried out in collaboration with our knowledge transition partners, to the employer/human resources and occupational health/safety target populations.

40|$|Increases in the {{prevalence}} of obesity have led to calls for <b>policy</b> <b>interventions</b> in the United Kingdom.

Results suggested that support for <b>policy</b> <b>interventions</b> was greatest when responsibility was attributed to factors beyond individual control, with support for child-focused interventions particularly high.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of institutional and <b>policy</b> <b>interventions</b> on reducing the rate of cesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR) in Wenzhou, China. Institutional interventions included health education, painless delivery introduction, and doula care. Additionally, a series of health policies were developed by the Chinese central and local governments to control cesarean section rates, mostly through controlling CDMR rates. We conducted a pre-/post-intervention study using 131, 312 deliveries between 2006 and 2014 in three tertiary-level public hospitals in Wenzhou, China. Chi-square tests and predictive models were used to examine changes in the CDMR rate before and after institutional and <b>policy</b> <b>interventions.</b> After institutional interventions were introduced, the overall CDMR rate increased from 15. 76 % to 16. 34 % (p = 0. 053), but the average annual growth rate (AAGR) of the overall CDMR rate quickly declined from 20. 11 % to - 4. 30 %. After <b>policy</b> <b>interventions</b> were introduced, the overall CDMR rate, the AAGR of the overall CDMR rate, and the probability of performing CDMR declined. Further, the overall probability of a woman undergoing CDMR decreased in all three age groups (group one: 34) after institutional and <b>policy</b> <b>interventions.</b> These results show that institutional and <b>policy</b> <b>interventions</b> can reduce the CDMR rate.
