25|$|Although Hill is {{not well}} known in the United States, he has become a celebrity in China as chief envoy in talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that during {{negotiations}} Hill speaks every morning and evening to the media and has an easygoing manner, while his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye Gwan, gives only occasional media access.|$|E
25|$|If the MBS was not {{underwritten by}} the {{original}} real estate and the issuer's guarantee, the rating of the bonds would be much lower. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the expected adverse selection against borrowers with improving credit (from MBSs pooled by initial credit quality) who would {{have an incentive to}} refinance (ultimately joining an MBS pool with a higher credit rating).|$|E
25|$|Counties {{have since}} {{gone out of}} use in Australia, and are rarely used or even known {{by most of the}} {{population}} today. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that counties are based on the size of land, rather than population, so in a large country where most of the population live in cities on the coast while the countryside has a very low population density, they have little relevance. The counties which contain the capital cities have millions of people, while those in remote areas have a very small population. The County of Adelaide, for instance, has a larger population than all the other counties in South Australia combined. Another reason {{is that many of the}} counties' borders follow rivers, having been proclaimed before settlements developed, which means that towns which typically grow up on rivers often find themselves in more than one county. Wangaratta, for instance, is located at the junction of the Ovens and King rivers, and is thus in three counties; Moira, Delatite and Bogong.|$|E
50|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{humor in}} the series comes from Dr. Kiwi's pedophilia, as he {{demonstrates}} an attraction to 13-year-old Patti. This subtext may be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> show was never sold internationally.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{suspected}} <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> Hygge is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> Danes and other Scandinavians score high on happiness.|$|R
50|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for <b>the</b> large fall {{in revenue}} after 2005 {{is due to}} <b>the</b> {{divestiture}} <b>of</b> assets such as Clearwater Paper.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> {{the feeling}} between {{contract}} servicemen, conscripts, and officers.|$|E
2500|$|The church {{architecture}} of Cornwall and Devon typically {{differs from that}} of the rest of southern England: most medieval churches in the larger parishes were rebuilt in the later medieval period with one or two aisles and a western tower, the aisles being the same width as the nave and the piers of the arcades being of one of a few standard types. Wagon roofs often survive in these churches. The typical tower is of three stages, often with buttresses set back from the angles. Only a few Cornish church towers are beautiful or striking, the majority are plain and dull. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the shortage of good building stone in the county. The arcades of those churches with aisles generally have piers of one of three different types: Type A [...] "consists of four attached shafts in the main axes and four hollows in the diagonals"; Type B which seems to have been in use earlier has [...] "square piers with four attached demi-shafts"; or octagonal piers. Type A is very common in both Devon and Cornwall.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, Jakala said [...] "the {{series has}} grown on [...] over time. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that Hidaka isn't just writing about dry {{political}} {{systems in the}} abstract; he humanizes concepts by crafting various characters that we follow through the tumultuous events depicted in this book." [...] Both Jakala and McElhatton highlighted and praised the fact that although Sakuragi is depicted as [...] "handsome, suave, and poised" [...] (Jakala), [...] "decisive, smart, and charismatic" [...] (McElhatton), [...] "Yoshiki remembers to keep his character human; he's got his flaws, and his doubts that he hides from the public. In the end, it just makes him all the more likable" [...] (McElhatton). In Jakala's opinion, [...] "One of the strongest things about this series is Sakuragi's character" [...] because [...] "Hidaka hasn't gone too far in making Sakuragi unbelievably perfect". In opposition, Jason Thompson, writing for ANN, considered the depiction of [...] "a badass Japanese politician, who stands up to America, China and North Korea, more comedic than believable." ...|$|E
50|$|Red Bull Driver Search {{formally}} concluded on 17 October 2005. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> {{it concluded}} is because Speed successfully {{made it to}} Formula One.|$|R
50|$|Creeggan {{was born}} in Scarborough, Ontario. His mother taught piano lessons to {{neighborhood}} children, which Creeggan credits as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for his interest in music.|$|R
50|$|Before long, {{however, the}} CIA was {{training}} Cuban guerillas. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> Bay <b>of</b> Pigs Invasion operation failed was disagreement between senior military {{people and the}} CIA paramilitary staff about what was necessary for an invasion to work; there were also pure political issues that helped doom it.|$|R
5000|$|Eastman {{has said}} of his own work [...] "Part {{of the reason for}} making (in fact a very large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason)</b> <b>is</b> to see things that I have never seen before - to build {{something}} that I can not fully understand or explain." ...|$|E
5000|$|The entry {{list for}} this race {{consisted}} of 46 cars, the lowest number for any NEXTEL Cup race this year. [...] <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that Front Row Motorsports has suspended operations and closed its #37 team. That team made {{only three of}} 24 races during the season and had no continuing sponsorship. (Yum! Brands sponsored select races.) ...|$|E
50|$|Although Hill is {{not well}} known in the United States, he has become a celebrity in China as chief envoy in talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that during {{negotiations}} Hill speaks every morning and evening to the media and has an easygoing manner, while his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye Gwan, gives only occasional media access.|$|E
50|$|Her {{character}} is perhaps <b>the</b> root <b>of</b> her daughter's cool and dangerous outlook, and is certainly <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> Peter Burns becomes engaged to Cynthia, mainly out of sympathy.|$|R
50|$|Indian {{gambling}} {{has been}} the source and focus of a great deal <b>of</b> controversy. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> {{for this is the}} ambiguity that surrounds tribal sovereignty in the legal sense.|$|R
50|$|Hammond {{continued}} to play Trump for <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season. Killam's contract was terminated early after that season, with some news sources alleging that being replaced as Trump was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|R
50|$|If the MBS was not {{underwritten by}} the {{original}} real estate and the issuer's guarantee, the rating of the bonds would be much lower. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the expected adverse selection against borrowers with improving credit (from MBSs pooled by initial credit quality) who would {{have an incentive to}} refinance (ultimately joining an MBS pool with a higher credit rating).|$|E
50|$|The crater's name is {{currently}} informal and not {{recognized by the}} International Astronomical Union (IAU), although nearly all the other features within the Taurus-Littrow valley that were named by the astronauts are. Possibly <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that the IAU recognizes the larger lunar crater Henry. The crater was named by the astronauts after the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator.|$|E
50|$|The unionization {{rate in the}} U.S. and Canada {{followed}} fairly similar paths from 1920 to the mid-1960s; both {{peaked at}} about 30%. However the U.S. rate declined steadily after 1974 to 12% in 2011. Meanwhile, the Canadian rate dropped from 37% the mid-1980s to 30% in 2010. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the different mixture of industry, and part is due to more favourable Canadian laws.|$|E
50|$|Dietary {{factors may}} be only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for health {{benefits}} gained by certain Mediterranean cultures. Physically active lifestyle, lower body mass index, cessation of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption also may contribute.|$|R
50|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>the</b> Narrows are so notable {{is because}} they have a {{downward}} gradient of over 100 feet per mile. <b>The</b> entire section <b>of</b> river is about 3 miles in length.|$|R
50|$|Outside battle, {{the player}} gets to control Hawke's interactions. When a dialog occurs, the player gets {{to choose what}} Hawke asks or answers. Dragon Age II {{features}} a fully voiced Hawke, (which is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> main character's race is fixed) and a new dialog wheel based on the dialog system from the Mass Effect series.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of {{building on a}} slipway is dying out with the increasing size of vessels from about the 1970s. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the space requirement for slowing and maneuvering the vessel immediately after it has left the slipway, but {{the sheer size of}} the vessel causes design problems, since the hull is basically supported only at its end points during the launch process and this imposes stresses not met during normal operation.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to get an account of redemption rates from most rebate companies, partly due to a reluctance {{on the part of}} rebate fulfillment houses to release confidential business information. Among different sources, radically different numbers on both ends of the spectrum can be cited. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that most [...] "redemption rates" [...] do not distinguish whether they are calculated as part of total sales or incremental sales.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> {{the feeling}} between {{contract}} servicemen, conscripts, and officers. [...] There is no relationship of mutual respect between leaders and led {{and it is}} difficult to see how a professional army can be created without one...at the moment 2002officers often despise contract servicemen even more than conscripts. Contract soldiers serving in Chechnya and other [...] "hot spots" [...] are often called mercenaries and marauders by senior officers. Michael Orr ...|$|E
500|$|The {{terrorist}} threat level in Great Britain was upgraded to [...] "substantial" [...] on 11 May 2016, with the New IRA's continuing threats being <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> by Home Secretary Theresa May and MI5.|$|R
50|$|On May 24, 2006, Hecatomb was discontinued. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's {{designers}} has unofficially cited <b>the</b> {{rising cost}} <b>of</b> oil (used in <b>the</b> manufacture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plastic cards) as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for <b>the</b> discontinuation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for <b>the</b> move may {{be because}} the site was {{considered}} for a casino before the deal between the Kutsher family and the St. Regis Mohawks was cancelled in favor of another site.|$|R
50|$|Emmett {{realizes that}} he has no {{recognizable}} stakes in the game, so he bullies Ann into marrying him. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that Ann's father has been considering putting her in a mental hospital to sweep her out of the way for a while, because he is under investigation for war profiteering, and because her father believes she did kill the pilot in Chicago, even though the police have reluctantly stated she is in the clear. By marrying her, Emmett can prevent Ann from being tucked away in a quiet corner and forgotten.|$|E
5000|$|Ashe {{began working}} as a {{stripper}} in Seattle. Never finishing high school, she started stripping {{at the age of}} seventeen using a fake ID. [...] In an interview, Ashe once explained her career choice: [...] "I guess I'm an exhibitionist. But that's not quite true. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that I developed huge breasts at an early age and breasts are a very sexualized thing. At an early age I was getting a lot of sexualized attention. Eventually, I just felt that stripping kind of put all that stuff out on the table." ...|$|E
5000|$|After Trump {{was elected}} President, Coulter created a {{spreadsheet}} {{of companies that}} do business with Trump family members and distributed the information online and via social media. The sheet also provides alternatives to stores on the boycott list, and has contact information so that consumers can [...] "express their outrage." [...] #GrabYourWallet as a movement grew larger after the election. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that the campaign {{became part of the}} broader anti-Trump movement. Working on the campaign has almost become a full time job for Coulter.|$|E
50|$|Mapperley Tunnel was {{extremely}} unstable due to mining subsidence {{and the heavy}} traffic through it. In 1925 <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof collapsed, blocking the line, and this was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that this section of line closed prematurely.|$|R
25|$|Harburg {{stated in}} 1960 {{that he was}} told <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> it was so {{difficult}} to get a film version made was Hollywood was scared of fantasy musicals. Another <b>reason</b> was <b>the</b> McCarthyism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period.|$|R
25|$|Zhou {{argued that}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for <b>the</b> {{original}} Bretton Woods system breaking down was {{the refusal to}} adopt Keynes' bancor {{which would have been}} a special international reserve currency to be used instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dollar.|$|R
