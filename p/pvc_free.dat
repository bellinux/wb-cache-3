40|$|In the {{previously}} described model of interpreting the numerous {{results in the}} switching states of the conduction in the films of PVC composites [1, 2] was noted the need to involve hopping mechanism and percolation theory to explain the phenomenon of giant jumps conductivity, just as was done for the interpretation of such jumps for disordered semiconductor films. It was also shown that to explain the totality of spontaneous and stimulated transitions between states of the conduction in PVC composites requires {{the existence of an}} internal process that is able to produce a fixed observable current - voltage delay and switching electrical conductivity levels lifetime. In this paper one of the possible relaxation processes that lead to the emergence of the delay time, and the occurrence of spontaneous and stimulated transitions sample conductivity of nanocomposites PVC is presented. In particular, as a mechanism for determining time delay and lifetimes of the conduction states the reaction of dehydrochlorination is proposed, which should be reversible in case when HCl molecules separated from macromolecule physically can not "travel" far from "their place" in the macromolecule, as it just takes place within a local <b>PVC</b> <b>free</b> volume. In a frame of developed model all previously observed and called "anomalous" electrical phenomena receive a reasonable and predictable behavior. Comment: 6 p, 1 fi...|$|E
40|$|Blends of Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) /Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) /Polystyrene (PS) of {{different}} compositions were prepared by solution casting technique. The blends were characterized using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Positron Lifetime Spectroscopy. DSC data {{were found to}} be inadequate to describe whether PMMA/PVC blends are miscible or not, possibly because of the small gap in their glass transition temperatures. On the other hand, PVC/PS blends were clearly found to be immiscible by DSC. FTIR results for PMMA/PVC indicate the possible interactions between the carbonyl group of PMMA and a-hydrogen of <b>PVC.</b> <b>Free</b> volume data derived from Positron lifetime measurements showed that the PMMA/PVC blends to be miscible in low PVC concentration domain. For the first time, the authors have evaluated the hydrodynamic interaction parameter a, advocated by Wolf and Schnell, Polymer, 42, 8599 (2001), {{to take into account the}} friction between the component molecules using the free volume data. This parameter (a) has a high value (- 57) at 10 wt% of PVC, which could be taken to read miscibility for PMMA/PVC blends to be high. In the case of PVC/PS blends, the positron results fully support the DSC data to conclude the blends to be immiscible throughout the range of concentration. As expected, the hydrodynamic interaction parameter a does not show any change throughout the concentration in PVC/PS blends, further supporting the idea that a is another suitable parameter in the miscibility study of polymer blends...|$|E

40|$|As a {{guide for}} {{adhesion}} development between two miscible polymers, interdiffusion of these polymers was studied using external reflection and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. Using gold substrates coated with a double layer of PMMA and PVC, and s-polarized infrared light, PMMA features in the external reflection spectra increase upon annealing at 150 °C {{as a result of}} PMMA diffusion away from the gold substrate into regions with a higher electric field intensity. Interdiffusion can also be followed with an external reflection set-up using glass substrates and p-polarized infrared light. Interdiffusion of <b>PVC</b> and PMMA, <b>free</b> or grafted on a glass slide, was observed. Increasing the molecular weight of the PMMA slows down the interdiffusion rate, which might be a consequence of a reduction in the thermodynamic driving force for diffusion or the molecular weight of PMMA. External reflection spectroscopy as well as attenuated total reflection experiments show that interdiffusion of PVC and PMMA grafted on a silicon slide was much slower than that of free PMMA of similar molecular weight. ...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY To {{define the}} prevalence, {{frequency}} {{and characteristics of}} premature ventricular complexes (<b>PVCs)</b> in adults <b>free</b> of recognizable heart disease, we performed 24 -hour ambulatory electrocardiography on 101 subjects (51 men and 50 women, mean age 48. 8 years) in whom physical examination, chest x-ray, ECG, echocardiogram, maximal exercise stress test, right- and left-heart catheterization and coronary arteriog-raphy were normal. Thirty-nine subjects had at least 1 PVC/ 24 hours, but only four had more than 100 PVCs/ 24 hours and fewer than five had more than five PVCs in any given hour. The probability of having at least 1 PVC/ 24 hours increased with age (chi square = 11. 789, p = 0. 019). The number of PVCs/ 24 hours was also positively associated with age (r- 0. 33, p = 0. 001). There was no consistent relationship between the presence or number of PVCs/ 24 hours and sex, blood pressure, weight, height, body mass index, serum potas-sium or calcium, cholesterol and triglyceride, hemoglobin, the ingestion of coffee, tea or alcohol, and cigarette smoking. Four subjects had multiform PVCs, two of whom had early PVCs.

40|$|The need {{to enhance}} and reuse {{existing}} materials on secondary sources of metals has had quite {{an impact in}} recent times. Several processes and technologies had being studied for recovery of raw materials from industrial waste generated. This study focuses {{on the possibility of}} waste reducing, from the galvanic floor covering industry, with the aim of obtaining micro or nano-particles of nickel or a nickel based alloy. Sludges from one galvanic treatment plant were used as base material in two conditions: as produced and after a hydrometallurgical treatment for metal concentration. Several reducing agents were used in this study: a synthesis gas from a polymer pyrolysis and solid polymer agents (PVC, HDPE and PP residues). Obtained products were characterised in terms of metallic particles production during the reduction treatment and by SEM/EDS analysis on the final products. A simultaneous differential thermal and thermogravimetric equipment (DSC/TGA) was used {{for the study of the}} reduction process with a reduction gas obtained from the pyrolysis of chlorine <b>free</b> <b>PVC</b> derived char. The obtained results show that it is possible to obtain small metallic particles, in the range of 60 to 240 nm, at 800 ºC. Reduction tests, by the use of a solid residue, were made in a laboratorial furnace with two independent heating zones. Best results were obtained with de-chlorinated PVC as a reduction agent with the production of metallic particles, in the range of 150 to 600 nm, at 800 ºC. For all the tested conditions the metallic particles were constituted by Ni and Cu with variable chemical composition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, {{catheter}} ablation {{has increasingly}} {{been used for}} ablation of idiopathic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or ventricular tachycardias (IVTs). However, the mapping and catheter ablation of the arrhythmias originating from the vicinity of tricuspid annulus (TA) may not be fully understood. This study aimed to investigate electrophysiologic characteristics and effects of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for patients with symptomatic PVCs and IVTs originating from the vicinity of TA. Methods Characteristics of body surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrophysiologic recordings were analyzed in 35 patients with symptomatic PVCs/ IVTs originating from the vicinity of TA. RFCA was performed using pace mapping and activation mapping. Results Among the 35 patients with PVCs/IVTs arising from the vicinity of TA, complete elimination of PVCs/IVTs could be achieved by RFCA in 32 patients (success rate 91. 43 %) during a median follow-up period of 21 [*]months. PVCs/IVTs originating from the vicinity of TA had distinctive ECG characteristics that were useful for identifying the precise origin. An rS pattern was recorded in lead V 1 in 93. 1 % of patients with PVCs/IVTs from the free wall of TA, vs 16. 7 % of patients with PVCs/IVTs from the septal TA, whereas a QS pattern in lead V 1 occurred in 83. 3 % of patients with PVCs/IVTs from the septal TA vs 6. 9 % of patients with <b>PVCs</b> from the <b>free</b> wall of the TA. The precordial R wave transition occurred by lead V 3 or earlier in all patients with PVCs/IVTs originating from the septal portion of the TA, as compared to transition beyond V 3 in all patients with PVCs/IVTs from the free wall of the TA. Conclusions RFCA is an effective curative therapy for symptomatic PVCs/IVTs originating from the vicinity of TA. There are specific characteristics in ECG and the ablation site could be located by ECG analysis. </p...|$|R
