40|$|Bi 2 Te 3 {{polycrystalline}} whiskers {{consisting of}} interconnected nanoplates have been synthesized through chemical transformation from In 2 Te 3 <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>whisker</b> templates assembled by nanoparticles. The synthesized Bi 2 Te 3 whiskers preserve the original one-dimensional morphology of the In 2 Te 3, while the In 2 Te 3 nanoparticles {{can be transformed}} into the Bi 2 Te 3 thin nanoplates, accompanied by the formation of high-density interfaces between nanoplates. The hot-pressed nanostructures consolidated from Bi 2 Te 3 polycrystalline whiskers at 400 Â°C demonstrate a promising figure of merit (ZT) of 0. 71 at 400 K, which {{can be attributed to}} their low thermal conductivity and relatively high electrical conductivity. The small nanoparticles inherited from the polycrystalline whiskers and high-density nanoparticle interfaces in the hot-pressed nanostructures contribute to the significant reduction of thermal conductivity. This study provides a rational chemical transformation approach to design and synthesize polycrystalline microstructures for enhanced thermoelectric performances...|$|E
40|$|High {{strength}} {{metal whiskers}} {{have a larger}} versatile field of application than monocrystalline <b>whiskers.</b> Although <b>polycrystalline</b> metal <b>whiskers</b> {{can be used for}} composites, preferably by extrusion in thermoplastics or by infiltration of resins or metals into whisker networks, the chief application at present may be the production and various use of whisker networks. Such networks can be produced up to high degrees of porosity and besides high mechanical strength, they have high inside surfaces and high electric conductivity. There are for instance, applications concerning construction of electrodes for batteries and fuel cells, catalysts and also new heat-exchanger material, capable of preparing fuel oil and gasoline in order to assist a high-efficiency combustion. The technical application of <b>polycrystalline</b> metal <b>whiskers</b> require their modification as well as the construction of a pilot production unit...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in development of reinforcing agents which combine high strength and stiffness with low density and good thermal resistance. Status of work carried out on the use of single crystal <b>whiskers,</b> <b>polycrystalline</b> fibers and single crystal flakes as reinforcing materials is dis-cussed. Progress made on incorporating these various types of reinforcing agents into composites is reviewed. Whiskers are shown to have considerable potential but because of subcriti-cal length and low strength poor translation of properties has been reported. Continuous filaments of boron and graphite ap-pear to provide the most immediate opportunity for develop-ment of high performance composites. However, eventually it appears that single crystal flakes will provide the greatest advantage because of their tendency to reinforce in the planar direction. For high temperature application composites rein-forced with boron nitride or carbon fiber are the most promising...|$|R
