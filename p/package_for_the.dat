5|$|Rieber has {{suggested}} a <b>package</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> politicians, {{where he would}} create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the route length traveled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion—Trygve Bratteli commenting {{that even though the}} financing was private, it would still have to use the same funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the Nordland Line.|$|E

5|$|Criterion and EA officially {{announced}} their partnership for Burnout 3: Takedown in March 2004. The game was showcased at several trade shows throughout the year, including E3. Burnout 3: Takedown released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles on 8 September 2004 in North America, and 10 September 2004 in Europe. In Japan, the game released on 14 October 2004 {{and was only}} available on the PlayStation 2. The PlayStation 2 version of the game included a demo for EA's , which was scheduled to launch a month after Burnout 3.

5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but without compromising the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive <b>package</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic <b>package</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning vanes to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over the rear wheels and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E
