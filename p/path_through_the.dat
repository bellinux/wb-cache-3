5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois. The Iroquois lived in long houses, {{primarily}} {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. They and other tribes used the Pine Creek <b>Path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there. They used the <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it, including one just north of the park near what is now the village of Ansonia. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).|$|E

Later, Isair and Madae locate the group with information from Nym. They state their intention to attack Kuldahar, and warn the group to not interfere. The group then passes through the Black Raven Monastery to enter the Underdark. After exiting the Underdark, they are flown to Kuldahar by Oswald Fiddlebender.|$|E

5|$|Chaltin's column {{advanced}} north {{with the}} Nile river protecting his right flank and the Azande cavalry contingent on his left. At seven o'clock, Belgian scouts sighted the two-thousand strong Mahdist force assembled along a two-mile line that spanned {{a range of}} hills between the Nile and a parallel river. There was one clear <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hills, which was especially well defended. Commandant Chaltin brought forward five companies for the attack, leaving his remaining three in reserve.|$|E

Similar cracks were found on the wing root fittings of another Martin 2-0-2 aircraft that flew the same flight <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> same storm shortly after Flight 421. October inspections of three other Martin 2-0-2 aircraft revealed identical fatigue cracks in similar locations.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{countries}} {{felt the}} effects of Hurricane Dean as its <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean Sea claimed 42lives. The hurricane first brushed the Lesser Antilles on August 17, 2007, and as it passed through {{the interior of the}} Caribbean its outer rain bands swept over the Greater Antilles. It passed Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane, and strengthened to a Category5 storm as it made landfall on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 21. A second landfall on August 22 was less devastating.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Joan's <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} Caribbean in late October {{was highly}} unusual. Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern {{portion of the}} Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took the southernmost path of a tropical cyclone since a June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of Joan's. Joan-Miriam was also unusual in that it survived passage from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. Only seven other storms {{have been known to}} survive the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{gameplay}} of Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth comprises unarmed {{escape and}} evasion together with investigative exploration, although first-person shooter (FPS) style combat is introduced later on. As with most survival horror video games, ammunition is limited {{and must be}} conserved carefully for situations when it will really be indispensable, occasionally requiring the player to avoid combat even when armed. The game {{as a whole is}} heavily scripted and very linear, with only one <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> chapters from start to finish, in contrast with some earlier survival horror games such as the original Alone in the Dark (which itself was inspired by the Mythos).|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 1942, {{during the}} Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury {{was one of}} the few {{survivors}} of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his Bren gun from the hip, he cleared a <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then seen to fall, shot by a Japanese sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.|$|E

5|$|On July 4, 1879, the {{settlement}} of Independence was established {{just west of the}} pass, taking its name from the Independence Day holiday, and soon lending it to the pass among other natural features in the area. Independence's gold deposits were quickly opened by miners. By the following year the Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company had improved the <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> pass, which followed a route close to Highway 82's present alignment, to the point that horses could make the trip.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{was split}} into two parts. The first group, composed of around eight hundred colonial troops and led by Commandant Louis-Napoléon Chaltin, {{was to take the}} main road towards Rejaf and engage the rebels openly. The second, under Belgian war hero Baron Dhanis, was a much larger force of over three-thousand men, mostly natives from the Tetela ethnic group, and was to take a treacherous <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> jungle to the north. Both expeditions left for the Lado Enclave in December 1896.|$|E

The deer park contains notable herds of rare White Park cattle and fallow deer. A small garden behind the house, overlooking the deer park, Moorish in style with a central fountain, has been restored to its former glory. Brown's beech clumps survive in the present day.|$|E

5|$|The hurricane's intense winds, waves, {{rains and}} storm surge were {{responsible}} for at least 45deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US$1.66billion. First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Dean's <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean devastated agricultural crops, particularly those of Martinique and Jamaica. Upon reaching Mexico, Hurricane Dean was a Category5 storm, but it missed major population centers and its exceptional Category5 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the Caribbean islands it passed as a Category2 storm.|$|E

The house is {{described}} as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|Across Florida, damage totaled $27.75million (1950USD), {{of which}} $15million {{was in the}} Miami {{metropolitan}} area. The hurricane damaged 20,861houses in southern Florida, 580 of them severely. Additionally, 248trailer homes were damaged, 188 of them severely. A total of 248houses or trailers were destroyed in the Miami area. A preliminary survey indicated there were about 2,000store windows that were broken during the storm. In West Hollywood, a town of 2,000people located north of Miami, strong winds destroyed or severely damaged about 150houses, leaving hundreds homeless. At the Broward County airport in Fort Lauderdale, the winds damaged 55buildings and destroyed one plane. Further north, damage was lighter in Palm Beach, consisting of downed trees and flooded streets. Along its <b>path</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> state, strong winds were observed around Lake Okeechobee, with a 93mph (150km/h) gust in Clewiston. In Orlando, the winds destroyed the roof of an airport hangar.|$|E
