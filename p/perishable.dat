5|$|According to {{accounts}} from his life, he preached {{the importance of}} realization of the self, and criticized love towards <b>perishable</b> things. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to the God and guru. He {{stressed the importance of}} surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.|$|E
5|$|All {{vegetables}} {{benefit from}} proper post harvest care. A {{large proportion of}} vegetables and <b>perishable</b> foods are lost after harvest during the storage period. These losses may {{be as high as}} thirty to fifty percent in developing countries where adequate cold storage facilities are not available. The main causes of loss include spoilage caused by moisture, moulds, micro-organisms, and vermin.|$|E

5|$|Over 400 souterrains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Scotland, {{many of them in}} the south-east, and although few have been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. Unfortunately the purpose of these small underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing <b>perishable</b> agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE.

5|$|From {{the classic}} {{language}} {{to the present}} day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in <b>perishable</b> media such as codices made of bark, only four of which have survived the ravages {{of time and the}} campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Group F is to {{the west}} of Group E. Mound F is the main {{structure}} within Group F. It slopes gradually away to the west and was not easily defensible on that side, however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears to have been an observation platform covering the western pass to the city. A retaining wall supported the mound above the pass and a round earth platform upon the mound may have supported a <b>perishable</b> watchtower.|$|E
5|$|Investigations of the West Group have {{revealed}} an occupation {{beginning in the}} Late Classic and reaching its maximum extent in the Terminal Classic. The construction methods used in the West Group were inferior {{to those of the}} acropolis, consisting of finely cut limestone blocks bound with an earth-based mortar rather than the lime-based mortar used in the palace complex. The platforms of the West Group appear to have supported <b>perishable</b> superstructures and some of these buildings may have been dedicated to craft production.|$|E

5|$|Maya art is {{essentially}} {{the art of the}} royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both <b>perishable</b> and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas. Maya art has many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E
5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in <b>perishable</b> softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren of hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E
5|$|Platform E6 is {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of the Group E plaza. It is roughly built from irregularly sized, poorly cut stones. The platform faces east towards Pyramid E1 and has four access stairways. The platform once supported <b>perishable</b> residences; these were built from maize stalks bound together with clay, as evidenced by the imprint of the maize stalks in the fragments of clay wall recovered during excavations. The platform itself was once covered with stucco.|$|E

5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} <b>perishable</b> and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in the shade.|$|E
5|$|Structure 13 {{is on the}} {{southwest}} side of Plaza 1, dividing that Plaza from Plaza 2. It was accessed via a double stairway ascending from Plaza 1. This double stairway gave access to the first level of the temple structure only; from there, a wide single stairway continued to the summit shrine. Only the lower sections of the walls and columns of the temple superstructure remain. The earliest phase of construction dates to the Early Classic and consisted of a low platform that supported a <b>perishable</b> superstructure.|$|E
5|$|Tapestry {{production}} {{began with}} design. The designs, or cartoons were typically executed on paper or parchment, {{put together by}} qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly <b>perishable,</b> few of the original cartoons survive. Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, {{in most of the}} towns and in many of the villages.|$|E

Costing approximately S$16 million to build, Coolport @ Changi {{will be the first}} dedicated on-airport facility in Singapore for handling terminal and transit <b>perishables</b> cargo within the Free Trade Zone. Located within SATS Airfreight Terminal 2, Coolport @ Changi will have an annual operating capacity of around 250,000 tonnes, with scope for expansion from the current 8,000 square metres to 14,000 square metres. Coolport @ Changi will be the first facility in Singapore comprising three multi-tiered zones with different temperatures ranging from -28C to 18C. It will be able to handle a range of <b>perishables</b> cargo such as live seafood and ornamental fish, fresh produce, meats, flowers and pharmaceutical products including vaccines.|$|R

5|$|Taxes were levied on {{artisans}} such as potters, sheep herders, weavers, oilmen, shopkeepers, stall owners, brewers and gardeners. Taxes on <b>perishable</b> {{items such}} as fish, meat, honey, medicine, fruits and essentials like fuel was as high as 16%. Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines, implying that private mineral prospecting and the quarrying business may have been active. The state claimed all such properties whose deceased legal owner had no immediate family to make an inheritance claim. Other miscellaneous taxes included ferry and house taxes. Only Brahmins and their temple institutions were taxed at a lower rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known shrines {{appeared in}} Egypt {{in the late}} Predynastic Period, in the late fourth millenniumBC, at sites such as Sais and Buto in Lower Egypt and Nekhen and Coptos in Upper Egypt. Most of these shrines were made of <b>perishable</b> materials such as wood, reed matting, and mudbrick. Despite the impermanence of these early buildings, later Egyptian art continually reused and adapted elements from them, evoking the ancient shrines to suggest the eternal nature of the gods and their dwelling places.|$|E

Some ballast hoppers were given vacuum brakes in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without vacuum brakes) still formed {{the majority of the}} fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised {{to become a part of}} British Railways.|$|E
