50|$|The European {{colonization}} of Australia, {{and the consequent}} damage sustained by Aboriginal communities, had a catastrophic effect on indigenous languages in the southeast {{and south of the}} country, leaving them with no living traditional native speakers. A number of Aboriginal communities in Victoria and elsewhere are now trying to revive these languages. The work is typically directed by a group of elders and other knowledgeable people, with community language workers doing most of the research and teaching. They analyze the data, develop spelling systems and vocabulary and <b>prepare</b> <b>resources.</b> Decisions are made in collaboration.

With a growth model, they can examine the likely outcomes, both with the intended and alternative cutting limits, and can make their decision objectively.
