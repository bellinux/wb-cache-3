40|$|Described is {{a method}} of {{automatically}} welding pipes, comprising welding with a <b>pulsation</b> <b>welding</b> current and monitoring, {{by means of a}} sensor, the variations occurring in the arc voltage caused by weld pool oscillations. The occurrence of voltage variations with only frequency components below 100 Hz indicates excessive welding through; the occurrence of voltage variations with only frequency components above 100 Hz indicates in sufficient welding through; a welding process showing proper welding through is characterized by the occurrence of voltage variations in two different frequency peak...|$|E
