5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking <b>protocol</b> <b>suite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Technical {{standards}} {{specifying the}} Internet <b>protocol</b> <b>suite</b> {{and many of}} its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The Internet <b>protocol</b> <b>suite</b> predates the OSI model, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.|$|E
25|$|TFTP's {{design was}} {{influenced}} {{from the earlier}} protocol EFTP, {{which was part of}} the PUP <b>protocol</b> <b>suite.</b> TFTP was first defined in 1980 by IEN 133.|$|E
50|$|The Routing Information Protocol (RIP), a {{descendant}} of Pup's Gateway Information Protocol, is used as the router information-exchange system, and (slightly modified to match the syntax of addresses of other <b>protocol</b> <b>suites),</b> remains in use today in other <b>protocol</b> <b>suites,</b> such as the Internet Protocols.|$|R

50|$|In computations, we have {{algorithms}} and data, and in communications, we have protocols and messages, so {{the analog}} of a {{data flow diagram}} would {{be some kind of}} message flow diagram.To visualize protocol layering and <b>protocol</b> <b>suites,</b> a diagram of the message flows in and between two systems, A and B, is shown in figure 3.|$|R
25|$|From 1973 to 1974, Cerf's {{networking}} {{research group}} at Stanford worked out {{details of the}} idea, resulting in the first TCP specification. A significant technical influence was the early networking work at Xerox PARC, which produced the PARC Universal Packet <b>protocol</b> <b>suite,</b> much of which existed around that time.|$|E
25|$|Encapsulation is used {{to provide}} {{abstraction}} of protocols and services. Encapsulation is usually aligned with {{the division of the}} <b>protocol</b> <b>suite</b> into layers of general functionality. In general, an application (the highest level of the model) uses a set of protocols to send its data down the layers, being further encapsulated at each level.|$|E
25|$|The Internet <b>{{protocol}}</b> <b>suite</b> and the layered {{protocol stack}} design were in use before the OSI model was established. Since then, the TCP/IP {{model has been}} compared with the OSI model in books and classrooms, which often results in confusion because the two models use different assumptions and goals, including {{the relative importance of}} strict layering.|$|E
50|$|Web Single Sign-On Metadata Exchange Protocol is a Web Services and Federated {{identity}} specification, {{published by}} Microsoft and Sun Microsystems that defines mechanisms for {{a service to}} query an identity provider for metadata concerningthe <b>protocol</b> <b>suites</b> it supports.

25|$|The Domain Name System also {{specifies}} {{the technical}} functionality of the database service {{that is at}} its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, {{as part of the}} Internet <b>Protocol</b> <b>Suite.</b> Historically, other directory services preceding DNS were not scalable to large or global directories as they were originally based on text files, prominently the hosts file.|$|E
25|$|The Internet <b>protocol</b> <b>suite</b> is the {{conceptual}} model and set of communications protocols {{used on the}} Internet and similar computer networks. It {{is commonly known as}} TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). It is occasionally known as the Department of Defense (DoD) model, because the development of the networking method was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.|$|E
25|$|The {{layers of}} the <b>protocol</b> <b>suite</b> near the top are logically closer to the user application, while those near the bottom are logically closer to the {{physical}} transmission of the data. Viewing layers as providing or consuming a service is a method of abstraction to isolate upper layer protocols from the details of transmitting bits over, for example, Ethernet and collision detection, while the lower layers avoid having to {{know the details of}} each and every application and its protocol.|$|E
50|$|The Gateway Information Protocol's descendant, RIP, (with minor {{modifications}} {{to carry the}} addresses of any protocol family), remains in use today in other <b>protocol</b> <b>suites,</b> including TCP/IP. One version of RIP served {{as one of the}} initial so-called interior gateway protocols for the growing Internet, before the arrival of the more modern OSPF and IS-IS. It is still in use as an interior routing protocol, in small sites with simple requirements.|$|R
50|$|NetBIOS Frames or NBF {{protocol}} is a non-routable network- and transport-level data protocol {{most commonly}} used {{as one of the}} layers of Microsoft Windows networking in the 1990s. NBF protocol or NetBIOS over IEEE 802.2 LLC is used by a number of network operating systems released in the 1990s, such as LAN Manager, LAN Server, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 and Windows NT. Other protocols, such as NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP), and NetBIOS-over-IPX/SPX also implement the NetBIOS/NetBEUI services over other <b>protocol</b> <b>suites.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Internet is {{the global}} system of {{interconnected}} computer networks {{that use the}} Internet <b>protocol</b> <b>suite</b> (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by {{a broad array of}} electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.|$|E
25|$|The Internet <b>protocol</b> <b>suite</b> {{provides}} end-to-end {{data communication}} specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers which classify all related protocols {{according to the}} scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, which provides process-to-process data exchange for applications.|$|E
25|$|Big-endian is {{the most}} common format in data networking; fields in the {{protocols}} of the Internet <b>protocol</b> <b>suite,</b> such as IPv4, IPv6, TCP, and UDP, are transmitted in big-endian order. For this reason, big-endian byte order is also referred to as network byte order. Little-endian storage is popular for microprocessors, in part due to significant influence on microprocessor designs by Intel Corporation. Mixed forms also exist, for instance the ordering of bytes in a 16-bit word may differ from the ordering of 16-bit words within a 32-bit word. Such cases are sometimes referred to as mixed-endian or middle-endian. There are also some bi-endian processors that operate in either little-endian or big-endian mode.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, a {{group called}} the Instant Message and Presence Protocol (IMPP) working group (WG), was formed within the Internet Engineering Task Force {{organization}} (IETF) in order to develop protocols and data formats for simple presence and instant messaging services. Unfortunately, IMPP WG was not able to come to consensus on a single protocol for presence. Instead it issued a common profile for presence and instant messaging (CPP) which defined semantics for common services of presence to facilitate the creation of gateways between presence services. Thus any two CPP-compatible presence <b>protocol</b> <b>suites</b> are automatically interoperable.|$|R
25|$|The Internet <b>protocol</b> <b>suite</b> {{resulted}} from {{research and development}} conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the late 1960s. After initiating the pioneering ARPANET in 1969, DARPA started work {{on a number of}} other data transmission technologies. In 1972, Robert E. Kahn joined the DARPA Information Processing Technology Office, where he worked on both satellite packet networks and ground-based radio packet networks, and recognized the value of being able to communicate across both. In the spring of 1973, Vinton Cerf, the developer of the existing ARPANET Network Control Program (NCP) protocol, joined Kahn to work on open-architecture interconnection models with the goal of designing the next protocol generation for the ARPANET.|$|E
25|$|The Internet {{standards}} {{describe a}} framework {{known as the}} Internet <b>protocol</b> <b>suite.</b> This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123. The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the application layer, space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the client-server application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a peer-to-peer paradigm. Below this top layer, the transport layer connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods.|$|E

At UCLA {{he worked in}} Professor Leonard Kleinrock's {{networking}} group that connected the first two nodes of the ARPANET {{and contributed to the}} ARPANET host-to-host protocol. Cerf was an assistant professor at Stanford University from 1972–1976, where he conducted research on packet network interconnection protocols and co-designed the DoD TCP/IP <b>protocol</b> <b>suite</b> with Bob Kahn. He was a program manager for the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) from 1976 to 1982. Cerf was instrumental in the formation of both the Internet Society and Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), serving as founding president of the Internet Society from 1992–1995 and in 1999 as Chairman of the Board and as ICANN Chairman from 2000 to 2007. His many awards include the National Medal of Technology, the Turing Award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and membership in the National Academy of Engineering and the Internet Society's Internet Hall of Fame.|$|E
