30|$|No {{matter whether}} under Strategy 1 or under Strategy 2, the optimal <b>price</b> <b>in</b> {{the first period}} {{increases}} as α increases or β decreases and the optimal <b>price</b> <b>in</b> the second period increases as β increases. These results are intuitive because when snobs are more positively sensitive to the probability of stockout (more conspicuous), the firm is able to charge a higher <b>price</b> <b>in</b> the first period. Similarly, when followers are more negatively sensitive to the probability of stockout (more conservative), the firm should set a lower <b>price</b> <b>in</b> the first period and a higher <b>price</b> <b>in</b> the second period. An interesting result is that under Strategy 1 the second-period <b>price</b> decreases <b>in</b> α while under Strategy 2 the second-period <b>price</b> increases <b>in</b> α. This can be explained as follows. When Strategy 2 is adopted, the stock-out probability and the fraction of snobs are typically small. The increase of α induces the firm to increase the optimal <b>price</b> <b>in</b> the first period to profit more from snobs. In addition, the firm cares {{a lot about the}} second-period profit from followers. So it is optimal for the firm to increase the second-period price simultaneously but at a relatively smaller pace in order to maintain an appropriate price gap under the condition of Strategy 2.|$|R

After Minton joined the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn. In another decision, Minton was in the majority that ruled under the Sherman Antitrust Act that the New York Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business.
