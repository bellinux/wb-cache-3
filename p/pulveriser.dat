5|$|The European Championship was Razer's next—and final—televised tournament, {{for which}} it {{qualified}} as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions <b>Pulveriser</b> {{to set up a}} semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries attached the anti-crusher frame used in their previous meeting in the series six grand final; the Razer team installed a revised version of the lifting hook. Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer picked it up with the hook and dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, but the result went to a judges' decision. They awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight, but in a split decision the team decided this was unfair and conceded to Tornado, who beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title.|$|E

500|$|Coal is {{fed into}} one of 30 coal bunkers, each with a {{capacity}} of 1,000 tonnes. Each bunker feeds two of the 60 <b>pulverisers,</b> each of which can crush 36 tonnes of coal an hour. [...] The station has six Babcock Power boilers, each weighing 4,000 tonnes. The powdered coal from ten <b>pulverisers</b> is blasted into each boiler through burners, which are ignited by propane. In 2003 the original burners were replaced by low nitrogen oxide burners. Each of the six boilers feed steam to a steam turbine set, consisting of one high pressure (HP) turbine, one intermediate pressure (IP) turbine and three low pressure (LP) turbines. The HP turbines generate at 140 megawatts (MW). Exhaust steam from them is fed back to the boiler and reheated, then fed to the 250MW IP turbines and finally passes through the 90MW LP turbines. This gives each generating set a generating capacity of 660MW: with six generating sets, the station has a total capacity of 3,960MW.

50|$|White {{cast iron}} {{displays}} white fractured surfaces {{due to the}} presence of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (graphitizing agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in white cast iron precipitates out of the melt as the metastable phase cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit plastic deformation by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, white cast iron could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry pumps, shell liners and lifter bars in ball mills and autogenous grinding mills, balls and rings in coal <b>pulverisers,</b> and the teeth of a backhoe's digging bucket (although cast medium-carbon martensitic steel is more common for this application).|$|R

40|$|The {{coal fired}} power plants {{are one of}} the oldest, most common and wide spread {{generators}} of electricity. They utilise heat generated by burning coal, that is pulverised in different type of grinding machines selected based on the coal type that is being processed, to produce steam power. For bituminous coal, vertical spindle pulverisers are the preferred and most common equipment for pulverisation. In this thesis, the vertical spindle pulverisers were of interest and their operation is modelled. In order to achieve this goal, a sampling procedure was developed to collect samples from these pulverisers. A standard procedure for sample analyses was followed; and when required, new experimental and sampling tools were developed and manufactured. A multi-component data set of five industrial scale surveys was produced for the <b>pulveriser</b> operating at different coal and air flow conditions. The multi-component data are based on size and ash content as well as density for one test and the feed samples. The selected samples were classified into size-by-size density bins by float/sink density analysis. One of the general outcomes of using multi-component data was confirmation of the mineral matter accumulation in the mill showing its dependency on size. Moreover, the multi-component data were utilised to calculate the flow rates and unknown particle size distributions of the mill interior streams by mass balancing. Hence, the mill interior streams particle size distributions and flow rates, as well as size-by-size ash content distributions were obtained; thus the circulating loads that develop in the <b>pulveriser</b> were calculated. This information was used in constructing the ball feed stream via combining the reject streams with the coal fed to the <b>pulveriser,</b> which is the key stream to compute comminution information and model parameters. The mass balanced streams information were utilised to evaluate the classifications that occur in the <b>pulveriser.</b> The model parameters describing the classification curves that correspond to the two different zones in the <b>pulveriser</b> were found to be closely related to the operational conditions. A 3 D multi-component breakage function was developed with the results obtained from compressive breakage tests. It is observed that the coal and mineral matter differ in breakage behaviour. This difference was incorporated into the 3 D breakage model {{in order to be able}} to predict the breakage of these component particles and their composites. The mass balanced stream information together with the multi-component breakage function was utilised to successfully determine the rate of breakage of particles in the grinding zone. The model parameters describing the rate of breakage of the particles were found to be related to the operational variables. A demonstration of the developed approach was done using a simulator which linked comminution and classification models based on size and density components, to work in closed circuit operation. The classification function used in the overall simulation model was changed to an efficiency curve model based on settling velocities of particles to enable integration of both density and size of particles into the model; rather than employing empirical relations developed based only on particle size. Similarly, parameters for rate of breakage of particles have differed from that of parameters calculated during the computations for open circuit grinding conditions. The results obtained from the simulation studies were satisfactory in describing the existing conditions that occur in the <b>pulveriser</b> at all the sampled conditions. In conclusion, a mathematical model of an industrial scale ball-and-race <b>pulveriser</b> was developed by determining the effect of operational variables on the comminution and classification operations within the <b>pulveriser...</b>|$|E
40|$|Coal pulverisation {{in power}} plants {{is a major}} {{electrical}} energy consumer. In 2006 more than 41 per cent of world electricity generation was from coal where pulverisers use 0. 5 to 1 per cent of gross generation. Therefore, pulverisers are an important target for optimisation not only for reducing costs of power generation but also for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. A {{better understanding of the}} operation of pulverisers is an essential requirement for their optimisation. However, little information is available, other than operating experience, on the performance of pulverisers and how these react to changes in operational variables. This study investigates the effect of changes in coal and airfl ow feed rates on the classifi cation performance that occurs in an industrial scale ball-and-race vertical spindle mill in which the pulverisation and classifi cation processes are linked together due to the separator classifi er being an integral component within the <b>pulveriser.</b> In order to decouple the breakage and classifi cation processes, samples were cut from upward fl owing streams through sampling ports drilled on the <b>pulveriser</b> body at different locations. Specifi c sampling tools were developed. Samples collected from the <b>pulveriser</b> were size and density fractioned to distinguish the differences in behaviour of the components, namely coal and mineral matter. The coal fl ow rates on dry basis within the mill and around the separator classifi er were calculated by mass balancing the multi-component data. The difference in classifi cation behaviour of components during pneumatic transport was confi rmed. The response of the circulating load in the mill (~ 600 to ~ 1100 per cent) as well as the dependency of fi neness of the streams to the operating variables was demonstrated. The approach taken in this study has proved that development of a classifi cation model for a vertical spindle mill pulverising non-homogeneous materials, eg coal, requires treating these materials as multi-component/composite substances...|$|E

40|$|Hammers {{are the key}} {{machine element}} of {{high-speed}} hammer mills which lead to the coal pulverisation process. Progressive material loss from the hammer occurs due to the mechanical interactions between the coal particles and the hammer surface. Coal <b>pulveriser</b> industries implement extensive efforts to combat against premature material loss from the hammer surface due to coal particle impact which may result in premature failure. This work investigates the erosion wear mechanism through computational simulation. A numerical model is developed using Abaqus® to simulate the solid coal particle impacting onto the hammer (target). The Abaqus/Explicit® dynamic simulation solver is used for this analysis. The interactions between the solid coal particles and the target are modelled using the Abaqus/Explicit® element deletion method. The Johnson and Cook plasticity model is employed to analyse the flow stress behaviour of ductile materials during impact. The developed stress and plastic strain are analysed through simulation on the impact surface.

40|$|The {{breakage}} of a coal {{in compression}} tests {{has been studied}} {{with the aim of}} obtaining an appearance function giving the distribution resulting from the breakage of each particle type, which can be used in the simulation of vertical spindle mills that are commonly used in coal fired power plants. The appearance functions from the compression tests were found to take a linear form on logit axes (log(x/(x - x))), thus giving a simpler description than is available on other axes. In common with other breakage analysis methods the lines can be identified by the percent passing one tenth of the initial size, the t parameter. An exponential relation between t and specific energy was found for each particle group defined by size and density and the parameters of the exponential relation were related to the particle size and density. It was found for this particular coal that breakage did not preferentially concentrate either coal or mineral matter. The relations developed allow the generation of a three dimensional breakage-appearance function for the breakage of both size and density components which can be used in the simulation of a <b>pulveriser</b> for the coal tested.

40|$|Nanostructured silicon is a {{promising}} materials for research because {{it serves as}} building blocks for nanotechnological applications, such as nano and quantum electronics, sensors and energy applications. However, many of the synthesis methods come with an increased level of sophistication, and thus the unit cost of material produced is high. The study shows that cheap and mass production of silicon nanoparticles can be achieved e ciently with a topdown process of mechanical attrition, particularly using an orbital <b>pulveriser.</b> The inclusion of the powder in a polymeric binder resulted in {{a new class of}} nanocomposite whose electrical properties are promising for devise applications using simple printing processes. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that the powders consist {{of a wide range of}} size and shape distribution, with large faceted particles with sizes between 1 ô 3 m and relatively small particles of sizes 40 ô 100 nm. The variation of the average particle size with milling time ts well with a rst order exponential decay model which was used to evaluate the limiting particle size as about 120 nm. The structural properties of the nanocomposites was investigated using small angle X-ray scattering, while the electrical properties were investigated by conducting I ô V measurements on a metal-nanocomposite-metal structure. Further tests for electronic properties like eld e ect mobilities were achieved by using the nanocomposite as the active layer in an insulated gate eld e ect transistor structure. Electrical characterisation reveals that the carrier injection and transport is determined by two main factors: the concentration of particles constituting the composite, and the level of external bias voltage on the structure. The nanocomposite systems show a clear percolation threshold for charge conduction. Below the percolation threshold, transport is mainly limited by the matrix or insulating binding medium. Direct tunneling and eld emission (FE) are the major transport mechanism for all concentrations at low voltages, while thermally activated processes, such as hopping and thermionic emission are major contributors at low concentrations. At higher concentrations and eld, Poole-Frenkel and Richardson-Schottky conduction mechanisms, resulting from barrier limiting process in the interface, of the metal contact to an interfacial insulator is dominant. Similar pronounced contribution from space charge limited current process resulting from accumulation of charges at the interface, and traps in the bulk, is pronounced at concentrations above the percolation threshold. The transistors function as ambipolar devices, where the dominance of either carrier is deteri mined by the sign and swing direction of the gate potential.

40|$|In power {{generation}} from solid fuel such as coal-fired power plants, combustion efficiency can be {{monitored by the}} loss on ignition (LOI) of the pulverised fuel. It {{is the role of}} the pulveriser-classifier combination to ensure pulverised fuel delivered to the burners is within the specified limits of fineness and mass flow deviation required to keep the LOI at an acceptable level. However, government imposed limits on emissions have spurred the conversion of many coal fired power plants to convert to the use of Low NOx Burners. To maintain good LOI or combustion efficiency, the limits of fineness and mass flow deviation or inter-outlet fuel distribution have become narrower. A lot of existing <b>pulveriser</b> units cannot operate efficiently within these limits hence retrofits of short term solutions such as orifice balancing and classifier maintenance has been applied. The work performed in this thesis relates to an investigation into coal classifier devices that function to control fineness and inter pipe balancing upstream of the burner and downstream of the pulverisers. A cold flow model of a static classifier was developed to investigate the flow characteristics so that design optimisations can be made. Dynamic similarity was achieved by designing a 1 / 3 scale model with air as the continuous phase and glass cenospheres of a similar size distribution as pulverised fuel, to simulate the coal dust. The rig was operated in positive pressure with air at room temperature and discharge to atmosphere. The Stokes number similarity (0. 11 -prototype vs. 0. 08 -model) was the most important dimensionless parameter to conserve as Reynolds number becomes independent of separation efficiency and pressure drop at high industrial values such as 2 x 10 4 Hoffman, 2008). Air-fuel ratio was also compromised and an assumption of dilute flow was made to qualify this. However, the effect of air fuel ratio was ascertained by its inclusion as an experimental variable. Experiments were conducted at air flow rates of 1. 41 - 1. 71 kg/s and air fuel ratios of 4. 8 - 10 with classifier vane angle adjustment (30 °- 60 °) and inlet swirl umbers (S) of 0. 49 – 1. Radial profiles of tangential, axial and radial velocity were obtained at several cross sections to determine the airflow pattern and establish links with the separation performance and outlet flow balance. Results show a proportional relationship between cone vane angle and cut size or particle fineness. Models can be derived from the data so that reliable predictions of fineness and outlet fuel balance can be used in power stations and replace simplistic and process simulator models that fail to correctly predict performance. It was found that swirl intensity is more significant a parameter in obtaining balanced flow at the classifier outlets than uniform air flow distribution in the mill. However the latter is important in obtaining high grade efficiencies and cut size. The study concludes that the static classifier can be further improved and retrofit-able solutions can be applied to problems of outlet flow imbalance and poor fineness at the mill outlets.
