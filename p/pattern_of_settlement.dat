25|$|Polynesia divides {{into two}} {{distinct}} cultural groups, East Polynesia and West Polynesia. The culture of West Polynesia is conditioned to high populations. It has strong institutions {{of marriage and}} well-developed judicial, monetary and trading traditions. It comprises the groups of Tonga, Niue, Samoa and extends to the atolls of Tuvalu to the north. The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> that {{is believed to have}} occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from the Samoan Islands into the Tuvaluan atolls, with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to migration into the Polynesian Outlier communities in Melanesia and Micronesia.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of Roman occupation, the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in the Mureș valley {{demonstrates}} a continual shift towards nucleated settlements {{when compared to the}} pre-Roman Iron Age settlement pattern. In central Dacia, somewhere between 10 and 28 villages have been identified as aggregated settlements whose primary function was agricultural. The settlement layouts broadly fall between two principal types. The first are those constructed in a traditional fashion, such as Radeşti, Vinţu de Jos, and Obreja. These show generally sunken houses in the Dacian manner, with some dwellings having evolved to becoming surface timber buildings. The second settlement layout followed Roman settlement patterns.|$|E

25|$|The reef {{islands and}} atolls of Tuvalu are {{identified}} as being part of West Polynesia.

The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> that {{is believed to have}} occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Tonga and the Samoan Islands into the Tuvaluan atolls. The distinct linguistic areas that have been recognised in the islands of Tuvalu shows that the Tongan influence is stronger in the northern islands of Nanumea and Nanumaga rather than in the south.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2004 census, the {{population}} of the department of Montevideo was 1,325,968, and that of the neighboring department of Canelones was 485,240, out of a total population of 3,241,003. Thus, these departments and the eastern portion of San José, which together constituted the Greater Montevideo region, held over one-half of Uruguay's population. This monocephalic <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> was more pronounced in Uruguay than in any other nation of the world, barring citystates. The 2004 census indicated a population density of about 2,475 inhabitants per square kilometer in the department of Montevideo and about 80 inhabitants per square kilometer in the department of Canelones. Densities elsewhere in the country were dramatically lower.|$|E

Epping Forest also acts as a protected barrier to the further spread of London. Because of its proximity to London and the economic magnetism which that city exerts, many of Essex's settlements, particularly those on or within short driving distance of railway stations, function as dormitory towns or villages where London workers raise their families.|$|E

25|$|Between about 3000 and 1000 BC {{speakers}} of Austronesian languages {{spread through the}} islands of Southeast Asia – almost certainly starting out from Taiwan, as tribes whose natives were thought to have previously arrived from mainland South China about 8000 years ago – into the edges of western Micronesia and on into Melanesia. In the archaeological record there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated {{with a degree of}} certainty. In the mid-2nd millennium BC a distinctive culture appeared suddenly in north-west Melanesia, in the Bismarck Archipelago, the chain of islands forming a great arch from New Britain to the Admiralty Islands. This culture, known as Lapita, stands out in the Melanesian archeological record, with its large permanent villages on beach terraces along the coasts. Particularly characteristic of the Lapita culture is the making of pottery, including a great many vessels of varied shapes, some distinguished by fine patterns and motifs pressed into the clay. Within a mere three or four centuries between about 1300 and 900 BC, the Lapita culture spread 6000km further to the east from the Bismarck Archipelago, until it reached as far as Tonga and Samoa. In this region, the distinctive Polynesian culture developed. The Polynesians are then believed to have spread eastward from the Samoan Islands into the Marquesas, the Society Islands, the Hawaiian Islands and Easter Island; and south to New Zealand. The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> also extended to the north of Samoa to the Tuvaluan atolls, with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to migration into the Polynesian Outlier communities in Melanesia and Micronesia.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> {{that had}} begun in the Appalachian foothills was {{continued}} and extended through the mountains and highlands {{to the west and}} across the Mississippi River into the Ozark highland region.

2500|$|Both {{before and}} after the War of 1812, the {{government}} of Upper Canada continued to fear what it suspected might be a growing interest in American-inspired republicanism in the province. Reasons for this {{can be found in the}} <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> across the province over the previous half-century. Although the British had originally hoped that an orderly settlement in Upper Canada would inspire the former American colonies to abandon their republican form of government, demographic realities intervened. After an initial group of about 70,000 United Empire Loyalists were thinly settled across the province in the mid-1780s, a far larger number of American settlers came after Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe offered cheap land grants to promote settlement. Although these settlers, known as [...] "late-Loyalists," [...] were required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown in order to obtain land, their fundamental political allegiances were always considered dubious. By 1812, this had become acutely problematic since the American settlers outnumbered the original Loyalists by more than ten to one. It was this reality that led American legislators to speculate that bringing Upper Canada into the American fold would be a [...] "mere matter of marching." [...] Following the war, the colonial government took active steps to prevent Americans from swearing allegiance, thereby making them ineligible to obtain land grants. Relations between the appointed Legislative Council and the elected Legislative Assembly became increasingly strained in the years after the war, over issues of immigration, taxation, banking and land speculation.|$|E
