5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being <b>practically</b> <b>insoluble</b> in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} illustrates {{the application of}} hydrotropy. There was a miraculous synergistic effect on enhancement in solubility of a <b>practically</b> water <b>insoluble</b> drug by using hydrotropic agents. The enhancement in the solubility of ketoprofen by using hydrotropic solution 1. 25 M sodium citrate was more than 180 fold (as compared to the solubility in distilled water). This proved a synergistic enhancement in solubility of a <b>practically</b> water <b>insoluble</b> drug due to hydrotropy. Hydrotropic agent was employed to solublize a <b>practically</b> water <b>insoluble</b> drug, ketoprofen, in bulk to carry out titrimetric analysis precluding the use of organic solvents.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} mixed co solvency in the enhancement of solubility and estimation of ketoprofen, <b>practically</b> water <b>insoluble</b> dug and thus precludes the use of organic solvents. The selected solubilizers were sodium citrate (15 %), PEG 400 (8 %) and polyvinyl pyrolidine (7 %). Beer’s law was obeyed in the concentration range of 2 - 20 µg/ml at wavelength of 256 nm. The solubility of ketoprofen was increased by 30 folds in the mixed cos-solvents as compared to distilled water. The recovery study revealed that any small change in the drug concentration in the solution could be accurately determined by the proposed method. The low values of LOD and LOQ indicated good sensitivity of proposed method. The study proved that mixed co-solvency phenomenon is an effective technique in enhancement of aqueous solubility of poorly water soluble drugs and can be successfully employed for estimation of drugs in routine analysis of tablets.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of iron, chromium, nickel, and cobalt from manual metal arc {{and metal}} inert gas stainless steel welding fumes were studied. Neutron activated welding fumes, in aqueous suspensions, were instilled intratracheally into rats. The follow up continued for up to 106 days. From both fumes, approximately 10 % of the injection bolus was immediately lost into the gastrointestinal tract, to be recovered in the faeces within three days. Thereafter, a pronounced difference {{was seen in the}} kinetics of the two types of fumes. After the first day, chromium, nickel, and iron were lost from the lungs with half times of about 53, 49, and 73 days after exposure to MMA/SS fumes, whereas practically no loss could be seen in the metal components of the {{metal inert gas}} welding fumes within two months. The disposition of chromium from MMA/SS fumes closely resembled that of intratracheally instilled water soluble chromates. On the other hand, the disappearance of trivalent chromium from MIS/SS fumes was considerably slower than that of the <b>practically</b> water <b>insoluble</b> chromates, or even of trivalent chromium salts. Thus the physical characteristics of the fume appreciably affect the kinetics of the clearance of chromium compounds from the lungs...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to obtain directly compressible agglomerates of naproxen containing disintegrant by spherical crystallization technique. Acetone-water containing hydroxypropyl celloluse (HPC) and disintegrant was used as the crystallization system. In this study croscarmellose sodium (Ac-Di-Sol) was employed as disintegrant. The agglomerates were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD), and scanning electron microscopy and were evaluated for flow, packing and tableting properties and drug release. The growth of particle size and the spherical form of the agglomerates resulted in formation of products with good flow and packing properties. The improved compaction properties of the agglomerated crystals were due to their fragmentation occurred during compression. DSC and XRPD studies showed that naproxen particles, crystallized in the presence of HPC and Ac-Di-Sol did not undergo structural modifications. The dissolution rate of naproxen from tablets made of naproxen-(Ac-Di-Sol) agglomerates was enhanced significantly because of including the disintegrant in to the particles. This was attributed to an increase in the surface area of the <b>practically</b> water <b>insoluble</b> drug is exposed to the dissolution medium. In conclusion the spherical crystallization technique developed in this study is suitable for obtaining agglomerates of drug with disintegrant. © American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2007...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRilpivirine (RPV) is a {{pharmaceutical}} drug {{used for the}} treatment of HIV infection. The drug is characterized with poor aqueous solubility and dissolution rate leading to low bioavailability of the drug. Hence, {{there is a need for}} the improvement of the solubility and dissolution of such drugs. In this exertion, enhancement of the solubility and dissolution of the <b>practically</b> water <b>insoluble</b> drug rilpivirine was achieved by solid dispersion (SD) preparation using solvent evaporation method which eventually leads to bioavailability enhancement. SD's were formed using Kollidon VA 64 which is a water-soluble copolymer and varying copolymer ratio to Avicel PH- 101, Gelucire 50 / 13 and lecithin soya. Solubility studies were carried out to establish the solubility-enhancing property of the SD's. To support solubility analysis results, powder dissolution studies were carried out. The SD's were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction studies, scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the SD's formed showed the absence of crystalline nature of the drug and its conversion to amorphous state. The solubility and dissolution of the rilpivirine SD's were enhanced. There is a 14. 9 fold increase in solubility for Drug: Kollidan VA 64 : Gelucire 50 / 13 (1 : 4 : 1). For Drug: Kollidan VA 64 (1 : 5), Drug: Kollidan VA 64 : Lecithin soya (1 : 4 : 1) and Drug: Kollidan VA 64 : Avicel PH- 101 (1 : 4 : 1) it was 5. 9, 5. 4 and 4. 2 respectively.

40|$|A liquisolid {{system has}} the ability to improve the {{dissolution}} properties of poorly water soluble drugs. Liquisolid compacts are flowing and compactable powdered forms of liquid medications. The aim {{of this study was to}} enhance the in vitro dissolution properties of the <b>practically</b> water <b>insoluble</b> loop diuretic furosemide, by utilising liquisolid technique. Several liquisolid tablets were prepared using microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel® pH- 101) and fumed silica (Cab-O-Sil® M- 5) as the carrier and coating materials, respectively. Polyoxyethylene- polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block copolymer (Synperonic® PE/L 81); 1, 2, 3 -propanetriol, homopolymer, (9 Z) - 9 -octadecenoate (Caprol® PGE- 860) and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) were used as non- volatile water-miscible liquid vehicles. The liquid loading factors for such liquid vehicles were calculated to obtain the optimum amounts of carrier and coating materials necessary to produce acceptable flowing and compactible powder admixtures viable to produce compacts. The ratio of carrier to coating material was kept constant in all formulations at 20 to 1. The formulated liquisolid tablets were evaluated for post compaction parameters such as weight variation, hardness, drug content uniformity, percentage friability and disintegration time. The in-vitro release characteristics of the drug from tablets formulated by direct compression (as reference) and liquisolid technique, were studied in two different dissolution media. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier- Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were performed. The results showed that all formulations exhibited higher percentage of drug dissolved in water (pH 6. 4 – 6. 6) compared to that at acidic medium (pH 1. 2). Liquisolid compacts containing Synperonic® PE/L 81 demonstrated higher release rate at the different pH values. Formulations with PEG 400 displayed lower drug release rate, compared to conventional and liquisolid tablets. DSC and FT-IR indicated a possible interaction between furosemide and tablet excipients that could explain the dissolution results.

60|$|There are, however, {{still other}} {{possibilities}} {{to be considered}} in this matter. In these Anticipations it is impossible to ignore the forces making for a considerable relaxation of the institution of permanent monogamous marriage in the coming years, and of a much greater variety of establishments than is suggested by these possibilities within the pale. I guess, without attempting to refer to statistics, that our present society must show a quite unprecedented number and increasing number of male and female celibates--not religious celibates, but people, for the most part, whose standard of personal comfort has such a relation to their earning power that they shirk or cannot enter the matrimonial grouping. The institution of permanent monogamous marriage--except in the ideal Roman Catholic community, where {{it is based on the}} sanction of an authority which in real Roman Catholic countries a large proportion of the men decline to obey--is sustained at present entirely by the inertia of custom, and by a number of sentimental and practical considerations, considerations that may very possibly undergo modification in the face of the altered relationship of husband and wife that the present development of childless ménages is bringing about. The practical and sustaining reason for monogamy is the stability it gives to the family; the value of a stable family lies in the orderly upbringing in an atmosphere of affection that it secures in most cases for its more or less numerous children. The monogamous family has indisputably been the civilizing unit of the pre-mechanical civilized state. It must be remembered that both for husband and wife in most cases monogamic life marriage involves an element of sacrifice, it is an institution of late appearance in the history of mankind, and it does not completely fit the psychology or physiology of any but very exceptional characters in either sex. For the man it commonly involves considerable restraint; he must ride his imagination on the curb, or exceed the code in an extremely dishonouring, furtive, and unsatisfactory manner while publicly professing an impossible virtue; for the woman it commonly implies many uncongenial submissions. There are probably few married couples who have escaped distressful phases of bitterness and tears, within the constraint of their, in most cases, <b>practically</b> <b>insoluble</b> bond.
