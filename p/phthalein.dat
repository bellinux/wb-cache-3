5000|$|The rhodamines, {{which are}} closely related to the <b>phthaleins,</b> are formed by the {{condensation}} of the alkyl metaaminophenols with phthalic anhydride in the presence of sulfuric acid. Their salts are fine red dyes. By the entrance of amino or hydroxyl groups into the molecule dyestuffs are formed. The mono-amino derivatives or eurhodines are obtained when the arylmonamines are condensed with orthoamino azo compounds; by condensing quinone dichlorimide or para-nitrosodimethyl aniline with monamines containing a free para position, or by oxidizing ortho-hydroxydiaminodipbenylamines. They are yellowish-red solids, which behave as weak bases, their salts undergoing hydrolytic dissociation in aqueous solution. When heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid the amino group is replaced by the hydroxyl group and the phenolic eurhodols are produced.|$|R

40|$|Bilitranslocase is a plasma {{membrane}} carrier firstly identified on the sinusoidal (vascular) domain of liver cells {{and later on}} also in the gastric epithelium. It transports diverse organic anions, such as bilirubin, some <b>phthaleins</b> and many dietary anthocyanins, suggesting that it could play a role both in the absorption of flavonoids from dietary sources and in their hepatic metabolism. This work was aimed at characterising the interaction of bilitranslocase with flavonols, a flavonoid sub-class. The results obtained show that, contrary to anthocyanins, flavonol glycosides do not interact with the carrier, whereas {{just some of the}} corresponding aglycones act as relatively poor ligands to bilitranslocase. These data point to a clear-cut discrimination between anthocyanins and flavonols occurring {{at the level of the}} bilitranslocase transport site. A quantitative structure-activity relationship based on counter propagation artificial neural network modelling was undertaken in order to shed light on the nature of flavonoid interaction with bilitranslocase. It was found that binding relies on the ability to establish hydrogen bonds, ruling out the involvement of charge interactions. This requisite might be at the basis of the discrimination between anthocyanins and flavonols by bilitranslocase and could lie behind some aspects of the distinct pharmacokinetic properties of anthocyanins and flavonols in mammals...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that specific liver poisons (chloroform, phosphorus) which cause histological changes in the liver cells, decrease the liver excretion of phenoltetrachlorphthalein.

Ether anesthesia for a period of two hours usually causes a depression in the <b>phthalein</b> curve during the twenty-four hours following the anesthesia.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the molecular requirements and mechanisms for the hepatic uptake of <b>phthaleins,</b> {{the transport of}} tetrabromosulfonephthalein (TBS) was investigated in basolateral rat liver plasma membrane vesicles. TBS uptake was electrogenic as greatly accelerated by {{the creation of a}} positive-inside membrane potential by the addition of valinomycin {{in the presence of a}}n inwardly directed potassium gradient. No effect was observed when the ionophore was added in the presence of a sodium gradient. The transport occurred into an osmotic-sensitive space and was saturable with an apparent Michaelis constant of 5. 32 +/- 0. 56 microM and a maximal velocity of 9. 23 +/- 0. 25 nmol. s- 1. mg protein- 1 (mean +/- SD, n = 3 experiments). TBS uptake was directly related to the extra-vesicular pH, indicating the deprotonated quinoid negative-charged form of the dye as the transported species. In contrast, TBS uptake was inversely related to the intravesicular pH, suggesting that protonation inside the vesicles may act as an efficient trap in transport process. Addition of polyclonal monospecific anti-bilitranslocase antibody to liver vesicles specifically inhibited TBS uptake rate (3. 27 +/- 0. 17 vs. 5. 82 +/- 0. 61 nmol. s- 1. mg protein- 1, n = 3, P less than 0. 001).

40|$|When phenoltetrachlorphthalein is {{injected}} intravenously, it is {{eliminated from the}} body in the bile through the activity of the hepatic epithelium. The feces may be collected after purgation and the <b>phthalein</b> extracted and estimated against a standard solution. The estimation of <b>phthalein</b> can be done with accuracy in a suitable colorimeter and the elimination in normal dogs is quite constant. Given a definite liver injury by means of poisons (chloroform, phosphorus), the amount of <b>phthalein</b> excreted will be diminished and the fall in output will be proportional to the amount of injury. With an acute fatal poisoning the curve may fall to zero. Under certain conditions of vascular interference the liver <b>phthalein</b> may show a decreased output; in passive congestion of the liver and with the Eck fistula the liver output may fall considerably below normal. Known disturbances of the liver function due to parenchymatous injury or vascular disturbances are indicated by a fall in the <b>phthalein.</b> excretion curve. Conversely it may be claimed that a drop in <b>phthalein</b> excretion may indicate a decrease in the functional capacity of the liver even if there be no detectable histological changes. Adrenal insufficiency produced by extirpation of three fourths or more of the gland tissue will be associated with a drop in liver <b>phthalein</b> excretion. With hypertrophy of the adrenal fragment the excretion comes back to normal, but may fall again when more adrenal tissue is removed (text-figure 1). Pancreatic insufficiency causes a progressive fall in the <b>phthalein</b> excretion indicating a grave lowering of the functional capacity of the liver (text-figure 2). This fact has a direct bearing on the question of diabetes. Parathyroid insufficiency with tetany causes no decrease in <b>phthalein</b> output, but at times a rise above normal. This comes out best when the <b>phthalein</b> curve is low following pancreas extirpation. Parathyroid tetany may cause hyperactivity {{on the part of the}} liver cells. Thyroid insufficiency produces no change in the uniform curve of <b>phthalein</b> excretion. Hypophysis insufficiency shows an initial fall in the curve, followed by a return to normal and a final drop in the last few days before death. These experiments supply evidence to the effect that the liver is very much concerned in the derangement that follows the removal of the ductless glands. Hence it seems probable that this disturbance of the liver function may be an important factor in the general symptom complex of ductless gland insufficiency.

In rat liver plasma membranes, its function is assayed by recording the electrogenic sulfobromophthalein movement. This {{has been found}} to be inhibited by both cysteine-specific and arginine-specific reagents. Inhibition is both partial and it occurs to the same extent, i. e. approximately 50 %. The effects are not additive. Here we describe the mechanism underlying the above observations. It is concluded that bilitranslocase occurs in two possible states, featured by high and low affinity for the substrates (for sulfobromophthalein, Km =  5  μM and 37  μM, respectively). Cysteine- or arginine-reactive reagents, by reacting selectively with the low-affinity form, entrap it and shift the equilibrium between the two forms, so that, at completion, only the low-affinity form is present. The substrate concentration in the standard transport assay is 39  μM, a value at which the modified low-affinity form operates in the range of half-maximal velocity. This explains both the apparent half-inhibition measured after the chemical treatments and the lack of additivity.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{halogenated}} <b>phthalein</b> dye for {{the investigation}} of hepatic function was first proposed by Rowntree, Hurwitz and Bloomfield (1) in 1913. Their technique required the measurement of the fecal excretion of phenoltetrachlorphthalein following its parenteral administration. However, it was subsequently shown by Rosenthal and White (2) that intravenously administered phenoltetra-bromophthalein disulfonate (BSP) {{is removed from the}} blood almost exclusively by the liver and that the function of the liver may therefore be evaluated by measuring the rate of disappearance of this dye from the plasma. Various lines of evidence support the view that the removal of BSP (and presumably many other substances) from the plasma involves two proc-esses: 1) storage of the material in the liver and 2) biliary excretion. Following the intravenous administration of BSP to dogs it was first shown by Wirts and Cantarow (3) that the output of BSP in the bile continues for over three hours after its virtual disappearance from the plasma, indi-cating that this material is first taken up by the liver and then gradually excreted. This observa-tion was confirmed by Brauer and Pessotti (4), also in dogs. The existence of a similar hepatic BSP storage mechanism in man is evident from the studies of Mendeloff, Kramer, Ingelfinger and Bradley (5) in which a retardation of the BSP disappearance rate from plasma was noted when successive identical intravenous dosts were ad-ministered 30 minutes apart.

The material is derived, not from the dye, but from living elements responding characteristically to a stimulus far from unique. Such responses may well play a rôle in normal physiological activities and in the cellular defense against microorganisms. Vital staining with litmus demonstrates anew that the intracellular reaction during life is independent of that of the body fluids. By means of color changes in the stored indicator one can distinguish sick as well as dead cells of certain sorts and follow their distribution and fate within the organism. There are data to suggest that with the aid of the indicator the normal period of survival of certain elements at least can be determined. By the indicator method, of which the foregoing observations afford a crude illustration, much should be learnt in the future about body processes. The present paper is the second of a series upon the theme...|$|E
40|$|The {{rates of}} the {{alkaline}} hydrolysis of some esters and amides, and of the alkaline fading of certain organic dyes, have been studied over a range of hydrostatic pressures from atmospheric pressure to 16, 000 pounds per square inch. In {{the case of the}} ester and amide hydrolyses the results obey van 't Hoff's law, the logarithm of the rate constant varying linearly with the pressure. From the slopes of the lines values of DeltaV*, the volume of activation, were calculated; they fell in the range of - 10 to - 17 cc, per mole. These negative volumes of activation are to be correlated with the negative entropies of activation for the reactions. It is suggested that the results maybe explained in terms of the hypothesis that the activated complex is much more polar than the reactants. In the case of the alkaline fading of dyes the results were somewhat more complicated, the van 't Hoff law not always being obeyed. In the case of crystal violet the rate was found to be independent of the pressure. With brom phenol blue and phenol <b>phthalein</b> the rates were markedly increased by pressure, so that the volumes of activation are negative. These negative volumes of activation are found to be correlated with the entropies of activation for the reactions. An explanation for the results is given in terms of the changes in polarity {{during the course of the}} reactions...|$|E
40|$|Bilirubin and <b>phthalein</b> dyes {{are taken}} up by the liver via a carrier-mediated {{mechanism}} operated at least in part by bilitranslocase (BTL). Because they also undergo renal transport, the presence and function of BTL was investigated in rat renal tubular plasma membrane vesicles. Transport of sulfobromophthalein (BSP) was enriched in basolateral domain of plasma membrane and followed the distribution pattern of Na+-K+-ATPase but not of γ-glutamyltransferase. BSP uptake was inhibited by addition of monospecific antibodies raised against hepatic BTL. As in liver vesicles, BSP transport was electrogenic, being greatly accelerated by addition of valinomycin in presence of an inwardly directed K+ gradient. Apparent K(m) of BSP transport was 17 ± 2 μM (n = 3 expts), one order of magnitude higher than that measured in liver; however, V(max) was similar to that described in liver vesicles (429 ± 18 nmol BSP·mg protein- 1 ·min- 1, n = 3 expts). Competitive inhibition was observed with both unconjugated bilirubin (K(i), 2. 9 ± 0. 2 μM) and rifamycin SV (K(i), 76 ± 10 μM), known competitors for hepatic BTL-mediated transport of BSP. Immunoblotting studies with anti-BTL monospecific antibodies revealed presence of a single positive band only in basolateral-enriched membrane fraction; its apparent molecular mass was 37 kDa, virtually identical to that of hepatic protein. Immunohistochemistry confined presence of BTL to renal proximal tubules (RPT). We conclude that BTL is present in basolateral plasma membrane of RPT cells. Lower affinity of renal, compared with hepatic protein, for substrates might explain the marginal role of kidney in plasma clearance of bilirubin and cholephilic dyes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of the {{investigation}} of various halophilic bacteria it became of interest to determine the magnitude of the sodium chloride error in the colorimetric estimation of pH. Various investigators (Clark, 1925) have estimated salt errors at low concentrations (1 M or less) while both Wells (1920) and Ramage and Miller (1925) have studied the salt errors of cresol red over fairly wide ranges of salt concentration. The object of this work was to ascertain the errors in measuring colorimetrically the pH of solutions 1, 2 and 3 M with respect to sodium chloride using the sulfon <b>phthalein</b> series of indicators. The general procedure consisted in buffering the salt solutions, adding indicator and adjusting to the same color as that given by an identical buffer containing no salt. The pH of each solu-tion was then measured electrometrically and {{the difference between the two}} readings taken as the salt error. The standard buffer solutions proposed by Clark and Lubs (Clark, 1925) were prepared in M/ 5 concentration from specially purified materials and preserved in glass stoppered Pyrex glass containers. The sodium hydroxide solution was prepared car-bonate free from sodium amalgam and preserved in an appro-priate manner. The buffer solutions were made up to the recommended M/ 20 concentration immediately before use. The following is given as an example of the method finally adopted. First the standard buffer solution was made up to a suitable pH, a 10 cc. portion measured into a comparator tube and indicator added. An identical buffer solution 1, 2 or 3...|$|E
40|$|Thymidylate synthase (TS) (EC 2. 1. 1. 45), {{an enzyme}} {{involved}} in the DNA synthesis of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, is a potential target {{for the development of}} anticancer and antinfective agents. Recently, we described a series of <b>phthalein</b> and naphthalein derivatives as TS inhibitors. These compounds have structures unrelated to the folate (Non-Analogue Antifolate Inhibitors, NAAIs) and were selective for the bacterial versus the human TS (hTS). In particular, halogen-substituted molecules were the most interesting. In the present paper the halogen derivatives of variously substituted 3, 3 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 1 H, 3 H-naphtho[2, 3 -c]furan- 1 -one (1 - 5) and 3, 3 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 1 H, 3 H-naphtho[1, 8 -c,d]pyran- 1 -one (6 - 14) were synthesized to investigate the biological effect of halogen substitution on the inhibition and selectivity for the TS enzymes. Conformational properties of the naphthalein series were explored in order to highlight possible differences between molecules that show species-specific biological profile with respect to non species-specific ones. With this aim, the conformational properties of the synthesized compounds were investigated by NMR, in various solvents and at different temperatures, and by computational analysis. The apparent inhibition constants (K-i) for Lactobacillus casei TS (LcTS) were found to range from 0. 7 to 7. 0 muM, {{with the exception of the}} weakly active iodo-derivatives (4, 10, 13); all] the compounds were poorly active against hTS. The di-halogenated compounds 7, 8, 14 showed the highest specificity towards LcTS, their specificity index (SI) ranging between 40 and > 558. The di-halogenated 1, 8 -naphthalein derivatives (7 - 10) exhibited different conformational properties with respect to the tetra-haloderivatives. Though a clear explanation for the observed specificity by means of conformational analysis is difficult to find, some interesting conformational effects are discussed in the context of selective recognition of the compounds investigated by the LcTS enzyme...|$|E
40|$|A {{new set of}} <b>phthalein</b> {{derivatives}} {{stemming from}} the lead compound, phenolphthalein, were designed to specifically complement structural features of a bacterial form of thymidylate synthase (Lactobacillus casei, LcTS) versus the human TS (hTS) enzyme. The new compounds were screened for their activity and their specificity against TS enzymes from different species, namely, L. casei (LcTS), Pneumocystis carinii (PcTS), Cryptococcus neoformans (CnTS), and human thymidylate synthase (hTS). Apparent inhibition constants (Ki) for all the compounds against LcTS were determined, and inhibition factors (IF,ratio between the initial rates of the enzymatic reaction in the presence and absence of each inhibitor) against {{each of the four}} TS species were measured. A strong correlation was found between the two activity parameters, IF and Ki, and therefore the simpler IF was used as a screening factor in order to accelerate biological evaluation. Compounds 5 b, 5 c, 5 ba, and 6 bc showed substantial inhibition of LcTS while remaining largely inactive against hTS, illustrating for the first time remarkable species specificity among TSs. Due to sequence homology between the enzymes, several compounds also showed high activity and specificity for CnTS. In particular, 3 -hydroxy- 3 -(3 -chloro- 4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 6 -nitro- 1 H, 3 H-naphtho[1, 8 -c,d]pyran- 1 -one, (6 bc) showed an IF < 0. 04 for CnTS (K-i = 0. 45 mu M) while remaining inactive in the hTS assay at the maximum solubility concentration of the compound (200 mu M). In cell culture assays most Of the compounds were found to be noncytotoxic to human cell lines but were cytotoxic against several species of Grampositive bacteria. These results are consistent with the enzymatic assays. Intriguingly, several compounds also had selective activity against Cr. neoformans in cell culture assay. In general, the most active and selective compounds against the Gram-positive bacteria were those designed and found in the enzyme assay to be specific for LcTS versus hTS. The original lead compound was least selective against most of the cell lines tested. To our knowledge these compounds are the first TS inhibitors selective for bacterial TS with respect to hTS...|$|E
40|$|Mice can be vitally {{stained with}} many of the <b>phthalein</b> indicators. The {{staining}} is diffuse, appearing to interfere not at all with health {{in the case of the}} majority of the dyes. The color phenomena show that these retain the character of indicators. A special technique has been evolved for the determination of the hues of the various organs, which are readily modified by extraneous influences. The ability to recognize that the pH has thus been altered is a signal advantage of the indicator method. Phthaleins of slightly alkaline range or one that trenches slightly on acidity have been employed for the work here reported. Cresol red, phenol red, and brom phenol red have proved especially useful. The observations with the three agree closely in pointing to the existence of notable differences between the reaction of the blood and that within the tissues generally. The hue of blood plasma from the right heart is such as to suggest that its reaction lies at about pH 7. 38 ordinarily, whereas that of the most alkaline of the tissues, judging from its color, the connective tissue, would appear to have a pH of 7. 2 or slightly less. The tendons seem to be nearly but not quite so alkaline. The other stained tissues without exception, are of a hue which would indicate that the reaction lies beyond the range of phenol red on the acid side, that is to say is at least as acid as pH 6. 6. In a subsequent paper observations which accord with these findings, carried out with indicators of frankly acid range, will be described. On the exposure of tissues to air, without disturbance of the circulation, some of them become alkaline. In the case of connective tissue, at least, the change is a consequence of the escape of carbon dioxide. The gas passes readily in and out, exerting a practically immediate influence on the color of the tissue bared by eversion of a skin flap; and so much may be absorbed on exposure to pure carbon dioxide, when the surface is large, that a general acidosis results. The precise interpretation of the color changes in terms of pH waits necessarily upon further work...|$|E
