Labor Senator Lionel Murphy {{sent a message to}} the House suggesting that St John's comments were an inappropriate breach of the Prime Minister's privacy. St John's view was that Gorton was inadequate in character, training and temperament to be prime minister.

St John resigned from the Liberal Party in March 1969 to sit as an independent but was defeated at the October 1969 election by the Liberal candidate. His book about these turbulent times, A Time to Speak, was published just before the elections.|$|E
