40|$|ABSTRACT: Supercritical fluids {{have special}} {{properties}} {{that could lead}} to substantial improvements when utilized as replacements for water in wet processing of textiles. These fluids have densities and solvating powers similar to liquid solvents combined with viscosity values and diffusion coefficients like those observed for gases. In particular, these properties make supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) one of the most beneficial and environmentally acceptable solvents used in manufactur-ing processes today. Therefore, it is anticipated that commercial textile processes using SC-CO 2 will have many advantages when compared to conventional aqueous processes. Succesful commercialization of SC-CO 2 processing will improve the economics of dyeing and other textile chemical processes by eliminating wastewater discharges, reducing energy consumption, eliminating drying, and reducing air emissions. As a result, the use of SC-CO 2 is expected to make textile processing more economical and environmentally friendly. Research groups throughout the world are investigating SC-CO 2 textile processing. Succesful pilot dyeing machines have been operated and even publicly exhibited within the past few years. Research focused to developing a commercial dyeing process for polyester yarn packages is in its sixth year within the College of Textiles at North Carolina State University. Process development has been accomplished using a single-package SC-CO 2 dyeing machine located in the Model Manufacturing Facility of the College. This paper provides an overview of the status of the research and discusses the technical and economic factors important to the successful commercialization of an SC-CO 2 polyester yarn <b>package</b> <b>dyeing</b> process.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of {{bleaching}} of alpaca tops and dyeing of bleached alpaca tops/yarns {{on the quality of}} tops and yarns. A dark brown alpaca top was bleached with hydrogen peroxide. Two bleaching methods were tried for effectiveness of color removal. A portion of each bleached top was dyed after bleaching. Color parameters were examined for unbleached, bleached and bleached/dyed tops, these tops were then converted into yarns of different twist levels and counts using a worsted spinning system. Some of the bleached yarn from each bleaching method was dyed in a package dye vat to compare the difference of top dyeing versus yarn <b>package</b> <b>dyeing</b> on yarn quality. Fiber diameter, yarn strength, yarn evenness, yarn hairiness and fiber degradation were tested to examine {{the effects of}} bleaching and dyeing on these properties at top and yarn stages. A processing route for bleaching and dyeing alpaca fiber was recommended. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} {{observed}} {{over the years that}} yarn tension during high speed over-end unwinding from a helically wound stationary package is highly non linear (1). Each yarn element during unwinding performs a complex motion that involves a movement along the yarn axis and rotation about the package axis. Parameters that affect the yarn tension are linear yarn density, unwinding speed, package diameter, balloon profile, and specific yarn winding density of the cone or cheese. This paper analyses mathematically the influence of the above stated parameters at the guide eyelet on yarn unwinding tension. On the basis of the model it proposes a cost effective mechanical device for tension variation control where a movable guide eyelet is used. The proposed device helps to minimize tension variation during unwinding and to obtain more or less constant tension, which definitely improves the quality of the package prepared from cones or cheeses (for example a warp beam). The concept behind the proposed system is to move the guide eyelet with respect to reducing cone or cheese diameter according to the proposed mathematical model. This will invariably affect the uniform unwinding tension, which also improves the quality of subsequent processes such as warping, sizing, pirn winding and processes associated with <b>package</b> <b>dyeing...</b>|$|E
40|$|After {{reviewing}} past {{work into}} {{the geometry of}} the symmetrical idealised plain knit loop, an account is given of the present knowledge of loop distortion, which {{represents one of the}} major problem areas of the knitting industry. The shortcomings of this knowledge are shown to be that, although a large number of processing variables have been demonstrated to be associated with loop distortion, there have been no systematic studies of the defect and there have been virtually no attempts to explain it in terms of fundamental physical characteristics of the yarn. Eleven yarn production and processing variables are examined within the framework of factorially designed experiments. The influence of these independent variables is statistically related both to ranked levels of loop distortion and to values of yarn physical characteristics. The two latter groups of data are also inter-related by rank correlation. It is shown that loop distortion is dependent upon at least three yarn characteristics which, in turn, are dependent upon particular production and processing variables. These three are yarn bending hysteresis, bending rigidity, and count regularity. The greater propensity for wool to distort in comparison to acrylic is explained in relation to these characteristics, and to their different changes during processes such as steam setting and <b>package</b> <b>dyeing.</b> The work is finally reviewed both {{from the point of view}} of the manufacturer, who wishes to be able to predict the likelihood that a particular yarn will cause distortion, and the textile technologist who is not only interested in choosing the optimum yarn production conditions for minimum distortion, but would like to improve the fabric appearance by changes or additions to established production routes...|$|E

Even though regulators and standard-setting bodies consider strategy disclosure as highly relevant information (Gu and Li 2007), it has not yet been made mandatory under either German GAAP or under IFRS (for details on the regulatory environment in Germany, see “Appendix 1 ”). While our results do not indicate whether evidence of such externalities exists and/or whether they are outweighed by negative consequences, they could still be used as a further argument for standard-setters at least to continue debating whether to require mandatory strategy disclosure.|$|R

40|$|Background: Millions {{of workers}} are occupationally exposed to dyes in the world, but {{little is known}} about their {{knowledge}} and attitudes toward the effects of dye on their health. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the fabric dyers&#x 2032; and fabric printers&#x 2032; knowledge, attitude, and practice toward the health hazard of dyes. Materials and Methods: The present study was taken up in the Madurai district which is situated in the Southern Tamil Nadu, India. One hundred and forty-two workers employed in small-scale dyeing and printing units participated in a face-to-face confidential interview. Results: The mean age of fabric dyers and fabric printers was 42 years (&# 897; 10. 7). When enquired about whether dyes affect body organ(s), all the workers agreed that dye(s) will affect skin, but they were not aware that dyes could affect other parts of the body. All the workers believed that safe methods of handling of dyes and disposal of contaminated <b>packaging</b> used for <b>dyes</b> need to be considered.
