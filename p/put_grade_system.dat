This causal comparative study examined whether a change from a traditional <b>grading</b> <b>system</b> to a standards-based system affected the student retention frequency rate. Convenience sampling was used to collect retention data on third and fifth grade students who attended four Title 1 schools in northeast Georgia during the 2007 - 08 and 2008 - 09 school years when the <b>grading</b> <b>system</b> changed. A Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s Exact test was used to determine if there was a difference between students 2 ̆ 7 retention rates under a traditional <b>grading</b> <b>system</b> and a standards-based <b>grading</b> <b>system.</b> No statistically significant difference was found between the traditional and standards-based <b>grading</b> <b>systems</b> for reducing the frequency of retention for both third grade students and fifth grade students.

The results from this study suggests that the frequency of grade retention with a traditional <b>grading</b> <b>system</b> was not significantly different from the frequency of grade retention that occurred under a standards-based <b>grading</b> <b>system</b> for third and fifth grade students and did not significantly affect the frequency of retention for females and males...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the preferences of}} program directors for various <b>grading</b> <b>systems</b> and other criteria in selecting students for residency training positions through the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS). DESIGN: Questionnaire survey. PARTICIPANTS: All 110 directors of residency training programs in Ontario. SETTING: Ontario medical schools. OUTCOME MEASURES: Weighting of importance of different screening tools (e. g., <b>grading</b> <b>systems,</b> personal interview, dean's letter) used during undergraduate training. RESULTS: Of the 110 directors 96 (87 %) responded. Of the 92 who rated the various grading practices 35 (38 %) preferred a numeric <b>grading</b> <b>system,</b> 26 (28 %) a letter <b>grading</b> <b>system,</b> 23 (25 %) an honours/pass/fail system and 8 (9 %) a pass/fail system. Most of the respondents from each school favoured a <b>grading</b> <b>system</b> that was more discriminating than the one used at their location. The personal interview was regarded {{as the most important}} screening tool by 80 (83 %) of the respondents; the dean's letter was considered to be very useful by only 16 (17 %). CONCLUSIONS: More value was placed by program directors on a numeric or other more discriminating <b>grading</b> <b>system</b> than on the pass/fail <b>system.</b> Although the <b>grading</b> <b>system</b> provides only one type of screening mechanism it {{raises the question of whether}} there should be a policy for uniform grading practices for all Canadian students...|$|R
