The corpus callosum, rostrum, and the anterior mid-body sections are larger in adults who stutter as compared to normally fluent adults. This difference may be due to unusual functions of brain organization in stuttering adults and may be a result of how the stuttering adults performed language-relevant tasks. Furthermore, <b>previous</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> found that adults who stutter show cerebral hemispheres that contain uncommon brain proportions and allocations of gray and white matter tissue.|$|E

The relevance of pseudouridine in rRNA has been documented where pseudouridylation is required for ribosome biogenesis and translational accuracy.

U2 in comparison to other spliceosomal snRNAs has the most extensive modifications, including 13 pseudouridines as well as a 5' trim ethyl guanosine (TMG) cap and others. It is a mixture of modifications involving that of the pseudouridine residues that assist in the complete assembly of the 17S U2 snRNP particle needed for splicing.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Previous</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> shown REM {{sleep to}} reactivate {{cortical}} neural assemblies post-training on a serial reaction time task (SRT), {{in other words}} REM sleep replays the processing that occurred while one learnt an implicit task in the previous waking hours. However, control subjects did not complete a SRT task, thus researchers could not assume the reactivation of certain networks to {{be a result of}} the implicitly learned sequence/grammar as it could simply be due to elementary visuomotor processing which was obtained in both groups. [...] To answer this question the experiment was redone and another group was added who also took part in the SRT task. [...] They experienced no sequence to the SRT task (random group), [...] whereas the experimental group did experience a sequence (probabilistic group), although without conscious awareness. [...] Results of [...] PET scans indicate that bilateral cuneus were significantly more activated during SRT practice as well as post-training REM sleep in the Probabilistic group than the Random group. [...] In addition, this activation was significantly increased during REM sleep versus the SRT task. [...] This suggests that specific brain regions are specifically engaged in the post-processing of sequential information. [...] This is further supported by the fact that regional CBF (rCBF) during post-training REM sleep are modulated by the level of high-order, but not low-order learning obtained prior to sleep. [...] Therefore, brain regions that take part in a learning process are modulated by both the sequential structure of the learned material (increased activation in cuneus), and the amount of high-order learning (rCBF).|$|E
