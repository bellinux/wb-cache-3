The importance {{of work in}} terms of the subjective well-being and growth of individuals through their work, however, is not as extensively discussed and documented. Risk factors and unhealthy factors have long been discussed at the expense of positive conditions for well-being and personal growth. We like to call work with that type of potential regenerative work. Hence, that is the type of work that we have chosen to focus on in this study. The following research objectives have guided us through the study: Which everyday work processes may contribute to sustainable prerequisites for the subjective well-being and growth of individuals? The study takes an explorative approach to two workplaces - a care unit at a hospital and a manufacturing company. Our aim is to increase the understanding of prerequisites for the well-being and growth of individuals through their work.

The natural and induced environment surrounding a spacecraft can decrease material performance and limit useful lifetimes.

40|$|Abstract — MPICH 2, the {{successor}} {{of one of}} the most popular open source message passing implementations, aims to fully support the MPI- 2 standard. Due to a complete redesign, MPICH 2 is also cleaner, more flexible, and faster. The InfiniBand network technology is an open industry standard and provides high bandwidth and low latency, as well as reliability, availability, serviceability (RAS) features. It is currently spreading its influence on the market of costeffective cluster computing. We expect for the near future that upcoming requirements in many cluster environments can only be satisfied by the functionality of MPICH 2 and the performance of InfiniBand. Hence, there is the need for an effective support of the InfiniBand interconnect technology by MPICH 2. In this paper we present our experience that has been gained during the implementation of our MPICH 2 Device for InfiniBand. Further, a <b>performance</b> <b>overview</b> is given, as well as ideas for future developments.

The aim of the investigation was to map out, how nurses in the ICU comply with legislation in the area of their competencies and whether their work is influenced by anything. The results showed two trends - situation within a specific unit, that means whether nurses contravene their competencies; whether nurses are aware about their competencies and about competencies of doctors and in addition why nurses are contravening their competencies and what is the opinion of doctors on compliance of competencies for medical professionals, what is the position of management towards contravention of competencies by nurses. Furthermore, the situation overall, that means existence of further regulatory measures, which impact on the conduct of nurses within units.
