5000|$|Message {{submission}} (...) and SMTP-AUTH (...) {{were introduced}} in 1998 and 1999, both describing new trends in email delivery. Originally, SMTP servers were typically internal to an organization, receiving mail for the organization from the outside, and relaying messages from the organization to the outside. But as time went on, SMTP servers (mail transfer agents), in practice, were expanding their roles to become message submission agents for Mail user agents, {{some of which were}} now relaying mail from the outside of an organization. (e.g. a company executive wishes to send email while on a trip using the corporate SMTP server.) This issue, a consequence of the rapid expansion and popularity of the World Wide Web, meant that SMTP had to include specific rules and methods for relaying mail and authenticating users to prevent abuses such as relaying of unsolicited email (spam). Work on message submission (...) was originally started because popular mail servers would often rewrite mail in an attempt to fix problems in it, for example, adding a domain name to an unqualified address. This behavior is helpful when the message being fixed is an initial submission, but dangerous and harmful when the message originated elsewhere and is being relayed. Cleanly separating mail into submission and relay was seen as a way to permit and encourage rewriting submissions while prohibiting rewriting relay. As spam became more prevalent, it was also seen as a way to <b>provide</b> <b>authorization</b> <b>for</b> mail being sent out from an organization, as well as traceability. This separation of relay and submission quickly became a foundation for modern email security practices.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a programming language that supports information-flow security policies and certificate-based declassification. The language uses monadic information-flow annotations in the style of Abadi et al. ’s dependency core calculus, and has an effects system and fixpoints. The type system conflates security concepts such as labels, principals, and privileges with abstract types, allowing a uniform treatment of lattice structures throughout the language. Myers ’ and Liskov’s decentralized label model is encoded using type constructors that describe confidentiality and integrity policies, and label refinements and principal groups follow naturally from intersection and union types. Singleton types, combined with bounded universal and existential quantifications, connect the type system with public-key infrastructures whose digital certificates <b>provide</b> <b>authorization</b> <b>for</b> privileged operations such as declassification. These features allow specification of security policies in term of dynamic entities such as run-time user identities and file access permissions. Besides showing that the language is sound, we present a security theorem that generalizes standard noninterference to account for information flows introduced by declassification. Although this result gives only a coarse approximation to the information potentially leaked, it captures our intuitions about certificatebased declassification. ...|$|E
