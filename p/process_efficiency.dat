25|$|More recently, {{the concept}} of Business Process Management (BPM) has gained major {{attention}} {{in the corporate world}} and can be considered a successor to the BPR wave of the 1990s, as it is evenly driven by a striving for <b>process</b> <b>efficiency</b> supported by information technology. Equivalently to the critique brought forward against BPR, BPM is now accused of focusing on technology and disregarding the people aspects of change.|$|E
25|$|The {{measure of}} {{innovation}} at the organizational level relates to individuals, team-level assessments, and private companies from the smallest {{to the largest}} company. Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys, workshops, consultants, or internal benchmarking. There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation. Corporate measurements are generally structured around balanced scorecards which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances, innovation <b>process</b> <b>efficiency,</b> employees' contribution and motivation, as well benefits for customers. Measured values will vary widely between businesses, covering for example new product revenue, spending in R, time to market, customer and employee perception & satisfaction, number of patents, additional sales resulting from past innovations.|$|E

25|$|Metrics {{applicable}} to the ED can be grouped into three main categories, volume, cycle time, and patient satisfaction. Volume metrics including arrivals per hour, percentage of ED beds occupied and age of patients are understood at a basic level at all hospitals as an indication for staffing requirements. Cycle time metrics are the mainstays of the evaluation and tracking of <b>process</b> <b>efficiency</b> and are less widespread since an active effort is needed to collect and analyze this data. Patient satisfaction metrics, already commonly collected by nursing groups, physician groups and hospitals, are useful in demonstrating the impact of changes in patient perception of care over time. Since patient satisfaction metrics are derivative and subjective, they are less useful in primary process improvement. Health information exchanges can reduce nonurgent ED visits by supplying current data about admissions, discharges, and transfers to health plans and accountable care organizations, allowing them to shift ED use to primary care settings.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this example}} the syngas {{produced}} {{is used as}} fuel in a gas turbine which produces electrical power. [...] In a normal combined cycle, so-called [...] "waste heat" [...] from the gas turbine exhaust is used in a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) to make steam for the steam turbine cycle. [...] An IGCC plant improves the overall <b>process</b> <b>efficiency</b> by adding the higher-temperature steam produced by the gasification process to the steam turbine cycle. [...] This steam is then used in steam turbines to produce additional electrical power.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the nation}} deepened its {{technological}} base, old-fashioned artisans and craftsmen became [...] "deskilled" [...] {{and replaced by}} specialized workers and engineers who used machines to replicate in minutes or hours work that would require a journeyman hours or days to complete. Frederick W. Taylor, recognizing the inefficiencies introduced by some production lines, proposed that by studying the motions and processes necessary to manufacture each component of a product, reorganizing the factory and manufacturing processes around workers, and paying workers piece rates would allow great gains in <b>process</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Scientific management, or [...] "Taylorism" [...] as {{it came to be}} known, was soon being applied by progressive city governments to make their urban areas more efficient and by suffragettes to home economics.|$|E
40|$|For {{production}} systems composed of parallel <b>processes,</b> the system <b>efficiency</b> will more properly represent the aggregate {{performance of the}} component processes if the operation of each process is taken into consideration. Several approaches have been proposed for measuring the efficiency of parallel {{production systems}}. By requiring the same factor {{to have the same}} virtual multiplier, the proposed method is able to calculate the system and <b>process</b> <b>efficiencies</b> at the same time. Moreover, the former can be decomposed into a weighted average of the latter. A system is efficient only if all of its component processes are efficient. Chemistry departments in the UK are used as an example, where teaching and research are two major functions of the department. The relationship between the system and <b>process</b> <b>efficiencies</b> which holds for the case of constant returns to scale can be extended to the case of variable returns to scale. ...|$|R

[...] For example, the primary crusher product is a good location to measure, since {{you are able to}} control the size that the crusher is producing with slight adjustments to the crusher ensuring that the downstream comminution circuit is receiving a consistent product to help reduce variability in the process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{simulate}} and to optimize integrated gasification for combine cycle (IGCC) for power generation and hydrogen (H 2) production by using low grade Thar lignite coal and cotton stalk. Lignite coal is abundant of moisture and ash content, the idea of addition of cotton stalk is to increase the mass of combustible material per mass of feed use for the process, to reduce the consumption of coal and to increase the cotton stalk efficiently for IGCC process. Aspen plus software is used to simulate the process with different mass ratios of coal to cotton stalk and for optimization: <b>process</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> net power generation and H 2 production etc. are considered while environmental hazard emissions are optimized to acceptance level. With the addition of cotton stalk in feed, <b>process</b> <b>efficiencies</b> started to decline along with the net power production. But for H 2 production, it gave positive result at start but after 40 % cotton stalk addition, H 2 production also started to decline. It also affects negatively on environmental hazard emissions and mass of emissions/ net power production increases linearly with the addition of cotton stalk in feed mixture. In summation with the addition of cotton stalk, overall affects seemed to negative. But the effect is more negative after 40 % cotton stalk addition so it is concluded that to get maximum <b>process</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and high production less amount of cotton stalk addition in feed is preferable and the maximum level of addition is estimated to 40 %.
