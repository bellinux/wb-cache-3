6000|$|... "Now, young man," [...] {{said the}} stranger, [...] "will {{you go and}} do as you're bid? I'm ready to pay for my dinner, and you can say so." [...] The boy stared at him, slowly taking in the facts of his costume, with eyes that climbed from the heavy shoes up the legs of his thick-ribbed {{stockings}} and his knickerbockers, past the <b>pleats</b> and <b>belt</b> of his Norfolk jacket, to the red neckcloth tied under the loose collar of his flannel outing-shirt, and so by his face, with its soft, young beard and its quiet eyes, {{to the top of}} his braidless, bandless slouch hat of soft felt. It was one of the earliest costumes of the kind that had shown itself in the hill country, and it was altogether new to the boy. [...] "Come," [...] said the wearer of it, [...] "don't stand on the order of your going, but go at once," [...] and {{he sat down on the}} steps with his back to the boy, who heard these strange terms of command with a face of vague envy.|$|R
5000|$|The colours, {{patterns}} and decorations of the costume can signify a person's marital status and geographical origin. There are different gákti {{for women and}} men; men's gáktis are shorter at the hem than women's. Traditionally the gákti was made from reindeer skin, but in modern times, wool, cotton or silk are more common. The gákti can be worn with a <b>belt</b> (<b>pleated,</b> quilted or with silver buttons), silver jewellery, traditional leather footwear and a silk scarf. Traditionally, if the buttons on the belt are square, it shows the wearer is married. If they are round, the person is unmarried. If a married couple divorce, and the ex-husband still continues to use the Sami costume made by his ex-wife, he states by this that he wants her back.|$|R
25|$|The {{trousers}} worn by Indiana Jones in {{all three}} films were based on original World War II Army and Army Air Corps officer trousers. Although not original Pinks {{they are based on}} the same basic design and do carry a slight pinkish hue. The trousers made for Raiders are said {{to be more of a}} greyish-brown whereas the trousers made for Temple of Doom and Last Crusade were supposedly a purer reddish brown. The trousers were made of a khaki wool-twill, <b>pleated</b> with seven <b>belt</b> loops, two scalloped button flap rear pockets, a button fly and a four-inch military style hem. They were all most likely subcontracted by the costume department and made by famed London based cinema costumers, Angels and Bermans, to be tailored perfectly for Harrison Ford for the production.|$|R
