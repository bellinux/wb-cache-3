5000|$|CloudLocker {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{different}} <b>personal</b> <b>cloud</b> options in the market today. CloudLocker falls into the [...] "server device cloud" [...] category of <b>personal</b> <b>cloud</b> solutions. CloudLocker attempts to address the internet privacy issue by providing a <b>personal</b> <b>cloud</b> server that users keep in their sole possession. It gives them global access through any remote browser or any of a user’s internet-enabled devices. Files stored on CloudLocker can be accessed from a PC, laptop, smartphone or tablet via the StoAmigo platform with a StoAmigo account.|$|E
50|$|A <b>personal</b> <b>cloud</b> is a {{collection}} of digital content and services which are accessible from any device. The <b>personal</b> <b>cloud</b> is not a tangible entity. It is a place which gives users the ability to store, synchronize, stream and share content on a relative core, moving from one platform, screen and location to another. Created on connected services and applications, it reflects and sets consumers’ expectations for how next-generation computing services will work.|$|E

The main drawback, however, is that the speed of the transfer rate is only as fast as the network connection the data is accessed over and can therefore be fairly slow. [...] Three examples of NAS <b>personal</b> <b>clouds</b> are the My Cloud by Western Digital, the CloudBox by Lacie, and the Central by Seagate.|$|R

40|$|DOI: 10. 1016 /j. jnca. 2016. 02. 006 Filiació URV: SIUsers are unceasingly {{relying on}} <b>personal</b> <b>clouds</b> (like Dropbox, Box, etc) to store, edit and {{retrieve}} their files stored in remote servers. These systems generally follow a client–server model {{to distribute the}} files to end-users. This means that they require {{a huge amount of}} bandwidth to meet the requirements of their clients. <b>Personal</b> <b>clouds</b> with limited bandwidth budget can benefit from the upload speed of the clients interested in the same content {{to improve the quality of}} service. This can be done by introducing a peer-to-peer protocol, BitTorrent for instance, when the load on a certain content becomes high. The main challenge is to decide when to switch to BitTorrent and how to allocate the cloud's available bandwidth to the different clients. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the allocation of the cloud׳s bandwidth. Based on the current load and the predefined quality of service constraints, the algorithm identifies the most suitable protocol for each swarm and provides the corresponding bandwidth allocation. We validate the algorithm using a real trace of the Ubuntu One system and the results show important gains in the download times experienced by the clients...|$|R

Its flexible architecture enables multiple types of functionality and performance data to easily be collected about the systems it is monitoring. A unique centralized monitoring configuration approach makes Inca easy to setup and maintain on multiple systems and lends to consistent monitoring results. We are experimenting with using Inca in Cloud environments where users are interested in monitoring the functionality and performance of their <b>personal</b> <b>Clouds</b> as they are re-instantiated on different machines and locations. We believe Inca’s flexibility, easy-to-use administrative interfaces, and other features make it a natural fit for Cloud environments...|$|R

40|$|Fast {{emerging}} mobile edge computing, mobile clouds, Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber physical systems require many novel realistic {{real time}} multi-layer algorithms {{for a wide}} range of domains, such as intelligent content provision and processing, smart transport, smart manufacturing systems and mobile end user applications. This paper proposes a low cost open source platform, MODiToNeS, which uses commodity hardware to support prototyping and testing of fully distributed multi-layer complex algorithms over real world (or pseudo real) traces. MODiToNeS platform is generic and comprises multiple interfaces that allow real time topology and mobility control, deployment and analysis of different self-organised and self-adaptive routing algorithms, real time content processing, and real time environment sensing with predictive analytics. Our platform also allows rich interactivity with the user. We show deployment and analysis of two vastly different complex networking systems: fault and disconnection aware smart manufacturing sensor network and cognitive privacy for <b>personal</b> <b>clouds.</b> We show that our platform design can integrate both contexts transparently and organically and allows a wide range of analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} new {{sequencing}} technologies has generated extremely {{large amounts of}} information. To successfully apply bioinformatics tools to such large datasets, they need to exhibit scalability and ideally elasticity in diverse computing environments. We describe the application of Weaver to the PEMer structural variation detection workflow. Because the original workflow has an intractable sequential running time on large datasets, {{it also has a}} batch implementation designed for a shared file system. Using scripts provided by the developers of PEMer, along with the Weaver Python module, the Starch archive generator, and the Makeflow workflow engine, we have refactored PEMer for elastic scaling on <b>personal</b> <b>clouds.</b> Our case study describes the various challenges faced when constructing such a workflow, from dealing with failure detection, to managing dependencies, to handling the quirks of the underlying operating systems. The practice of scaling bioinformatics tools is increasingly commonplace. As such, the hands-on application of refactoring techniques to PEMer can serve as a valuable guide for those looking to reconfigure other bioinformatics software. Significantly, our customized Makeflow framework enabled elastic deployment on a wider variety of systems while substantially reducing wall clock runtimes using hundreds of cores...|$|R

30|$|Cloud {{computing}} attracts, inter alia, with scalability {{and cost}} reduction. However, cloud’s benefits {{are accompanied by}} potential harm to the users data. Existing cloud solutions can be considered synonymous with unknown locations and potentially hostile environments. Therefore security protection objectives can not be guaranteed in the cloud. Motivated by cloudâĂŹs potential we proposed {{a way to get}} rid of this drawback. We presented π-Cloud, a <b>personal</b> secure <b>cloud,</b> that enables users to benefit from cloud computing and retain data sovereignty by federating the users own resources. More precisely we presented the prototypic implementation of a Resource Manager for <b>personal</b> secure <b>clouds.</b> This includes the coordination of devices which form this cloud as well as the description of the services they provide and the description of external services. For this description an intermediary format, the Cloud Resource Description Language (CRDL) was developed as an extension of the Open Cloud Computing Infrastructure (OCCI). Since OCCI is currently limited to infrastructure services the approach has been extended to support PaaS and SaaS services as well. Furthermore, an architecture for the coordination and management of CRDL service descriptions and the respective services was developed. As a foundation for the π-Box the Resource Manager enables users to (re)gain their data sovereignty when going to the cloud. Scalability and usability of our prototype have been empirically demonstrated by extensive lab tests.|$|R
