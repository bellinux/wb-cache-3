5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a <b>protective</b> <b>effect.</b> For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no <b>protective</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no <b>protective</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Circumcision has a <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> {{against the}} risks of penile cancer in men, and {{cervical}} cancer in the female sexual partners of heterosexual men. Penile cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland). The number of new cases is also high in certain South American countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay at about 4.3 per 100,000. It is least common in Israeli Jews—0.1 per 100,000—related {{in part to the}} very high rate of circumcision of babies.|$|E
40|$|The <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> {{of three}} kinds of typical tannins: gallotannin; tannic acid and gallic acid, ellagitannin; ellagic acid, {{condensed}} tannin; bergenin, on ethanol-induced gastric lesions were tested in rats. As the results, ellagic acid and tannic acid showed <b>protective</b> <b>effects.</b> Some related compounds with catechol or its 0 -methylate or 0 -methyl pyrogallol moiety were tested. However, these compounds did not show statistically significant effects. Since tannins with pyrogallol moiety were effective for ethanol-induced gastric lesions, a mechanism of the <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> of ellagic acid and tannic acid was examined. Both compounds lost the effects in indomethacin-treated rats. These results suggested that tannins with pyrogallol moiety showed <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> for ethanol-induced gastric lesions by stimulating the production of prostaglandins in the gastric mucosa...|$|R

5|$|Polish {{studies found}} that {{although}} the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, several studies showed I.badia bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect {{is caused by a}} brown pigment, the polyphenol compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some <b>protective</b> <b>effect,</b> it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali chelators based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a bioremediation agent to clean up contaminated sites.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{has been}} shown to provide a <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> against heavy metal {{toxicity}} when associated with the host Pinus sylvestris, preventing copper accumulation in the needles, and protecting seedlings against cadmium toxicity. Owing to its frequent rate of sexual reproduction and the resulting extensive gene flow within populations, the fungus can rapidly evolve a trait to tolerate otherwise toxic levels of heavy metals in the environment. The genetic basis of this adaptation—intriguing to researchers investigating the bioremediation potential of metal-adapted plants and their fungal associates—are contained in the genome sequence of S.luteus, published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Two novel sesquiterpenes, dictyophorine A and B, {{have been}} {{identified}} from the fruit bodies of the fungus. These compounds, based on the eudesmane skeleton (a common structure found in plant-derived flavours and fragrances), are the first eudesmane derivatives isolated from fungi and were found to promote the synthesis of nerve growth factor in astroglial cells. Related compounds isolated and identified from the fungus include three quinazoline derivatives (a class of compounds rare in nature), dictyoquinazol A, B, and C. These chemicals were shown in laboratory tests to have a <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> on cultured mouse neurons that {{had been exposed to}} neurotoxins.

5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a <b>protective</b> <b>effect,</b> such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E
5|$|The <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> {{does not}} begin immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before {{arriving}} and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward). The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for {{those who live in}} areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother. The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E

5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E

40|$|Prostaglandin I 2 (PGI 2) {{has been}} shown to {{attenuate}} vascular constriction, hyperpermeability, inflammation, and acute lung injury. However, molecular mechanisms of PGI 2 <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> on pulmonary endothelial cells (EC) are not well understood. We tested a role of cAMP-activated Epac-Rap 1 pathway in the barrier <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> of PGI 2 analog iloprost in the murine model of ventilator-induced lung injury. Mice were treated with iloprost (2 μg/kg) after onset of high tidal volume ventilation (30 ml/kg, 4 h). Bronchoalveolar lavage, histological analysis, and measurements of Evans blue accumulation were performed. In vitro, microvascular EC barrier function was assessed by morphological analysis of agonist-induced gap formation and monitoring of Rho pathway activation and EC permeability. Iloprost reduced bronchoalveolar lavage protein content, neutrophil accumulation, capillary filtration coefficient, and Evans blue albumin extravasation caused by high tidal volume ventilation. Small-interfering RNA-based Rap 1 knockdown inhibited <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> of iloprost. In vitro, iloprost increased barrier properties of lung microvascular endothelium and alleviated thrombin-induced EC barrier disruption. In line with in vivo results, Rap 1 depletion attenuated <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> of iloprost in the thrombin model of EC permeability. These data describe for the first time <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> for Rap 1 -dependent signaling against ventilator-induced lung injury and pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|This review {{describes}} the recent literature on microbial exposures and <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> for asthma and atopy. Certain microorganism-associated molecular patterns {{have been identified}} as agents that might influence the development of the immune system, which in turn leads to <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> for asthma and atopy. Endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria were the first agents associated with a reduced risk for asthma and atopy. In later studies, β(1 → 3) glucans, extracellular polysaccharides, and muramic acid from, respectively, molds and gram-positive bacteria were associated with a reduced risk of allergy and asthma separately in rural and urban populations. These results already suggested that not just one but several independent microbial signals from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as molds, might play a role in explaining the <b>protective</b> <b>effects.</b> Recently, the diversity of microbial exposure has been associated with such a reduced risk in farmers' children. Surprisingly, the diversity of both fungal and bacterial exposure seemed to have <b>protective</b> <b>effects.</b> These results open new areas of research and create complex challenges. Methodological issues, such as environmental exposure characterization and assessment and elucidation of potential underlying mechanisms, are discussed because these aspects have a major influence on how microbial diversity can be studied in future studies in relation to <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> for asthma and atopy...|$|R

40|$|Activated protein C (APC) has endothelial barrier <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> {{that require}} binding to endothelial protein C {{receptor}} (EPCR) and cleavage of protease activated receptor- 1 (PAR 1) {{and that may}} play a role in the anti-inflammatory action of APC. In this study we investigated whether protein C (PC) activation by thrombin on the endothelial cell surface may be linked to efficient protective signaling. To minimize direct thrombin effects on endothelial permeability we used the anticoagulant double mutant thrombin W 215 A/E 217 A (WE). Activation of PC by WE on the endothelial cell surface generated APC with high barrier protective activity. Comparable barrier <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> by exogenous APC required a 4 -fold higher concentration of APC. To demonstrate conclusively that <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> in the presence of WE are mediated by APC generation and not direct signaling by WE, we used a PC variant with a substitution of the active site serine with alanine (PC S 360 A). Barrier <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> of a low concentration of exogenous APC were blocked by both wildtype PC and PC S 360 A, consistent with their expected role as competitive inhibitors for APC binding to EPCR. WE induced protective signaling only in the presence of wild type PC but not PC S 360 A and PAR 1 cleavage was required for these <b>protective</b> <b>effects.</b> These data demonstrate that the endogenous PC activation pathway on the endothelial cell surface is mechanistically linked to PAR 1 -dependent autocrine barrier protective signaling by the generated APC.
