5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic needle, using a <b>plunger</b> to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E
5|$|The Passing Zone {{auditioned for}} season 11 of America's Got Talent in an episode {{broadcast}} on July 5, 2016. Wee and Morse asked judge Howie Mandel {{to lie on}} the stage; Morse straddled Mandel while juggling a mouse trap, a flaming <b>plunger,</b> and a taser. Wee then jumped over Morse while continuing to juggle the items. The act was put through to the Judges Cuts round, where their knife-throwing routine ended with Mandel in a dunk tank and earned them {{a trip to the}} live shows.|$|E
5|$|Donald is {{armed with}} a special gun that can shoot plungers, popcorn or bubble gum. Donald has {{unlimited}} plungers which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with plungers), and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the <b>plunger</b> is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path.|$|E

30|$|Rod {{load reducer}} is a {{downhole}} device installed at certain depth between the well {{head and the}} pump. With dual solid <b>plungers,</b> it can produce a hydraulic feedback force to reduce the polished rod load. As shown in Fig.  3, a rod load reducer comprises dual <b>plungers,</b> a barrel and some small components. There is channel in dual <b>plungers</b> so that the fluid can pass through the device.|$|R
40|$|We studied whether motor-control {{constraints}} for grasping {{objects that}} are moved to new positions reflect a rigid constraint hierarchy or a flexible constraint hierarchy. In two experiments, we asked participants to move two <b>plungers</b> from the same start locations to different target locations (both high, both low, or one high and one low). We found that participants grasped the <b>plungers</b> had the same target heights, but these grasp tendencies were reduced when the <b>plungers</b> had different target heights. In addition, when the <b>plungers</b> had different mass distributions, participants behaved in ways that suggested still-different emphases of the relevant grasp constraints. When the <b>plungers</b> had different mass distributions, participants sacrificed bimanual symmetry for end-state comfort. The results suggest that bimanual grasp planning relies on a flexible rather than static hierarchy. Different constraints take on different degrees of importance depending {{on the nature of}} the task and on the level of task experience. The results have implications for the understanding of perceptual-motor skill learning. It may be that one mechanism underlying such learning is changing the priorities of task constraints...|$|R
5|$|Deciding to work together, Bart, Lisa, and Bob {{escape and}} try to save the dam. While Lisa and Bob set about {{defusing}} Cecil's dynamite, Bart jumps at Cecil before he can press the <b>plunger.</b> Cecil attempts to swat him off with the briefcase of money, but the case bursts open and the money is lost. Cecil manages to throw Bart off the cliff, declaring he will kill Bart as Bob never could; ironically, Bob grabs the cord of the dynamite and dives down {{in an effort to}} save him. As the two dangle {{down the side of the}} dam, Bob decides to cut the cord on the dynamite in an act of self-sacrifice to prevent Cecil from destroying the town, but his and Bart's perilous fall is broken by a conveniently placed pipe.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type <b>plunger,</b> and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

25|$|Solenoids or coils: These {{are found}} in every modern pinball machine since the flipper age. They are usually hidden under the playfield, or covered by playfield components. By {{applying}} power to the coil, the magnetic field created by electromagnetism causes a metal object (usually called a <b>plunger)</b> to move. The <b>plunger</b> is then connected mechanically to a feature or accessory on the playfield.|$|E
25|$|The C11 used a C10 motor {{fitted with}} an {{overhead}} valve cylinder head. The C11 frame was almost unchanged until 1951 when BSA added <b>plunger</b> rear suspension. Early gearboxes were weak and unreliable. The C11G was available with a three ratio gearbox and rigid frame or a four ratio gearbox and a <b>plunger</b> frame. Both models had better front brakes than earlier models. This model {{was a common}} commuter motorcycle, and many survive today.|$|E

40|$|Wear {{and failure}} modes {{exhibited}} by narrow neck press and blow (NNPB) <b>plungers</b> {{in the glass}} container industry have been related to inappropriate material selection. Problems exist with substrate and coating materials which lead to machine down time, process instability and poor product quality. Previous attempts to improve the service life of NNPB <b>plungers</b> have not examined the process operating characteristics and demanding nature of the application. New substrate and coating materials have been utilized and an assessment of their suitability for this application examined. Initial results from plant trials with modified <b>plungers</b> suggest that improvements in operational performance are achievable. This application, and other components of the mould tooling set, may benefit from improvements which may increase tool life and reduce the problems which result from the application of lubricant dopes to glass contact surfaces...|$|R

25|$|Armstrong was {{responsible}} for developing the hydraulic accumulator. Where water pressure was not available on site {{for the use of}} hydraulic cranes, Armstrong often built high water towers to provide a supply of water at pressure. However, when supplying cranes for use at New Holland on the Humber Estuary, he was unable to do this because the foundations consisted of sand. After much careful thought he produced the weighted accumulator, a cast-iron cylinder fitted with a <b>plunger</b> supporting a very heavy weight. The <b>plunger</b> would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure. The accumulator was a very significant, if unspectacular, invention, which found many applications in the following years.|$|E

Today’s technology, which mainly uses single-purpose machines where the production quality markedly depends on the abilities and activities of the operator, will replaced by modern machining centres and CNC machines for grinding all functional parts of the <b>plungers,</b> coupled with modern measuring devices. These production machines with the support of measuring devices will improve the productivity of production and the general quality of the produced components...|$|R
