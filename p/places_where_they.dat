40|$|During {{fieldwork}} {{this summer}} in a Franciscan convent in the midwestern United States, I met two Sisters who {{had returned to the}} convent after many decades of hard work. They returned to the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> come as teenagers when they made a commitment to leave their families and to serve God as religious sisters. When they joined the community, they took the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. This community of a few hundred women became their family, and this convent became their home. It is the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> have returned every summer since the day they joined the community, it is the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> retire, and it is the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> their bodies will one day rest...|$|R

5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have small}} rounded ears {{so as to}} {{minimise}} heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have colour vision, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better {{than that of the}} dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> have found food before.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
