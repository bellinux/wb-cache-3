For example, there are many well-preserved Book of the Dead funerary papyri placed in tombs to act as afterlife guides for the souls of the deceased tomb occupants. However, it was only customary during the late Middle Kingdom and first half of the New Kingdom to place non-religious papyri in burial chambers. Thus, the majority of well-preserved literary papyri are dated to this period.|$|E
5|$|Embedded in the {{calcareous}} skeleton are numerous microscopic polyps. They are connected internally {{by a system}} of canals and are concealed behind pores in the skeleton, the surface of which is smooth and lacks the corallites of true stony corals. The polyps have specialist functions, the gastrozooids processing and digesting the food caught by the dactylzooids which are grouped around them. The gastrozooids are small and plump and extend four to six tentacle stubs through their pores but are otherwise invisible. The dactylzooids have hairlike tentacles covered in cnidoblasts. Stings from the cnidocysts immobilize an item of prey and the tentacles thrust it through the mouth of an adjacent gastrozooid, from where it passes into the stomach for digestion. The polyps also extrude the coenosteum, the calcareous material of which the skeleton is composed. The coenosteum contains certain symbiotic microalgae called zooxanthellae. These are photosynthetic organisms which provide their hosts with energy and in return benefit from a <b>protective</b> <b>environment</b> in a well lit position. About 75% of the fire coral's energy requirements are provided by the zooxanthellae.|$|E

Fifteen patients with leukaemia and neutropenia spent a total of 110 weeks in plastic isolators, and none acquired any infection. Endogenous flora was effectively suppressed by topical antiseptics and gastrointestinal decontamination effected with nonabsorbable antibiotics. The isolator system was acceptable to patients and staff and much cheaper than the use of sterile rooms. Other advantages of the system are portability, easy storage, and use on ordinary open wards without prejudice to the microbiological protection afforded.

25|$|B. burgdorferi is {{injected}} into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response {{at the site of}} the bite. This provides a <b>protective</b> <b>environment</b> where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis. The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. Neutrophils, however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in the developing EM lesion. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body.|$|E

40|$|The 2011 East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami {{suddenly}} {{took the}} homes, family members, friends, and familiar neighborhoods {{away from the}} children of Iwate. In {{the midst of this}} difficult situation, early childhood development (ECD) programs provided <b>protective</b> <b>environments</b> for the young children to access continuous care and development opportunities. This case study examines how these daycare centers in Iwate prepared for, responded to, and coped with the severe natural disaster, providing physical, cognitive, and psychosocial protections to these children. The study re-affirmed that daycare centers in Iwate had integrated the national standards for disaster risk reduction (DRR). On the day of the disaster, personnel safely evacuated the children while practicing monthly drills. Despite the challenges, the daycare programs quickly re-established normalcy in children’s lives, ensuring continuous access to care. Not only did daycare personnel act in loco parentis for these children, but also re-installed daycare programs during the recovery. The study revealed that local governments also faced serious challenges in their leadership and coordination roles. Their response capacities had been severely affected by the disaster. Governments’ appropriate and timely guidance was most beneficial for the daycare providers. Among other recommendations, I assert that in the future, local governments could take more active roles in coordinating the massive influx of humanitarian organizations. This interpretivist research was based on my one-year fieldwork in Iwate immediately after the disaster, and employed a series of survey instruments (questionnaires and interviews). This case study contributes to the field of education and ECD in emergencies through the use of qualitative, ethnographic research. It also recognizes significant and complimentary contribution of qualitative inquiry methods, including on-site fieldwork, ethnographic analyses, and follow-up interviews, for better understanding of crisis situations. While pre-school programs are not compulsory in Japan, the study calls attention to the valuable protection that they provide for both young children and their childhoods in emergencies. A recovery strategy that focuses on <b>protective</b> <b>environments</b> for children has great potential as a harmonizing approach, rather than as a parallel one, in the complex nature of humanitarian assistance. ...|$|R

2500|$|Several major {{transitions}} in shell pattern and morphology {{can be observed}} during the life of Haliotis asinina. The species has a pelagobenthic life cycle that includes a minimal period of three to four days in the plankton. Biomineralisation begins shortly after hatching, with the fabrication of the larval shell (protoconch) over about a 10-hour period. The initial differentiation of biomineralising cells is likely to include a localised thickening of the dorsal ectoderm followed by an invagination of cells to form the shell gland. The shell gland then evaginates to form the shell field which expands through mitotic divisions to direct the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) via the secretion of organic molecules. In this way the larval shell (protoconch) is formed. The construction of the haliotid protoconch is complete following torsion. These structures allow the veliger larva to completely retract into a <b>protective</b> <b>environment</b> and rapidly {{fall out of the}} water column.: ...|$|E
40|$|Vietnam’s rapid {{economic}} growth has provided young Vietnamese new opportunities unheard of in their parents’ generation. This is, however, {{not the case for}} ethnic minority youth. Many of them are among the poorest, least healthy, and least educated. Ethnic minorities, who tend to live in remote mountainous areas, account for 15 percent of Vietnam’s 84 million total population and, according to a recent estimate, 61 percent of them are poor. Evidence suggests that despite recent efforts of the Government of Vietnam in promoting poverty reduction in remote areas, a majority of ethnic minorities have not yet experienced positive change, contrary to their Kinh (i. e., ethnic Vietnamese) neighbors who have enjoyed substantial improvement in living standards. In 2007, well over half of ethnic minorities ages 15 - 29 grew up in impoverished households. Many of these young people have already taken or will soon take on economically active and reproductive roles as young adults.

40|$|In this research, the {{response}} of AZ 91 D granules during In-Situ melting as a novel technique for investment casting of magnesium alloy was investigated. In order to assess the melting behaviour, the granules were heated at 700 °C for 30 min under three different <b>protective</b> <b>environments,</b> including covering flux, argon atmosphere and their combination. Thermal analysis experiments were carried out to disclose the heating profile of the granules and to detect any probable characteristic temperatures.

The results showed that the granules underwent a severe oxidation when heated under the covering flux solely. However, the detected characteristic temperatures revealed that they experienced melting process during heating although they failed to produce a molten metal pool. Flowing argon gas not only prevented the granules from oxidation suffering, also assisted them to provide molten metal. It was further observed that using covering flux remarkably contributed to an increase in the feasibility of the granules melting in an argon atmosphere...|$|R

There is a paucity of research about why Irish young people misuse benzodiazepines. In this study, people between 18 and 25  years attending substance misuse services in the south of Ireland (N =  13) were interviewed in a semi-structured style between June 2012 and April 2013. Content analysis was performed. The main motivations for benzodiazepine misuse were to self-regulate negative emotions and to induce dissociation from their environment. Interviewees also described the consequences of benzodiazepine misuse, such as disengagement from family relationships and other <b>protective</b> <b>environments</b> such as school and sports clubs. The consequences of chronic misuse were discussed, such as the compulsion to take more benzodiazepines despite experiencing severe side-effects. The incidence of paradoxical aggression on benzodiazepines is also explored. Education about benzodiazepines and their risks to young people, families, and the public may reduce benzodiazepine misuse.

40|$|Farming practices, {{in which}} one {{organism}} (here: "the host") promotes {{the growth of the}} organism it relies on for food (here: "the symbiont"), are not restricted to human hosts. Among the non-human farmers, ants are particularly successful. Farming is an example of mutualism: an interaction between different species which is beneficial for all those involved. The evolutionary stability of mutualism in the light of potential conflicts of interests between the partners still remains incompletely understood. Various mechanisms may aid alignment of differing interests and resolve host-symbiont conflicts. Farming mutualisms are well-suited for studying these mechanisms. The three most important arenas of potential conflict in farming mutualisms concern symbiont reproduction, symbiont transmission / dispersal and symbiont (genetic) diversity. Here, these three symbiont characteristics and the control mechanisms governing them are reviewed for the two best-known cases of ant fanning: (1) fungus-growing by attine ants and (2) Homoptera-tending by various groups of ants. Cross-system comparison of these ant farming systems highlights several universal patterns potentially governing the evolutionary stability of these successful mutualisms: Many systems are characterised by reduced symbiont dispersal and diversity (often in association with asexual reproduction and vertical transmission), possibly promoted by specific ant behaviours, such as creation of <b>protective</b> <b>environments.</b> Frequently, these systems function as networks, with the focal species interacting with additional species, highlighting a promising new take on classic mutualisms...|$|R
40|$|Tantalum alloys {{are one of}} the {{refractory}} metals with renewed consideration for high temperatures in fusion reactor applications. Tantalum alloys perform well in <b>protective</b> <b>environments</b> but are oxidized readily in gases containing higher oxygen levels. In addition, the radioactive isotope Ta- 182 would be produced in tantalum and could be a significant contributor to dose if mobilized. Other isotopes of importance are produced from tungsten and hafnium. Mobilization of activated products during an accident with air ingress is therefore a safety issue. In this study, we measured the extent of oxidation and mobilization from tantalum alloy T- 222 oxidized in flowing air between 500 and 1200 degrees C. This alloy nominally contains 10 wt% tungsten, 2. 5 wt% hafnium and 0. 01 wt% carbon. We found that the mobilization of Ta and Hf was closely linked to the occurrence of oxide spalling. These elements showed no migration from the test chamber. Some W was mobilized by volatilization as evidenced by transport from the chamber. Tungsten volatilization could occur primarily during initial stages of oxidation before the formation of an oxide scale impedes the process. The mobilization of Ta and W are presented in terms of the mass flux (g/m 2 -h) as a function of test temperature. These measurements along with specific designs, activation calculations, and accident scenarios provide information useful for dose calculations of future fusion devices...|$|R

Even though {{potential}} impacts {{of political and}} legal environments of business on ethical behavior of firms (EBOF) have been conceptually recognized, not much evidence (i. e., empirical work) has been produced to clarify their role. In this paper, using Bayesian causal maps (BCMs) methodology, relationships between legal and political environments of business and EBOF are investigated. The unique design of our study allows us to analyze these relationships based on the stages of development in 92 countries around the world. The EBOF models structured through BCMs are used to explain how EBOF in a given country group are shaped by how managers perceive political, legislative, and <b>protective</b> <b>environments</b> of business in these countries.
