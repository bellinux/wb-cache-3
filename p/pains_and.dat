5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint <b>pains,</b> <b>and</b> a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pain</b> <b>and</b> {{distress}} in animal research adversely affects animal welfare and scientific quality, {{as well as}} erodes public support for research. Journal requirements for inclusion of detailed information on animal welfare in submitted manuscripts, including how animal <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress were addressed, would likely increase scientist attention to <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress and thus improve science and animal welfare. In order to examine this issue further, we analyzed and compared thirty nine journals for instructions to authors in regards to animal <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress. The analysis also sought {{to determine the extent}} to which <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> {{distress in}}formation is reported in these journals and whether journal reporting requirements and animal use policies influence this reporting. Two randomly selected articles involving animal use that potentially caused <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> / or distress were chosen from recent issue(s) of each journal and examined for inclusion of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress information. The data show that instructing authors to report <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress information influences authors to include <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress information in articles. Having an animal use policy or statement that mentions <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress also encourages reporting of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress information...|$|R

40|$|The aims {{of these}} studies were to {{investigate}} some aspects of elderly patientsí <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress, related to their sense of coherence (SOC), need for social support, functional ability, and background variables and to compare patientsí reported experiences of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress with nursesí assessments. The first study investigated <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress from elderly patientsí perspective using a grounded theory approach in intensive care. Interviews and observations were conducted with 18 patients. A model, developed from the analysis of data, describes elderly patientsí experiences of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress as four interrelated aspects: a sensory, an intellectual, an emotional, and an existential dimension. Sixteen categories form the four dimensions. Questionnaires derived from this model were used in studies II-V. Study II compared elderly patientsí (n = 51) reported experiences of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress with nursesí (n = 44) and enrolled nursesí (n = 37) assessments in intensive care. The patientsí self-reported experiences of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress did not agree completely with the nursesí and enrolled nursesí assessments. Nurses overestimated some of the patientsí experiences; whereas enrolled nurses tended to underestimate the patientsí <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress and assessed the interventions as more sufficient than did their patients. The third study explored postoperative experiences of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress in elderly patients. One-hundred patients who had undergone elective surgery in two orthopaedic and two surgical units were interviewed, using a structured interview format on three occasions. Logistic regression analyses showed that <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress were significantly related above all to type of surgery and SOC. Three different clusters of patients, who showed variations in their experiences of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress, were identified. Study IV compared experiences of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress among older chronic pain patients in the community with enrolled nursesí assessments and related potential differences to patient and enrolled nurse characteristics. Data were collected through personal interviews with 38 patients and questionnaires completed by 38 enrolled nurses. Enrolled nurses underestimated patientsí experiences of physical <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> discomfort, breathing problems, resignation, and dependency. Personality as a nurse characteristic seemed to influence the enrolled nursesí assessment of patientsí <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress. The fifth study identified various profiles of experiences of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress experiences among older chronic <b>pain</b> patients <b>and</b> compared if background variables, SOC, functional ability, and experiences of interventions aimed at reducing <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress varied between the profiles of patients. Interviews were carried out with 42 elderly patients. A cluster analysis yielded three clusters, each representing a different profile of patients. One profile, with subjects of advanced age, showed a decreased functional ability, and favourable scores {{in most of the}} categories of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress. Another profile of patients showed favourable mean scores in all categories. The third cluster of patients showed unfavourable scores in most categories of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress. In conclusion, the assessment of patientsí <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress could be more systematic in acute health care {{as well as in the}} community. Nurses need to become aware of possible biases related to <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress assessment as a result of personality factors and other variables. Patients in postoperative care, as well as in the community, with less favourable scores of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress had a weaker SOC compared with patients with more favourable <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> distress scores. The differences suggest that there is a need to treat the patients in different ways in the caring situation...|$|R

5|$|Michigan, led by {{the young}} and hot-headed Mason, responded {{with the passage of}} the <b>Pains</b> <b>and</b> Penalties Act just six days after Lucas County was formed; the act made it a {{criminal}} offense for Ohioans to carry out governmental actions in the Strip, under penalty of a fine up to $1,000, up to five years imprisonment at hard labor, or both. Acting as commander-in-chief of the territory, Mason appointed Brigadier-General Joseph W. Brown of the Third U.S. Brigade to head the state militia, with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio trespassers. Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own, and he soon sent forces to the Strip area. The Toledo War had begun.|$|E

40|$|Background Pain, neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} (NPS) {{and functional}} impairment are prevalent {{in patients with}} dementia <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> is hypothesized to be causal in both neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and functional impairment. As {{the exact nature of}} the associations is unknown, this review examines the strength of associations between <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> NPS, <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> physical function in patients with dementia. Special attention is paid to the description of measurement instruments and the methods used to detect <b>pain,</b> NPS <b>and</b> physical function. Methods A systematic search was made in the databases of PubMed (Medline), Embase, Cochrane, Cinahl, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. Studies were included that described associations between <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> NPS and/or physical function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. Results The search yielded 22 articles describing 18 studies, including two longitudinal studies. Most evidence was found for the association between <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> depression, followed by the association between <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> agitation/aggression. The longitudinal studies reported no direct effects between <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> NPS but some indirect effects, e. g. pain through depression. Although some association was established between <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> NPS, <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> physical function, the strength of associations was relatively weak. Interestingly, only three studies used an observer rating scale for pain-related behaviour. Conclusions Available evidence does not support strong associations between <b>pain,</b> NPS <b>and</b> physical function. This might be due to inadequate use or lack of rating scales to detect pain-related behaviour. These results show that the relationship between <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> NPS, as well as with physical function, is complicated and warrants additional longitudinal evaluation...|$|R

The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at Westminster Abbey, on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she thought she had been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|While in Lexington for a {{deposition}} on May 26, 2002, Wilkinson began to experience chest <b>pains</b> <b>and</b> {{was admitted to}} St. Joseph's Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with arterial blockages and scheduled him for arterial bypass surgery. Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the mass on June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on life support on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002. Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue life support after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw life support, and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002. He was originally buried at Blue Grass Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date of death for his marker.

5|$|For reasons {{related to}} class and race, {{it had been}} unthinkable before the war for the West Indies to appoint a black Test captain, but the postwar world saw social and {{political}} changes in the Caribbean. Although opinion was still divided over the merits of a black captain, Headley was appointed {{as one of the}} West Indian captains for the series against the England team which toured the Caribbean in 1948. Crab Nethersole, the former Jamaican captain and member of the Board of Control for cricket, argued Headley should be outright captain but a compromise was reached. Headley was scheduled to captain the first and fourth Test matches, played in Barbados and Jamaica, and the white players Gerry Gomez and John Goddard were given the captaincy of the second and third matches. In the event, Headley only played in the first Test. In the first innings, he scored 29 but strained his back while fielding. Batting towards the end of West Indies' second innings, he scored seven not out. Rain helped England to draw the match. Headley's back caused him to miss the second and third Tests, but he was fit enough to play for Jamaica when the tourists arrived there to play two games against the island before the fourth and final Test. After the first island game, in which he scored 65, Headley's request to miss the second match to rest his back was refused by the Jamaican Board. He scored 36 not out, but aggravated his back <b>pains</b> <b>and</b> he withdrew from the final Test. West Indies won this game under the captaincy of Goddard, who had earlier led West Indies to victory in the third Test. He was subsequently chosen to captain West Indies in India in 1948–49, despite Headley's availability and apparently superior claims to the position.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pain</b> <b>and</b> fear {{are both}} {{aversive}} experiences that strongly impact on behaviour and well being.
