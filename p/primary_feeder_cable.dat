40|$|Ranking {{problems}} arise {{in a wide}} range of real world applications where an ordering on a set of examples is preferred to a classification model. These applications include collaborative filtering, information retrieval and ranking components of a system by susceptibility to failure. In this extended abstract, we present an ongoing project to rank the underground <b>primary</b> <b>feeders</b> of Consolidated Edison Company of New York according to their susceptibility to outages. We describe our framework and the application of different machine learning ranking methods along with experiments on concept drift detection. Between the high-voltage transmission system and the household-voltage secondary system, electricity is sent through <b>primary</b> distribution <b>feeders,</b> <b>cables</b> which move energy around the New York city area. There are three regions of interest 1 – Manhattan, Brooklyn/Queens and Bronx – which together have over 1000 feeders. Individual feeders fail with some regularity. On average there were over five failures per day over all regions during summer 2007. Our goal was to create an ordered list of feeders in the system ranked from most susceptible to failure to least susceptible. There are a number of challenges. The number of attributes is very large, while failures are relatively rare. The system is believed to exhibit concept drift, where the causes of failures change significantly over the course of the year. Many of the attributes are in the form of time series which must be aggregated. Other attributes map to feeder sub-components (e. g. cable sections, averagin...|$|R

50|$|The {{cause of}} the outages - which was {{undetermined}} for five days - {{appeared to be the}} company's decision to continue supplying power to the 400,000 people serviced by twenty-two <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> after ten of them had failed, overloading the remaining twelve. After these were repaired, a manhole-to-manhole inspection and repair of smaller cables which had also burned took place. Consolidated Edison was due to make an initial status report, regarding the outage, on August 2, 2006. Data submitted by Con Edison in August, 2006 indicated that the failed <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> had been in service an average of 16 years, with the oldest failed cable 59 years old.|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{tremendous}} development of GSM services over the last years, the number of related services used by organizations has drastically increased. Therefore, monitoring GSM services is becoming a business critical issue {{in order to be able}} to react appropriately in case of incident. In order to provide with GSM coverage all the CERN underground facilities, more than 50 km of leaky <b>feeder</b> <b>cable</b> have been deployed. This infrastructure is also used to propagate VHF radio signals for the CERN’s fire brigade. Even though CERN’s mobile operator monitors the network, it cannot guarantee the availability of GSM services, and for sure not VHF services, where signals are carried by the leaky <b>feeder</b> <b>cable.</b> So, a global monitoring system has become critical to CERN. In addition, monitoring this infrastructure will allow to characterize its behaviour over time, especially with LHC operation. Given that commercial solutions were not yet mature, CERN developed a system based on GSM probes and an application server which collects data from them via the CERN GPRS network. By placing probes in strategic locations and comparing measurements between probes, it is possible now possible to determine if there is a GSM or VHF problem on one leaky <b>feeder</b> <b>cable</b> segment. This system has been successfully working for several months in underground facilities, allowing CERN to inform GSM users and fire brigade in case of incidents...|$|R

5000|$|If {{there is}} a fault on the <b>primary</b> <b>feeder,</b> the {{substation}} circuit-breaker is meant to open, disconnecting the <b>primary</b> <b>feeder</b> from one side. The problem is that this primary cable is also connected to a network transformer, which is interconnected to other network transformers on its secondary side. The secondary network will energize the <b>primary</b> <b>feeder</b> through the network transformer. This can be very dangerous, because a fault {{will continue to be}} 'fed' from the secondary network side of transformer. Even without a fault, if the electric utility wants to perform maintenance on that primary cable, they must have a way to fully disconnect that primary cable, without worrying about the cable being energized by the secondary network through the network transformer. Thus, the network protector is designed to open its contacts if the relay senses backwards flowing current.|$|R

The limit lengths of <b>feeder</b> <b>cable</b> were determined as 1, 000 m for octagon loop detector and 900 m for circle loop detector, respectively.

40|$|In {{deformed}} massive sulfide deposits, it {{is commonly}} difficult to distinguish between primary stockwork mineralization and remobilized sulfides that occupy late cleavages and deformation structures, and the mechanism of formation of the deformation veins is not always clear. An analysis of sulfide vein networks associated with two massive sulfide deposits of the Iberian Pyrite Belt is presented {{as an example of}} this complexity. Variscan deformation has affected the massive sulfide-related stockworks at La Zarza and Tharsis and {{led to the formation of}} sulfide-bearing deformation veins. The <b>primary</b> <b>feeder</b> stockwork has a complex mineralogical composition with pyrite-rich veins rimmed by narrow Co-As assemblages (e. g., cobaltite and arsenopyrite). Interstitial galena, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite minerals are also observed. The vein set developed during deformation was emplaced within cleavage and shear planes characteristic of the regional south-verging tectonics. Away from massive sulfides, the characteristic minerals of the syntectonic veins are pyrite and quartz. However, deformation veins developed in contact with <b>primary</b> <b>feeder</b> veins and massive sulfide have Co-As–rich rims and base metal sulfides similar to the <b>primary</b> <b>feeder</b> veins. The development of the complex vein paragenesis within the stockwork zones is explained in terms of regional-scale deformation models...|$|R
