5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having the <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his building plan despite the franchise's 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened.|$|E

25|$|The {{survivors}} of Jamestown were taken aboard the Deliverance and the Patience, and the colony was abandoned. Gates intended to transport all the settlers back to England, but the fortuitous arrival of another relief fleet, bearing Governor Lord De la Warre, granted Jamestown a reprieve. All the settlers were put ashore again, and Sir George Somers returned to Bermuda aboard the <b>Patience</b> <b>to</b> obtain more food. (Somers died there, and his nephew, Matthew Somers, {{the captain of}} the Patience, sailed the vessel to Lyme Regis in England, instead, to claim his inheritance).|$|E

When <b>Patience</b> goes <b>to</b> buy the candy, she is unable to find the sixpence. Martha calls Patience a liar for not bringing her candy and both girls go back to class crying.

25|$|In a May 1609 {{voyage to}} Virginia, Virginia Company {{treasurer}} Sir Thomas Smith arranged for about 500 colonists to come along, including women and children. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank {{in a storm}} soon after leaving the harbour, and the Sea Venture with flotilla admiral Sir George Somers aboard wrecked on the Bermuda Islands. They finally {{made their way to}} Jamestown one year later in May 1610, after building the Deliverance and <b>Patience</b> <b>to</b> take most of the passengers and crew of the Sea Venture off Bermuda, with the new governor Thomas Gates on board.|$|E

At 3:30am, {{at the suggestion of}} two doctors in the Red Cross camp, Hou Dejian and Zhuo rode in an ambulance to the northeast corner of the Square and spoke with Ji Xinguo, the political commissar of the 336th Regiment, who relayed the request to command headquarters, which agreed to grant safe passage for {{the students}} to the southeast. At 4:00 am, the lights on the Square abruptly shut, signalling the end of the army's <b>patience.</b> <b>To</b> break the students' spirits, Company No. 5 of the 2nd Bridgade, 334th Regiment knocked down the Goddess of Democracy statue {{at the north end of}} the Square.

Zoey's mother, a captive-bred {{orangutan}} named Lucky, didn't know how to care for her new baby, having never seen it done in the wild. As a result, little Zoey had to be placed in the care of Mrs. Miles, a primatologist at the zoo, and the only character with the time and <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> be Zoey's foster parent. Molly tries her hardest {{to get used to the}} new family member, even making Zoey her current-events project for school, but after having her homework destroyed and her mother's time taken up by the baby orangutan she gives up and begins desperately wanting things to be normal again. After Zoey ingests a bottle of shampoo and has to be rushed to the hospital, Molly learns what it truly means to be a big sister and to care about Zoey, no matter how much trouble she causes.|$|E
25|$|In August 1609, John Smith {{was quite}} {{surprised}} to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him. London was sending new settlers with no real planning or logistical support. Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the Sea Venture. (Bermuda, or the 'Somers Isles', had remained settled since 1609, and the Virginia Company's possession was made official in 1612 when it was added to Virginia's territory.) Gates soon {{found that there was}} not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor, Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda with the <b>Patience</b> <b>to</b> gather more food for Jamestown but died there. The Patience, captained by his nephew, then sailed for England instead of Virginia.|$|E

Parkin and VanOrd criticized the stronghold-takeover missions.

Marchiafava praised the game's side activities, saying that the diversions increased its replayability. Davis criticized the missions' repetition, but liked their quantity.|$|E

Hogg's mother attempted to teach her ladylike skills such as needlework, but Hogg claimed that she [...] "never had the <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> succeed".

Polygon considered the game's strategic elements, such as deciding whether to go on offense or defense, to be its most interesting aspect. Others focused on TumbleSeed art and movement mechanics, as Wired reviewer appreciated the slow process of learning how best to navigate the game and additionally found a new aspect to appreciate each time she played it. Some disagreed {{as to whether the}} game's challenge was appropriate and never malicious, or often unbalanced and frustrating compared to its rewards. The randomness of each basecamp's power-up offerings also contributed to uneven difficulty between playthroughs.|$|E
