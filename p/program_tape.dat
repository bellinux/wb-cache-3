5000|$|... #Caption: A <b>program</b> <b>tape</b> for the 1944 Harvard Mark I, one of {{the first}} digital computers. Note {{physical}} patches used to correct punched holes by covering them.|$|E
50|$|A {{very small}} (about 20 instructions) {{bootstrap}} loader {{could be held}} at the front of each <b>program</b> <b>tape,</b> but even this approach was not always used. Tape labels were (with the exception of COBOL and Tape Control managed applications) almost non-existent. A grandfather/father/son cycle of tape rotation protected production tapes from major disasters, but required careful manual controls. Programmers (or for operational suites Production Control staff) gave the operator written instructions on which <b>program</b> <b>tape</b> and data tapes to load, on which devices, and a written summary of how to load and initiate each program. The operator would then load the tapes, and load and initiate each program in turn manually from the console.|$|E
50|$|The {{input and}} output were in decimal numbers, with a decimal {{exponent}} and the units had special machinery for converting these to and from binary numbers. The {{input and output}} instructions would be read or written as floating point numbers. The <b>program</b> <b>tape</b> was 35 mm film with the instructions encoded in punched holes.|$|E

5000|$|The show took {{telephone}} requests {{which were}} then mixed into the following-night <b>program</b> <b>tape.</b> Its big feature {{was the voice of}} the D.J. who was identified as the [...] "Night Hawk", but whose voice some mistook as a clone of Wolfman Jack. He was heralded over the sound effects of a massive steam train which gave the impression the Texas Night Train was chugging its way across Texas.|$|E
50|$|The {{term has}} become {{standard}} among event and corporate video engineers since 2001. It {{is named after}} a video engineer Wayne Stockton based in Phoenix, Arizona. Due to an undetected audio board failure in a Sony Betacam SP recorder, Wayne unfortunately recorded the video without any audio, rendering the <b>program</b> <b>tape</b> useless. Event production companies started adding an extra video record deck {{in addition to the}} ones ordered by the clients as a safety record.|$|E
50|$|The {{operator}} then {{removed the}} bootstrap tape, snapped {{in the tape}} containing the regular loader, carefully arranging it so it wouldn't jam, and pressed a few more buttons to start up the bootstrap program. Once the regular loader was in, the computer was ready to read in a <b>program</b> <b>tape.</b> The regular loader read a more compact format tape than the bootstrap loader. Each block began with a starting address so the tape could be rewound and retried if an error occurred. If any mistakes {{were made in the}} process, or if the program crashed and damaged the loader program, the process had to be restarted from the beginning.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{engineers}} Gerry Block and Burgess Macneal devised a preview system of mastering vinyl which allowed about 10-20% more music per disc while not sacrificing dynamic range. The preview tape head was positioned far enough before the <b>program</b> <b>tape</b> head {{to allow the}} disk computer enough time to measure the peaks in low frequency and thereby expand the feed appropriately for the greater excursions of groove modulation they produce. The ne-plus-ultra Compudisk system was unveiled at the 1980 AES Convention, alongside the Zuma Disk Computer (made by John W. Bittner) and the Neumann VMS-80 lathe, which had its own advanced Disk Computer, on board.|$|E
5000|$|Trek {{developed}} {{out of a}} {{brainstorming session}} between Mike Mayfield and several high school friends in 1971. The original Star Trek television show had only recently ended its run and was still extremely popular. Mayfield and his [...] "geek friends" [...] wrote down a number of ideas for a game, and during the summer holidays he then started incorporating {{as many of them}} as he could on an SDS Sigma 7, using an illicitly borrowed account at the University of California, Irvine. Later that summer Mayfield purchased an HP-35 calculator and often visited the local Hewlett-Packard sales office looking for help using it. The company offered time on a HP 2000C time-sharing computer system if he would port his Star Trek game to it. HP distributed this version of the game as [...] "STTR1" [...] on its Contributed <b>Program</b> <b>tape</b> library.|$|E
50|$|A typical UNIVAC I {{installation}} {{had several}} ancillary devices. There were, typically: a printer that read a magnetic tape and printed output on continuous-form paper; a card-to-tape converter, that read punched cards and recorded their images on magnetic tape; and a tape-to-card converter, that read a magnetic tape and produced punched cards. There was no UNIVAC provided operating system. Operators loaded on a UNISERVO a <b>program</b> <b>tape</b> {{which could be}} loaded automatically by processor logic. The appropriate source and output data tapes would be mounted and the program started. Results tapes {{then went to the}} offline printer or typically for data processing into short term storage to be updated with the next set of data produced on the offline card to tape unit. The mercury delay line memory tank temperature was very closely controlled as the speed of sound in mercury varies with temperature. In the event of a power failure, many hours could elapse before the temperature stabilized.|$|E

40|$|Over 200 noncommercial radio {{stations}} {{responded to a}} survey to gather data {{on the characteristics of}} member stations and to sample the opinion of nonmembers toward a cooperative network concept. A second survey of 18 networks sought to gather indepth information on network operation. Results showed that 22. 2 percent of the stations surveyed were participating in program cooperatives, and over 79 percent felt that network participation would be beneficial. It was concluded that the cooperative <b>program</b> <b>tape</b> network should continue in order to fulfill specialized programing needs. A copy of the two questionnaires, the letter of transmittal, and the mailing list is appended. A list of the networks that participated in the study, 12 statistical tables, and a 20 -item bibliography are included. (Author/DS) l...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{electrical}} power system (EPS) analysis of the planned Shuttle Transportation System Flight 1 mission are presented. The capability of the orbiter EPS to support the planned flight and to provide <b>program</b> <b>tape</b> information and supplementary data specifically requested by the flight operations directorate was assessed. The analysis was accomplished using the orbiter version of the spacecraft electrical power simulator program, operating from {{a modified version of}} orbiter electrical equipment utilization baseline revision four. The results indicate that the nominal flight, as analyzed, is within the capabilities of the orbiter power generation system, but that a brief, and minimal, current overload may exist between main distributor 1 and mid power controlled 1, and that inverter 9 may the overloaded for extended periods of time. A comparison of results with launch commit criteria also indicated that some of the presently existing launch redlines may be violated during the terminal countdown...|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports on}} {{a case study of}} mental {{training}} for 470 class vachtsmen. The subjects were six men who have participated in international races. The mental training was planned in line with the mental training system. The mental training consisted mainly of psychological tests(TSMI and TEG), counseling, and a mental management <b>program</b> <b>tape.</b> Main results were as follows: 1) In interviewing, the effect of mental training was thought to differ from man to man, supposedly due to their attitude towards mental training. 2) In their pre-and post-game psychological states, the mental training was effective for sport motivation(TSMI). And from the viewpoint of transactional analysis(TEG), it was found that one pair had good transaction, and the others has bad ones. These results suggested that mental training has some effect on athletes. But there remain problems to solve in developing mental training for individuals and pairs, and in bridging the gap between the coach's goal and the athlete's goal...|$|E
