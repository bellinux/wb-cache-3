40|$|Foundation, {{and method}} for the {{production}} of such a foundation. It is proposed that it be based on prefabricated concrete elements. The elements consist of base elements (2) and end elements (4). Each element is provided with two sockets for receiving <b>pretensioning</b> cables (6), which sockets are situated at a distance from each other, viewed in the vertical direction, and extend over the full length of the element. End elements are provided with further sockets relating to the other direction in which such end elements extend. After the elements have been placed against each other {{in the form of a}} closed curve, the tensioning cables are fitted in the sockets concerned and <b>pretensioning</b> is applied by means of <b>pretensioning</b> anchors comprising <b>pretensioning</b> nuts. Thereafter, the <b>pretensioning</b> anchors are sealed off relative to the environment, and the foundation is ready for use. Delft University of Technolog...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Graft <b>pretensioning</b> {{is used in}} {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction to prevent secondary slackening. Its effects on collagen fibrillar ultrastructure are not known. In this study, we hypothesized that graft <b>pretensioning</b> in ACL reconstruction creates ultrastructural changes detectable in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Methods A prospective comparative study was carried out on 38 ACL reconstructions using a 4 -strand semitendinosus graft. Samples were harvested intra-operatively before and after <b>pretensioning</b> for 30 s, 2 or 5 min. The images produced in SEM were analyzed using an original semi-quantitative «CIP» score taking into account collagen cohesion, integrity, and parallelism. Intra- and inter-tester reliability for the CIP score were tested. Results The CIP scores decreased by 3. 5 (1. 6) points after <b>pretensioning</b> (P < 0. 05). Significant {{differences were found in}} the 5, 2 min and 30 s subgroups for the global CIP score. Relative decrease (Delta CIP) was significantly higher in the 2 and 5 min subgroups after <b>pretensioning</b> in comparison with the 30 s subgroups. Intra- and inter-tester reliability for the CIP score were 0. 85 and 0. 92 (P < 0. 05). Conclusion <b>Pretensioning</b> ACL grafts resulted in alteration of the collagen fibrillar ultrastructure, detectable using SEM. These results confirm the existence of collagen ultrastructural changes after <b>pretensioning</b> that may be related to its duration.

40|$|Recent {{deterioration}} of prestressed concrete bridge beams in New Zealand {{and around the}} world highlights an escalating problem. 1 – 3 Corrosion of <b>pretensioned</b> reinforcement is especially critical because of the highly stressed nature of these structures; a small amount of corrosion of a <b>pretensioned</b> strand results in a considerable reduction in the structural capacity of the member. The Tiwai Point Bridge is located in a highly aggressive coastal environment in the South Island of New Zealand. The structure was opened to traffic in 1969 and replaced in 2009 – 2010 because of severe corrosion of the <b>pretensioned</b> reinforcement. Nineteen of the 42 -year-old beams were set aside as test specimens for a destructive and nondestructive testing program. This paper forms part of a larger study that aims to develop a methodology for nondestructive assessment of the resid-ual strength of beams that have experienced corrosion of <b>pretensioned</b> reinforcement. Opportunities to measure the capacity of full-scale beams with corroded <b>pretensioned</b> reinforcement are relatively rare, and although a number of testing programs have been conducted around the world, each study provides {{only a small number of}} actual destruc-■ Destructive tests were performed on 19 decommissioned <b>pretensioned</b> concrete bridge beams that had corroded pre-tensioned reinforcement. The beams were from the 1969 Tiwai Point Bridge in Southland, New Zealand. ■ The condition of the beams tested ranged from good condi-tion to those with severe corrosion in 4 of the 21 prestressed strands. ■ A proposed methodology for assessment of the residual strength of beams with corroded <b>pretensioned</b> reinforcement was shown to provide an effective means of estimating the number of corroded strands that should be disregarded in calculation of the residual strength.

25|$|The main {{minority}} grievance {{regards the}} appointment of muftis. The Greek government started appointing muftis instead of holding elections {{after the death of}} Mufti of Komotini in 1985 (which is a failure to implement Law 2345/1920 according to Cultural Survival), although the Greek government maintained that as the practice of state-appointed muftis is widespread (including in Turkey), this practice should be adhered to in Greece, and as the muftis perform certain judicial functions in matters of family and inheritance law, the state ought to appoint them. Human Rights Watch alleges that this is against Lausanne Treaty which grants the Muslim minority the right to organize and conduct religious affairs free from government interference (although it is unclear whether issues such as inheritance law are religious matters). As such, there are two muftis for each post, one elected by the participating faithful, and one appointed by Presidential Decree. The elected Mufti of Xanthi is Mr Aga and the government recognized one is Mr Sinikoğlu; the elected Mufti of Komotini is Mr Şerif and the government recognized one is Mr Cemali. According to the Greek government, the elections by which Mr Aga and Mr Şerif were appointed were rigged and involved very little participation from the minority. As <b>pretension</b> of (religious) authority is a criminal offence against the lawful muftis under the Greek Penal Code, both elected muftis were prosecuted and on conviction, both were imprisoned and fined. When, however, the case was taken to the European Court of Human Rights, the Greek government was found to have violated the right to religious freedom of Mr Aga and Mr Şerif.|$|E

The present investigation has the objective to present {{an examination of the}} analytical modeling of <b>pretensioned</b> members undergoing nonlinear vibrations. Two approximate nonlinear analysis are developed to model general structural arrangements which include beam-columns and <b>pretensioned</b> cables attached to a common nucleus, such as may occur at a joint of a <b>pretensioned</b> structure.

500|$|The social {{historian}} James Hammerton defines [...] "Pooterism" [...] as [...] "the dependent {{weakness and}} inflated social <b>pretension</b> of white-collar workers, {{constructed in the}} workplace but expressed just as powerfully at home". Jon Wilde of The Guardian observes this characteristic {{in a number of}} British TV comedy creations of the late 20th and early 21st centuries: Captain Mainwaring, Victor Meldrew, and Peep Shows Mark Corrigan are all examples of characters [...] "whose blinkered view of themselves is forever in sharp contrast to how they are perceived by the world". Charles Pooter, says Hammerton, was a metaphor for lower middle-class <b>pretension,</b> pomposity and self-importance, set up for mockery by the [...] "elites". [...] However, by the mid-20th century changes in the perception of masculine roles in lower middle-class society had stifled the mockery, as men increasingly embraced domesticity. [...] Hammerton remarks that the Grossmiths [...] "would surely appreciate the irony in seeing features of the lower middle-class existence they mocked so mercilessly becoming the more universal model for 20th century family life". Bailey remarks on how the poet John Betjeman presented the Pooters [...] "not as objects of ridicule but of envy, snug and secure in their suburban retreat".|$|E
