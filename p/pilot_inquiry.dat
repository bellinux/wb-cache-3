40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to analyze the {{knowledge}} the term “ecological corridor”. An <b>pilot</b> <b>inquiry</b> on "ecological corridor" definition and function was conducted. The understanding of the term, as well as, the basic knowledge of ecological corridors functions were tested using the questionnaires given to the group of 63 students representing different academic disciplines (humanities - 22 persons, life sciences - 21 persons and exact sciences - 20 persons). Most of respondents (except from natural sciences students) never heard the term “ecological corridor”. Quite a few participants were not able to give an example of ecological corridor. What is more, humanists frequently pointed that the highway underpasses for wildlife would be a good example of “ecological corridor”. The most frequently indicated function of corridors was “migration of animals and plants”. The results suggest that the knowledge of investigated term is usually very theoretical and quite abstract that was especially apparent within the “naturalists” group. Alina Gerlé...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} {{is taken from}} a <b>pilot</b> <b>inquiry</b> into patient experiences of general surgery provided in National Health Service hospitals. This study sought to identify how the cross section of patients facing general surgery experienced communication and information problems particular to their surgical 'settings', how such discontent is understood or rationalised by them, and consequently {{how it would be}} reported to relatives or researchers. Drawing on interviews with patients and surgical staff, the paper explores the range of communication difficulties facing certain types of patient which arise from the hospital setting and the routines and rituals of service providers. While it is concluded that communication should be explored with some reference to disease classification, this should not divert attention from the general context of care to the unique circumstances of patient or surgeon. It is questioned whether patients are always disposed to rationalise their difficulties in terms of 'dissatisfaction' in the way required by survey research. Drawing on interview-generated comments by patients and staff, the paper illustrates less obvious validity problems for patient satisfaction studies, and addresses briefly questionnaire design which may account for them. communication patient satisfaction surgery...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of medical technologies has to answer several questions ranging from {{safety and effectiveness}} to complex economical, social, and health policy issues. The type of data needed to carry out such evaluation depends on the specific questions to be answered, {{as well as on}} the stage of development of a technology. Basically two types of data may be distinguished: (a) general demographic, administrative, or financial data which has been collected not specifically for technology assessment; (b) the data collected with respect either to a specific technology or to a disease or medical problem. On the basis of a <b>pilot</b> <b>inquiry</b> in Europe and bibliographic research, the following categories of type (b) data bases have been identified: registries, clinical data bases, banks of factual and bibliographic knowledge, and expert systems. Examples of each category are discussed briefly. The following aims for further research and practical goals are proposed: criteria for the minimal data set required, improvement to the registries and clinical data banks, and development of an international clearinghouse to enhance information diffusion on both existing data bases and available reports on medical technology assessments...|$|E

40|$|The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has {{conducted}} a successful <b>pilot</b> <b>inquiry</b> {{into the computer}} services sector, collecting sales by type of service ‘product’. The size of the computer services market in 2000 was £ 32. 0 bn, with IT consultancy, computer facilities management and systems integration being the largest three activities. This is the first National Statistics official source of detailed service sector sales by product. Following a development period of only six months, a detailed classification of computer services has been devised, according to which businesses {{have been able to}} provide data. The survey has been conducted and published within six months, achieving 77 per cent response from sampled businesses. Useful lessons have been learnt in surveying service sector industries for this type of detailed information. Background This inquiry is viewed as a study into the feasibility of a SERVCOM inquiry (albeit possibly limited to key sectors) similar to the existing PRODCOM 1 (PRODucts of the European COMmunity) Inquiry which measures sales of manufactured products. The computer services industries (Division 72 of NACE 2 (the EC classification of economic activity)), were piloted following the Performance Innovation Unit Report E-commerce @ its. - best. uk 3, which supported DTI proposals for new five-digit codes for e-commerce enabling industries within the UK Standard Industrial Classification 4 (SIC(92)). The computer services industries are amongst {{the most important of these}} enabling industries. However, it was felt that industry based proposals would be both difficult to implement and of limited value in the fast-moving and converging IT services industry. It was decided that a product based approach (“SERVCOM”) would have more chance of success. Potential Benefits of Detailed Services Information A range of initiatives has been put in place by the ONS over recent years to improve the quality and availability of service sector statistics, for example the newly developing Index of Services (IoS), the Corporate Services Price Index (CSPI) and improvements to th...|$|E

50|$|As {{hardware}} became smaller, {{he developed}} the <b>PILOT</b> language (Programmed <b>Inquiry,</b> Learning Or Teaching) that {{made it easy for}} non-programmers to write sequences of machine-administered teaching or testing using the time-share terminals in use in 1970, and then microcomputers when they became available a decade later.The National Library of Medicine adopted PILOT as its primary computer language for the dissemination and exchange of computer-based instructional materials in the health sciences, and used it for instructing medical librarians in using MEDLINE. Starkweather chaired a working group for the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers from 1987 through 1991 that established standards for PILOT. The language was in active use for many years. However, the introduction of microcomputers also attracted capital to a budding software industry, and this ended the early period when most non-business software was created in universities; Starkweather thereafter turned his energy to administration.|$|R

Immediately after completing his master's degree, Beckham enlisted in the Air Force with aspirations to be a pilot in World War I. Beckham’s application came during a time of serious segregation within the armed forces. The Air Force rejected Beckham’s application; it would be decades before an African American became an Air Force <b>pilot.</b> After persistent <b>inquiry,</b> the Air Force told Beckham that he could best serve his country by being a War Professor of Psychology at Wilberforce University. Beckham remained at Wilberforce, a private university that served African Americans, from 1917 until 1920. From 1920 until 1924, Beckham studied at Columbia University and New York University. During this time he was the editor of a newspaper called the New York City Dispatch, he also worked closely with the New York public schools.|$|R

This study used experimental methodology to test the possibility of positively influencing the dispositions of occupational educators toward desktop VR through application of prime theory in a context of supplantation and technology self-efficacy theory. Supraliminal bipolar primes were used to test whether a positive disposition more conducive to VR adoption could be created in a sample of 30 occupational educators prior to introduction of a desktop VR presentation, with “disposition ” defined as a pair of specific performance measures. Intended as a <b>pilot</b> study, this <b>inquiry</b> used ANOVA and correlation statistical analyses to produce sufficient indications of relationships between positive primes, VR viewing time, and perceived confidence in VR to merit recommendation of further investigation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} a pilot study in under-taking phenomenological qualitative inquiry for culturally competent research. The pilot work was conducted in preparation for a dissertation on Korean-American family dementia caregiving. The definition and useful functions of pilot studies in qualitative inquiry are particularly identified. To highlight the benefits of pilot work, it describes the specific practical and methodological issues emerging in the pilot exercise as well as the modifications made for the main study {{as a result of the}} pilot work. The implementation of the pilot exercise proved to be essential in four ways. These comprise (1) finding issues and barriers related to recruiting potential participants, (2) engaging the use of oneself as a researcher in a culturally appropriate way and from a phenomenological perspective, (3) reflecting the importance of the epoche process and its difficulty in conducting phenomenological inquiry, and (4) modifying interview ques-tions. Finally, the value of sharing the pilot study to develop culturally competent research practice is addressed.

40|$|The {{theme for}} this master study is teacher students’ {{mathematical}} meanings about the function concept. Meanings are representations of cognitive schemes, {{which can be}} observed through {{the behavior of the}} person, for example through answers on tasks. This study is part of a bigger research project connected to Patrick W. Thompsons’ research about secondary mathematics teacher’s meanings. The instrument Mathematical Meanings for Teaching secondary mathematics (MMTsm), developed by American researchers, is used in this study. In my study, students’ meanings about the concept of functions have been studied by analyzing teacher students’ written answers on tasks in the instrument MMTsm addressing the research question: What does the instrument MMTsm reveal when used to explore in depth Norwegian mathematics teacher education students meanings about the concept of functions? This study is defined as a qualitative <b>inquiry</b> <b>pilot</b> study, where constructivist learning theory is used as the theoretical framework. The student’s individual thinking and meanings are in focus. Moreover, the instrument is developed within the constructivist framework. Qualitative data were collected as written answers to selected tasks in the instrument. The answers have been analyzed using an analysis tool that is developed and based on the interpretation tool that Thompson developed alongside the instrument. The findings from this master study reveal that the students expressed a diversity of different meanings about the concept of functions and that the kind of meanings expressed about concepts and ideas connected to the concept of function are highly individualistic. This master study shows that several students do not have fully developed meanings and that they therefore express themselves in an unclear and vague manner. From the analysis of the written answers, {{it can be argued that}} several of the meanings that have been expressed are likely to create confusion amongst the students they will teach in schoo...|$|R
40|$|On social {{networking}} services, sharing is caring. However, {{depending on who}} or what is involved, sharing can {{be the source of}} a community transgression, copyright infringement, a violation of employment policies or worse. If people who use social media, mobile messaging apps and social devices do not know where the ethical or legal lines are drawn, in jurisprudence, in vendor Terms of Service, in professional codes of conduct or in keeping with online social norms, they are in jeopardy of being publicly shamed or even sued. Users may also put their employers, friends and colleagues at risk of community, professional or legal penalties in an era where the boundary between work and leisure is becoming even more blurred. This mixed-methods, interdisciplinary research project explores the current state of awareness on a range of legal and ethical issues involving User-Generated Content (UGC) and other forms of Electronically Stored Information (ESI) on social networks and devices for personal and enterprise use and for several different constituencies, including marketers, artists, journalists, academics, educators, entrepreneurs, bloggers, photographers and videographers. The quantitative, numeric data resulting from an online survey as well as qualitative, descriptive data gathered from semi-structured interviews with participants and observations gleaned in contextual inquiry will help address gaps in current research on this subject. In addition, the research findings will guide design directions for a tool, intervention or affordance to help users become better informed about privacy, intellectual property and information governance in the context of electronic sharing and more easily put this knowledge into practice. The first phase of developing the survey protocol is already underway, with a literature review completed and the survey submitted for IRB review as # 1602921512. <b>Pilot</b> contextual <b>inquiries</b> and field studies are being pursued to guide development of qualitative research phases in the future. 1.
