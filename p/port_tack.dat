25|$|Race three {{initially}} {{looked good}} for Oracle as Spithill luffed Team New Zealand at the reach mark to successfully draw a penalty. Oracle held the lead {{for the first}} downwind leg, and were 18 seconds to the good heading into the upwind third leg. The pivotal moment of the race occurred when Barker brought the New Zealand boat back on <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> within three boat lengths of the boundary. Oracle was forced to tack away due to the boundary rights, {{even though they were}} on starboard which would have otherwise have had right of way. The 29 second lead at the top mark was held by the Kiwis {{all the way to the}} finish, crossing 28 seconds ahead of the Americans to go 0–3 up.|$|E
500|$|At 09:00, Duncan {{made the}} signal to prepare for battle while De Winter {{organised}} his ships into a line of battle to meet the British attack in a solid defensive formation, sailing on the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> in a northeasterly heading. As they manoeuvred into their assigned stations, the Dutch fleet drew closer to the shore. Duncan intended to follow Lord Howe's manoeuvres at the Glorious First of June three years earlier and bring each ship through the Dutch line between two opponents, but the Dutch formation and proximity to the shore rendered this plan impractical. To compensate, Duncan signalled for his ships to form line and sail southeast on the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> so {{that they had the}} wind directly behind them. Shortly afterwards, concerned that the Dutch might make the shoreline before he could bring them to battle despite his wry insistence that [...] "I am determined to fight the ships on land if I cannot by sea", Duncan ordered his fleet to turn southwards and advance on the enemy and [...] "bear up and sail large". He fired signal guns to alert his captains and then ordered them to [...] "engage the enemy as arriving up" [...] and for his [...] to attack the Dutch rear. At 11:00, Duncan sought to remedy increasing gaps between his vessels by ordering the faster ships to slow down and wait for their compatriots. He then made an effort to re-establish the line on the starboard tack before realising that the Dutch fleet was still in order awaiting the British attack and continually drawing closer to the dangerous coastline. Abandoning his previous signals, Duncan ordered the entire fleet to turn towards the Dutch and attack directly, each ship to [...] "steer for and engage her opponent". Many of these signals were poorly executed and incorrect, visibility was low and Trollope's squadron was still using obsolete signal codes, so a number of vessels failed to comprehend Duncan's intentions, turning the advancing line into a ragged pattern of scattered vessels clustered into two loose groups. The flurry of orders was so quick and contradictory that at least one captain gave up entirely: the Scottish captain, John Inglis, of HMS Belliqueux threw his signal book to the deck in frustration and shouted [...] "Up wi' the hel'lem and gang into the middle o't." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{course for}} the 34th America's Cup has been {{especially}} designed {{to take advantage of}} the San Francisco Bay to bring the racing within easy viewing of the shore for the first time. The starting area is furthest away from the shore, close to the Golden Gate Bridge. The boats are only allowed to enter the starting box two minutes before the gun. The boat entering on <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> is allowed to enter ten seconds before the starboard tack boat. This is to reduce the danger of having two boats travelling at up to [...] heading towards each other into the starting area.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom," [...] said he, {{resuming}} {{his place}} at the wheel, [...] "go and nail a bit of canvas over that hole. You'll find materials down below. We'll have to steer into <b>port</b> on this <b>tack,</b> 'cause {{if we try to}} go on the other, she'll sink like a stone. I only hope the wind'll hold as it is. Look alive now!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Upwash {{from the}} sails - the airflow {{around the top}} of the mast is {{distorted}} by the presence of the sails. This effect varies with the sails set at the time, the wind speed and the point of sail, but is noticed by the true wind angle changing from <b>port</b> to starboard <b>tack,</b> and the true wind speed changing from when beating to running ...|$|R
5000|$|The lug sail, or lugsail, is a fore-and-aft, four-cornered sail that is {{suspended}} from a spar, called a yard. When raised the sail area overlaps the mast. For [...] "standing lug" [...] rigs, the sail {{remains on the}} same side of the mast on both the <b>port</b> and starboard <b>tacks.</b> For [...] "dipping lug" [...] rigs, the sail is lowered partially to be brought around to the leeward side of the mast in order to optimize the efficiency of the sail on both tacks.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on 6 April 1776, a lookout on Andrew Doria sighted two vessels to the southeast. Biddle passed {{word of the}} {{discovery}} to Hopkins who ordered the fleet {{to head for the}} strangers. The larger of the unidentified ships headed toward the Americans and before long she was within hailing distance and identified herself as [...] "... his majesty's ship of war Glasgow...." [...] A broadside from Cabot into the British frigate opened a fierce fight in which the American ships were unable to fight as a squadron. In attempting to avoid a salvo from Glasgow, Cabot crossed Andrew Dorias bow, forcing Biddle's brig onto a <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> which avoided collision but took her away from the action. Meanwhile, Alfred and Columbus, Hopkins' largest warships, took on Glasgow but received worse punishment than they inflicted.|$|E
2500|$|Race 2 narrative: Alinghi {{received}} a penalty {{for being in}} the pre-start area before the designated time. There was very little pre-start maneuvering. BMW Oracle Racing started on starboard tack ahead of Alinghi on <b>port</b> <b>tack.</b> Alinghi sailed faster than during the previous race and benefited from a 20-degree wind shift, which put the Swiss boat in the lead at about {{the midpoint of the}} first leg. But after crossing ahead, Alinghi fell behind after tacking for the lay line. BMW Oracle Racing then proved to be much faster on the first reach, pulling about 2 kilometers ahead (26.8 kt vs. 25.2 kt average speed). [...] The final delta includes the penalty turn by Alinghi. Without the penalty turn the delta would have been around 4 minutes. Winds were 7 to 8 knots. Partial timings for the winner were 0h59 to upwind mark, 0h29 to gybe mark, 0h39 to finish.|$|E
2500|$|... "I had {{resolved}} on {{a voyage}} around the world, {{and as the}} wind {{on the morning of}} April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the Spray had been moored snugly all winter. The twelve o'clock whistles were blowing just as the sloop shot ahead under full sail. A short board was made up the harbor on the <b>port</b> <b>tack,</b> then coming about she stood to seaward, with her boom well off to port, and swung past the ferries with lively heels. A photographer on the outer pier of East Boston got a picture of her as she swept by, her flag at the peak throwing her folds clear. A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since {{conditions}} are always changing somewhat, a sailor must keep evaluating which <b>tack,</b> <b>port</b> or starboard {{is actually the}} most favorable. So with these concepts in mind, when the desired destination is exactly to windward, the most efficient strategy is given by the old racing adage to [...] "Tack on a header." [...] This is true because if before the wind changed both tacks were exactly equal - neither one was more favorable, then since a header on one tack is automatically a lift on the other, the opposite tack has just become the more favorable one and the helmsman should tack and change course for the most efficient passage.|$|R
50|$|Freestyle is a timed event {{which is}} judged. The {{competitor}} {{who has the}} greatest repertoire, or manages to complete most stunts, wins. Freestyle is about show and competitors are judged on their creativity. Both the difficulty {{and the number of}} tricks make up the final score. Sailors who perform tricks on both <b>tacks</b> (<b>port</b> and starboard), and perform the tricks fully planing score higher marks. High scoring moves include Shaka, Burner (funnel ponch), Double Forward Loops, the Funnell (invented by freestyle champion Ricardo Campello in memory of Andy Funnell), the Chachoo and the Clew First Puneta (switch stance Spock), Eslider, and Flaka. The latest freestyle windsurfing has been well documented in the film Four Dimensions.|$|R
50|$|Compasses on sailboats {{may have}} {{additional}} lubber lines at forty-five {{degrees from the}} centerline. This represents about {{as close to the}} wind as the average boat will sail. These lubber lines may be used when sailing close hauled to see if you are on the closest course to your destination, without having to add or subtract the 45 degrees every few minutes, or recalculate your required heading every time you tack. The main line on the compass reads your current (close-hauled) heading and the leeward lubber line will read the bearing to your destination, regardless of whether you are on <b>port</b> or starboard <b>tack.</b> Lubber lines also help you to see windshifts when racing. If you are sailing close-hauled with good trim and you notice that your bearing to the windward mark starts to drift outside the lubber line (angle becoming greater than 45 degrees) you are being headed, and should consider tacking.|$|R
2500|$|At one point, the tugs succeeded {{turning the}} Star of Bengal on the {{starboard}} tack, but she immediately reverted to the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> when either {{due to a}} sudden change in direction of the wind or due to an error on part of the Star of Bengals crew, her sails were filled aback. This resulted in a more dangerous situation, pushing all three vessels towards the rocky shore of Coronation island. The two tugs continued to struggle to pull the Star of Bengal out of danger, but the ships continued to drift leeward. Both tugs started to experience mechanical problems with their boilers due to overloading, and the Hattie Gage also developed structural problems with her mast mounting. At 3:50a.m. the Star of Bengal dropped her anchors in [...] of water. Pulled into less than [...] of water and occasionally as close as [...] to the land, the tugs finally severed the hawsers at 4:00a.m., steamed out of danger, and found shelter from still strengthening wind [...] away, behind Warren Island.|$|E
60|$|The two vessels held {{away on the}} <b>port</b> <b>tack.</b> As the polacre {{approached}} the gunboats, a sudden bustle was observed on board them.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{can keep}} her {{hammering}} ahead close-hauled on the <b>port</b> <b>tack,</b> it's all I ask," [...] Vane laughed. [...] "You needn't call me unless the sea gets steeper." ...|$|E
60|$|I was not {{a hundred}} yards from her when the wind came again in a clap; she filled on the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> and was off again, stooping and {{skimming}} like a swallow.|$|E
60|$|She {{ran off to}} the eastward, {{hugging the}} shore with the wind on her {{starboard}} quarter. About three {{miles east of the}} entrance of the harbour she came over on the <b>port</b> <b>tack.</b>|$|E
60|$|They sailed on the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> for an {{hour and}} then came round again. The {{brigantine}} could no longer be seen from the deck, and could only just be made out from the crosstrees.|$|E
60|$|In the {{old days}} the navigators used to strive {{as far south as}} 64 degrees or 65 degrees, into the Antarctic drift ice, hoping, in a favouring spell, to make westing at a prodigious rate across the extreme-narrowing wedges of longitude. But of late years all shipmasters have {{accepted}} the hugging of the land all the way around. Out of ten times ten thousand passages of Cape Stiff from east to west, this, they have concluded, is the best strategy. So Captain West hugs the land. He heaves-to on the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> until the leeward drift brings the land into perilous proximity, then wears ship and heaves-to on the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> and makes leeway off shore.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{the wind}} comes {{more from the}} east, {{as long as we}} can sail we are to head {{northwest}} or else lie to on the <b>port</b> <b>tack.</b> If it shifts more to the south, we are to lie to on the starboard tack." ...|$|E
60|$|The wind returned, and the PYRENEES, her deck {{smoking and}} shimmering {{in the bright}} gray light, ran off dead to leeward. Then she worked back, <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> and {{starboard}} tack, crisscrossing her track, combing the sea for the Acteon Islands, which the masthead lookouts failed to sight.|$|E
60|$|This time, having {{missed the}} boat, {{and not being}} in the same {{position}} as in the previous instances, Wolf Larsen was compelled to resort to a different manœuvre. Running off before the wind with everything to starboard, he came about, and returned close-hauled on the <b>port</b> <b>tack.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Wyllard {{smiled at}} him. [...] "If you took that up {{the wrong way}} I'm sorry. She ought to work off on the <b>port</b> <b>tack,</b> and when we've open water to leeward you can heave her to. When it moderates we {{can pick up the}} beach again." ...|$|E
60|$|I came on deck to {{find the}} Ghost heading up close on the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> and cutting in to {{windward}} of a familiar spritsail close-hauled on the same tack ahead of us. All hands were on deck, for they knew that something was to happen when Leach and Johnson were dragged aboard.|$|E
60|$|Another {{week has}} passed, {{and we are}} to-day, by observation, sixty miles due south of the Straits of Le Maire, and we are hove-to, in a driving gale, on the <b>port</b> <b>tack.</b> The glass is down to 28.58, and even Mr. Pike {{acknowledges}} that {{it is one of}} the worst Cape Horn snorters he has ever experienced.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} we were hove {{to on the}} <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> under upper-topsails and foresail. The wind {{had come out of}} the south-west, and our leeway was setting us down upon the land. Captain West gave orders to the mate to stand by to wear ship. Both watches had been taking in sail, so that both watches were on deck for the manoeuvre.|$|E
60|$|When all was ready, {{the word}} “hard-a-lee” was passed forward {{to me from}} man to man; and the Ghost heeled about on the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> with {{practically}} no noise at all. And what little there was,—the slapping of a few reef-points and the creaking of a sheave in a block or two,—was ghostly under the hollow echoing pall in which we were swathed.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{know the}} fog-signals. One blast {{means that a}} ship steers to starboard, two to port, three astern, four that it is unmanageable. But this man asks such dreadful {{questions}} {{at the end of}} each chapter. Listen to this: `You see a red light. The ship is on the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> and the wind at north; what course is that ship steering to a point?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lingard {{crossed over}} to the port side, and looked {{steadily}} at the sooty mass of approaching vapours. After a moment he said curtly, [...] "Brace up for the <b>port</b> <b>tack,</b> Mr. Shaw," [...] and remained silent, with {{his face to the}} sea. A sound, sorrowful and startling like the sigh of some immense creature, travelling across the starless space, passed above the vertical and lofty spars of the motionless brig.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's the rottenest kind of rig," [...] {{the captain}} admitted: [...] "all {{blooming}} pocket-handkerchiefs! {{and not one}} sailor-man on deck! Ah, if she'd only been a brigantine now! But it's lucky the passage is so plain; there's no manoeuvring to mention. We get under weigh before the wind, and run right so till we begin to get foul of the island; then we haul our wind and lie as near south-east as may be till we're on that line; 'bout ship there and stand straight out on the <b>port</b> <b>tack.</b> Catch the idea?" ...|$|E
60|$|I called Captain Oudouse's {{attention}} to it, {{only to be}} informed that he had watched it going down for several hours. There was little to do, but that little he did very well, considering the circumstances. He took off the light sails, shortened right down to storm canvas, spread life lines, {{and waited for the}} wind. His mistake lay in what he did after the wind came. He hove to on the <b>port</b> <b>tack,</b> which {{was the right thing to}} do south of the Equator, if--and there was the rub--IF one were NOT in the direct path of the hurricane.|$|E
60|$|I shall {{begin at}} the beginning--{{yesterday}} afternoon. For it was yesterday afternoon, five weeks to a day since we emerged from the Straits of Le Maire into this gray storm-ocean, that once again we found ourselves hove to directly off the Horn. At {{the changing of the}} watches at four o'clock, Captain West gave the command to Mr. Pike to wear ship. We were on the starboard tack at the time, making leeway off shore. This manoeuvre placed us on the <b>port</b> <b>tack,</b> and the consequent leeway, to me, seemed on shore, though at an acute angle, to be sure.|$|E
60|$|The Arangi {{was beating}} {{out between the}} coral patches of the narrow channel into {{the teeth of the}} brisk trade wind. This necessitated {{frequent}} tacks, so that, overhead, the mainsail was ever swooping across from <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> to starboard tack and back again, making air-noises like the swish of wings, sharply rat-tat-tatting its reef points and loudly crashing its mainsheet gear along the traveller. Half a dozen times, as it swooped overhead, Jerry leaped for it, mouth open to grip, lips writhed clear of the clean puppy teeth that shone in the sun like gems of ivory.|$|E
60|$|Marston pondered. He knew Harry Wyndham {{rather well}} and had noted, {{in moments of}} {{excitement}} and strain, a curious recklessness that was perhaps not altogether normal. For example, there was the race when Red Rose and another yacht met close-hauled. Red Rose was on the <b>port</b> <b>tack,</b> and the rule was she must give way, but, until the last minute, Harry sat unmoved at the tiller. Marston remembered the piled-up foam about the plunging hulls as the yachts converged, the slanted pyramids of sail {{that looked as if}} they must shock, and the horrible tension he had felt. Then, when collision was imminent, Wyndham gave the other room and afterwards laughed.|$|E
60|$|But {{the wind}} was light, the Pyrenees' bottom was foul, {{and she could not}} beat up against the strong {{westerly}} current. At the end of two hours she had lost three miles. The sailors worked eagerly, as if by main strength they could compel the PYRENEES against the adverse elements. But steadily, <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> and starboard tack, she sagged off to the westward. The captain paced restlessly up and down, pausing occasionally to survey the vagrant smoke wisps and to trace them back to the portions of the deck from which they sprang. The carpenter was engaged constantly in attempting to locate such places, and, when he succeeded, in calking them tighter and tighter.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looked as}} if she'd weather it all right till eight bells on Friday mornin', when every thread of canvas was blown off the spars, leavin' us wallowin' in a chop sea that stove the bulwarks an' swept the decks clean before we could heave her to on the <b>port</b> <b>tack</b> by settin' the lower main-tops'l. By this time the fo'castle was drownded out, an' all hands bunked in the cabin till Saturday, {{when there was no}} more watches below, for she was takin' water so fast that {{everybody}} up to the captain had to stand by the pump. We managed to keep the old barkey afloat till Sunday, when the long-boat an' yawl--the gig had been stove--were launched.|$|E
