500|$|American {{officials}} said {{according to the}} New York Times that Hillary Clinton's increasingly cordial relationship with the young Pakistani foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar paid dividends in resolving the dispute between both countries over the Salala incident. A final agreement on the wording of Clinton's statement of her conversation with Khar came {{after a week of}} marathon talks that included two trips to Islamabad by General John R. Allen, the US commander in Afghanistan, and a quickly arranged weekend trip by Thomas R. Nides, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources. In recent weeks Nides and Pakistani Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh had spearheaded the negotiations to reopen the supply lines. After weeks of behind-the-scenes phone calls, e-mails and meetings between Nides and Abdul Hafeez Shaikh reached an agreement on the terms for the reopening of the NATO supply lines. Besides the US apology both sides agreed to the following: After initially demanding as much as $5,000 for each truck Pakistan dropped its insistence on a higher transit fee for each truck carrying NATO’s nonlethal supplies from Pakistan into Afghanistan and agreed to keep the fee at the current rate of $250. The Obama Administration will ask Congress to reimburse Pakistan about $1.2 billion for costs incurred by 150,000 Pakistani troops carrying out counterinsurgency operations along the border with Afghanistan. [...] "With the GLOCs open, we will look to pay past coalition support fund claims," [...] Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby said, using a Pentagon acronym for the supply routes. The United States military reimburses by [...] "coalition support funds" [...] Pakistan for logistical, military and other support provided to American military operations against militants, but these payments have been suspended since Pakistan shut off the routes. More precisely the US halted <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> from Pakistan as tension rose between the two countries.|$|E

Republicans claimed that he was simply passing the state's fiscal {{problems}} on to future generations by borrowing his way to balanced budgets. Indeed, the 2005 state budget called for <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> by underfunding a state employees' pension fund by $1.2 billion.|$|E

2500|$|Matisse's wife Amélie, who {{suspected}} {{that he was}} having an affair with her young Russian emigre companion, Lydia Delectorskaya, ended their 41-year marriage in July, 1939, dividing their possessions equally between them. [...] Delectorskaya attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest; remarkably, she survived with no serious after-effects, and instead returned to Matisse and worked with him for the rest of his life, [...] running his household, <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> typing his correspondence, keeping meticulous records, assisting in the studio and coordinating his business affairs.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1901 the Corwin was towed from Port Townsend to Esquimalt {{and hauled}} out for refitting. [...] She then {{spent most of}} that summer tied to the dock for nonpayment of the {{dockyard}} bill. Captain West, who had spent {{the early part of}} the season as second mate on an east coast collier, was eventually sent west with $2000 to settle up. [...] After <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> he set about finding work for the vessel to pay her keep. [...] A plan to charter her out for halibut fishing was vetoed by F.W. Huestis, president of the Corwin Trading Company, reportedly because of insurance costs.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1960, the CIA {{began to}} recruit anti-Castro Cuban exiles in the Miami area. Until July 1960, {{assessment}} and training {{was carried out}} on Useppa Island and at various other facilities in South Florida, such as Homestead AFB. Specialist guerrilla training took place at Fort Gulick, Panama and at Fort Clayton, Panama. The force that became Brigade 2506 started with 28 men, who initially were told that their training was being paid for by an anonymous Cuban millionaire émigré, but the recruits soon guessed who was <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> calling their supposed anonymous benefactor [...] "Uncle Sam", and the pretense was dropped. The overall leader was Dr. Manuel Artime while the military leader was José [...] "Pepe" [...] Peréz San Román, a former Cuban Army officer imprisoned under both Batista and Castro.|$|E

6000|$|At length, General Fox {{arrived at}} Minorca--and at length {{permitted}} Col. Graham {{to go to}} Malta, but with means miserably limited. In fact, the expedition was at a stand for want of money; when Troubridge arriving at Messina to co-operate in it, and finding this fresh delay, immediately offered all that he could command of his own. [...] "I procured him, my lord," [...] said he to Nelson,"1500 of my cobs--every farthing and every atom of me shall be devoted to the cause." [...] "What can this mean?" [...] said Nelson, {{when he learned that}} Col. Graham was ordered not to incur any expenses for stores, or any articles except provisions!--"the cause cannot stand still for want of a little money. If nobody will pay it, I will sell Bronte and the Emperor of Russia's box." [...] And he actually pledged Bronte for L6600 if there should be any difficulty about <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b> The long-delayed expedition was thus, at last, sent forth; but Troubridge little imagined in what scenes of misery he was to bear his part. He looked to Sicily for supplies: it was the interest, as well as the duty of the Sicilian government to use every exertion for furnishing them; and Nelson and the British ambassador were on the spot to press upon them the necessity of exertion. But, though Nelson saw with what a knavish crew the Sicilian court was surrounded, he was blind to the vices of the court itself; and resigning himself wholly to Lady Hamilton's influence, never even suspected the crooked policy which it was remorselessly pursuing. The Maltese and the British in Malta severely felt it. Troubridge, who had the truest affection for Nelson, knew his infatuation, and feared that it might prove injurious to his character, as well as fatal to an enterprise which had begun so well, and been carried on so patiently.|$|E
