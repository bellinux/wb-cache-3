To verify {{the effectiveness of a}} water pollution source mapping system, we made a model water pool in which a fish robot pursues infrared measurements of reflection to various colors {{at the bottom of the}} pool. The model of water pollution consists of various color maps, an LED emitting infrared, and a <b>photo-transistor</b> sensing the same wave length light. Different color has different reflectivity for the same light source; therefore this simulation model imitates the diffusion of water pollution sources. For real tests, an LED and the <b>photo-transistor</b> can be replaced with particular water pollution sensors. Water pollution maps can be composed based on the known mote location information by identifying motes. To get improved position data between the motes, directional sensors such as magneto-resistive sensors and accelerometers are applied to compensate noise components due to waves and the swing actions of the tail fin.

30|$|In conclusion, to test light-trapping of Si, four {{samples were}} prepared: bare-Si, square masked-pattern, MWCNT etch-masked Si with isopropyl-alcohol {{dispersion}}, and MWCNT etch-masked Si with HMDS dispersion. The MWCNT etch-masked Si with HMDS dispersion (sample D) showed the height RMS roughness and lowest reflectance {{as compared to}} the other three tested Si samples. The reflectance was most significant at mid-UV region and less significant at infrared. Based on the RMS roughness and reflectance experiments, two device structures were fabricated with active regions of bare-Si and CNT etch-masked Si and tested under dark and at UV illumination. While both devices showed a similar behavior indicating increased current at UV illumination, the PS indicating the ratio of the current change at UV-illumination over the current under dark much sharply increased with the test device of CNT etch-masked Si. The increased photo response can be due to the increased surface roughness and decreased reflectance and thus the increased light-trapping. This result can find applications in such devices as photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, photo-diodes, and <b>photo-transistors,</b> where the light-tramping is important.|$|E

40|$|Monolayer {{two-dimensional}} transitional metal dichalcogenides, such as MoS 2, WS 2 and WSe 2, are direct {{band gap}} semiconductors with large exciton binding energy. They attract growing attentions for opto-electronic applications including solar cells, photo-detectors, light-emitting diodes and <b>photo-transistors,</b> capacitive energy storage, photodynamic cancer therapy and sensing on flexible platforms. While light-induced luminescence has been widely studied, luminescence induced by injection of free electrons could promise another important applications of these new materials. However, cathodoluminescence is inefficient due to the low cross-section of the electron-hole creating process in the monolayers. Here {{for the first time}} we show that cathodoluminescence of monolayer chalcogenide semiconductors can be evidently observed in a van der Waals heterostructure when the monolayer semiconductor is sandwiched between layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with higher energy gap. The emission intensity shows a strong dependence on the thicknesses of surrounding layers and the enhancement factor is more than 1000 folds. Strain-induced exciton peak shift in the suspended heterostructure is also investigated by the cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that MoS 2, WS 2 and WSe 2 could be promising cathodoluminescent materials for applications in single-photon emitters, high-energy particle detectors, transmission electron microscope displays, surface-conduction electron-emitter and field emission display technologies.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} instruments {{designed to}} measure the tone-volume of the piano. The tone-volume depends {{on the amount of}} kinetic energy which the player spends on striking the key. The kinetic energy is in direct proportion to the mass set in motion and is the square of the velocity. The mass set is always constant and the energy depends only upon the velocity of the hammer. Thus it is possible to analyze the tone-volume by measuring the velocity of the hammer. Electronic digital devices generally have great advantages over analog ones in the field of physical measurement. The velocity is converted to the time interval by <b>photo-transistors</b> and flip-flop. The signal opens the gate, through which flows a clock pulse of 100 KHz.

30|$|There {{are four}} types of eye {{tracking}} technologies: limbus tracking, image tracking, electro-oculography, and corneal reflection. Limbus tracking devices use infrared LEDs and <b>photo-transistors</b> to track the gaze through the reflection off of the iris and sclera of the infrared light off the eye. The image tracking devices use a camera to detect the gaze direction. Electro-oculography devices use electrodes placed near the eye to detect electrical potential between the cornea and retina to determine eye movement and gaze. Corneal reflection devices utilize the reflection of light off the convex cornea surface. The BioMuse (BioControl Systems, Bellevue, WA, USA) is an electro-oculography device that is available for eye tracking. The BioMuse allows for eye tracking; however, the vertical movements become unreliable due to the reflex motion of blinking [127]. The Headhunter Head and Eye Tracking System (ISCAN, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) is a limbus tracking device [128]. It tracks the reflection of infrared light off the cornea or pupil. The EyeGaze System (LC Technologies, Inc., Fairfax, VA, USA) is also an image tracking [129]. The center of {{the lens of the}} eye is illuminated with IR light. A camera then processes the reflection off of the eye and determines the gaze direction. The Dual Purkinje Image Eye Tracker (Fourward Optical Technologies, Inc., Buena Vista, VA, USA) utilizes the Purkinje image to determine eye gaze. The Purkinje 1 reflection is compared to the Purkinje 4 reflection to determine the gaze direction.|$|E

Its optimal opto-microwave dynamic performance is then analyzed versus voltage biasing conditions for opto-microwave continuous wave measurements.

An opto-microwave scanning near-field optical microscopy (OM-SNOM) is performed using these optimum bias conditions to localize the region of the SiGe HPT with highest frequency response. The OM-SNOM results are key to extract the optical coupling of the probe to the HPT (of 32. 3 %) and thus the absolute respon-sivity of the HPT.

Practical aspects including device physical geometry, object scattering profile, LC material, and focusing effect of LCML on an object are considered during the design process with the support of ZEMAX simulations. An optimised effective focal length (EFL) has been calculated for the designed LCML to best relay the objects or contents on a paper to the TFPT pixel plane. The designed LCML devices are fabricated with the optimised EFL, and they have good phase depth profiles which are close to a spherical lens profile. Preliminary test results show that the combination of a TFPT imager with an LCML array can make the image contrast more than two times better than that using the TFPT imager alone.

Human ciliated epithelium was obtained by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate of healthy human volunteers. Ciliary slowing (CS) was measured using a <b>photo-transistor</b> technique and epithelial damage (ED) was documented using a visual scoring index. Effects of recombinant pneumolysin (100 ng/ml), a mutant pneumolysin preparation with markedly reduced haemolytic activity (100 ng/ml) and reagent H 2 O 2 (100 μM) were measured alone and in combination, in the absence and presence of catalase (1000 units/ml). When used individually, both recombinant pneumolysin and H 2 O 2 caused significant (P< 0. 05) CS and ED. The effects of H 2 O 2 but not those of pneumolysin were almost completely attenuated by catalase, while the mutant pneumolysin preparation did not cause significant CS or ED.

This thesis focuses on adhesion, new ways for testing adhesion and new approaches for solving related problems. New insights have been gained into important factors affecting the adhesion and how to overcome the associated limitations. It has been recognised that the volume and height of the plated metal has {{a major impact on}} the adhesion strength of the plated metal to the silicon. In addition. the author has contributed to evaluating a novel approach for improving the plated contacts through the use of anchor points, demonstrating adhesion strengths superior to those achieved by standard screen-printed solar cells and without compromising the electrical performance. The plating work naturally expanded into addressing others issues that significantly impact the electrical performance of plated solar cells. In particular. it was recognised that hydrogen passivation. which is considered essential for the achievement of high performance mono-silicon and multi-silicon solar cells. is more challenging to implement with plated contacts due to the thermal constraints imposed. This thesis therefore investigates. develops and adapts the use of advanced hydrogenation techniques for these eel I types where the emphasis is on controlIing the charge state of the hydrogen atoms to increase their difusivity and reactivity. making them more effective at lower temperature. This work includes designing novel structures such as through the use of <b>photo-transistors</b> for the solar cell contacts that can be easily incorporated into PERC cell fabrication. where significantly higher concentrations of hydrogen can be trapped within the silicon to further enhance the passivation.

Navigation of the service robot in a building {{is based on the}} given building map and the acquired position information. The functions that are relevant to robot movement such as path control, obstacle detection and avoidance are managed by a server notebook PC on the robot platform. According to a given building map, a proper set of locations for USN motes are determined. When a service robot passes by a mote, a set of an LED and a <b>photo-transistor</b> on the service robot and motes detects each other. When a mote detects a specified signal, then it reports to its server immediately. When a service robot detects a mote and then it receives a report from a mote in a short interval of time such as 100 msec, then a server makes decision that the service robot is in front of a mote which reported just before. Since the locations of motes are known, the location of a service robot is determined by the detection sensors and USN motes.
