500|$|Despite being {{presented}} as a [...] "polished commercial group" [...] in their radio appearances, Deep Purple's stage excesses and success in the US {{did not make a}} good impression on British audiences. The Deviants frontman and later journalist Mick Farren described Deep Purple's music as [...] "a slow and pompous din, somewhere between bad Tchaikovsky and a B-52 taking off on a bombing run." [...] They were also criticised for being too American and the [...] "poor man's Vanilla Fudge". As Brian Connolly of Sweet recalled, [...] "they were so out of <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> really felt sorry for them." ...|$|E

2500|$|During his 2009 {{interview}} for Australian Skeptics' podcast The Skeptic Zone, Minchin addressed his performance style {{as one that}} allows bringing up issues that can be upsetting or judgemental to others, such as the [...] "moral hypocrisy {{about the idea that}} the Bible is perfect, the only <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> need to go to for your moral guidance...and about, obviously, prejudice in the church, its role in ostracising homosexuals...your defences are down when you're laughing as well and it's couched in music. All I'm doing is making things consumable that are otherwise difficult to consume." ...|$|E

[...] ("Are you trying to hide in my arse, the <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> came out of?"). She is also recorded as saying with regard to her followers [...] "go mb'fhearr léi lán loinge de chlann Chonraoi agus de chlann Mhic an Fhailí ná lán loinge d'ór" [...] (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold).|$|E
2500|$|Madame Giry walks {{alone at}} night on a desolate pier, reminiscing about an {{amusement}} park called Phantasma, Coney Island's former [...] "City of Wonders". The ghost of Miss Fleck, a freak show performer who once worked with Giry at the park, appears {{out of the darkness}} ("Prologue"). When Fleck urges Giry to recall the [...] "good old days" [...] and blames her for [...] "what happened", the audience is suddenly transported back in time as the old, tattered billboards are restored, the lights of Phantasma are illuminated, and an assortment of the park's performers appear in a dreamlike sequence ("The Coney Island Waltz/That's the <b>Place</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Ruined, You Fool!").|$|E

50|$|In River Rush, one or {{two players}} stand in a raft and work {{together}} {{to pick up the}} adventure pins scattered throughout the winding rapids. The raft is controlled by stepping left or right to steer, and by jumping to jump the raft. There are many secret <b>places</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can get to by taking ramps. There are considerably more adventure points there than on the river. Crashing into barrels, wood, markers, or rapid markers, causes the player to lose points.|$|R
