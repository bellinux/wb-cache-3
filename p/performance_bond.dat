According to this hypothesis, firms pay wages above the opportunity cost of labor to elicit productivity or quality-enhancing behaviors from employees. Firms pursue this strategy when alternative incentive schemes are unavailable or too costly. Thus, firms will not pay premium wages when employees post sufficiently large <b>performance</b> <b>bonds.</b> This article examines employment rents in a setting where employees post sizable <b>performance</b> <b>bonds</b> [...] large law firms.

25|$|<b>Performance</b> <b>bond</b> margin The {{amount of}} money {{deposited}} by both a buyer and seller of a futures contract or an options seller to ensure performance of the term of the contract.

The negative association between bonds and sales volatility is consistent with principal-agent theory. Positive associations between <b>performance</b> <b>bonds</b> and firm age, the CEOs ranking in the Communist Party, and city-level clustering in the use of bonds are all consistent with "legacy " effects dating back to the use of <b>performance</b> <b>bonds</b> in the early reform period.

25|$|Although futures {{contracts}} are oriented towards a future time point, their main {{purpose is to}} mitigate risk of default by either party in the intervening period. In this vein, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up initial cash, or a <b>performance</b> <b>bond,</b> known as the margin. Margins, sometimes set {{as a percentage of}} the value of the futures contract, must be maintained throughout the life of the contract to guarantee the agreement, as over this time the price of the contract can vary as a function of supply and demand, causing one side of the exchange to lose money at the expense of the other.|$|E

There were three valid bids, and Six Companies' bid of $48,890,955 was the lowest, within $24,000 of the confidential government estimate of what the dam would cost to build, and five million dollars less than the next-lowest bid.|$|E

[...] A RICO indictment would have required the firm {{to put up a}} <b>performance</b> <b>bond</b> of as much as $1 billion in lieu of having its assets frozen. [...] This provision was put in the law because organized crime had a habit of absconding with the funds of indicted companies, and the writers of RICO wanted to make sure there was something to seize or forfeit {{in the event of a}} guilty verdict. [...] Unfortunately, most of Drexel's capital was borrowed money, as is common with most Wall Street firms (in Drexel's case, 96 percent—by far the most of any firm). [...] This debt would have to take second place to this <b>performance</b> <b>bond.</b> [...] Additionally, if the bond ever had to be paid, Drexel's stockholders would have been all but wiped out. [...] Due to this, banks will not extend credit to a firm under a RICO indictment.|$|E

2500|$|Included in this {{category}} are bid bonds (guaranty that a contractor will {{enter into a contract}} if awarded the bid); performance bonds (guaranty that a contractor will perform the work as specified by the contract); payment bonds (guaranty that a contractor will pay for services, particularly subcontractors and materials and particularly for federal projects where a mechanic's lien is not available); and maintenance bonds (guaranty that a contractor will provide facility repair and upkeep for a specified period of time). [...] There are also miscellaneous contract bonds that do not fall within the categories above, the most common of which are subdivision and supply bonds. Bonds are typically required for federal government projects by the Miller Act and state projects under [...] "little Miller Acts". In federal government, the contract language is determined by the government. In private contracts the parties may freely contract the language and requirements. Standard form contracts provided by American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) make bonding optional.

2500|$|By this time, several Drexel executives—including Joseph—concluded that Drexel {{could not}} survive a RICO {{indictment}} {{and would have to}} seek a settlement with Giuliani. [...] Senior Drexel executives became particularly nervous after Princeton Newport Partners, a small investment partnership, was forced to close its doors in the summer of 1988. [...] Princeton Newport had been indicted under RICO, and the prospect of having to post a huge <b>performance</b> <b>bond</b> forced its shutdown well before the trial. [...] Joseph said years later that he'd been told that a RICO indictment would destroy Drexel within a month, if not sooner. [...] Nonetheless, negotiations for a possible plea agreement collapsed on December 19 when Giuliani made several demands that were far too draconian even for those who advocated a settlement. [...] Giuliani demanded that Drexel waive its attorney–client privilege, and also wanted the right to arbitrarily decide that the firm had violated the terms of any plea agreement. [...] He also demanded that Milken leave the firm if the government ever indicted him. [...] Drexel's board unanimously rejected the terms.
