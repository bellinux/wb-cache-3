5|$|The {{development}} of the RP-77 began in 1955. Similar in outline to Radioplane's earlier OQ-19, four prototypes of the RP-77 were constructed, two each of the RP-77, <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> a four-cylinder McCulloch piston engine, and of the RP-77A, <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> a six-cylinder Lycoming engine. Results of flight-testing were insufficient to interest the U.S. Army, however in 1957 a proposal for an improved RP-77D, <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> a Boeing 502 turboprop, resulted in a contract {{for the construction of}} 20 aircraft.|$|E
