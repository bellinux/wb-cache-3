25|$|Various {{dense and}} heavy {{hardwoods}} {{are used in}} making the Erhu. According to Chinese references the woods include zi tan (紫檀 red sandalwood and other woods of the genus Pterocarpus such as <b>padauk),</b> Lao hong mu (老红木 aged red wood), wu mu (乌木 black wood), and hong mu (红木 red wood). Particularly fine Erhus are often made from pieces of old furniture. A typical erhu measures 81cm from top to bottom, {{the length of the}} bow also being 81cm.|$|E
25|$|Marimba {{bars are}} {{typically}} made of either wood or synthetic material. Rosewood {{is the most}} desirable, while <b>Padauk</b> is a popular affordable alternative. Bars made from synthetic materials generally fall short in sound quality in comparison to wooden bars, but are less expensive and yield added durability and weather resistance, making them suitable for outdoor use; marimbas with wooden bars are usually played inside because the bars are susceptible to pitch change due to weather. Bubinga (Guibourtia demeusei) and mahogany have also been cited as comparable to rosewood in quality for use as marimba bars. The specific rosewood, Dalbergia stevensonii, only grows in Southern Guatemala and Belize, formerly the British Honduras. This wood has a Janka rating of 2200, which is about three times harder than Silver Maple. The bars are wider and longer at the lowest pitched notes, and gradually get narrower and shorter as the notes get higher. During the tuning, wood is taken from the middle underside of the bar to lower the pitch. Because of this, the bars are also thinner in the lowest pitch register and thicker in the highest pitch register.|$|E

2500|$|The {{instrument}} {{is referred to}} as hammered in reference to the small mallets (referred to as hammers) that players use to strike the strings. Hammers are usually made of wood (most likely hard woods such as maple, cherry, <b>padauk,</b> oak, walnut, or any other hard wood), but can also be made from any material, including metal and plastic. In the Western hemisphere, hammers are usually stiff, but in Asia, flexible hammers are often used. The head of the hammer can be left bare for a sharp attack sound, or can be covered with adhesive tape, leather, or fabric for a softer sound.|$|E

5000|$|... <b>padauk</b> re-edition models: in {{the early}} 2000s, Washburn {{produced}} new <b>padauk</b> models. These tend to be lighter in weight than the original-run <b>padauk</b> N4s, and lighter in color (orange to red, {{as opposed to the}} red to purple colours of the original run).|$|E
50|$|The <b>padauk</b> {{found most}} often is African <b>Padauk</b> from Pterocarpus soyauxii which, when freshly cut, {{is a very}} bright red/orange but when exposed to {{sunlight}} fades over time to a warm brown. Its colour makes it a favourite among woodworkers. Burmese <b>Padauk</b> (ပိတောက်) is Pterocarpus macrocarpus while Andaman <b>Padauk</b> is Pterocarpus dalbergioides. Padauks can be confused with rosewoods {{to which they are}} somewhat related, but as a general rule padauks are coarser and less decorative in figure. Like rosewood, <b>padauk</b> is sometimes used to make xylophone and marimba keys, and guitars. It is an important material in traditional Chinese furniture.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the N4 has a maple neck (the N4 Vintage having {{birdseye}} maple), excepting <b>padauk</b> models (<b>padauk</b> necks) and sapele models (sapele necks).|$|E
50|$|Two {{theories}} {{exist for}} that obvious change in production: quick-grown wood (therefore not giving {{the time for}} the wood to age naturally and achieve the full density that <b>padauk</b> would naturally acquire over time) or a change in the wood species (African <b>padauk</b> for the first models, Indian <b>padauk</b> for the later ones). Another reason for the difference in color is the oxidation of the reddish pigments in padouk wood by UV light over time. All <b>padauk</b> darkens with age from a red/orange to a deep purplish brown, and the time between runs likely contributes to the differentiation in color.|$|E
50|$|After Washburn stopped {{producing}} <b>padauk</b> N4, {{they offered}} a swamp ash models stained to resemble <b>padauk.</b> These are readily recognized {{because of the}} typical swamp ash porous veins showing behind the stain. This models sounds exactly like the (unstained) N4E-SA.|$|E

50|$|Amboyna burl is a {{particularly}} expensive type of burl, much more than bigleaf maple burl, for example. It comes from <b>padauk</b> trees (Pterocarpus spp.) of Southeast Asia. <b>Padauk</b> trees are quite common but burl wood is rare. The amboyna is usually a deep red, although the more rare moudui burl is the same species but the color is from golden yellow to yellow-orange. The sapwood is creamy white with brown streaks. The common use for amboyna is interiors for luxury vehicles, turnery, cabinets, veneer, and furniture.|$|E

50|$|When Doris Stone {{visited the}} Brunca {{community}} in 1968, {{there was much}} less variety in natural dye sources. Back then, the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) was not diverse, and the Brunca used the plants native to Costa Rica for their dyes. Nowadays, the Brunca have cultivated plant species that are native to Southeast Asia for dying purposes, such as Curcuma longa and Tectona grandis, illustrating that the TEK has spread drastically over the past 40 years. She discusses several of the sources still used today. These examples include the Purpura patula, the Carbonero tree, and the Upright Indigo the Brunca call Tuika˝. She also mentions {{the use of the}} Sangrilla tree (Pterocarpus officinalis), also known as <b>Padauk.</b> However, <b>Padauk</b> is not used anymore due to the difficulty in preparing the dye. Also, another mollusk (P. kiosquiformia) used to be used for its purple dye, but the Brunca had to swim out to sea for these shells and kill them, while the P. patula releases its dye as a defense mechanism and {{does not need to be}} killed. Today, the red color that <b>Padauk</b> offered can be taken from the Nance tree or from Teca (teakwood).|$|E

This font contains not only Unicode code points and glyphs but also the OpenType Layout (OTL) logic and rules. Their research center is based in Myanmar ICT Park, Yangon. <b>Padauk,</b> which was produced by SIL International, is Unicode compliant.
