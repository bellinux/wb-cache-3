The relative level of contributions differs from a member state to another because of the conceptions and different historical traditions regarding the social security policies and funding sources. The factors that determined the general increase {{of the weight of}} contributions {{for social security}} are the tendency of increasing the weight of old age population, increasing the expenses with the health care, the policies of insurances of pensions that do not correspond any more to the new demographic and economic realities.

30|$|In 1958, it was {{introduced}} the mobility in benefits, with a guarantee of 82  % of the taxable wage that the beneficiary received before retirement. This element meant a certain homogenization of benefits among the different sectors, and the abolishment of the progressive component introduced with the 1954 reform. Also, {{and perhaps the most}} important development, it was that with the maturation of the system, and due to the existence of a high proportion of informal workers and high levels of evasion in the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions,</b> the system began to experience deficits. These deficits led to a new reform in 1969, which involved the merge of the various pension funds, and the introduction of a centralized management, this last change in fact meant cross-sector transfers from those programs with surplus to those with deficits. The reform also introduced more stringent conditions to access to a benefit, with the increase of the minimum age and the number of years of contributions. Also, the benefit would be a function of the worker’s earnings history, calculated as an average of the best 3  years of salaries during the last 10  years of work, which led to the replacement ratio to be between 70 and 82  %. The mobility of the benefits was maintained. However, all these changes meant only a temporary relief to the financial imbalances.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the 1990 s, Latvia {{aimed at}} {{introducing}} Social Health Insurance (SHI) but later {{changed to a}} National Health Service (NHS) type system. The NHS is financed from general taxation, provides coverage to the entire population, and pays for a basic service package purchased from independent public and private providers. In November 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers passed a draft Healthcare Financing Law, aiming at increasing public expenditures on health by introducing Compulsory Health Insurance (CHI) and linking entitlement to health services to the payment of income tax. Opponents of the reform argue that linking entitlement to health services to the payment of income tax {{does not have the}} potential to increase public expenditures on health but that it can contribute to compromising universal coverage and access to health services of certain population groups. In view of strong opposition, {{it is unlikely that the}} law will be adopted before parliamentary elections in October 2014. Nevertheless, the discussion around the law is interesting because of three main reasons: (1) it can illustrate why the concept of SHI remains attractive – not only for Latvia but also for other countries, (2) it shows that a change from NHS to SHI does not imply major institutional reforms, and (3) it demonstrates the potential problems of introducing SHI, i. e. of linking entitlement to health services to the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions...</b>|$|E

40|$|When Australia’s {{compulsory}} superannuation {{system was}} introduced in 1992, the name given to it, the superannuation guarantee, suggested that the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> by employers would be “guaranteed”. Reporting on compliance with superannuation guarantee by small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), however, paints a vastly different picture — especially for small businesses. Also, the pseudo status of some small businesses as “contractors” (as opposed to employees) of larger businesses may be undermining their potential own entitlement to superannuation guarantee. Such non-compliance draws into question how certain the superannuation guarantee system is for employees of these enterprises, and thereby undermining this important pillar of Australia’s retirement system. Non-compliance by the SME sector is of concern given that it accounts for nearly 50 % of private employment in Australia and performs important sub-contracting roles. This article will examine data on the compliance by small business employers with their superannuation guarantee obligations that indicate this {{is far from the}} case. The article will examine the reasons behind non-compliance by small business employers and the related issue of non-recovery of outstanding entitlements by the Australian Taxation Office. The article will then consider recommendations for reform of the current system to reduce the incidence of non-compliance by employers and to increase the likelihood of recovery of outstanding entitlements. The article will conclude by setting out areas worthy of further research and by arguing that reform is required to ensure that superannuation guarantee contributions are “guaranteed” for small business employees and operators.

It does not therefore appear to be necessary for societies offering these benefits only to have large reserve funds. Probably a year 2 ̆ 7 s income in hand would be sufficient.
