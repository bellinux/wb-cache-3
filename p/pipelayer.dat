50|$|A <b>Pipelayer</b> or {{sideboom}} {{is a type}} of {{a construction}} vehicle used to lay pipes.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pipelayer</b> (or pipe-layer or pipe layer) is {{a skilled}} {{tradesman}} who lays pipe, such as for storm sewers, sanitary sewers, drains, and water mains. Pipelayers may grade (i.e., level) trenches and culverts, position pipe, or seal joints. The Standard Occupational Classification System code for pipelayers is 47-2151.|$|E
50|$|The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor {{estimated}} that there were 41,080 pipelayers in the United States in May 2014, earning a median hourly wage of $17.38 and a median annual wage of $37,000. (The BLS definition of <b>pipelayer</b> excludes welders, cutters, solderers, and brazers). Pipelayers most commonly work in the utility system construction, building construction, and highway, street, and bridge construction sectors. Among U.S. states, Alabama and North Dakota have the highest concentration of pipelaying jobs.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of symptoms from the eyes and {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tract, lung function, and immunological sensitisation towards isocyanates in <b>pipelayers</b> exposed to thermal degradation products from methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) -based polyurethane (PUR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 50 presently active and 113 formerly active <b>pipelayers</b> were examined. Also, 65 unexposed workers were investigated for comparison. The one year prevalence of symptoms and smoking history (questionnaire data), lung function (vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), and atopy (positive skin prick tests towards standard allergens) were assessed among <b>pipelayers</b> and controls. For the <b>pipelayers,</b> the presence of work related symptoms and estimates of isocyanate and welding exposure were obtained from an interview. Skin prick tests towards specific isocyanate antigens and determinations of IgE-MDI and IgG-MDI in serum were also performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of episodes (more than once a month) of irritative eye symptoms, congestion of the nose, and soreness or dryness in the throat was much higher among the PUR <b>pipelayers</b> than among the controls. Most of the <b>pipelayers</b> with symptoms reported that these had started and occurred in relation to the PUR welding tasks. Presently active <b>pipelayers</b> with recent high PUR exposure showed a significant reduction of FEV 1 compared with the controls. The estimated reduction, adjusted for smoking, was - 0. 3 l (P = 0. 04). There was no confounding effect of ordinary welding. None of the <b>pipelayers</b> showed positive skin prick reactions against the specific isocyanate antigens used, or positive IgE-MDI, and only two had increased IgG-MDI. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that exposure to thermal degradation products from MDI-based polyurethane has adverse effects on the mucous membranes and airways...|$|R
5000|$|Pipefitters {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>pipelayers.</b> Both trades involve pipe and valves and both use some of the same tools. However, <b>pipelayers</b> usually work outside, laying pipe underground or on the seabed, while pipefitters typically work inside, installing piping in buildings, aeroplanes or ships. One author summarizes the different tasks this way: ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the tool}} of the ANSYS Workbench software, the {{modeling}} of three-dimensional Entity, meshing and dealing of loads and constraints {{has been done on}} the pipelayer’boom. According to the finite element analysis of pipelayer’boom in three basic conditions by the parameter of width, height and thickness, the material consumption of making boom is significantly reduced. All this is done in the premise of ensuring the safety of <b>pipelayer</b> ’ boom with the objective of minimizing the quality by the finite element optimization. And the results will be the theoretical basis of the design and improvement of <b>Pipelayer</b> ’ boom...|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "pipelaying vessel" [...] or [...] "pipelayer" [...] {{refers to}} all vessels capable of laying pipe {{on the ocean}} floor. It can also refer to [...] "dual activity" [...] ships. These vessels are capable of laying pipe {{on the ocean floor}} in {{addition}} to their primary job. Examples of dual activity <b>pipelayers</b> include barges, modified bulk carriers, modified drillships semi-immersible laying vessels among others.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{the largest}} {{industrial}} facility in Chuvashia is Promtraktor (JSC). Promtraktor {{is the only}} plant in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) manufacturing powerful tracked and wheeled industrial tractors, bulldozers, lift trucks, and <b>pipelayers.</b> The vehicles are powered by technology similar to Caterpillar, and their products are used for large volume excavation {{in a wide variety}} of industry sectors. Promtraktor products are used throughout the CIS, Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America.|$|R
50|$|The work {{involved}} in laying pipes over an active lava flow was highly dangerous, with low visibility {{due to the}} extensive emission of steam. Rough tracks were made onto the flow by bulldozing tephra, but these tracks quickly became very uneven and moved several metres a day. The <b>pipelayers</b> used bulldozers and walkie-talkies to advance through the steam to lay more pipes. The workers dubbed themselves 'The Suicide Squad', and managed to lay pipes up to 130 metres (430 ft) inward from the flow front, directly over the advance. Although several men sustained minor burns, no serious injuries were received.|$|R
50|$|NZG {{specializes in}} a wide variety of heavy {{equipment}} types ranging from hand pallet movers, forklifts, scissors lifts, reach stackers, power generators and skidsteers to front loaders, shovels, excavators, graders, and mammoth ore carrying dump trucks. Caterpillar and other engines and machinery are sometimes also made and displayed free-standing. Some offerings, like pavement profilers, road finishers, asphalt strippers, road rollers, <b>pipelayers,</b> large cranes and drill rigs have also been offered, and NZG seems to have the market corner in promoting many models for a variety of manufacturers (Toy Fair 2011). Considering the variety of commercial model vehicles and equipment, one sees that details are intricate and sometimes delicate. To call NZG models 'toys' is too simple - they are precise replicas of the real thing - and quite sophisticated.|$|R
40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} such as crystalline silica, {{diesel engine}} exhaust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and man-made mineral fibers are strongly suspected to increase lung cancer risk. Two case-control studies in Germany conducted between 1988 and 1996 were pooled for a joint analysis. A total of 3, 498 male cases and 3, 541 male population controls, frequency matched for age and region, {{were included in}} the study. The lifelong history of all jobs and industries was coded and occupational exposures were evaluated by expert rating. Odds ratios, crude and adjusted for smoking and asbestos exposure, were calculated by conditional logistic regression. Job-related evaluation showed a statistically significant increased odds ratio adjusted for smoking among farmers; forestry workers, fishermen, and livestock workers; miners and quarrymen; chemical processors; cabinet makers and related wood workers; metal producers and processors; bricklayers and carpenters; road construction workers, <b>pipelayers</b> and well diggers; plasterers, insulators, and upholsterers; painters and lacquerers; stationary engine and heavy equipment operators; transport workers and freight handlers; and service workers. With regard to specific occupational exposures, elevated odds ratios (OR) (95 % confidence intervals (Cl)) for lung cancer risk adjusted for smoking and asbestos exposure were observed fo...|$|R
