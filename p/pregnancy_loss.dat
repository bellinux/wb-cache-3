40|$|Objective: Although the {{etiopathogenesis}} of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses</b> has {{not been}} clearly explained yet, uterine anomalies, infections, chromosomal anomalies, thrombophilia and free radicals are among the main reasons. <b>Pregnancy</b> <b>losses</b> may also repeated in the following pregnancies. Oxidative stress occurs due to an imbalance between oxidants and free radicals and antioxidants. Conclusion: Oxidative stress may also result in damage in trophoblastic cells where the metabolism is high, such as placenta, and {{play a role in}} the etiopathogenesis of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses.</b> In this review, we aim to present the role of oxidative <b>losses</b> in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses</b> with literature...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses</b> and 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) were limited {{because they did}} not include losses prior to {{clinical}} detection of pregnancy and because exposures were measured after the pregnancies of interest. The authors examined the association of preconception serum total DDT (sum of DDT isomers and metabolites) concentration and subsequent <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses</b> in 388 newly married, nonsmok-ing, female textile workers in China between 1996 and 1998. Upon stopping contraception, subjects provided daily urine specimens and records of vaginal bleeding for up to 1 year or until clinical pregnancy. Daily urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was assayed to detect conception and early <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses,</b> and <b>pregnancies</b> were followed to detect clinical spontaneous abortions. There were 128 (26 %) early <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses</b> in 500 con-ceptions and 36 (10 %) spontaneous abortions in 372 clinical pregnancies. Subjects were grouped in tertiles by preconception serum total DDT concentration (group 1 : 5. 5 – 22. 9 ng/g; group 2 : 23. 0 – 36. 5 ng/g; group 3 : 36. 6 – 113. 3 ng/g).

25|$|The {{evidence}} {{for or against}} the importance of limiting caffeine intake during pregnancy is insufficient and of low quality. There are conflicting reports in the scientific literature about caffeine consumption during pregnancy. A 2011 risk analysis review found that caffeine consumption during pregnancy {{does not appear to}} increase the risk of congenital malformations, miscarriage or growth retardation even when consumed in moderate to high amounts. There is some evidence that the hormonal changes during pregnancy slow the metabolic clearance of caffeine from the system, causing a given dose to have longer-lasting effects (as long as 15hours in the third trimester). There is some evidence that higher caffeine intake by pregnant women may be associated with a higher risk of giving birth to a low birth weight baby, and may be associated with a higher risk of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>loss.</b> A systematic review, analyzing the results of observational studies, suggests that women who consume large amounts of caffeine (greater than 300mg/day) prior to becoming pregnant may have a higher risk of experiencing <b>pregnancy</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E

40|$|Treatment of {{patients}} with recurrent <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses</b> and recurrent implantation failure can be instituted only when the underlying etiology is determined. Embryo-secreted preimplantation factor (PIF) is essential for implantation and adequate trophoblastic invasion. Deficiency of PIF affects {{the outcome of the}} pregnancy leading to recurrent <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses.</b> Synthetic PIF modulates the outcome of the pregnancy decreasing the incidence of recurrent implantation failure and recurrent <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses.</b> In this article a thorough search is done regarding the data published for diagnoses of reproductive failure and its treatment. The effect of immunoglobulin (Ig), intralipid, heparin, aspirin, progesterone, estrogen, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is taken into consideration. Heparin, aspirin, and progesterone have successfully shown to decrease the incidence of recurrent pregnancy loses; whereas G-CSF, intralipids, estrogen, and Igs have shown success in the treatment of the recurrent implantation failure and recurrent pregnancy failure. The pregnancies treated with Igs and intralipids showed equal outcome when evaluated and compared. The place of intralipid in reducing natural killer (NK) cells has been discussed...|$|R
25|$|Miscarriage, {{also known}} as {{spontaneous}} abortion and <b>pregnancy</b> <b>loss,</b> is the natural death of an embryo or fetus before {{it is able to}} survive independently. Some use the cutoff of 20 weeks of gestation, after which fetal death is known as a stillbirth. The most common symptom of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding with or without pain. Sadness, anxiety and guilt often occur afterwards. Tissue and clot-like material may also come out of the vagina. When a woman keeps having miscarriages, infertility is present.|$|E
25|$|Amniocentesis and {{chorionic}} villus sampling are procedures conducted {{to assess the}} fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure {{with a sample of}} tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with <b>pregnancy</b> <b>loss</b> during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester. Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis ({{chorionic villus}} sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis) is rare (about 1%).|$|E
25|$|Because of {{high rates}} of very early {{miscarriage}} (25% of pregnancies are lost within the first six weeks since the woman's last menstrual period, or LMP), the methods used to detect pregnancy may lead to bias in conception rates. Less-sensitive methods will detect lower conception rates, because they miss the conceptions that resulted in early <b>pregnancy</b> <b>loss.</b> A Chinese study of couples practicing random intercourse to achieve pregnancy used very sensitive pregnancy tests to detect pregnancy. It found a 40% conception rate per cycle over the 12-month study period.|$|E

25|$|In the female, {{estradiol}} acts as {{a growth}} hormone for tissue of the reproductive organs, supporting {{the lining of the}} vagina, the cervical glands, the endometrium, and the lining of the fallopian tubes. It enhances growth of the myometrium. Estradiol appears necessary to maintain oocytes in the ovary. During the menstrual cycle, estradiol produced by the growing follicles triggers, via a positive feedback system, the hypothalamic-pituitary events that lead to the luteinizing hormone surge, inducing ovulation. In the luteal phase, estradiol, in conjunction with progesterone, prepares the endometrium for implantation. During pregnancy, estradiol increases due to placental production. The effect of estradiol, together with estrone and estriol, in pregnancy is less clear. They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors. In baboons, blocking of estrogen production leads to <b>pregnancy</b> <b>loss,</b> suggesting estradiol has a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. Research is investigating the role of estrogens in the process of initiation of labor. Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.|$|E

40|$|The present {{retrospective}} study investigates pregnancy rates, incidence of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses</b> and large offspring syndrome (LOS), and immune-related gene expression of {{sheep and goat}} somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) pregnancies. We hypothesized that significantly higher <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses</b> observed in sheep SCNT pregnancies compared to goats are due to the increased amounts of T-helper 1 cytokines and pro-inflammatory mediators at the maternal-fetal interface. Sheep and goat SCNT pregnancies were generated using the same procedure. Control pregnancies were established by natural breeding. Although SCNT pregnancy rates at 45 days were similar in both species, <b>pregnancy</b> <b>losses</b> between 45 and 60 days and incidence of LOS were significantly increased in sheep compared with goats.
