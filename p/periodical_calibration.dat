40|$|AbstractTo {{improve and}} better the {{applicability}} of lithium-ion battery model in electric vehicles, a new electrochemical-polarization model was put forward for the real-time model-based battery management system and control applications by adding an extra RC network {{on the basis of}} the electrochemical model to describe the relaxation effect of the lithium-ion battery, and the open circuit voltage as a function of State of Charge defined by the Nernst model is used in the model to avoid a time-consuming, laborious and even error-prone experiment for specially determining open circuit voltage at several specified SoC values. The model parameters are identified by the least squares method with the experimental data of hybrid power pulse characteristic test on a LiFePO 4 battery module. Experiments and simulation results show the new electrochemical-polarization model can simulate the dynamics of battery well. By using the proposed model and parameters identification approach, the time-consuming and complex experiments for model parameters’ identification and <b>periodical</b> <b>calibration</b> are avoided...|$|E
40|$|Sensors play an {{important}} role in guiding building systems to achieve desired operation and efﬁciency. However, sensors are subject to continuous degradation and failures over time. Although a <b>periodical</b> <b>calibration</b> is needed, it is exceptionally difﬁcult and/or impractical to many sensors with a conventional manual approach. Uncalibrated problematic sensors could signiﬁcantly compromise the systems 2 ̆ 7 performance and lead to unintended loss of energy efﬁciency in buildings. We propose a methodology, termed virtual in-situ calibration, to solve this critical issue. It is developed by mathematically extracting the characteristics of essential aspects involved in a calibration, including the environment assessment, benchmark establishment, and uncertainty quantiﬁcation. A case study of a supply air temperature sensor in rooftop units illustrates the implementation process; the erratic uncertainty is reduced from ± 19. 2 °C to ± 0. 7 °C after the virtual in-situ calibration. The calibration method can be implemented online to signiﬁcantly improve the reliability of sensor networks in buildings...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA new urea {{potentiometric}} biosensor {{based on}} all-solid-state (without inner liquid contacts) {{technology has been}} developed. Potentiometric transducers consisting of selective poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membranes directly applied onto electrically-conducting composite materials ([0 - 3] graphite/epoxy composites) has been previously developed in our laboratory. This all-solid-state construction procedure has been extended to the preparation of urea potentiometric biosensors using a new enzyme-immobilization technique based on the deposition of the biocatalyst layer onto the active transducer surface by spraying a diluted solution of glutaraldehyde. The combination of these new simple technologies provides {{a wide range of}} adaptability and multifunctional designs for the resulting sensing devices. Furthermore, by using a PVC-matrix membrane as the support of the enzymatic layer, the detachment of the enzyme (urease) is considerably reduced since a better adsorption on the enzyme layer is achieved. The results obtained with this new type of urea potentiometric biosensor show a low response time (10 s) and a wide linear range (10 − 5 to 10 − 3 M) with a sensitivity of 55 mV per urea decade. A great gain is achieved in terms of stability with a lifetime of about 40 days in <b>periodical</b> <b>calibration</b> use. Additionally, a flow-through urea biosensor using the same type of potentiometric transducer and immobilization procedure has been constructed for the use in flow-injection analysis systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for {{deep drawing process}} control. The new method consists in: i) using of a segmented-multiple moving drawbeads; ii) imposing an optimal reference trajectory for drawbeads position; iii) in-process control where controlled variable is chosen the amplitude of deviation δ of the actual instant workpiece surface geometry {{with respect to the}} surface geometry during simulation and as manipulated variable is chosen the deviation ΔhDB of the actual drawbeads position with respect to the programmed one; iv) <b>periodical</b> validation, <b>calibration</b> and updatation both of the control model and reference trajectory of drawbeads position; v) using a reduced order model of the complex system design. An experimental device conception and testing is presented. The results obtained using this device confirms the validity of the new proposed method for deep drawing process control...|$|R
30|$|Quality {{control and}} quality {{assurance}} (QA/QC) processes are required {{not only for}} imaging cameras but also for peripheral devices [1]. Assessment of the radioactivity concentration in blood samples obtained in conjunction with brain scintigrams gives various quantitative parameters for analyzing the images from single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The results from the analysis are employed for diagnosis of various diseases related to blood flow in brain such as dementia or moyamoya diseases. The diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment often require long periods such as 5 to 10  years. The quantitative analysis for the patients’ images should be performed with high accuracy. In initial and repeat examinations, the radioradioy in the blood samples is sometimes used as an input value for a quantitative analysis. An example is an analysis using the quantitative SPECT (QSPECT) dual-table autoradiographic (DTARG) method [2]. The measurement of the radioactivity is performed by using a well counter. The sample radioactivity is estimated based on counting the photons emanating from the scintillation phenomenon in the crystal detector, {{but the number of}} counts often varies {{depending on the type of}} crystal detector and the counting software. <b>Periodical</b> <b>calibrations</b> of the devices maintain quantitative accuracy for the measurements for a while; however, replacement of the device will happen eventually in both laboratories and hospitals. After any change in the type of well counter, the difference in the measurement result will affect the quantitative analysis of images when the examinations were performed before and after the change. Using a cross calibration is generally the way to compare the results between two devices, and Nakajima et al. have reported on a method using phantom materials from 84 institutions to compare the heart-to-mediastinum ratio from 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigram images to realize a multicenter comparison [3, 4]. Yoneda et al. have reported the reproducibility of CBF estimations between two institutions employing different gamma cameras but have not mentioned the well counters employed [5]. Thus, cross calibration for well counters has not been reported on yet, since the measurement results may be consistent ones because of system calibration. The purpose of this study is to specify the number of samples and a simple procedure for a robust data conversion of radioactivity value between two devices and to elucidate the number of samples required.|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{instrument transformers}} (CITs) are still {{widely used in}} the power network, thanks to their high reliability, insulation capability and low drift over time and temperature. Their traditional reliability is very often used as justification for skipping a <b>periodical</b> <b>calibration,</b> which requires putting off-line the CIT, thus implying a very complex and expensive procedure. For this reason, in the last years, a growing interest has been addressed towards the diagnostic/calibration methods based on on-line procedure. The typical approach {{is based on the}} frequency response analysis that permits, under sinusoidal conditions, to detect possible deterioration of the behavior of CIT. Anyway, the real interest is to check the CIT fleet already installed and operating on the grid without requiring the disconnection from the grid. As well known the actual voltage of the grid features a not negligible harmonic distortion that combined with the intrinsically non-linearity of the CTI reduces the feasibility of the on-line diagnostic methods based on the frequency response method. This paper proposed a novel approach to the on-line diagnosis of CIT based on a non-linear simplified Volterra model of the CIT. This opens the way to a different approach to the in-site characterization process of a CIT based on the actual voltage of the grid and thus not requiring the disconnection of the CIT from the grid...|$|E
40|$|In autumn 2001, the Institut für Erdmessung (IfE), {{received}} the new Scintrex Autograv CG- 3 M spring gravimeter no. 4492 (SC- 4492). Compared with LaCoste-Romberg gravimeters, the Scintrex instrument offers {{the advantage of}} a more simple calibration function. Due to the straightforward sensor design (no micrometer screws and gearboxes, no astatisation), a modelling of <b>periodical</b> <b>calibration</b> terms and of a higher order polynomial calibration function is not required. The costly calibration measurements can be reduced to some relative observations between two reliable absolute gravity stations. No complex calibration system should be necessary. A reliable evaluation of the SC- 4492 was done with respect to the stability of the calibration, measurement accuracy and precision, drift behaviour, and gravity range dependency of the calibration factor. Measurements were performed on the Hannover vertical calibration line (200 µm/s 2 (20 mGal) range, 20 -storied building, 10 µm/s 2 interval), on the Cuxhaven-Harz north-south line (3000 µm/s 2 range, 34 stations, 90 µm/s 2 interval) of the gravimeter calibration system Hannover, and in the absolute gravimetry net of the Fennoscandian land uplift area (6200 µm/s 2 range). A total gravity range of almost 0. 015 m/s 2 has been covered. In addition, the gravimeter was employed in the determination of vertical gravity gradients and centring to safety points for absolute gravimetry, and the observation of the horizontal gradient field at the IfE absolute gravity reference station in Clausthal. This paper presents the results as obtained in regional, local and microgravimetric surveys. The achieved accuracies are in the order of ± 10 to 100 nm/s 2 (± 1 to 10 µGal). No instability of the calibration and no gravity range dependency could be proven within the order of 1 • 10 - 4. Overall, the gravity meter SC- 4492 meets fully the expectations of IfE...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of neural decoders can degrade over time due to nonstationarities {{in the relationship}} between neuronal activity and behavior. In this case, brain-machine interfaces (BMI) require adaptation of their decoders to maintain high performance across time. One way to achieve this is by use of <b>periodical</b> <b>calibration</b> phases, during which the BMI system (or an external human demonstrator) instructs the user to perform certain movements or behaviors. This approach has two disadvantages: (i) calibration phases interrupt the autonomous operation of the BMI and (ii) between two calibration phases the BMI performance might not be stable but continuously decrease. A better alternative would be that the BMI decoder is able to continuously adapt in an unsupervised manner during autonomous BMI operation, i. e. without knowing the movement intentions of the user. In the present article, we present an efficient method for such unsupervised training of BMI systems for continuous movement control. The proposed method utilizes a cost function derived from neuronal recordings, which guides a learning algorithm to evaluate the decoding parameters. We verify the {{performance of}} our adaptive method by simulating a BMI user with an optimal feedback control model and its interaction with our adaptive BMI decoder. The simulation results show that the cost function and the algorithm yield fast and precise trajectories towards targets at random orientations on a 2 -dimensional computer screen. For initially unknown and non-stationary tuning parameters, our unsupervised method is still able to generate precise trajectories and to keep its performance stable in the long term. The algorithm can optionally work also with neuronal error signals instead or in conjunction with the proposed unsupervised adaptation.

40|$|Conventional voltage {{transformers}} (CVTs) {{are still}} widely used as transducers in power networks, {{thanks to their}} high reliability, insulation capability, low drift over time and temperature. Their rugged construction is very often used as justification for skipping <b>periodical</b> tests and <b>calibrations,</b> that require putting them off-line, thus avoiding a time-consuming and expensive procedure. For this reason, in the last years, a growing interest has been addressed towards the study of online diagnostic and calibration procedures. The typical approach {{is based on the}} frequency response analysis that permits, under sinusoidal excitation, to detect possible deterioration of the behavior of CVT. Anyway, the real interest is to check the CVT fleet already installed and operating on the grid without requiring their disconnection from the grid. As well known, distribution grid voltage features a non negligible harmonic distortion, which may allow the online evaluation of the frequency response of the transformer, by simply connecting a reference transducer. Unfortunately, being the harmonics much lower than the fundamental, this approach cannot be employed in a straightforward way because of the nonlinear behavior of the CVT. This paper proposes an innovative condition monitoring technique of CVTs based on a simplified Volterra model. This opens the way to a new approach to the on-site characterization of CVTs, exploiting the actual voltage of the grid and thus not requiring its disconnection...|$|R
40|$|The {{advances}} in communication technologies, especially the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology, have ensured a steady {{increase in the}} total data-rate of a single fiber. Current WDM systems offer 32 - 64 wavelengths at 2. 5 - 10 Gb/sec/wavelength, hence approaching 1 Tb/sec capacity, while research-level systems already exceed multi-terabits in a single fiber. As a result, switches/routers are replacing the fiber link as the bottleneck of the network. Consequently, {{there is a high}} demand for terabits/s switches/routers that support a large number of ports running at high bit rates. Most of these high-performance and scalable switches/routers employ crossbars as the switching fabric. However, it is very challenging to implement a monolithic terabits/s CMOS crossbar switch chip. In particular, for a 256 * 256 crossbar switch, conventional approaches that use 8 bit-slices of switch core may not be feasible since the area is increased by a factor of 8. To address the problem, a novel 3 -stage pipelined MUX-tree based architecture is proposed in this thesis. The clock cycle is reduced to below 1 ns for a 0. 25 μm CMOS process implementation, so that only 2 bit-slices are needed for a 2 Gb/s interface. Higher bit rates can be achieved if the CMOS process is scaled to a smaller dimension. At the interface, asymmetric serial link architecture is adopted to decrease the complexity in the crossbar switch chip by removing the clock recovery circuits from the switch receiver end to the line card transmitter end. In this thesis, we enhance the architecture by eliminating the <b>periodical</b> <b>calibration,</b> and hence improving the performance without additional hardware cost. Using TSMC 0. 25 μm CMOS technology, the crossbar switch chip is laid out and simulated to demonstrate and verify the design. Both 1 ns clock cycle time in the crossbar switch core and 2 Gb/s serial link at the interface are successfully achieved. The layout size of 256 * 256 crossbar switch is 18 mm* 18 mm. It consumes 50 W power and provides a total bandwidth of above half terabits/s...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO: A laserterapia de baixa intensidade (LBI) vem sendo cada vez mais utilizada, porém ainda não há consenso na {{literatura}} quanto ao tempo em que os equipamentos devem ser submetidos à aferição ou calibragem. OBJETIVO: Analisar a potência média real (PmR) dos equipamentos de LBI na região da Grande São Paulo. MÉTODOS: Para análise dos equipamentos, utilizou-se um potenciômetro (Lasercheck), próprio para aferição de equipamentos contínuos, o qual foi programado com dados referentes ao comprimento de onda do laser a ser avaliado, obtendo-se assim a PmR emitida. Os equipamentos foram analisados de duas formas: uma, com o LBI desaquecido, e outra, após 10 minutos de uso (aquecido), sendo que três análises foram feitas para cada condição. A caneta emissora foi acoplada ao potenciômetro, o qual fornecia a PmR emitida pelo LBI. Todos os dados e informações referentes à aplicação do laser foram coletados por um questionário respondido pelos responsáveis. RESULTADOS: Os 60 equipamentos avaliados mostraram déficit na PmR com os equipamentos desaquecidos e aquecidos. A análise estatística (ANOVA) mostrou diminuição significativa (P BACKGROUND: Despite {{the increase}} in the use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT), there is still a lack of consensus in the literature regarding how often the equipment must be calibrated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real average power of LLLT devices in the Greater São Paulo area. METHODS: For the evaluation, a LaserCheck power meter designed to calibrate continuous equipment was used. The power meter was programmed with data related to the laser's wavelength to gauge the real average power being emitted. The LLLT devices were evaluated in two ways: first with the device cooled down and then with the device warmed up for 10 minutes. For each condition, three tests were performed. The laser probe was aligned with the power meter, which provided the real average power being emitted by the LLLT device. All of the data and information related to the laser application were collected {{with the use of a}} questionnaire filled in by the supervising therapists. RESULTS: The 60 devices evaluated showed deficit in real average power in the cooled-down and warmed-up condition. The statistical analysis (ANOVA) showed a significant decrease (p< 0. 05) in the real average power measured in relation to the manufacturer's average power. On average, the most common dose in the clinics was 4 J/cm², and the most desired effects were healing and anti-inflammatory effects. According to the World Association for Laser Therapy (WALT), 1 to 4 J of final energy are necessary to achieve these effects, however only one device was able to reach the recommended therapeutic window. CONCLUSION: The LLLT devices showed a deficit in real average power that emphasized a lack of order in the application of this tool. The present study also showed the need for <b>periodical</b> <b>calibration</b> of LLLT equipment and a better technical knowledge of the therapists involved...|$|E
