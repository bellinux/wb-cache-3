There are many studies going on now a days about peer to peer (<b>P-to-P)</b> and file-sharing. Some studies predict staggering 45 % of total internet traffic is PtoP. Mobile operators need to embrace peer to peer (<b>P-to-P)</b> methodologies within their own networks {{and focus on the}} advantages of using <b>P-to-P.</b> P to P technology tends to make the network more robust and it would make cell-phone calls cheaper Here each handset looks for other handsets within about 2 km range. Calls and text information are then routed through the handset nodes, with a maximum of seven or less hops, until they reach their destination. The potential of this technology is immense and if properly utilised can redefine the future of mobile communication for ever, only if issues like security, portability and coordination are properly addressed. the disruptions.

We use a point explosive source and ignore the free surface effect, so the fracture scattered wavefield contains two parts: <b>P-to-P</b> scattering and P-to-S scattering. The elastic response of the fracture is described by the fracture compliance. We vary the incident angle and fracture compliance within a range considered appropriate for field observations and investigate the <b>P-to-P</b> and P-to-S scattering patterns of a single fracture. <b>P-to-P</b> and P-to-S fracture scattering patterns {{are sensitive to the}} ratio of normal to tangential fracture compliance and incident angle, whereas the scattering amplitude is proportional to the compliance, which agrees with the Born scattering analysis. We find that, for a vertical fracture, if the source is located at the surface, most of the energy scattered by the fracture propagates downwards.

40|$|We use a 2 -D finite {{difference}} {{method to}} numerically calculate the seismic response of a single finite fracture in a homogeneous media. In our experiments, we use a point explosive source and ignore the free surface effect, so the fracture scattering wave field contains two parts: <b>P-to-P</b> scattering and P-to-S scattering. We vary the fracture compliance within a range considered appropriate for field observations, 10 - 12 m/Pa to 10 - 9 m/Pa, and investigate the variation of the scattering pattern of a single fracture {{as a function of}} normal and tangential fracture compliance. We show that <b>P-to-P</b> and P-to-S fracture scattering patterns are sensitive to the ratio of normal to tangential fracture compliance and different incident angle, while radiation pattern amplitudes scale as the square of the compliance. We find that, for a vertical fracture system, if the source is located at the surface, most of the energy scattered by a fracture propagates downwards, specifically, the <b>P-to-P</b> scattering energy propagates down and forward while the P-to-S scattering energy propagates down and backward. Therefore, most of the fracture scattered waves observed on the surface are, first scattered by fractures, and then reflected back to the surface by reflectors below the fracture zone, so the fracture scattered waves have complex ray paths and are contaminated by the reflectivity of matrix reflectors. by Xinding Fang.

30|$|Shimizu and Maeda (1980) {{reported}} later phases {{that have}} characteristics {{similar to those}} of the X phase, and they concluded that the later phases were generated by a <b>P-to-P</b> reflection at an inclined reflector beneath the Hidaka Mountain range. As a benefit of the nationwide dense seismograph network in Japan, we can observe the X phase at stations distributed in a wider area than that in Shimizu and Maeda (1980). The X phase is difficult to interpret as a <b>P-to-P</b> reflection wave at the reflector proposed by Shimizu and Maeda (1980), but it is attributable to highly heterogeneous structures in the Pacific slab.One possible origin of the X phase is a mode-converted wave at velocity discontinuities between the source and receiver. If we assume the X phase to be an S-to-P converted wave (SP wave) at the Pacific slab interface, the time difference between SP and P waves is 1 to 4 s, which increases with epicentral distance (gray-shaded area in Figure  3). These time differences are too small to explain the characteristics of the X phase, such as characteristics 1 and 4 listed above. Therefore, we excluded the SP wave from the Pacific slab interface in the origin of the X phase. If we assume that the X phase is an SP wave from the continental Conrad or Moho, the phase should be observed only at stations near the epicenter because the incident angle to the discontinuities must be less than the critical angle for SP conversion. This contradicts the observation that the X phase appears only at stations with large epicentral distances (Figure  1); hence, the SP wave at either the Conrad or Moho is not a plausible candidate for the origin of the X phase.|$|E
40|$|Using the single-scattering {{approximation}} we invert for {{the material}} parameters ofan acoustic two-parameter medium {{and then for}} a three-parameter isotropic elastic medium. Our procedure is related to various methods of depth migration in seismics, i. e. methods for locating major discontinuities in the subsurface material without specifying which quantities are discontinuous orby how much they jump. Our asymptotic multiparameter inversion makes use of amplitude information to reconstruct {{the size of the}} jumps in the parameters describing the medium. We allow spatially varying background parameters (both vertically and laterally) and an almost arbitrary source-receiver configuration. The computation is performed in the time domain and we use all available data even if it is redundant. This ability to incorporate he redundant information i a natural way is based upon a formula for double integrals over spheres. We solve for perturbations in different parameters treating separately <b>P-to-P,</b> P-to-S, S-to-P, and S-to-S data. It turns out that one may invert using subsets of the data, or all of it together. We also describe modifications toour scheme which allow us to use the Kirchhoff instead of the Born approximation for the forward problem when the scatterers are smooth surfaces of discontinuity...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{retrieve}} a 2 D background velocity model and to retrieve the geometry and depth of shallow crustal reflectors in the Southern Apennines thrust belt a separate inversion of first arrival traveltimes and reflected waveforms was performed. Data were collected during an active seismic experiment in 1999 by Enterprise Oil Italiana and Eni-Agip using a global offset acquisition geometry. A total of 284 on-land shots were recorded by 201 receivers deployed on an 18 km line oriented SW–NE in the Val D’Agri region (Southern Apennines, Italy). The two-step procedure allows for the retrieval of a reliable velocity model by using a non-linear tomographic inversion and reflected waveform semblance data inversion. The tomographic model shows that the P wave velocity field varies vertically from approximately 3 km/s to 6 km/s within 4 km from the Earth’s surface. Moreover, {{at a distance of}} approximately 11 km along the profile, there is an abrupt increase in the velocity field. In this zone indeed, an ascent from 2 km depth to 0 km above sea level of the 5. 2 km/s iso-velocity contour can be noted. The retrieved velocity can be associated with Plio-Pleistocene clastic deposits outcropping in the basin zone and with Mesozoic limestone deposits. The inversion of waveform semblance data shows that a <b>P-to-P</b> reflector is retrieved at a depth of approximately 2 km. This interface is deeper in the north-eastern part of the profile, where it reaches 3 km depth and can be associated with a limestone horizon...|$|E
40|$|Constraining the {{structure}} of the lunar core is necessary to improve our understanding of the present-day thermal structure of the interior and the history of a lunar dynamo, as well as the origin and thermal and compositional evolution of the Moon. We analyze Apollo deep moonquake seismograms using terrestrial array processing methods to search for the presence of reflected and converted energy from the lunar core. Although moonquake fault parameters are not constrained, we first explore a suite of theoretical focal spheres to verify that fault planes exist that can produce favorable core reflection amplitudes relative to direct up-going energy at the Apollo stations. Beginning with stacks of event seismograms from the known distribution of deep moonquake clusters, we apply a polarization filter to account for the effects of seismic scattering that (a) partitions energy away from expected components of ground motion, and (b) obscures all but the main P- and S-wave arrivals. The filtered traces are then shifted to the predicted arrival time of a core phase (e. g. PcP) and stacked to enhance subtle arrivals associated with the Moon s core. This combination of filtering and array processing is well suited for detecting deep lunar seismic reflections, since we do not expect scattered wave energy from near surface (or deeper) structure recorded at varying epicentral distances and stations from varying moonquakes at varying depths to stack coherently. Our results indicate the presence of a solid inner and fluid outer core, overlain by a partial-melt-containing boundary layer (Table 1). These layers are consistently observed among stacks from four classes of reflections: <b>P-to-P,</b> S-to-P, P-to-S, and S-to-S, and are consistent with current indirect geophysical estimates of core and deep mantle properties, including mass, moment of inertia, lunar laser ranging, and electromagnetic induction. Future refinements are expected following the successful launch of the GRAIL lunar orbiter and SELENE 2 lunar lander missions...|$|E
40|$|File sharing {{systems such}} as Napster and KaZaA are accused by the {{recording}} industry of causing declines in sales of music CDs, and recently users of these systems are under lawsuit attack. However, there is not sufficient evidence that file sharing systems {{are responsible for the}} recent decline in music CD sales. Two previous studies examined micro data of sales and downloads and found mixed results regarding the connection between file sharing and CD sales (Blackburn, 2004; Oberholzer and Strumpf, 2004). The current essay estimated the effect of file sharing systems on music CD sales using micro data from Japan in 2004. Japan's file sharing system ("Winny") is almost completely decentralized and highly anonymous compared with ones addressed in the two previous studies, thus Japanese users can download music files with less concern about lawsuits. The goal of this research is to examine the effect of file sharing on music CD sales in such an illegal-copy-friendly file sharing system. Based on micro data of CD sales and numbers of downloads, we found that there was very little evidence that file sharing reduces music CD sales in Japan. We controlled simultaneous bias between sales and downloads by instrumental variables, but did not find correlation between CD sales and numbers of downloads. Although there were large differences in the numbers of downloads among CD titles, these differences did not affect CD sales. We also carried out a user survey on file sharing and CD purchases with consideration to the potential bias of respondents trying to understate their illegal copying activity. This survey also showed that file sharing had very limited influence on CD purchases. Copyright, File sharing, <b>P-to-P,</b> Intellectual Property Rights, Music, Entertainment Industry...|$|E
40|$|Small-scale {{heterogeneities}} in {{the mantle}} can give important {{insight into the}} dynamics and composition of the Earth's interior. Here, we analyse seismic energy found as precursors to PP, which is scattered offsmall-scale heterogeneities related to subduction zones in the upper and mid-mantle. We use data from shallow earthquakes (less than 100 km depth) in the epicentral distance range of 90 °- 110 ° and use array methods to study a 100 s window prior to the PP arrival. Our analysis focuses on energy arriving offthe great circle path between source and receiver. We select coherent arrivals automatically, based on a semblance weighted beampower spectrum, maximizing the selection of weak amplitude arrivals. Assuming single <b>P-to-P</b> scattering and using the directivity information from array processing, we locate the scattering origin by ray tracing through a 1 -D velocity model. Using data from the small-aperture Eielson Array (ILAR) in Alaska, {{we are able to}} image structure related to heterogeneities in western Pacific subduction zones. We find evidence for ~ 300 small-scale heterogeneities in the region around the present-day Japan, Izu-Bonin, Mariana and West Philippine subduction zones. Most of the detected heterogeneities are located in the crust and upper mantle, but 6 per cent of scatterers are located deeper than 600 km. Scatterers in the transition zone correlate well with edges of fast features in tomographic images and subducted slab contours derived from slab seismicity. We locate deeper scatterers beneath the Izu-Bonin/Mariana subduction zones, which outline a steeply dipping pseudo-planar feature to 1480 km depth, and beneath the ancient (84 - 144 Ma) Indonesian subduction trench down to 1880 km depth. We image the remnants of subducted crustal material, likely the underside reflection of the subducted Moho. The presence of deep scatterers related to past and present subduction provides evidence that the subducted crust does descend into the lower mantle at least for these steeply dipping subduction zones. Applying the same technique to other source-receiver paths will increase our knowledge of the small-scale structure of the mantle and will provide further constraints on geodynamic models. ...|$|E
40|$|In "outer sphere" {{electron}} transfer reactions, {{motions of the}} solvent molecules surrounding the donor and acceptor govern the dynamics of charge flow. Are the relevant solvent motions determined simply by bulk solvent properties such as dielectric constant or viscosity? Or are molecular details, such as the local solvent structure around the donor and acceptor, necessary to understand how solvent motions control charge transfer? In this paper, we address these questions by using ultrafast spectroscopy to study a photoinduced {{electron transfer}} reaction with only electronic degrees of freedom: the charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) reaction of Na- (sodide). Photoexcitation of Na- places the excited CTTS electron into a solvent-bound excited state; motions of the surrounding solvent molecules {{in response to this}} excitation ultimately lead to detachment of the electron. The detached electron can then localize either in an "immediate" contact pair (in the same cavity as the Na atom), which undergoes back electron transfer to regenerate Na- in similar to 1 ps, or in a "solvent-separated" contact pair (one solvent shell away from the Na atom), which undergoes back electron transfer in tens to hundreds of picoseconds. We present detailed results for the dynamics of each step of this reaction in several solvents: the ethers tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether and tetrahydropyran and the amine solvent hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). The results are interpreted in terms of a kinetic model that both incorporates spectral shifting of the reaction intermediates due to solvation dynamics and accounts for anisotropic spectral diffusion in polarized transient hole-burning experiments. We find that the rate of CTTS detachment does not correlate simply with any bulk solvent properties, but instead appears to depend on the details of how the solvent packs around the solute. In contrast, the rate for back electron transfer of solvent-separated contact pairs varies inversely with solvent polarity, indicating a barrier to recombination and suggesting that this reaction lies in the Marcus inverted regime. For immediate contact pairs, the rate of recombination varies directly with solvent polarity in the ethers but is slowest in the highly polar solvent HMPA, suggesting that the spatial extent of the solvated electron in each solvent {{is one of the major}} factors determining the recombination dynamics. The fact that each step in the reaction varies with solvent in a different way implies that there is not a single set of solvent motions or spectral density that can be used to model all aspects of electron transfer. In addition, all of the results and conclusions in this paper are compared in detail to related work on this system by Ruhman and co-workers; in particular, we assign a fast decay seen in the near-IR to solvation of the CTTS <b>p-to-p</b> excited-state absorption, and polarization differences observed at visible probe wavelengths to anisotropic bleaching of the Na- CTTS ground state.
