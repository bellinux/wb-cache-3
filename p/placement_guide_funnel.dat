40|$|This Bachelor’s thesis {{has been}} done in {{cooperation}} with the client who offered the thesis, in order to propose a new solution for a <b>guiding</b> <b>funnel</b> to a truck coupling. The assignment was introduced with the issue of having difficulties when connecting the truck to the trailer on hilly terrain. The work consists mainly of CAD-modeling in Autodesk Inventor 2017 and nonlinear calculations with FEA in Ansys 17. 1. The CAD-modeling was used for designing new <b>guiding</b> <b>funnels</b> and the calculations were done to verify that the new <b>guiding</b> <b>funnels</b> met the requirements that the client suggested. The project was limited by only designing the <b>guiding</b> <b>funnels</b> to withstand a single situation of a static load. The calculations assumed that the materials were isotropic and was following a multilinear stress curve in order to define the material as ideal plastic. Three <b>guiding</b> <b>funnels</b> were made whereas only two were valid according to the the requirements. The reliability of the results are discussed and improvements are suggested by potential errors that might have been evident in the calculations. The final decisions are discussed but the responsibility of choosing was given back to the client...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} error while using an implant <b>placement</b> <b>guide,</b> we created many FEA models for each placement to compare the accuracy between the same placement models used with different FEA models.|$|R

A case history is described to illustrate how a patient presented 9 years after mastectomy with an internal mammary lymph node metastasis and how cytopathological diagnosis of this metastasis was achieved by CT guided biopsy...|$|R
25|$|Pieces {{that can}} promote can choose {{whether or not}} they will promote when they capture an un{{promoted}} enemy piece; however, if a piece captures a promoted piece, it must promote if able. Promotion is indicated by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the character for the promoted piece. There are no promotion zones; dots on the board that usually represent promotion zones are present after the sixth rank only as a <b>placement</b> <b>guide</b> for initial setup.|$|R

30|$|Assessment plays {{a central}} role in {{teaching}} and learning. It has long been used in education for various high stakes decision-making purposes, e.g., selection and <b>placement,</b> <b>guiding</b> and correcting learning, and grading achievement (Crooks 1988). The prevalence of large-scale high-stakes testing, and its impact on stakeholders, has been well documented in education. There are a set of relationships, intended and unintended, between testing, teaching and learning. However, not until recently has research on classroom assessment begun to explore the role that assessment tasks that teachers use, and that the classroom environment plays in supporting student learning.|$|R
40|$|Insufficient {{width of}} the {{alveolar}} ridge often prevents ideal implant <b>placement.</b> <b>Guided</b> bone regeneration, bone grafting, alveolar ridge splitting and combinations of these techniques are used for the lateral augmentation of the alveolar ridge. Ridge splitting is a minimally invasive technique indicated for alveolar ridges with adequate height, which enables immediate implant placement and eliminates morbidity and overall treatment time. The classical approach of the technique involves splitting the alveolar ridge into 2 parts with use of ostetomes and chisels. Modifications of this technique {{include the use of}} rotating instrument, screw spreaders, horizontal spreaders and ultrasonic device...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and challenging aspects of implant dentistry is the correct planning and placement of the dental implant so as to achieve a prosthetically, aesthetically, and biologically stable outcome. It is also important to prevent encroachment on vital structures. To aid in the correct placement of dental implants, a variety of surgical guides have been proposed. If a fully limiting surgical guide is used, the encoded information should be reliable, as deviations are not possible during surgery. This article describes an acrylic resin implant <b>placement</b> <b>guide,</b> which is based on bone mapping of the edentulous ridge at the implant site...|$|R

40|$|The {{multilevel}} placement package mPL 6 combines improved implementations of {{the global}} placer mPL 5 (ISPD 05) and the XDP legalizer and detailed placer (ASPDAC 06). It consistently produces robust, high-quality solutions to di#- cult instances of mixed-size placement in fast and scalable run time. Best-choice clustering (ISPD 05) is used to construct a hierarchy of problem formulations. Generalized force-directed <b>placement</b> <b>guides</b> global <b>placement</b> at each level of the cluster hierarchy. During the declustering pass from coarsest to finest level, large movable objects are gradually fixed in positions without overlapping with one another. This progressive legalization of large objects during continuous optimization supports determination of a completely overlap-free configuration {{as close as possible}} to the continuous solution. Various discrete heuristics are applied to this legalized placement in order to improve the final wirelength...|$|R
40|$|During 1989 - 90 a {{new concept}} to avoid bycatch of fish in shrimp trawl has been {{developed}} in Norway. The system consists of an aluminium grid, 0. 6 - 1. 0 m wide and 1. 3 - l. 5 m long, with bars spaced 19 mm. The grid is installed in the extention piece in front of the codend, angled 45 º, and with a fish outlet on the top. In front of the grid is mounted a <b>guiding</b> <b>funnel</b> or flapper. Several practical tests with commercial trawlers are conducted. Performance of the system and behaviour of fish and shrimp relative to it has been studied with a remote controlled underwater TV-vehicle. Escapement of fish like cod, haddock, redfish and Greenland halibut is better than with any bycatch device tested earlier. Handling cause no significant problems, neither on small nor larger shrimp trawlers. Loss of shrimp when using the system is acceptable, less than 5 %. An extensive effort is taking place to introduce this selective device in all Norwegian shrimp fisheries. From March 1. 1990 the separator grid was introduced by law in the northern coastal shrimp fishery...|$|R

30|$|The {{reference}} {{instrument used}} {{here is a}} spectroradiometer X-Rite I 1 Pro, which measures the spectral range in 380 – 730  nm in 10  nm steps and uses an industry standard formula to calculate the red, blue and green response. The X-Rite I 1 Pro has an optical aperture of 4.5  mm, spectral resolution of 10  nm, physical sampling interval of 3.5  mm and uses an internal simulated gas filled tungsten type A source, that can be compensated to mimic other light supplies. The X-Rite I 1 Pro was used in reflectance mode with 3 data points measured and averaged at each location used on the archive samples. The hand held device is placed {{in contact with the}} paper using a Perspex <b>placement</b> <b>guide</b> to make each measurement at a defined position. The calibration of the spectroradiometer for usage in each experiment used a whitened polypropylene blank as supplied with the equipment. The equipment itself is calibrated and certified by the manufacturer.|$|R
40|$|The {{percutaneous}} transluminal {{coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA) {{is one of}} the interventional procedures which impart high radiation doses to patients compared to the other cardiologic procedures. This study intends to audit and optimize radiation dose imparted to patients undergoing PTCA. Forty-four patients who underwent PTCA involving single or multiple stent <b>placement</b> <b>guided</b> under cardiovascular X-ray machine were included in the study. Radiation doses were measured using dose area product (DAP) meter for patients undergoing single and multiple stent placements during PTCA. A dose reduction of 27 - 47 % was achieved using copper filters and optimal exposure parameters. The mean DAP values before optimization were 66. 16 and 122. 68 Gy cm 2 for single and multiple stent placement respectively. These values were 48. 67 and 65. 44 Gy cm 2 respectively after optimization. In the present scenario, due to {{the increase in the number}} of PTCAs performed and the associated risk from radiation, periodical audit of radiation doses for interventional procedures are recommended...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} to the bycatch problem when trawling for shrimp was initiated in Norway in 1984 utilizing the difference in swimming behaviour of fish and shrimp. A radial escape section (RES) in the aft belly of the trawl allowed fish to activly escape as shrimp was <b>guided</b> by <b>funnels</b> of netting towards the codend. The performance of the new selective device (RES) as well as behaviour of fish in trawls has been observed by a remote controlled television vehicle (RCTV). Comparative fishing experiments to evaluate its selective properties was conducted with a siamese twin trawl {{as well as with}} two trawlers fishing in the same area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: Conventional {{imaging and}} {{navigation}} during intravascular intervention employs fluoroscopic positioning of intracoronary devices. It may also include intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), allowing 2 dimensional slice visualization {{of blood vessels}} for enhanced imaging, diagnosis and stent placement. We report {{the use of an}} innovative 3 D imaging system (GIVUSTM), as well as stent <b>placement</b> (<b>Guided</b> StentTM) using a new non-fluoroscopic, intra-coronary Medical Positioning System (MPSTM, MediGuide Ltd, Israel). Methods: The GIVUSTM system consists of a miniaturized sensor that might be assembled on tips of various catheters (such as IVUS and stent delivery system) and provides accurate real time position and orientation, enabling real time tracking of a catheter tip in 3 D space. GIVUSTM is the integration of two technologies, MPSTM and IVUS, thus providing automatic real-time quantitative 3 D reconstruction of an inspected vessel. The GIVUS system was used to accurately navigate and deploy 12 stents in 6 adult pigs. 2 D angiogram roadmaps and 3 D reconstructed models were used to place stents at pre-defined locations in different coronary arteries close to bifurcations. Results: GIVUSTM 3 D image reconstruction was completed and displayed within 15 seconds after finishing pullback. MPS tracked the fluoroscopic image with mean accuracy of 0. 210 ± 0. 306 mm.

This article is open access. External recordings of the electrohysterogram (EHG) can provide new knowledge on uterine electrical activity associated with contractions. Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying labor can contribute to preventing preterm birth which is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in newborns. Promising results using the EHG for labor prediction and other uses in obstetric care are the drivers of this work. This paper presents a database of 122 4 -by- 4 electrode EHG recordings performed on 45 pregnant women using a standardized recording protocol and a <b>placement</b> <b>guide</b> system. The recordings were performed in Iceland between 2008 and 2010. Of the 45 participants, 32 were measured repeatedly during the same pregnancy and participated in two to seven recordings. Recordings were performed in the third trimester (112 recordings) and during labor (10 recordings). The database includes simultaneously recorded tocographs, annotations of events and obstetric information on participants. The publication of this database enables independent and novel analysis of multi-electrode EHG by the researchers in the field and hopefully development towards new life-saving technology...|$|R
30|$|In clinics, the {{radiographic}} {{evaluation of}} the maxillary sinus is obligatory prior to for example sinus floor elevation.

40|$|Wikipedia entity {{pages are}} a {{valuable}} {{source of information}} for direct consumption and for knowledge-base construction, update and maintenance. Facts in these entity pages are typically supported by references. Recent studies show {{that as much as}} 20 % of the references are from online news sources. However, many entity pages are incomplete even if relevant information is already available in existing news articles. Even for the already present references, there is often a delay between the news article publication time and the reference time. In this work, we therefore look at Wikipedia through the lens of news and propose a novel news-article suggestion task to improve news coverage in Wikipedia, and reduce the lag of newsworthy references. Our work finds direct application, as a precursor, to Wikipedia page generation and knowledge-base acceleration tasks that rely on relevant and high quality input sources. We propose a two-stage supervised approach for suggesting news articles to entity pages for a given state of Wikipedia. First, we suggest news articles to Wikipedia entities (article-entity placement) relying on a rich set of features which take into account the salience and relative authority of entities, and the novelty of news articles to entity pages. Second, we determine the exact section in the entity page for the input article (article-section <b>placement)</b> <b>guided</b> by class-based section templates. We perform an extensive evaluation of our approach based on ground-truth data that is extracted from external references in Wikipedia. We achieve a high precision value of up to 93 % in the article-entity suggestion stage and upto 84 % for the article-section placement. Finally, we compare our approach against competitive baselines and show significant improvements...|$|R
40|$|Background-Long {{coronary}} lesions {{treated with}} stents have a poor outcome. This study compared the 6 -month outcome of stent implantation for long lesions in patients randomized to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS; n= 73) or angiographic guidance (n= 71). Methods and Results-Stenoses > 20 mm {{in length and}} a reference diameter that permitted a stent diameter {{greater than or equal}} to 3 mm were eligible. Primary end points were 6 -month minimal lumen diameter (MLD) and the combined end point of death, myocardial infarction, and target-lesion revascularization (TLR). Baseline clinical and angiographic data were comparable in both groups. At 6 months, MLD in the IVUS group (1. 82 +/- 0. 53 mm) was larger than in the angiography group (1. 51 +/- 0. 71 mm; P= 0. 042). TLR and combined end-point rates at 6 months were 4 % (n= 3) and 6 % (n= 4) in the IVUS group and 14 % (n= 10) and 20 % (n= 14) in the angiography group, respectively (P= 0. 037 for TLR and P= 0. 01 for combined events). Restenosis (> 50 % diameter stenosis) was found in 23 % of the IVUS group and 45 % of the angiography group (P= 0. 008). At 12 months, TLR and the combined end point occurred in 10 % (n= 7) and 12 % (n= 9) of the IVUS group and 23 % (n= 17) and 27 % (n= 19) of the angiography group (P= 0. 018 and P= 0. 026), respectively. Conclusions-Angiographic and clinical outcome up to 12 months after long stent <b>placement</b> <b>guided</b> by IVUS is superior to guidance by angiograph...|$|R
50|$|The ECoG {{recording}} {{is performed}} from electrodes {{placed on the}} exposed cortex. In order to access the cortex, a surgeon must first perform a craniotomy, removing {{a part of the}} skull to expose the brain surface. This procedure may be performed either under general anesthesia or under local anesthesia if patient interaction is required for functional cortical mapping. Electrodes are then surgically implanted {{on the surface of the}} cortex, with <b>placement</b> <b>guided</b> by the results of preoperative EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Electrodes may either be placed outside the dura mater (epidural) or under the dura mater (subdural). ECoG electrode arrays typically consist of sixteen sterile, disposable stainless steel, carbon tip, platinum, Platinum-iridium alloy or gold ball electrodes, each mounted on a ball and socket joint for ease in positioning. These electrodes are attached to an overlying frame in a “crown” or “halo” configuration. Subdural strip and grid electrodes are also widely used in various dimensions, having anywhere from 4 to 256 electrode contacts. The grids are transparent, flexible, and numbered at each electrode contact. Standard spacing between grid electrodes is 1 cm; individual electrodes are typically 5 mm in diameter. The electrodes sit lightly on the cortical surface, and are designed with enough flexibility to ensure that normal movements of the brain do not cause injury. A key advantage of strip and grid electrode arrays is that they may be slid underneath the dura mater into cortical regions not exposed by the craniotomy. Strip electrodes and crown arrays may be used in any combination desired. Depth electrodes may also be used to record activity from deeper structures such as the hippocampus.|$|R
