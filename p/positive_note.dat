5|$|The team's struggles {{continued}} into December, where the Flames lost four of six games {{to begin the}} month. Back-to-back victories over the Columbus Blue Jackets and Toronto Maple Leafs on December 13 and 16, respectively, {{marked the first time}} the team won consecutive games since late October. The latter victory also spoiled Dion Phaneuf's first return to Calgary following his trade to Toronto the previous season. The Flames followed the victories with three consecutive losses, but entered the Christmas break on a <b>positive</b> <b>note</b> with a 3–2 shootout victory over the Dallas Stars.|$|E
5|$|He {{ended the}} 2005 season on a <b>positive</b> <b>note</b> {{by winning the}} gold medal in the 200m at the World Athletics Final, his first major {{championship}} title. His time of 19.96s was his second fastest that year and fourth fastest of any sprinter that season. Although he stated that the quality of the competition and memories of Helsinki had made him nervous beforehand, he went on to beat all three American sprinters he had lost to in the World Championships, becoming the first athlete to beat Gatlin over 200m that season. It was not only his rival sprinters that would cause future difficulties, however, as Gay's coach Brauman was indicted for various crimes relating to his time at Barton College and the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He had helped athletes gain funds and credits that they were not entitled to. Following Gay's testimony, the courts ruled that Brauman was guilty and, as a result, Arkansas' two NCAA titles and all of Gay's college track times were annulled. None of the athletes were charged with any wrongdoing. Although he was imprisoned for 10 months, Brauman continued to train Gay, periodically updating him with coaching routines and techniques.|$|E

5|$|He opened 2005 with {{a second}} win in the European Clubs' Cross Country Cup. He won his first World Cross Country Championship medal soon after, {{finishing}} second to Bekele to take silver at the 2005 edition. On the track, he recorded a 5000m personal best of at the Qatar Grand Prix in Doha, and qualified to compete at the World Championships in both the 5000 and 10,000m. At the 2005 World Championships, he broke the national record in the 10,000 m final, but his time of 27:12.82 was only enough for sixth. The 5000 m final held little reprieve for the Eritrean as he finished in second last position. He ended the season on a <b>positive</b> <b>note,</b> however, improving his 10,000m best to 27:04.70 at the Memorial Van Damme, and winning the Great North Run with a world best time of 59:05 – which was only his second outing over the half marathon distance.|$|E
5|$|Byrom {{started in}} Stevenage's first ever Football League game, a 2–2 home draw against Macclesfield Town. He played in Stevenage's {{televised}} League Cup loss {{two days later}} against Championship side Portsmouth. The following week, Byrom gave away a penalty in a 1–0 defeat at Bradford City, which Gareth Evans converted to score the only goal of the game. After playing the whole game in Stevenage's 1–0 defeat at Cheltenham Town in September 2010, Byrom suffered a number of injuries that {{kept him out of}} the first-team for five months. He returned to first-team action in February 2011, coming on as an 89th-minute substitute in a 3–0 loss at Bury. Four days later, he started in a 1–0 defeat at Shrewsbury Town. He was an unused substitute for Stevenage's next five league matches, before starting in the club's 3–3 home draw with Bury {{on the final day of}} the 2010–11 season – playing a key role in two of Stevenage's goals to ensure the club reached the play-offs. Byrom scored his first goal of the season in Stevenage's 2–0 home win against Accrington Stanley in the play-off semi-final first leg, reaching the ball before Accrington goalkeeper Alex Cisak to double Stevenage's lead. He played the whole game in the second leg, a 1–0 victory that ensured Stevenage made the play-off final. Byrom started in the final, a 1–0 victory against Torquay United at Old Trafford, a win that meant Stevenage earned back-to-back promotions to League One. Despite ending the season on a <b>positive</b> <b>note,</b> Byrom made just 12 appearances, scoring once, due to a host of injuries interrupting his campaign.|$|E

5000|$|Another myth {{about this}} theater has also persisted in modern literature, namely, {{that the music}} was of an {{inferior}} quality and that the performances were rather crude.
