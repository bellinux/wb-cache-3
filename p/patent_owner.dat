25|$|A patent, {{being an}} exclusionary right, does not {{necessarily}} give the <b>patent</b> <b>owner</b> the right to exploit the invention subject to the patent. For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else's patent. If an inventor obtains a patent on improvements to an existing invention which is still under patent, they can only legally use the improved invention if the patent holder of the original invention gives permission, which they may refuse.|$|E
2500|$|Patents can {{generally}} only {{be enforced}} through civil lawsuits (for example, for a U.S. patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal court), although some countries (such as France and Austria) have criminal penalties for [...] infringement. Typically, the <b>patent</b> <b>owner</b> seeks monetary compensation for past infringement, and seeks an injunction that prohibits the defendant {{from engaging in}} future acts of infringement. To prove infringement, the <b>patent</b> <b>owner</b> must establish that the accused infringer practises all the requirements {{of at least one}} of the claims of the patent. (In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the doctrine of equivalents).|$|E
2500|$|Patent {{licensing}} {{agreements are}} contracts {{in which the}} <b>patent</b> <b>owner</b> (the licencor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, and/or import the claimed invention, usually {{in return for a}} royalty or other compensation. [...] It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product. Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under cross-licensing agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other's patented inventions.|$|E

The survey was performed in 2003. 9000 <b>patent</b> <b>owners</b> responded. The <b>patent</b> <b>owners</b> were asked how much effort was required to produce their inventions and how much monetary value their patents had been worth. The median effort to create the patentable invention was 1 person-year, with 10% of the <b>patent</b> <b>owners</b> requiring 2 or more person-years. The median value of the patents produced was €300,000, with 10% of <b>patent</b> <b>owners</b> reporting values of €10 million Euros or more.|$|R

[...] This was expressed in a concurring opinion to the case of eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C. [...] There has been considerable speculation as to how this opinion might affect future business method patent litigation, particularly where a <b>patent</b> <b>owner</b> seeks an injunction to stop an infringer. In 2006, three Justices (Breyer, J., joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ.) dissented from the dismissal of certiorari as improvidently granted in Laboratory Corp. of Am. Holdings v. Metabolite Labs., Inc., arguing that State Street enunciated an erroneous legal test under which processes that the Supreme Court had held patent-ineligible would be held patent-eligible.|$|E
2500|$|Atomoxetine is manufactured, marketed, {{and sold}} in the United States as the {{hydrochloride}} salt (atomoxetine HCl) under the brand name Strattera by Eli Lilly and Company, the original patent-filing company and current U.S. <b>patent</b> <b>owner.</b> Atomoxetine was initially intended to be developed as an antidepressant, but it {{was found to be}} insufficiently efficacious for treating depression. It was, however, found to be effective for ADHD and was approved by the FDA in 2002 for the treatment of ADHD. Its patent expired in May 2017. On May 30, 2017 the FDA approved the generic production by four pharmaceutical companies. On 12 August 2010, Lilly lost a lawsuit that challenged its patent on Strattera, increasing the likelihood of an earlier entry of a generic into the US market. On 1 September 2010, Sun Pharmaceuticals announced it would begin manufacturing a generic in the United States.

50|$|The General Talking Pictures {{doctrine}} {{does not}} apply to all cases in which a <b>patent</b> <b>owner</b> imposes a restriction on what may subsequently be done with the patented product. When the <b>patent</b> <b>owner</b> sells a patented product to a customer, for example, the exhaustion doctrine applies instead and the patent no longer operates to limit what the customer does with the product or in what field the customer uses it.|$|E
50|$|None {{of these}} points is on firm, sound ground. In the Boesch case, a seller entirely {{unrelated}} to the U.S. <b>patent</b> <b>owner</b> made the sale in Germany; the German seller {{had a right to}} sell the product under German law because it had begun preparation to manufacture the product before the U.S. <b>patent</b> <b>owner</b> applied for its German patent. The U.S. company (the patentee) had no complicity in the sale and did not profit from it, and could not possible be accused of “double dipping.” This is quite unlike the usual U.S. situation, such as that in the Lexmark and Jazz cases, in which the U.S. <b>patent</b> <b>owner</b> was responsible for the foreign sale, and therefore profited from it. The Boesch case is therefore not a proper precedent to support the general international exhaustion situation.|$|E

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{analysis of}} the first ten years of decisions by the Board Patent Appeals and Interferences regarding inter partes patent reexamination appeals was conducted. The analysis of 101 cases focused on answering three broad questions: (1) How accurate are the specialist patent examiners of the Central Reexamination Unit of the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office? (2) Do <b>patent</b> <b>owners</b> or third party requestors fare better in appeals of decisions in inter partes reexamination proceedings? (3) Which types of appeals {{are more likely to}} be successful? The examiners’ determinations were upheld more than three fourths of the time; third party requestors tended to be more successful than <b>patent</b> <b>owners</b> at winning appeals; and appeals solely by third party requestors of unadopted grounds of rejection were the most successful type of appeal. These historical observations can be used to predict the success rate for appeals of Patent Trial and Appeal Board decisions in Inter Partes Review (IPR) proceedings, which was implemented in September 2012. Appeals of IPR decisions by third party requestors are predicted to have a better success rate at maintaining patent claim rejections and adding new grounds of rejection than appeals by <b>patent</b> <b>owners</b> will have at receiving reversal of patent claim rejections...|$|R
