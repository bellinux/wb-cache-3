5|$|The {{need for}} a <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> National Guard unit became {{apparent}} to Major General Luis R. Esteves, who had served as instructor of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Officers for the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry at Camp Las Casas in Puerto Rico. His request was met {{with the approval of}} the government and <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Legislature. In 1919, the first regiment of the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> National Guard was formed, and General Luis R.

5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} {{has diminished}} due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> barn owl (Tyto cavatica), <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it {{is still one of the}} ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E

Several <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> became notable commanders, five have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration in the United States, also several <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> have attained the rank of General or Admiral, which requires a Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation.

5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within {{members of the same}} species. The research concluded that the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis. Recent phylogenetic studies show that the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black-billed amazon.|$|E
5|$|Every year on July 25, <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Nationalists and {{independence}} activists gather atop Cerro Maravilla to honor Carlos Soto and Arnaldo Dario, {{as well as}} to defend and celebrate the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> independence ideology.

5|$|As {{early as}} in February 1913, poet and lawyer Luis Lloréns Torres had {{publicly}} requested that Betances' wishes {{to have his}} ashes returned to Puerto Rico be fulfilled.

5|$|The 11 snake species {{occurring}} in Puerto Rico are generally considered non-venomous, although research {{has concluded that}} at least one species, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> racer (Alsophis portoricensis), secretes venom. These species belong to 3 families and 4 genera: Typhlopidae (Typhlops genus), Boidae (Epicrates) and Colubridae (Alsophis and Arrhyton). The largest snake in Puerto Rico is the endemic <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> boa (Epicrates inornatus) with a maximum length of 12ft (3.7m). The diet of snakes in Puerto Rico consists of reptiles (Ameiva, Anolis, geckos), coquís and other frogs, and, to a lesser extent, mice, birds and bats (exclusively by the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Boa).|$|E

5|$|The {{last major}} changes in <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> fauna {{occurred}} about 10,000 {{years ago as a}} result of the post-Ice Age rise in sea level and associated environmental changes.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1800s and early 1900s <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> {{including}} students, laborers, cigar markets, tradespeople, organizers, merchants, and pro-Puerto Rican Independence organizers exiled from Puerto Rico. In 1910 {{there were fewer}} than 100 <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> in Philadelphia and they were among many Latin American groups. In the 1920s labor recruiters in Philadelphia focused on attracting <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> because they were already U.S. citizens: the Immigration Act of 1924 had restricted immigration into the U.S. In the early 20th Century, due to inexpensive housing and the proximity to employment, concentrations of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> moved to Northern Liberties, Southwark, and Spring Garden. Between 1910 and 1945 those three areas had the majority of Philadelphia Hispanophones.

Since the 1990s, the role of stateside <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> in advocating for Puerto Rico in Washington, D.C., {{on issues such as}} the Navy's removal from Vieques and others has increased, especially given that there have been three voting members of the U.S. Congress who are stateside <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> (two from New York City and one from Chicago), in contrast to Puerto Rico's single Resident Commissioner in the U.S. Congress with no vote.|$|R
