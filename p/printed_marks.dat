40|$|In {{order to}} attract the reader's attention, John Galsworthy, an author most careful in his {{technique}} of writing, often resorts to "italicized emphasis" -emphasis shown by making a word or words (sometimes a whole sentence) printed in italics. This technique is often made use of by various authors, the examples of which {{are by no means}} difficult to be found. Few writers, however, have used this method more extensively and effectively than the Nobel Prize novelist and dramatist of "The Forsyte Saga". This technique of Galsworthy's is greatly appreciated by foreign readers and students of English pronunciation (accentuation and intonation), who manage to acquire correct word stress with the aid of dictionaries, but who might be at a loss how to put right sentence stress and proper intonation, regarding which dictionaries can help us little, if at all. Galsworthy's dramas and novels with many <b>printed</b> <b>marks</b> and hints of pronunciation may serve as excellent text-books of spoken English. In this paper, quoting examples from his plays (and novels), I attempt to analyze and and interpret his technique of "italicized emphasis", with a view to learning the right way of speaking English-how to accentuate correctly and intonate properly...|$|E
40|$|We face {{experiences}} {{in life that}} we cannot ignore; we approach them with uncertainty and understand them with what rational thought {{that we have to}} offer. But what about the elements of an event that we never fully understand, yet carry with us to pick apart and revisit time and time again? It is the tastes that linger in our mouths, thread through our thoughts and formulate our personalities. These are the memories that evolve us into the future and keep us searching for answers. We saturate ourselves with these uncertainties, waiting for a bit of light, a chance to dry out and the opportunity to look back at the encounter as nothing but a stain. In my work I am addressing these leftover elements of my personal experiences, the histories that saturate me with lingering sensations. Continually evolving these ideas in my art, I am addressing situations of my self, family, genetics, habits and hardships. These are the thoughts that I carry with me each day, constantly trying to process that which is unresolved. These are the trials that make me human, and through visual investigation, weave me into the fabric of the universal. The process of staining and printing are in direct conversation with the experience of living. I bruise and fold paper, saturate fibers with liquid, monitor the absorption process, and provoke the resistance of materials with opposite chemical make ups. Similarly, we are built from these same elements; through the process of saturation, absorption and resistance we become the residue of what was there, the proof of existence, leaving each stain within us different from the last. I use abstract and decorative marks as the subject of my residual history. Such marks become symbols that act as the basis of my memories. They represent loved ones, childhood, snow, rain, freckles, fertility, age and fluid. When combining <b>printed</b> <b>marks</b> and saturated washes, a memory evolves for me. Temperature, perspective, layers and movement bring my work to a sense of place. The exposed fibers and scale allow me to bathe in the rich colors, follow the patterns and have a sense of vulnerability. Here is where my stains, my histories, can be understood. Through the act of creating, I look toward myself in an effort to understand the human condition. The saturations from our lives leave us lingering for answers. We all look toward our stains for identity and find that this imprinting process is never ending. We are continually accumulating new marks, dodging new obstacles and adapting to new situations. Our depths of memory become our badges of experience and wisdom, our key to future choices and our reference for empowerment. These are the stains J keep; these are the stains that penetrate...|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with exploring phenomena of the night through combining printmaking and installation practices. I explore a phenomenology of darkness via embodied vision. The embodied nature of vision implies subjective experience {{and this is the}} key to re-activating a viewer's relationship to the environment in darkness. I consider how perception changes in the dark and the intermingling of the senses becomes more apparent, precipitating a heightened suggestivity to nocturnal phenomena. I have drawn on phenomenological ideas and methods and on my own nocturnal experiences to reflect on aspects of the changing contemporary night, creating a series of print-based installations that extend the possibilities for sensory affect. I bring together installation strategies and the analogue print as an embodiment of the tactile to assert the phenomenological. The submitted work has developed through extensive experimentation that draws together diverse methods for combining prints in installation environments. I have explored strategies that locate the visual via embodied processes, combining the physical mark making possibilities of the analogue print with installation strategies. Using print processes I have collected a range of marks derived from tactile interactions with forms. The <b>printed</b> <b>marks</b> do not describe visual forms, rather they are fragments that signify a sensate engagement with the unseen in the dark. The ability of print to reproduce images in different states has facilitated possibilities for the construction and fragmentation of imagery, as repeated forms alter and echo, generating heightened effects. I configure these in ways that strategically focus on the tactile, inviting an intimate and experiential engagement. The intent of the project is to create a perceptual intervention, a break in habitual and everyday modes of viewing. In terms of theory, Merleau Ponty's discussions of phenomenological thought provide key reference points for the project, in particular the idea that experience at the moment of apprehension and prior to conceptual meaning suggests new ways of understanding the relationship between self and the world, one that relocates vision in the body. I have also drawn on the writings of Jonathan Crary, who describes how an understanding of embodied vision has emerged and discusses ways that contemporary perceptual experiences are changing, and Paul Crowther, who considers the phenomenological possibilities for artworks. Rosalind Krauss' critique of the optical has also been significant as it locates several art practices that subvert the disembodied optical; and I trace a series of connections with other artists who have enlisted the bodily as a means of destabilising the visual. The project is located within a field of contemporary artists who engage with ideas about perception and darkness in relation to the environment and, in particular, with artworks that deal with the concept of an embodied relationship to darkness and utilise phenomenal strategies to engage viewers on a sensory level. Rothko, Turrell, Morris, Eliassen and Kusama deal with perceptual questions, creating immersive environments that engage in reflection on the world. Fernandez, Hofshi, Bitters, Seigel, Silveira and Pien deal with perceptions of darkness in their works and develop strategies to extend the sensory. While current installation practices often explore the sensory possibilities of Lhe digilal, my installation positions the analogue print to comment on the transition from the physical to the virtual worlds that we increasingly inhabit. The results of this project are shown in a dark, labyrinthine installation that interrogates the realm of perception, as the viewer is invited to consider the embodied nature of vision. Everyday modes of seeing are destabilised through encounters with fragments of imagery that hover between form and feeling, imagination and reality. This is suggestive of experiences of the night, where not only tactile, aural and visual phenomena are experienced differently but also images are conjured in the mind in response to nocturnal events. This exploration of ideas and processes suggests a reading of the night which points to the richness of sensuous engagement with the world, encouraging the viewer to reconsider their own multi-sensory relationship to the world in darkness...|$|E
40|$|It becomes oppressive when {{important}} events, important changes, can’t {{break through}} {{to the surface of}} life and are continually unable to fulfill themselves. The still invisible and uncrystallized fact that is to be realized in the future is already growing, swelling, beginning to push through into a preexisting reality, which, however, doesn’t want to yield. It gets tighter and tighter, and therefore more and more suffocating. The lack of air increases our feeling of helplessness. We watch the gathering of the clouds and wait for a voice to speak from them, reading us the inexorable verdict of fate. ” -Ryszard Kapúscínski Zero Street is a highly subjective visual portrait of Lincoln’s central artery, with the title borrowed from a poem by Allen Ginsberg. Taking my immediate surroundings as a starting point, my thesis examines the physical reality yet suggests states of awareness beyond it. The subject encompasses the ways things become timeworn through use or neglect and the people who inhabit and reflect such worn spaces. In the popular imagination Nebraska stands in for someplace far away and empty. Of course it is far from empty, physically, culturally or historically. At the same time the idea of emptiness as a subject is relevant to me. The sky has an overwhelming presence here: objects placed against it become monumental and we are dwarfed by the scale of the sky and the plains. By imposing the rigidly structured grids of utility and commerce on our landscape it could be that we have filled our spaces with meaninglessness. Emptiness enters my work in various ways, in a direct yet vacant gaze, in views of uncared-for spaces, or in the dull browns and tans of winter. I think of myself a naturalist of sorts, looking for meaning in small things. My working method is to observe, gather and present. My sketchbooks and bookworks are filled with everyday details, collected impressions and unexpected elements. With a broad filter I am willing to accept most anything as potential subject matter. I look at the built environment and the passing of innumerable faces as an assembly of artifacts, and attempt to respond honestly with artifacts of my own making. Printmaking is important to me because of its particular graphic qualities. The decisions I make along the path from idea to matrix to print elevate the final image, while the distancing nature of <b>printed</b> <b>marks</b> ensures that my hand is present but once removed, lending the work a sense of translation. I consider the interaction of color, density, opacity and line weight in seeking to form a unified whole. I find the final print becomes a distillation of many elements, in which I attempt to balance texture and simplicity, sequence and meaning, efficiency and time. For me the ongoing challenge of the medium is to achieve spontaneity within a system. Layering has been particularly important in this work as it allows me to introduce subtleties of pattern and color. A halftone pattern can highlight or obscure, when overlaid it can appear to buzz or glow, and it can stand alone to form its own specific atmosphere, mediated by the look of commercial production. To me layering suggests embedded history, a tension between the surface and what lies beneath. Within the overwhelming presence of the commonplace in this Zero place, the images resonate for me on many levels. Parallel lines of thought: I know of the observation of small things; I know of the discovery that one image can stand in for a larger concept; I sense that perhaps I’m not talking about Lincoln at all but instead presenting other issues entirely. Another thought is more personal, relating to my identification with place and sense of belonging. Having grown up next to one of the largest industrial districts on the west coast, I have always found beauty in dilapidation, “those dead neighborhoods shut away and buried in a corner of a busy and lively town. ” My intention in Zero Street is to orchestrate a conversation across images. My work interrogates the circumstances of life in a city that has much in common with other American cities. I question how people, objects, and phenomena can become invisible to us. We shape the world and it in turn shapes how we move through it; rarely, we experience the contingent and constructed quality of our surroundings and see beyond the nothingness of zero.

40|$|In earprint identification, the {{formation}} of earprints is little understood, particularly the distortion of the ear when it is pressed against a listening surface and {{the effect on the}} resulting earprint. This lack of understanding causes widespread suspicion about the validity of earprints as forensic evidence. Yet empirical investigations show that crime scene marks from ears are relatively stable. To study earprint formation in real time we introduce an optical apparatus that highlights the ear contact area when pressed against a surface. We report results from a small number of volunteers using this system to log the ear-printing process as they listened at an instrumented surface. Recordings of force history, pressure distribution and growth of the <b>print</b> <b>mark</b> were made. The optical system has proved successful in gaining new insight into the print formation process. From our observations we conclude that involuntary movement and local pressure redistribution during listening at a surface make print formation a decidedly stochastic process. Evidently the stability of the <b>print</b> <b>mark</b> is a result of accumulating the transfer of body oils and waxes over a listening interval during which the ear suffers widely varying amounts of deformation...|$|R
