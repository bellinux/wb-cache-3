40|$|This paper revisits {{the puzzle}} of low returns on Swiss Franc assets using a new data set <b>of</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> {{residents}} and non residents at Swiss banks. The main findings are as follows. First, {{we find that the}} return anomaly is present only for fixed income assets and not for equity. Second, it is mostly due to a long run deviation from uncovered interest rate parity, not a deviation from purchasing power parity. Third, it is unlikely that foreign demand for Swiss assets (possibly due to banking secrecy) is driving down returns: This demand is quantitatively small especially for Swiss Franc fixed income instruments. A dynamic factor analysis confirms that foreign demand had almost no impact on Swiss Franc asset prices. Finally, we propose a new explanation for low returns on Swiss fixed income assets, namely the diversification benefits offered by these instruments. Applying reversed portfolio optimization to back out the implied returns reveals that the estimated pattern of this returns conforms very well with the observed pattern.

40|$|We model {{activism}} as {{it affects}} the future distribution of prices in a portfolio con- text with risk-averse expected utility of end-of-period wealth maximizing investors. We characterize activism as affecting the mean, the variance, and/or the covariance of the target firm' s price with the prices of the other fi rms. This characterization allows us to investigate conditions under which the activist would choose to become an activist and, subsequently, to derive the sequence of equilibria that begins with the surreptitious acquisition of shares by the activist and ends {{at the moment of}} the activist s divestiture of these shares. We investigate the impact of activism not only on the target firm' s price over time and the activist s profi t, but also on the redistri- bution <b>of</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> all market participants that this activism induces. We propose a method to evaluate activism and show that, while activism may augment the share price of the target fi rm, there exist conditions under which activism would not necessarily increase the value of the market.
