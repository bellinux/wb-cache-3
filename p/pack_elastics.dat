40|$|The <b>packing</b> of <b>elastic</b> bodies {{has emerged}} as a {{paradigm}} for the study of macroscopic disordered systems. However, progress is hampered by the lack of controlled experiments. Here we consider a model experiment for the isotropic two-dimensional confinement of a rod by a central force. We seek to measure how ordered is a folded configuration and we identify two key quantities. A geometrical characterization is given by the number of superposed layers in the configuration. Using temporal modulations of the confining force, we probe the mechanical properties of the configuration and we define and measure its effective compressibility. These two quantities may be used to build a statistical framework for <b>packed</b> <b>elastic</b> systems. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

The proof {{is based on}} the primal-dual variational principle, where the upper bound is derived by using the Keller-type test functions and the lower bound by singular functions made of nuclei of strain. Singular functions are solutions of the Lamé system and capture precisely singular behavior of the stress in the narrow region between two adjacent hard inclusions. Comment: 12 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

We find a number of competing low-energy ordered structures, composed of threading of three identical labyrinths, with three-fold infinite branch lines, {{that are likely to}} be of comparable energy for polyphile shapes with moderately splayed arms. These patterns are triply-periodic analogues of the hexagonal honeycomb, which is most favoured for unsplayed three-arm polyphile architectures. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>packing</b> of <b>elastic</b> sheets is {{investigated}} in a quasi two-dimensional experimental setup: a sheet is pulled through a rigid hole {{acting as a}} container, so that its configuration is mostly prescribed by the cross-section of the sheet in {{the plane of the}} hole. The characterisation of the packed configuration is made possible by using refined image analysis. The geometrical properties and energies of the branches forming the cross-section are broadly distributed. We find distributions of energy with exponential tails. This setup naturally divides the system into two sub-systems: in contact with the container and within the bulk. While the geometrical properties of the sub-systems differ, their energy distributions are identical, indicating 'thermal' homogeneity and allowing the definition of effective temperatures from the characteristic scales of the energy distributions.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{statistical}} approach {{for studying the}} close <b>packing</b> of <b>elastic</b> rods. This phenomenon belongs to the class of problems of confinement of low dimensional objects, such as DNA packaging in viral capsids. The method developed is based on Edwards' approach, which was successfully applied to polymer physics and to granular matter. We show that the confinement induces a configurational phase transition from a disordered (isotropic) phase to an ordered (nematic) phase. In each phase, we derive the pressure exerted by the rod (DNA) on the container (capsid) and the force necessary to inject (eject) the rod into (out of) the container. Finally, we discuss {{the relevance of the}} present results with respect to physical and biological problems. Regarding DNA packaging in viral capsids, these results establish the existence of ordered configurations, a hypothesis upon which previous calculations were built. They also show that such ordering can result from simple mechanical constraints...|$|R

The methods {{are based on the}} principle of minimum energy and on structural beam models. The analytical solutions are obtained using symbolic processing software. The microstructure of the random foam is simulated using Voronoi tessellation together with a rate-dependent random close-packing algorithm. The statistics of the geometrical properties of random foams corresponding to different packing fractions have been studied. The effects of the <b>packing</b> fraction on <b>elastic</b> properties of the foams have been investigated by decomposing the compliance into bending and axial compliance components.

40|$|AbstractAn elastic DNA {{molecular}} mechanics {{model is}} used to compare DNA structures and packing thermodynamics in two bacteriophage systems, T 7 and ϕ 29. A discrete packing protocol allows for multiple molecular dynamics simulations of the entire packing event. In T 7, the DNA is coaxially spooled around the cylindrical core protein, whereas the ϕ 29 system, which lacks a core protein, organizes the DNA concentrically, but not coaxially. Two-dimensional projections of the packed structures from T 7 simulations are consistent with cryo-electron micrographs of T 7 phage DNA. The functional form of the force required to package the ϕ 29 DNA is similar to forces determined experimentally, although the total free energy change is only 40 % of the experimental value. Since electrostatics {{are not included in}} the simulations, this suggests that electrostatic repulsions are responsible for ∼ 60 % of the free energy required for packaging. The entropic penalty from DNA confinement has not been computed in previous studies, but it is often assumed to make a negligible contribution to the total work done in packing the DNA. Conformational entropy can be measured in our approach, and it accounts for 70 – 80 % of the total work done in <b>packing</b> the <b>elastic</b> model DNA in both phages. For ϕ 29, this corresponds to an entropic penalty of ∼ 35 % of the total work observed experimentally...|$|R
40|$|DNA origami {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} ways to create novel two-dimensional (2 D) and 3 D structures, assemble inorganic and organic materials, and synthesise functional micro/nano systems. In particular, DNA origami structures consisting of nanotube configurations can function as mechanical components for encapsulating materials such as gold particles or drug proteins, due to their tubular structure, relatively high rigidity, high aspect ratio and other desirable characteristics, but certain mechanical properties such as radial rigidity have yet to be fully determined experimentally. A report is presented on the direct measurement of the radial modulus of a DNA nanotube structure by force–distance curve-based atomic force microscopy, in a magnesium ion solution. A Hertz model, corrected using the finite-element method to achieve greater realism, was employed to determine the DNA nanotube's actual radial modulus in two states, corresponding to the rigidity of a porous and electrostatically repulsive nanotube lattice, and the rigidity of a <b>packed</b> and <b>elastic</b> honeycomb lattice. Furthermore, the biphasic radial modulus was verified by estimation of the inter-helix electrostatic force and torsional rigidity of a six-helix DNA nanotube, with results comparable to those reported elsewhere. The anisotropy of the DNA nanotube honeycomb lattice revealed by the authors’ radial measurements should be useful when developing new DNA structures and may enable further applications that utilise DNA origami structures as a mechanical component...|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} program is {{presented}} to simulate the process of <b>packing</b> and coiling <b>elastic</b> wires in two- and three-dimensional confining cavities. The wire is represented by third order beam elements and embedded into a corotational formulation to capture the geometric nonlinearity resulting from large rotations and deformations. The hyperbolic equations of motion are integrated in time using two different integration methods from the Newmark family: an implicit iterative Newton-Raphson line search solver, and an explicit predictor-corrector scheme, both with adaptive time stepping. These two approaches reveal fundamentally different suitability for the problem of strongly self-interacting bodies found in densely packed cavities. Generalizing the spherical confinement symmetry investigated in recent studies, the packing of a wire in hard ellipsoidal cavities is simulated in the frictionless elastic limit. Evidence is given that packings in oblate spheroids and scalene ellipsoids are energetically preferred to spheres. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|A new volume {{integral}} equation method (VIEM) {{is used to}} study problems involving wave scattering by multiple inclusions and cracks. The major objective {{of this study is}} to determine the characteristics of the scattered field in metal matrix composites with large fibers in presence of microcracks and other defects. Since composites consist of a large number of closely <b>packed</b> fibers, the <b>elastic</b> field in these materials is strongly affected by the interaction between microcracks and the fibers. Thus, to analyze the effects of microcracks on the scattered field in composites is of particular interest in ultrasonic NDE for crack detection and characterization. In this paper we consider the scattering of elastic waves by a distribution of long parallel fibers in presence or absence of interface debonding. We use the VIEM to calculate the scattering cross section from the fibers and discuss the possible application of the results in the nondestructive characterization of the fibermatrix interface degradation in structural composites...|$|R
40|$|International audienceManifestations of the {{so-called}} structure induced nonlinearity are considered for {{the case of a}} granular medium, the latter being a generally accepted model of nonconsolidated rocks in seismics. The consideration is carried out using the medium model {{in the form of the}} "ideal" random <b>packing</b> of spherical <b>elastic</b> granules in which the interparticle space can be filled with a fluid. A physical equation of such a medium is derived; the dependencies of nonlinear parameters on the grain material elastic moduli, the fluid compressibility and the initial medium strain are analyzed. The influence of defects in nonideal grain packings (that is, the presence of a fraction of unloaded intergranular contacts) upon the nonlinear properties of the medium is investigated. It is shown that the packing nonideality has the stronger effect on higher-order nonlinear properties. It is demonstrated that the nonlinear parameters may be used in exploration seismology as a much more sensitive and informative characteristic compared with conventionally used linear moduli...|$|R
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the elasticity and rheology of disordered materials, such as granular piles, foams, emulsions or dense suspensions relies on improving experimental tools to characterize their behaviour at the particle scale. While 2 D observations are now routinely carried out in laboratories, 3 D measurements remain a challenge. In this paper, we use a simple model system, a <b>packing</b> of soft <b>elastic</b> spheres, to illustrate the capability of X-ray microtomography to characterise the internal structure and local behaviour of granular systems. Image analysis techniques can resolve grain positions, shapes and contact areas; this is used to investigate the material's microstructure and its evolution upon strain. In addition to morphological measurements, we develop a technique to quantify contact forces and estimate the internal stress tensor.

30|$|The biopsy {{protocol}} and selection criteria for SVAB were identical for the 11 G and 8 G groups. Pre-biopsy medication restriction guidelines and routine post-biopsy care (manual compression, dressing, ice <b>pack,</b> and <b>elastic</b> band application) were also identical {{for these two}} groups. Stereotactic biopsy was used for calcifications without definite mass on MMG and no definite lesion on US. All biopsy targets were BI-RADS category 4 or 5 lesions and some 3 lesions which the patients want to biopsy. Lesion size and density of breast parenchyma were not used as criteria for exclusion from SVAB. Informed consent for biopsy was obtained from each patient. Images were obtained {{before and after the}} biopsy device were activated to document accurate needle position in the targeted lesion. Retargeting was performed if necessary. Biopsy specimens were typically obtained in a 360 ° rotation with the directional biopsy instrument, particularly when needle placement was within the lesion. When MMG obtained after the instrument was activated showed the needle to be immediately adjacent to the lesion, cores were obtained with the bowl of the needle directed toward the lesion. Standard practice at our institution {{at the time of the}} study was to obtain sufficient specimens to acquire adequate calcifications on routine specimen radiography. The radiologist assessed the specimen radiograph and obtained additional cores as needed. Post-biopsy MMGs were routinely obtained for the evaluation of residual calcification. Lesion type, number of cores obtained, and pathology results were recorded by the radiologist performing the procedure. Acute complications such as hematoma or bleeding also were recorded.|$|R

The database contains the atomic radii information as well as elastic properties {{of the most commonly}} used alloying elements, permitting composition, <b>packing</b> efficiency and <b>elastic</b> property predictions to be made for binary, ternary and quaternary bulk metallic glasses. Twenty different alloys per system (binary, ternary and quaternary) experimentally reported in the literature were compared with those estimated by the database. Comparison charts and diagrams showed good agreement between the composition predictions and those reported from the experimentally processed metallic glasses. The elastic properties predictions could be used to elaborate Blackman diagrams in order to know, in advance, the intrinsic toughness that the investigated alloys might present. The database is intended for designing bulk metallic glasses. Finally, some quaternary alloys were experimentally produced based on the prediction obtained with the database, showing a glassy phase.

40|$|The {{development}} of elastin lamellae {{in the media}} of elastic type arteries such as the aorta appears to be modulated by mechanical factors such as flow. On that basis, decreased aortic flow during fetal development is {{held responsible for the}} occurrence of tubular hypoplasia of the aortic arch. Under{{development of}} the ascending aorta in aortic atresia likewise is considered due to diminished retrograde flow from the aortic arch. The present study has examined this hypothesis by comparing the number of elastic lamellae in hypoplastic segments of the aortic arch and ascending aorta with corresponding segments from normal aorta. In both situations the underdeveloped segments show a paucity of cellular and supportive connective tissue constituents, leading to a densely <b>packed</b> layer of <b>elastic</b> lamellae and, thus, contributing to the diminished dimensions. A major difference, however, was noted with respect to the number of elastic lamellae. In the hypoplastic ascending aorta in aortic atresia, the number was not different from that encountered in normal specimens. In tubular hypoplasia, on the other hand, the number of elastic lamellae was significantly lower than in the corresponding segments of normal specimens (P less than 0. 01). Taking the stance that flow is a major factor in proper development of the aortic media, it seems that the findings in tubular hypoplasia fit well with a chronic lack of tension from early development and, hence, relate directly to the cardiac malformation. The findings in the ascending aorta of aortic atresia are less easy to understand from this point of view. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{cholesterol}} on the interfacial <b>elastic</b> <b>packing</b> interactions of various molecular species of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) {{has been investigated}} by using a Langmuir-type film balance and analyzing the elastic area compressibility moduli (Cs(- 1)) {{as a function of}} average cross-sectional molecular area. Emphasis was on the high surface pressure regions (pi > or = 30 mN/m) which are thought to mimic biomembrane conditions. Increasing levels of cholesterol generally caused the in-plane elasticity of the mixed monolayers to decrease. Yet, the magnitude of the cholesterol-induced changes was markedly dependent upon PC hydrocarbon structure. Among PC species with a saturated sn- 1 chain but different sn- 2 chain cis unsaturation levels [e. g., myristate (14 : 0), oleate (18 : 1 delta 9 (c), linoleate (18 : 2 delta 9, 12 (c), arachidonate (20 : 4 delta 5, 8, 11, 14 (c), or docosahexenoate (22 : 6 delta 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 (c) ], the in-plane elasticity moduli of PC species with higher sn- 2 unsaturation levels were less affected by high cholesterol mol fractions (e. g., > 30 mol %) than were the more saturated PC species. The largest cholesterol-induced decreases in the in-plane elasticity were observed when both chains of PC were saturated (e. g., di- 14 : 0 PC). When both acyl chains were identically unsaturated, the resulting PCs were 20 - 25 % more elastic in the presence of cholesterol than when their sn- 1 chains were long and saturated (e. g., palmitate). The mixing of cholesterol with PC was found to diminish the in-plane elasticity of the films beyond what was predicted from the additive behavior of the individual lipid components apportioned by mole and area fraction. Deviations from additivity were greatest for di- 14 : 0 PC and were least for diarachidonoyl PC and didocosahexenoyl PC. In contrast to Cs(- 1) analyses, sterol-induced area condensations were relatively unresponsive to subtle structural differences in the PCs at high surface pressures. Cs(- 1) versus average area plots also indicated the presence of cholesterol concentration-dependent, low-pressure (< 14 mN/m) phase boundaries that became more prominent as PC acyl chain unsaturation increased. Hence, area condensations measured at low surface pressures often do not accurately portray which lipid structural features are important in the lipid-sterol interactions that occur at high membrane-like surface pressures...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} <b>elastic</b> <b>packing</b> {{interactions of}} different galactosylceramides (GalCers), sphingomyelins (SMs), and phosphatidylcholines (PC) were compared by determining their elastic area compressibility moduli (Cs- 1) {{as a function}} of lateral packing pressure (pi) in a Langmuir-type film balance. To assess the relative contributions of the lipid headgroups {{as well as those of}} the ceramide and diacylglycerol hydrocarbon regions, we synthesized various GalCer and SM species with identical, homogeneous acyl residues and compared their behavior to that of PCs possessing similar hydrocarbon structures. For PCs, this meant that the sn- 1 acyl chain was long and saturated (e. g., palmitate) and the sn- 2 chain composition was varied to match that of GalCer or SM. When at equivalent pi and in either the chain-disordered (liquid-expanded) or chain-ordered (liquid-condensed) state, GalCer films were less elastic than either SM or PC films. When lipid headgroups were identical (SM and PC), Cs- 1 values (at equivalent pi) for chain-disordered SMs, but not chain-ordered SMs, were 25 - 30 % higher than those of PCs. Typical values for fluid phase (liquid-expanded) GalCer at 30 mN/m and 24 degrees C were 158 (+/- 7) mN/m, whereas those of SM were 135 (+/- 7) mN/m and those of PC were 123 (+/- 2) mN/m. Pressure-induced transitions to chain-ordered states (liquid-condensed) resulted in significant increases (two- to fourfold) in the "in-plane" compressibility for all three lipid types. Typical Cs- 1 values for chain-ordered GalCers at 30 mN/m and 24 degrees C were between 610 and 650 mN/m, whereas those of SM and of PC were very similar and were between 265 and 300 mN/m. Under fluid phase conditions, the pi-Cs- 1 behavior for each lipid type was insensitive to whether the acyl chain was saturated or monounsaturated. Measurement of the Cs- 1 values also provided an effective way to evaluate the two-dimensional phase transition region of SMs, GalCers, and PCs. Modest heterogeneity in the acyl composition led to transitional broadening. Our findings provide useful information regarding the in-plane elasticity of lipids that are difficult to investigate by alternative methods, i. e., micropipette aspiration technique. The results also provide insight into the stability of sphingolipid-enriched, membrane microdomains that are thought to play a role in the sorting and trafficking of proteins containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors with cells...|$|R
