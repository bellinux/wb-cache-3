40|$|Invited paperThe {{last three}} years Belgian (Flanders) {{education}} policy for secondary schools is characterized by devolution {{and a number of}} measures to improve the effectiveness of schooling. One of the major changes is the establishment of a new participatory structure in both private (<b>participation</b> <b>council)</b> and public schools (local school council). Although this new participatory structure was established, most of the other participatory councils are still operating. This means new possibilities for school leaders to develop a local school policy, {{but at the same time}} a new challenge. In the new participatory structure heads have to cope with new participants in school policy (e. g. are parents, representatives of local economic and cultural organizations, puplils) and with a very complex participatory structure. On the base of in-depth interviewing in 12 schools the strategies developed by schools to cope with these new challenge will be described. First, the analysis will be focused on the strategies from the standpoint of the heads and two other members of the local school council or <b>participation</b> <b>council,</b> namely parents and teachers. Second, the relationship between the new participatory structure and the old participatory councils will be analyzed. Third, an assessment of the improvement of the new participatory structure for local school policy in comparison with the old structure will be given as it is seen by the main policy makers. status: publishe...|$|E

The data suggests that, whatever their other merits, these new bodies are not on their own a sufficient condition for enabling increased levels of parental participation in the decision-making processes of schools. If this is to happen, councils will need to develop a new culture of cooperation. Only then will parents have a real say in school policy making. status: publishe...|$|E

Dit project werd gefinancierd door het Fonds voor Collectief Fundamenteel Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (M. I. 93. 10) en gebeurde in opdracht van het Departement Onderwijs van het Ministerie van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap. Een volledig, meer technisch, onderzoeksverslag, inclusief een literatuurstudie, werd door ons en Filip Bally eveneens gepubliceerd onder de titel "De werking van participatieraden en lokale schoolraden. Een evaluatie in het basis- en secundair onderwijs", eveneens bij Garant. Since the Participation Act (23 October 1991), {{free and}} {{municipal}} {{schools have been}} obliged to organise a participatieraad (<b>participation</b> <b>council)</b> chaired by the head, who has to be independent of the factions of the council. The factions represented in the <b>participation</b> <b>council</b> are: the organising authority, the staff, the parents and co-opted representatives of the local community. Moreover, in each school or group of schools, a local school council exists of four members elected by the parents. In addition, four members of local economic, social and cultural organisations are appointed by the parents’ representatives, and three representatives of the pedagogical council (‘pedagogisch college’) are co-opted by the two former groups. This book offers {{the results of the}} first survey about the functioning of these councils. Before the researchers organized a survey among the council members (N = 4, 298), they had conducted 12 case studies on the subject. The main questions answered in this book are: how are the councils composed; are the members of the councils satisfied with the councils and why; how high do the members appreciate the functioning of the councils; what is the influence of the councils on school-based management. nrpages: 131 status: publishe...|$|E

This is because there are no community organizations or board that could representatively work on behalf of the community with regard to river problems.

Apart from facilitative styles emphasized by Sutcliffe (2012) and Sophia and Mark (2006) as important to encourage the participation of sectors and exchange of information, this study found out that the acceptance or recognition of the letters of invitations from the organizers also affects the involvement of sectors. Thus, the community needs to be consulted to create a collaborative system among various members of the community.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{establishment}} of <b>participation</b> <b>councils</b> and local school councils {{a few years}} ago in Belgium {{can be seen in the}} light of the striving of the Flemish Government for more democratic decision-making in schools. This article focuses on the role of teachers in these councils. The main objective of this article is investigating the influence of the participatory council on school policy in the view of teachers’representatives and whether, in the opinion of teachers’ representatives, the new participatory structure in Belgian (Flemish) schools actually influences school policy. A survey approach was the appropriate method to collect the answers to these questions. The ultimate information we wanted to obtain was whether these new participatory councils had enhanced teacher empowerment. Literature suggests that, in spite of teachers’ participation, this is not the case. The data show that these new bodies are not sufficient to increase teacher empowerment. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{participation}} of communities and community organizations in Municipal governance {{is set in}} terms of the law as a mechanism to deepen democracy. Municipalities are required to develop a culture of governance that complements representative democracy with community participation. However the {{participation of}} communities in local governance has not translated to the strengthening of governance and the deepening of democracy as municipalities have not done enough to involve communities in municipal affaires. Lack of human resources, and financial capacity have been cited as some of the reasons that beset municipalities and undermine citizen participation. Municipalities have taken steps to encourage community participation and these include establishment of structures to enable participation, however without the guidance and financial support of the municipalities these structures are not able to perform their functions. In spite of all the efforts made by municipalities to encourage participation, a culture of community participation has not yet taken root in local government. While the legislative framework provides for communities to participate, practice shows that the implementation of legislation is complex and requires dedicated capacities within the councils to be effective. This can be achieved when municipalities develop their own community participation policies which address their special circumstances, which must be reviewed on a regular basis. Unless communities are empowered with knowledge on the available participation mechanisms, the dream of a culture of participation will remain just that, a dream. Thus civic education coupled with capacity building of officials will assist in ensuring the development of a culture of <b>participation.</b> <b>Council</b> must also develop mechanisms {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} community participation processes and procedures, to avoid a one size fits all approach. It is imperative that councils as the legislative arm of municipalities must lead the process and not leave everything to the executive arm...|$|E
40|$|Most {{schools of}} {{democratic}} theory consider political participation {{to have a}} positive impact in deepening democracy. Political participation makes democracies more accountable and freer, as well as creating more engaged, civic minded and public spirited citizens. It has been observed that in regimes where citizens lack capacity for self-organization and political engagement this contributes to a lower quality of their democratic regimes and institutions. Moreover, this connection is even more vital in democratizing settings and new democracies, like the Southern European countries of Portugal, Spain, and Greece. Research has shown that in democracies that emerged after a long experience of authoritarianism there will be a lower capacity for mobilization of citizens. Democratic regimes may became established, with the minimal requirements (freedom of the press, civil and political liberties, a functioning party system, free and fair elections), but they will have a lower quality because there will be very weak attachments of citizens to its institutions. After the euphoria of participation during the transition, desencanto (disenchantment, disappointment) settles in, estranging citizen’s from the democratic process. Contrary to older democracies, where political participation tended to grow steadily after the transition and for decades, in new democracies the high levels of participation of the transition give place to very weak levels of participation. Even more troubling, new democracies are also characterized by strong inequalities in participation, which affect especially popular groups and the poor, but also the middle classes.

Not satisfied with culturally essentialist notions of parental apathy of disinterest the authors examine the reason why this couture of silence occurs. Through a journey of understanding of school-community relations of several primary and one secondary school that included classroom observation of teaching, ethnographic interviews and conversations with parents we reached the conclusion that the relationship between school and community is “a divorce of convenience”. Each party finds it more convenient to keep it from the other rather than collaborating to improve the education of the students. The details of this phenomenon are discussed in the article...|$|R

The {{reform of}} the Flemish higher {{education}} in 1994 university colleges were assigned new tasks {{and they had to}} create new representative bodies. The question arises to what extent the new structures and the new policy processes function as they were originally intended. The researchers examine to what extent the staff, five years after the acceptance of the university college decree, is actually involved in the management of the university colleges. The involvement of staff in decision includes several dimensions. Taking into account these various dimensions of decision-making in our study we distinguish between the formal decision which happens under the authority of specific bodies and the informal decision, which rather refers to the openness of the university college management for participatory decision-making. This dichotomy has been translated into the following questions: How do managers and staff perceive the operation of the legally obligatory <b>participation</b> <b>councils?</b> - Who sets the agenda for meetings? - Do preparatory documents arrive on time to the members? – Do the documents contain sufficient information? - Can the members influence the opinions and decisions made in the councils? – Do managers take into account the opinions or decisions of the council? -Is the council useful? –Are council members generally satisfied with the functioning of the body? - How do general managers and staff evaluate the leadership style of the general managers?nrpages: 17 status: publishe...|$|R
