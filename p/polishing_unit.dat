40|$|Abstract — In {{spite of}} the facts that coffee is highly {{economical}} and can boost the country’s revenue, coffee production is fast declining in Nigeria and the participation of farmers has become very low. This {{may be attributed to}} inadequate processing technology as result of the high level of drudgery involve in the shelling of the coffee bean by manual method. Therefore, there is need to develop a dehulling and polishing machine that will help increase both the quality and production of coffee seed. This work was aimed at the design, construction and performance evaluation of a combined coffee bean dehulling and polishing machine. The two units-dehulling and polishing units were incorporated in a single machine in order to prevent drudgery associated with the traditional method of dehulling and separation of the hull from the dehulled coffee bean seed. The first unit of the machine consist of a hopper; through which the coffee was fed into the the machine, and dehulling cylinder; which houses the dehulling shaft that dehulls the bean. The second unit of the machine consists of the polishing drum and brushes, attached to the dehulling shaft. The performance of the machine was evaluated following optimum operating condition of the length of dehulling shaft, speed of rotation of the dehulling shaft and the rotating brushes attached to the rotating shaft in <b>polishing</b> <b>unit</b> of the machine. Based on this conditions, the worked optimally at the rate of 180 kg/hr. the result showed that the performance of the machine were 56. 67 % and 64. 66 % respectively for dehulling and <b>polishing</b> <b>unit.</b> This was obtained at a dehulling head of 500 rpm as the speed of the dehulling shaft...|$|E

40|$|The larger reactor volume, {{additional}} oxygen <b>polishing</b> <b>unit,</b> {{and carbon}} stripper for {{the separation of}} oxygen carriers and ash in the chemical looping combustion (CLC) and/or chemical looping oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) processes for solid fuels are anticipated not only to incur operational complexity but also to increase the capital and operating costs. As an alternative, this paper proposes a novel hybrid process, called "Chemical Looping Oxy Combustor (CLOC) ". This novel process provides an integration of chemical looping air separation (CLAS) with fluidized bed oxy-fuel combustion {{and is expected to}} eliminate the need for an additional oxygen <b>polishing</b> <b>unit</b> and carbon stripper. It can be retrofitted to any existing coal circulating fluidized bed (CFB) at low cost. The other advantages of CLOC includes less solid handling issues, flexibility in handling low-grade coal with high moisture, no/less contamination of oxygen carriers, no/less slip of CO₂/SOₓ in an air reactor, low energy penalty, etc. Also, in the CLOC process, coal combustion will occur in a separate fluidized bed combustor with relatively faster kinetics, because of the availability of high oxygen concentration (i. e., ~ 25 - 28 vol%), which eliminates the need for a larger fuel reactor volume. In the current paper, thermodynamic simulations of CLOC process using Cu-, Mn-, and Co-based metal oxide oxygen carriers were performed. Their performances were also compared against the conventional air-firing and oxy-firing technologies, e. g., oxy-fuel combustion integrated with cryogenic air separation unit (CASU) and CLOU. It was identified that the CLOC process needs external heat for reduction reactor provided by either direct or indirect methane combustion. Moreover, a maximum plant thermal efficiency was achieved for CLOC using Cu-based oxygen carrier. The energy penalty of the CLOC process, compared with the air-firing base case, was found to be ~ 2 %- 3 %, which is ~ 4 - 5 times smaller than those of the CASU cases and only half of that of the CLOU process, indicating that CLOC offers a promising option for the combustion of solid fuels...|$|E

The saw dust has been acquired from a wood <b>polishing</b> <b>unit.</b> The physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics of WA is presented and analyzed. The strength parameters (compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength) of concrete with blended WA cement are evaluated and studied. Two different water-to-binder ratio (0. 4 and 0. 45) and five different replacement percentages of WA (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 18 % and 20 %) including control specimens for both water-to-cement ratio is considered. Results of compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength showed that the strength properties of concrete mixture decreased marginally with increase in wood ash contents, but strength increased with later age. The XRD test results and chemical analysis of WA showed that it contains amorphous silica and thus {{can be used as}} cement replacing material. Through the analysis of results obtained in this study, it was concluded that WA could be blended with cement without adversely affecting the strength properties of concrete. Also using a new statistical theory of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), strength parameters were predicted by developing a suitable model and as a result, the application of soft computing in structural engineering has been successfully presented in this research paper...|$|E

40|$|In view of {{the rapid}} growth of urban population, {{industrialization}} and inadequate infrastructure, the river water quality across the country {{has been found to be}} deteriorating alarmingly. Recognizing the gravity of the problem, Government of India launched a massive plan for river conservation across the country. Ganges, being one of the most sacred and largest rivers in the country, was identified for priority intervention in 1985. In the subsequent stage river Yamuna was selected which is one of the major tributaries of Ganges and passes through some of the major urban centres including the national capital of Delhi. Combined effect of modified flow regime due to water holding structures and the cumulative discharge of domestic, industrial and agricultural wastewaters has converted Yamuna into almost an open sewer and very often fish kills are observed in the Delhi stretch and downstream upto Etawah. Yamuna Action Plan (YAP) was formulated to mitigate the level of water pollution from major urban centres. The Plan was implemented during 1993 – 2003, wherein sewage treatment plants for 14 Class-I cities were constructed with emphasis on energy efficient treatment processes viz. UASB and oxidation pond. A number of pilot projects on innovative technologies for decentralised sewage treatment and Coliform removal were implemented.

The process supports the mission and goals of the Department of Energyâs Gasification Technologies Program, namely to enhance the performance of gasification systems, thus enabling U. S. industry to improve the competitiveness of gasification-based processes. The gasification program will reduce equipment costs, improve process environmental performance, and increase process reliability and flexibility. Two sulfur conversion concepts were tested in the laboratory under this project, i. e., the solventbased, high-pressure University of California Sulfur Recovery Process â High Pressure (UCSRP-HP) and the catalytic-based, direct oxidation (DO) section of the CrystaSulf-DO process. Each process required a <b>polishing</b> <b>unit</b> to meet the ultra-clean sulfur content goals of < 50 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) as may be necessary for fuel cells or chemical production applications.

40|$|Aim of the study: Though {{efficient}} in stain and plaque removal, air polishing is highly abrasive on root cementum or dentin even if working parameters are adjusted to minimize damage. As abrasiveness is {{also influenced by}} the physical properties of the powders used, {{the aim of the}} study was to evaluate the safety of novel low abrasive air polishing powders in vitro. Material and methods: Using four novel air polishing powders (A, B, C and D) and a standard sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) powder, roots of 126 extracted teeth were air polished under standardized conditions at various working parameter combinations (distance: 2 mm, 4 mm and 6 mm; powder and water setting: low, medium and high) at an angulation of 90 ° for 20 s. Instrumentation was performed in triplicate; resulting root defects were quantified laser-optically. Results: Mean defect depths after application of powders A, B, C and D were significantly lower than with standard powder (A: 17. 9 ± 10. 9 μm, B: 48. 2 ± 32. 7 μm, C: 92. 5 ± 51. 9 μm, D: 33. 9 ± 19. 6 μm, NaHCO 3 : 163. 1 ± 71. 1 μm) (Kruskal-Wallis test). Among the experimental powders, D was transported most reliably in the air <b>polishing</b> <b>unit</b> and allowed complete removal of disclosed plaque as assessed on freshly extracted teeth. Conclusion: The novel air polishing powder D is of low abrasiveness to root cementum and dentin while being effective in removing dental plaque. Thus, it may be useful for safe and efficient plaque removal on exposed root surfaces. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to develop simulation models for multistage production system under processing time and quality variation, to identify areas of potential bottleneck in production system and to determine the optimum production lot size for each station in a multistage production system under the uncertainties to minimize the WIP level and lead time and thereby the total system cost. A simulation model is developed based on a live case from a Malaysian company. Taguchi approach for orthogonal array is used in designing experiments and these are executed in WITNESS. The models are verified and validated by face validity, the historical data from the company and analytical model. The delivery performances, average lead time and work-in-progress (WIP) in the system, are examined for different experimental scenarios. Interaction effects and confirmation tests are also performed. The optimal batch sizes respectively for <b>polishing</b> <b>unit</b> (PU), quality control (QC) and packing stations are 8, 16 and 3 at minimum WIP and lead time. If the company uses these optimal batch sizes, a total of 24 % improvement can be obtained. The simulation models show that Gasketing station is the bottleneck and batch size selection in PU station is the most critical decision in the system. The interaction effects are insignificant. The main contribution {{of this research is}} determination of the optimal lot sizes under imperfect quality of product and stochastic processing time.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of different air polishing powders on the surface roughness of different types of composite resin restorative materials. Materials and methodsThirty cylindrical specimens (15 ± 2 mm) were prepared for each of seven composite resin restorative materials. All specimens were polished with a series of aluminum oxide polishing discs (Sof-Lex). Prepared specimens of each composite resin were randomly divided into three groups of 10 specimens each, including a control (Group C) and two different air-powder applications (Group CP, Cavitron Prophy-Jet; and Group PS, Sirona ProSmile prophylaxis powder). A standard air <b>polishing</b> <b>unit</b> (ProSmileHandly) was used. All specimens were air-polished for 10 seconds at a pressure of 4 bar. The distance of the spray nozzle from the specimens was approximately 10 mm, and the angle of the nozzle was 90 ±. Surface roughness measurements (Ra, ±m) were performed using a profilometer (Perthometer M 2). Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and mean values were compared by Tukey's honestly significant difference test (a = 0. 05). ResultsAccording to the two-way ANOVA, composite resins, air polishing powders, and their interactions were statistically significant (P 0. 05), and these groups demonstrated the highest Ra values for the Aelite Aesthetic Enamel, FiltekZ 250, and IntenS composite resin restorative materials. The lowest Ra values for the composite resin groups were observed in Group C (P < 0. 05). When comparing composite resins, FiltekZ 250 demonstrated statistically significantly lower Ra values than the other composite resins tested (P < 0. 05). No significant difference was observed between the IntenS and Quixfil composite resin groups; these groups also demonstrated the highest Ra values.
