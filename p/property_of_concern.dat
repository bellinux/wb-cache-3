In the HVOF spray process, significant peening stresses are generated during impact of semi molten particles on the substrate. The combination of these peening stresses together with quenching and thermal mismatch stresses can be of significant importance. Both numerical Finite Element Method (FEM), to calculate peening, quenching stresses, and experimental methods, i. e. Modified Layer Removal Method (MLRM) and Neutron Diffraction, have been utilised in this work. The investigation was performed on thick Inconel 718 coatings on Inconel 718 substrates. Combined, these numerical and experimental techniques yield {{a deeper understanding of}} residual stress formation in the HVOF process and thus a tool for process optimisation.

30|$|Within Annex XIII of the REACH legislation, the {{identification}} of SVHC may also be justified on ‘weight-of-evidence’ information, i.e. results from monitoring in the field, from suitable laboratory experiments, or on elevated pollutant concentrations in organisms compared to concentrations in their environment, especially in endemic or endangered species. This goes along with the recommendations of ECHA who points out in Chapter R. 11 PBT Assessment of the Guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment that remote areas and their ‘intrinsic value of pristine environments’ (p. 7) should be protected from adverse effects of chemical substances [2]. In addition, ‘borderline chemicals’ which fail {{at least one of}} the persistence (P), bioaccumulation (B) and toxicity (T) criteria but show an equivalent level of concern, e.g. by widespread distribution and long-range transport potential (LRTP), should be considered as SVHC within a PBT assessment. Nevertheless, the LRTP of an organic compound is not yet considered under REACH, although LRTP is also defined as a <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> according to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) [3] in addition to persistence, bioaccumulation and adverse effects. Substances with LRTP cross international boundaries and may be transported via air, water [4] or with migrating animals to particularly sensitive ecosystems like the Arctic. This is of special interest when one substance fails or misses PBT or vPvB criteria slightly. Especially in these borderline cases, LRTP can be a significant property to indicate very high concern and support a prioritization of chemicals. Currently, the publicly available REACH database of end 2012 contains 5, 306 publishable compounds registered in the European Union and can be downloaded from the official homepage of the European Chemicals Agency [5]. ‘Publishable’ substances include all of the 5, 705 registered compounds except those where either the IUPAC name is claimed confidential according to REACH Article 119 (2) (f) or (g) or where there has been no dossier disseminated. For the remaining 5, 306 substances, at least one registration document has been processed and been published (in a filtered version) on the Dissemination Portal [5].|$|E
30|$|Short-chain PFASs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) {{are widely}} used as {{alternatives}} to long-chain PFASs. Long-chain PFASs become gradually regulated under REACH (EC No. 1907 / 2006) and other international regulations, due to having persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic properties and/or being toxic for reproduction. The increasingly used short-chain PFASs are assumed to have a lower bioaccumulation potential.

Quantifying the optical properties of Australian atmospheres {{will be part}} of a site survey to determine the viability of possible IACT Australian sites. Atmospheric optical properties need to be quantified as a TeV IACT γ-ray array detects Cherenkov radiation that has propagated through the atmosphere within the visible spectrum. For the optimum collection of Cherenkov radiation, sites with the highest optical atmospheric transmission are ideal. Another optical <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> is the night sky background (NSB) level. NSB photons are a form of background noise that can cause accidental triggering, therefore sites with the lowest levels of NSB are desired. Further information on IACT and the NSB is presented in Chapter 2. The optical properties of the Australian atmosphere which I quantified for the site surveys were the optical transmission and the NSB. The optical transmission was measured through the star extinction coefficient. The star extinction coefficient and the NSB were found through the method of photometry using a Pentax K 10 D digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera. Because a Pentax K 10 D DSLR camera has not previously been used for this purpose, I initially conducted viability tests on its ability to measure the NSB and star extinction coefficients. I will present these results in Chapter 5. Data collected from multiple trips to Fowlers Gap in New South Wales, Australia, were used for this purpose. I will present the results of star extinction coefficient and NSB level measurements in Chapter 6. To further help understand the effects of atmospheric conditions, I have investigated the effects of differing levels of aerosols and the effects of cirrus clouds on the performance of a simulated ≥ 10 TeV IACT γ-ray array. I give more information about simulated IACT γ-ray array's in Chapter 3 and present the results in Chapter 4.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the microphysical properties of clouds {{made up of}} ice particles, called ice clouds. Ice clouds are strong modulators of the outgoing longwave radiation and incoming shortwave radiation, yet our knowledge on several key ice cloud properties, which govern the magnitude and sign of the net contribution to the Earth’s atmospheric radiation budget, is inadequate. For instance, currently climate models are far from consensus on the magnitude and spatial distribution of ice water path (IWP), a vital radiative property of ice clouds, and the main <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> in this thesis. The large spread amongst the models in terms of IWP is mostly {{due to the lack}} of constraints from observations on ice cloud properties. The lacking constraints reflect the major difficulties faced in observing global ice cloud properties. In-situ measurements provide useful sources of information on ice clouds, but are far from adequate due to the sparseness of measurements. Cloud ice observations from satellites provides a global view and is the most useful source of information. However, measurements from satellites also carry large uncertainties and are notoriously difficult to use for model evaluation, due to a mismatch on how IWP is defined in the models compared to what is actually observed. Not one satellite instrument can measure ice particle information from the entire ice cloud column, as desired from the model point of view. Satellite observations of IWP depend for the most part on the wavelength spectrum the instrument measures in, hence the instruments measure related, but different information on clouds. A study addressing the satellite observed and modeled IWP is presented in the first appended article: Eliasson et al. [2011]. Large differences between climate models are observations, especially in areas with frequent deep convection, were reported and discussed. The second appended article is a first evaluation study of cloud parameters, such as IWP, in the EC-Earth climate model using satellite A-Train observations. The model captures large-scale features for the most part but has problems related to ice water content and cloud fraction. This is strongly linked to the treatment of precipitation. The thesis contains introductory chapters on ice clouds; their formation, radiative importance, and representation in climate models. This is followed by a more in depth chapter on the observational data. The different satellite techniques are then discussed following a radiation physics and radiative transfer background section.

40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industry, {{components}} used in {{the drill}} mud handling system suffer from erosive wear. Drill mud containing a fairly large fraction of sand moving at high speed, creates harsh conditions with respect to erosion. Cemented carbides are being used as coating to obviate wear caused by erosion and abrasion in the most exposed and critical components. However, in some cases when selecting a coating material, the erosive wear resistance is not the only <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern.</b> Lyng Drilling, a Slumberger company, has developed a new type of nickel coating with certain properties to be used in drilling mud systems. The coating has proved to meet its requirements, but wears out rather fast due to erosion. To retain the desired properties {{and at the same time}} increase erosive wear resistance, reinforcement of the nickel coating with diamond particles has been proposed as a solution. This study mainly concerned erosion of diamond composite coatings, where the aim was to quantify the erosion dependence on diamond concentration and angle of impact. In addition, the effect of the size ratio between hard particles in the coating and the erodent were going to be investigated. This was not carried out as the erosion rig used was not capable of transporting fine grained sand. Up to this date, more research has been conducted on erosion behavior of cemented tungsten carbides than for diamond composites. Two cemented tungsten carbide materials were therefore included in the test program to compare the erosion behavior with a more familiar composite material. Nickel-diamond coatings containing 31, 38 and 43 vol. % 36 to 38 micro meter large diamond particles were tested at 15 and 30 degrees impact angle. A new slurry jet erosion test rig, where the erodent was applied to the water jet stream by compressed air, was used to perform erosion test of the materials. During the test program some essential weaknesses with the concept were discovered, which in turn have limited the results achieved from this project. However, the results from the current work indicate that erosion decreases with a higher concentration of diamond particles. Also, less erosion was seen at 15 degrees impact angle, than for 30 degrees. Investigation of the eroded surfaces in Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) showed that the diamond particles developed comet tails of binder material behind it. Longer comet tails were seen for 15 degrees than for 30 degrees, which is believed to be the reason for the brittle characteristic with respect to angle. The mechanical properties of the new materials had not been investigated in detail at the start of this project. A lot of effort has therefore been put into characterizing the materials. Methods and results from experiments performed to decide the volume fraction of hard particles in the composites, the hardness, roughness and the adhesion to the substrate material are presented. In addition, microscopy by Infinite Focus Microscope (IFM) and SEM of the materials is described. </p...|$|E

The confidence in predictions can be greatly improved by consensus modelling that allows for taking conflicting results into account. The inventory is complemented by a brief discussion of socio-economic tools for assessing the potential efficiency gains of using in silico methods compared to traditional in vivo testing of chemical hazard...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of boron triangular nanotubes competes with carbon in many respects. The closed form of M‐polynomial of nanotubes produces closed forms of many degree‐based topological indices which are numerical {{parameters of the}} structure and, in combination, determine <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> the <b>concerned</b> nanotubes. In this report, we give M‐polynomials of boron triangular nanotubes and recover many important topological degree‐based indices of these nanotubes. We also plot surfaces associated with these nanotubes that show the dependence of each topological index on {{the parameters of the}} structure...|$|R
40|$|As {{the result}} of the {{ecological}} impacts from the use of tributyltins (TBT) in shipping, environmental legislation for the registration of chemicals for use in the environment has grown to a monumental challenge requiring product dossiers to include information on the environmental fate and behavior of any chemicals. Specifically, persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity, collectively known as PBT, are <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> in the assessment of chemicals. However, existing measurements <b>of</b> PBT <b>properties</b> are a cumbersome and expensive process, and thus not applied {{in the early stages of}} the product discovery and development. Inexpensive methods for preliminary PBT screening would minimize risks arising with the subsequent registration of products. In this article, we evaluated the PBT <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> compounds reported to possess anti-fouling properties using QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) prediction programs such as BIOWIN™ (a biodegradation probability program), KOWWIN™ (log octanol-water partition coefficient calculation program) and ECOSAR™ (Ecological Structure Activity Relationship Programme). The analyses identified some small (Mr < 400) synthetic and natural products as potential candidates for environmentally benign biocides. We aim to demonstrate that while these methods of estimation have limitations, when applied with discretion, they are powerful tools useful in the early stages of research for compound selection for further development as anti-foulants...|$|R
