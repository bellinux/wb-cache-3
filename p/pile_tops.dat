In {{order to}} study {{influences}} of applied load on <b>pile</b> <b>top</b> {{on the negative}} skin friction behaviors of piles, field investigations of negative skin friction behaviors of three identical piles with different loads on <b>pile</b> <b>top</b> {{are made in the}} same site. Test results show that applied load on <b>pile</b> <b>top</b> affects negative skin friction behaviors evidently. Additional settlement of pile induced by negative skin friction becomes larger, negative skin friction induced by the settlement of soil surrounding the pile becomes smaller with the increase of load on <b>pile</b> <b>top.</b> Dragload induced by negative skin friction decreases and position of neutral point in pile moves up while applied load on <b>pile</b> <b>top</b> increases. While there is no applied load on <b>pile</b> <b>top,</b> additional settlement induced by negative skin friction is minimum, dragload induced by negative skin friction is maximum and the neutral point is the farthest from the <b>top</b> of <b>piles.</b> The field investigation results may be useful to the further research for negative skin friction behaviors of pile...|$|R

Based on Biot consolidation theory, combined with a certain highway project, a three-dimensional FEM model is established, the process that the soil lateral deformation under heaped load lead to the pile side displacement was simulated. On the ground of the former result, the influence factors for the displacement of <b>pile</b> <b>top</b> and the <b>pile</b> displacement field distribution are analysed. The results show that, the building load area, load grade and the distance from loading area to pile have {{a major influence on}} the pile side displacement. On the other hand, the load on <b>pile</b> <b>top</b> have a very small contribution for stability of anti side displacement. The buildings nearby the area of pile foundation should be given attention in practical engineering...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} <b>pile</b> <b>top</b> displacement and the bending moment in the pile decrease with an increase in the edge distance, whereas they increase as the slope angle is increased. The response of the pile in sloping ground is compared with its response in the level ground.

The {{excavation}} of city subway pit breaking the original {{balance of the}} soil, affecting the safety of existed buildings and the surface subsidence of construction are important and direct factors which react to construction impacts. Using the Gray Relational Analysis Theory, through monitoring measured data of factors, building gray correlation analysis among {{excavation of}} subway construction surface subsidence, horizontal displacement of <b>pile</b> <b>top,</b> deep displacement, the groundwater level, the support axial force, the anchor cable tension and other factors, get the collective degree of different monitoring program. The results show that, the factors, from maximal to minimum correlation degree, which affect surface subsidence includes horizontal displacement of <b>pile</b> <b>top,</b> anchor cable tension, the groundwater level, deep displacement, strut axial forces. It provides a theoretical basis for law of surface subsidence and similar monitoring program optimization for the future projects. The excavation of city subway pit breaks the original balance of the soil. Before the excavation and construction process, {{in order to prevent}} pit deformation, measures has been taken, such as diaphragm wall, concrete support, steel support, anchor and so on. However, it does not eliminate the impact of excavation on the surrounding environment. Construction causes the movement o...|$|R
40|$|The load {{transfer}} mechanism for a laterally loaded pile is complex {{when it is}} located on the sloping ground. Though the field test is the best option for investigating the pile response for varying slope angles, it may not be cost-effective always. The computer simulation of numerical model can be an economical way to analyze the pile-soil interaction of laterally loaded piles in sloping ground. Therefore, in the present investigation, a computer program based on a three-dimensional finite element analysis is developed to evaluate the response of laterally loaded piles embedded in sloping ground. A detailed parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of slope of the ground on the deflection and the bending moment along the pile length. The results show that the <b>pile</b> <b>top</b> displacement and bending moment in the pile increase with increasing slope angle. A comparison of the results is also made with the case of laterally loaded piles in horizontal ground, based on which a relationship is developed to predict the <b>pile</b> <b>top</b> displacement and maximum bending moment in the pile for a given slope angle using their values for the horizontal ground case...|$|R
