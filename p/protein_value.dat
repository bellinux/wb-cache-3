5000|$|Edible protein {{per unit}} area of land {{is a measure of}} {{agricultural}} productivity. This measure for various major foodstuffs is shown in the chart below.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the energetic and <b>protein</b> <b>values</b> of some new Bulgarian feedstuffs (green forages and Industrial by-products). The evaluation was made on the basis of data on chemical composition (Weende method) according to the new energy and protein evaluation system. For each feed the following parameters are given: calculated values of GE, ME,NEL, NEG; for <b>protein</b> value: calculated <b>value...</b>|$|R
5000|$|So, the BV of {{a protein}} {{is related to}} the amount of protein given. BV is {{measured}} at levels below the maintenance level. This means that as protein intake goes up, the BV of that protein goes down. For example, milk protein shows a BV near 100 at intakes of 0.2 g/kg. As protein intake increases to roughly maintenance levels, 0.5 g/kg, BV drops only around 70. [...] Pellet et al., concluded that [...] "biological measures of protein quality conducted at suboptimal levels in either experimental animals or human subjects may overestimate <b>protein</b> <b>value</b> at maintenance levels." [...] As a result, while BV may be important for rating proteins where intake is below requirements, it has little bearing on individuals with protein intakes far above requirements.|$|E
50|$|The outer {{coverings}} of the cottonseed, {{known as}} cottonseed hulls, {{are removed from}} the cotton kernels before the oil is extracted. Cottonseed hulls serve as {{an excellent source of}} feed for the livestock as they contain about 8% of cotton linters which have nearly 100% cellulose in them. They require no grinding and easily mix with other feed sources. As they are easy to handle, their transportation cost is fairly low, as well. Whole cottonseed is another feed product of cottonseed used to feed livestock. It is the seed left after the separation of long fibres from cotton, and serves as a good source of cellulose for ruminants. Whole cottonseed leads to high production of milk and fat, if it is being fed to a high-producing dairy cow. It can be cost effective and provides nutrients such as high <b>protein</b> <b>value</b> of about 23%, crude fibre value of 25%, and high energy value of 20%. Whole cottonseed serves as a highly digestible feed which also improves the reproductive performance in livestock. Pima cottonseed, which is free of linters by default, and delinted cottonseed are other types of cottonseed feed products.|$|E
50|$|The {{movement}} and habitat utilisation patterns of an elephant population were studied in southern India during 1981-83 within a 1130 km2 study area. The vegetation types {{of this area}} encompasses dry thorn forest at 250 to 400 m, deciduous forest at 400 to 1400 m, stunted evergreen forest and grassland at 1400 to 1800 m. Five different elephant clans, each consisting of between 50 and 200 individuals had home ranges of between 105 km2 and 320 km2, which overlapped. They preferred habitat where water was available and food plants were palatable. During the dry months of January to April, they congregated at high densities of up to five individuals per km2 in river valleys where browse plants had a much higher protein content than the coarse tall grasses on hill slopes. With the onset of rains in May, they dispersed over a wider area at lower densities, largely into the tall grass forests, to feed on the fresh grasses, which then had a high <b>protein</b> <b>value.</b> During the second wet season from September to December, when the tall grasses became fibrous, they moved into lower elevation short grass open forests. The normal movement pattern could be upset during years of adverse environmental conditions. However, the movement pattern of elephants in this region has not basically changed for over a century, as inferred from descriptions recorded during the 19th century.|$|E

Commercial herring meals produced by several methods showed only small differences in protein utilization values.

Steam drying did not produce meals of better <b>protein</b> <b>value</b> than flame drying. No effect on the protein quality of herring meals was found of the preservatives sodium nitrite or formalin used during the storage of the raw material.

Four foreign fish meals were of about the same <b>protein</b> <b>value</b> as Norwegian herring meal, whereas one was decidedly better.

Rumen degradable protein estimates observed using the Cornell method were, on average, 0. 06 and 0. 16 lower than their corresponding in situ uncorrected and corrected values, respectively, with the latter being statistically significant (P< 0. 01). However, regression analysis between the Cornell and the in situ uncorrected rumen degradable protein, using all eight feeds, was statistically significant (r 2 0. 59; P< 0. 05). The relationship did not improve when the Cornell values were compared with the in situ corrected values for the eight feeds (r 2 0. 55; P< 0. 05).
