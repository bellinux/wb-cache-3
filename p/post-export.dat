50|$|Duty Entitlement Pass Book Scheme {{in short}} DEPB is an export {{incentive}} scheme. Notified on 1/4/1997, the DEPB Scheme consisted of (a) <b>Post-export</b> DEPB and (b) Pre-export DEPB. The pre-export DEPB scheme was abolished w.e.f. 1/4/2000. Under the <b>post-export</b> DEPB, which is issued after exports, the exporter {{is given a}} duty entitlement Pass Book Scheme at a pre-determined credit on the FOB value. The DEPB rates allows import of any items except the items which are otherwise restricted for imports. Items such as Gold Nibs, Gold Pen, Gold watches etc. though covered under the generic description of writing instruments, components of writing instruments and watches are thus not eligible for benefit under the DEPB scheme.|$|E
50|$|DEPB Scheme {{is issued}} only on <b>post-export</b> basis and pre/export DEPB Scheme has been discontinued. The {{provisions}} of DEPB Scheme are mentioned in Para 4.3 and 4.3.1 to 4.3.5 of the Foreign Trade Policy or Exim Policy. One {{significant change in}} the new DEPB Scheme is that in terms of Para 4.3.5 of the Exim Policy even excise duty paid in cash on inputs used in the manufacture of export product shall be eligible for brand rate of duty drawback as per rules framed by Department of Revenue which was not mentioned in the earlier DEPB Scheme.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, India {{has become the}} world s largest arms importer. During the Cold War, India bought arms mostly from the Soviet Union, {{but now it is}} {{increasingly}} buying from other suppliers. The Russia-India defense trade relations are not as bleak as often presented, however, as Russia supplies highly sensitive arms and technology. Likewise, the USA-India defense trade relations do have weaknesses, as the USA still has strict export controls on high-tech arms, technology, and <b>post-export</b> use of the arms. This thesis provides a holistic overview of all the motivations India has to buy from specific suppliers. All the different choices {{can be traced back to}} one larger theme. As India grows, it wants to improve the domestic capacity, increase strategic autonomy, and be accepted as an equal player in the worldwide arena. To do so, New Delhi needs to become independent and decrease the leverage that often comes with arms supplies. Developing its own industry, diversifying suppliers, avoiding countries that trade for ulterior motives, improving multilateral relations, and joining global export control regimes are some of the strategies India has used over the past two decades to achieve those goals...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome c {{maturation}} (Ccm) is a post-translational and <b>post-export</b> protein modification {{process that}} involves ten (CcmABCDEFGHI and CcdA or DsbD) components in most Gram-negative bacteria. The {{absence of any}} of these components abolishes the ability of cells to form cytochrome c, leading in the case of Rhodobacter capsulatus to the loss of photosynthetic proficiency and respiratory cytochrome oxidase activity. Based on earlier molecular genetic studies, we inferred that R. capsulatus CcmF, CcmH, and CcmI interact with each other to perform heme-apocytochrome c ligation. Here, using functional epitope-tagged derivatives of these components coproduced in appropriate mutant strains, we determined protein-protein interactions between them in detergent-dispersed membranes. Reciprocal affinity purification as well as tandem size exclusion and affinity chromatography analyses provided the first biochemical evidence that CcmF, CcmH, and CcmI associate stably with each other, indicating that these Ccm components form a membrane-integral complex. Under the conditions used, the CcmFHI complex does not contain CcmG, suggesting that the latter thio-reduction component is not always associated with the heme ligation components. The findings are discussed with respect to defining the obligatory components of a minimalistic heme-apocytochrome c ligation complex in R. capsulatus...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how a firm 2 ̆ 7 s specialization in {{its core}} products after exporting affects its factor intensity and productivity. Using Chinese manufacturing firm {{data for the}} 1998 – 2007 period, we find that firms become less capital-intensive but more productive after exporting, compared to non-exporters that share similar ex ante characteristics. To rationalize these findings that contrast with existing studies, we develop {{a variant of the}} model by Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010, 2011) to consider firms producing multiple products with varying capital intensity. The model predicts that when a firm in a labor-abundant country starts exporting, it specializes in its core competencies by allocating more resources to produce more labor-intensive products. Firm ex ante productivity is associated with a smaller decline in capital intensity after exporting. A sharper <b>post-export</b> decline in capital intensity is associated with a larger increase in measured total factor productivity. We find firm-level evidence supporting these predictions. Using transaction-level data for the 2000 – 2006 period, we show that Chinese new exporters add products that are less capital-intensive than their existing products and drop those that are more capital-intensive in subsequent years...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) gas {{to prevent the}} adverse effects of ethylene is limited by its short-term residual activity in some plants. Development of a simple 1 -MCP sustained release device that prolongs 1 -MCP exposure is reported herein. Sustained release devices comprised of polyvinylchloride tubes containing 0. 1 g SmartFresh(TM) powder (a. i. 3. 3 % 1 -MCP) and 1. 25 ml deionised water were used to release 1 -MCP into fibreboard cartons containing cut Geraldton waxflower (Chamelaucium uncinatum Schauer) cv. CWA Pink bunches during export shipment by air (107 h) from Australia to the UK. The devices protected flowers against abscission induced by subsequent test exposures to ethylene (1011,mul l(- 1), 12 h, 20 degreesC) for 3 - 5 days after arrival. In contrast, pre-shipment treatments with either a single application of 790 nl l(- 1) 1 -MCP for 14 h at 2 degreesC or a 0. 2 mM Ag+ (as silver thiosulphate; STS) pulse for 14 h at 2 degreesC protected flowers against exogenous ethylene for only 1 - 2 days of <b>post-export</b> life. However, pre-shipment 1 -MCP fumigation was up to about three-fold more effective than either sustained 1 -MCP release or pre-shipment STS treatments in reducing floral organ and leaf abscission from bunches during export. Thus, {{it is suggested that}} a combination of pre-shipment 1 -MCP fumigation before export with sustained 1 -MCP release during shipment should maximise efficacy against ethylene-induced waxflower flower abscission.

40|$|Abstract Background Mouse mammary {{tumor virus}} (MMTV) encodes the Rem protein, an HIV Rev-like protein that enhances nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA in rodent cells. We {{have shown that}} Rem is {{expressed}} from a doubly spliced RNA, typical of complex retroviruses. Several recent reports indicate that MMTV can infect human cells, suggesting that MMTV might interact with human retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), and human endogenous retrovirus type K (HERV-K). In this report, we test whether the export/regulatory proteins of human complex retroviruses will increase expression from vectors containing the Rem-responsive element (RmRE). Results MMTV Rem, HIV Rev, and HTLV Rex proteins, but not HERV-K Rec, enhanced expression from an MMTV-based reporter plasmid in human T cells, and this activity was dependent on the RmRE. No RmRE-dependent reporter gene expression was detectable using Rev, Rex, or Rec in HC 11 mouse mammary cells. Cell fractionation and RNA quantitation experiments suggested that the regulatory proteins did not affect RNA stability or nuclear export in the MMTV reporter system. Rem had no demonstrable activity on export elements from HIV, HTLV, or HERV-K. Similar to the Rem-specific activity in rodent cells, the RmRE-dependent functions of Rem, Rev, or Rex in human cells were inhibited by a dominant-negative truncated nucleoporin that acts in the Crm 1 pathway of RNA and protein export. Conclusion These data argue that many retroviral regulatory proteins recognize similar complex RNA structures, which may depend {{on the presence of}} cell-type specific proteins. Retroviral protein activity on the RmRE appears to affect a <b>post-export</b> function of the reporter RNA. Our results provide additional evidence that MMTV is a complex retrovirus with the potential for viral interactions in human cells. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPresence of {{nitrofuran}} and chloramphenicol in farmed prawn {{and shrimp}} {{is a major}} concern in the export sector of Bangladesh. Rejections of consignments by the foreign buyers have been recurrent {{for the last couple of}} years due to detection of these banned antibiotics. The increasingly complex requirements for food safety assurance and traceability set by major export markets represent a threat to the trade of this significant sector. In this study, the status and trends of the presence of nitrofuran and chloramphenicol in freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (De Man) and marine shrimp Penaeus monodon (Fabricius) and in their feeds in the Southwest coastal region of Bangladesh were investigated. The prawn/shrimp farmers, feed manufacturers and feed sellers were interviewed with well structured pre-tested Questionnaires. Antibiotic residues present in the animal muscles, feeds and feed ingredients were detected using LC–MS–MS by the Fish Inspection and Quality Control Wing of the Department of Fisheries. The study reveals that farmers did not deliberately use those banned antibiotics, but these chemicals were detected in many M. rosenbergii and P. monodon samples in 2008, 2009 and 2010, in both fresh muscles, pre-export and <b>post-export</b> consignments. The percentage of contamination with this banned antibiotics in M. rosenbergii samples were 17. 74 %, 22. 89 %, 13. 60 % and in P. monodon samples were 12. 65 %, 15. 79 %, 11. 85 % in 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. Antibiotic residue data of 2008, 2009 and 2010 showed: (i) contamination of nitrofuran and chloramphenicol was more in M. rosenbergii than P. monodon; (ii) among four nitrofuran metabolites, nitrofurazone was found more frequently but in smaller quantities in 2009 and 2010; (iii) contamination of nitrofuran metabolites was more in prawns fed with commercial feed than those with home-made feed; and (iv) there has been a decreasing trend of the presence of nitrofuran and chloramphenicol in prawn and shrimp of Bangladesh...|$|E
