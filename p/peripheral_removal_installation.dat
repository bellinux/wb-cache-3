40|$|A {{connector}} retainer {{and mounting}} {{system has been}} designed to replace screw-mounting of Winchester connectors. Countersunk screws are normally used to secure connectors to structures, and to keep them from coming apart. These screws are normally put into threaded or through-holes in metallic structures. This unique retainer is designed such that integral posts keep the connector halves retained, and a groove permits a cable tie to be fastened around the retainer and composite tube, thus securing the connector to the structure. The system is compatible for use on cryogenic (and conventional) bonded composite tube assemblies. Screws and tapped/through-holes needed to retain and mount Winchester connectors cannot be used on blind-access composite tubes. This system allows for rapid <b>installation,</b> <b>removal,</b> low-molecular-outgassing materials, and particulate-free <b>installation</b> and <b>removal.</b> <b>Installation</b> and/or changes late in the integration, and test flow with limited access in a cleanroom environment are possible.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} have implicated the vomeronasal (accessory olfactory) {{system in}} the chemosensory control of rodent social behaviors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to observe the effects of peripheral vomeronasal organ extirpation on sexual behavior, aggression, and urine marking in male mice. Relative to sham-operated control animals, mice lacking vomeronasal organs displayed significantly reduced levels of copulatory behavior and intermale aggression. Urine marking rates were not reduced. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>removal</b> of the vomeronasal organ resulted in complete bilateral deafferentation of the accessory olfactory bulbs but spared the peripheral input to the main olfactory bulbs as evidenced by the lack of anterograde vomeronasal nerve transport but normal anterograde olfactory nerve transport of intranasally applied horseradish peroxidase. Neither body weights, paired testes weights, nor seminal vesicle weights of mice with vomeronasal system lesions differed significantly from those of control animals. Thus, an intact vomeronasal organ is important for the normal display of sexual behavior and aggression in male mice, and the reductions in these androgen-dependent behaviors following peripheral deafferentation of the vomeronasal system cannot be attributed to a chronic reduction of gonadal hormone secretion. Chemosensory stimuli and the olfactory system influenc...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of measures for {{the recording of}} gastric hunger contractions {{half a century ago}} laid the foundations for the modern study of ap-petite and hunger (1, 2). The finding that intra-venous administration of glucose could abolish these contractions in fasting dogs led Bulatao and Carlson to postulate that "(lack of) availability of carbohydrates for utilization [...] . is an impor-tant factor in the genesis of the gastric hunger contractions " (3). Further evidence for this hy-pothesis was not forthcoming, and later reports of the effects of glucose administration on gastric motility have been inconsistent, and even in con-flict (4 - 6). Recently this problem has been reopened by Mayer's proposal of a "glucostatic " theory of the regulation of food intake which ascribes hunger to a depletion of the carbohydrate stores of the body, and satiety to the replenishment of these stores (7, 8). According to this theory the status of the carbohydrate stores is signalled to the hypothala-mic food regulatory centers by the rate at which glucose is utilized. Since experiments of the type performed by Bulatao and Carlson should provide a test of the glucostatic theory, it seemed important to repeat these studies in man to determine with greater assurance the effects of glucose on gastric hunger contractions. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>removal</b> of glucose provides an index of the metabolic events accom-panying such injection. Accordingly, peripheral capillary-venous glucose differences were deter-mined at intervals throughout the experiment, and these values were correlated with the effects of glucose injection on gastric hunger contractions...|$|R
