Only 1.4% of the population are from a black or other minority ethnic group (BME), as opposed to 9.1% of the national population. Relatively few <b>pensioners</b> live in the suburb, 12.2% as compared to 15.9% nationally and 17.3% in the borough.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic {{diversity}} is minimal in Navenby. Statistics for 2001 show that of 707households questioned, 703 were classed as white. Of those 707households, 104 were <b>pensioners</b> living alone, 176 were couples without children, 27 were lone parents and 153couples with dependent children. 343 of the households {{had at least}} one vehicle. Sickness rates were surprising high – with 237households reporting one or more people with limiting long-term illness. A total of 82% call themselves Christians.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the Bread and Cheese Lands {{were sold}} for housing, and the {{resulting}} income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably, providing the widows and <b>pensioners</b> of Biddenden with cheese, bread and tea at Easter and with cash payments at Christmas. Biddenden cakes continue {{to be given to}} the poor of Biddenden each Easter, and are sold as souvenirs to visitors.|$|E

5|$|On {{his first}} day in office, Macdonald kept a key Liberal promise by {{bringing}} in old age pensions for elderly people in need. Cheques would be mailed out to 6,000 <b>pensioners</b> {{by the end of}} March 1934. It was a popular move even though monthly pension payments in Nova Scotia were substantially below the national average.|$|E
5|$|The poor knights were impoverished {{military}} veterans, {{required to}} pray daily for the Knights Companion. In return, {{they received a}} salary and lodging in Windsor Castle. The knights are no longer necessarily poor, but are still military <b>pensioners.</b> They participate in the Order's processions, escorting the members, and in the chapel services. However, they are not considered members of the Order.|$|E
5|$|The {{share of}} public {{spending}} in GDP increased from 27% in 1995 to 30% in 2000. Some poorer provinces had depended on state enterprises or on inefficient industries, such as sugar, {{which could not}} compete when trade was opened. To quell social unrest, provincial governors padded their payrolls. The government had embarked on a pension reform with costs reaching 3% of GDP in 2000, as it still had to pay <b>pensioners</b> but no longer received contributions.|$|E
60|$|How {{it came to}} pass, {{with some}} {{appearance}} of inconsistency, that Mrs. Mitts was cut by all the ladies and the <b>Pensioner</b> admired by all the ladies, matters not. Before another week was out, Titbull's was startled by another phenomenon. At ten o'clock in the forenoon appeared a cab, containing not only the Greenwich <b>Pensioner</b> with one arm, but, to boot, a Chelsea <b>Pensioner</b> with one leg. Both dismounting to assist Mrs. Mitts into the cab, the Greenwich <b>Pensioner</b> bore her company inside, and the Chelsea <b>Pensioner</b> mounted the box by the driver: his wooden leg sticking out after {{the manner of a}} bowsprit, as if in jocular homage to his friend's sea-going career. Thus the equipage drove away. No Mrs. Mitts returned that night.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the time}} being, the <b>Pensioner</b> Guards {{retained}} {{the use of}} the original depot site (in [...] "Old Toodyay") for accommodation purposes. The area became known as the <b>Pensioner</b> Guard Barracks. However, the proposed <b>Pensioner</b> Guard allotments close to the former convict depot were sold off and new sites were selected adjacent to the new depot site. The cottages on these new allotments were not fully complete until 1856.|$|R

5|$|In 1765 {{the system}} of Dual Government was established, in which the Nawabs ruled {{on behalf of the}} British and were mere puppets to the British. In 1772 the system was {{abolished}} and Bengal was brought under direct control of the British. In 1793, when the Nizamat (governorship) of the Nawab was also taken away from them, they remained as the mere <b>pensioners</b> of the British East India Company. The last Nawab of Bengal, Mansur Ali Khan abdicated on 1 November 1880 in favour of his eldest son, Hassan Ali Mirza.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the Chulkhurst Charity was amalgamated {{with other}} local {{charities}} with similar purposes, {{to form the}} Biddenden Consolidated Charity, still functioning as a registered charity. The Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, expanding the charity significantly to provide Biddenden <b>pensioners</b> and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at Christmas, and distribute Biddenden cakes. (During the food rationing of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.) A wrought iron village sign showing the Biddenden Maids was erected on Biddenden village green in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In January 1957, Diefenbaker {{took his}} place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent {{informed}} him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10. The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly high taxes, failure to assist <b>pensioners,</b> {{and a lack of}} aid for the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory that he did not even bother to make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom, a Certificate of Life is {{termed a}} Certificate of Existence. When a UK {{resident}} is in receipt of a pension from a European country {{from time to}} time the <b>pensioner</b> may be required to complete a Certificate of Existence form. The <b>pensioner</b> must get the form stamped, dated and signed by an Electoral Officer at the <b>pensioner's</b> local authority. The completion process requires the <b>pensioner</b> to physically attend at the local authority office where he is resident with his/her passport or driving licence (as proof of identity) and a recent Council Tax bill (as proof of the pension's address in the Local Authority). No charge is levied by the local authority for stamping, dating and signing the Certificate of Existence.|$|R

5|$|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a 2011 British comedy-drama film {{directed}} by John Madden.

The movie was produced by Participant Media and Blueprint Pictures on a budget of $10 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and <b>pensioners</b> {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Geddes (1783–1844) and David Wilkie (1785–1841) {{were among}} the most {{successful}} portrait painters, with Wilkie succeeding Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823. Geddes produced some landscapes, but also portraits of Scottish subjects, including Wilkie and Scott, before he finally moved to London in 1831. Wilkie worked mainly in London, and was most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life, including The Chelsea <b>Pensioners</b> reading the Waterloo Dispatch in 1822 and for his flattering painting of the King George IV in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. After a tour of Europe he was more influenced by Renaissance and Baroque painting. David Roberts (1796–1864) became known for his prolific series of detailed lithograph prints of Egypt and the Near East that he produced during the 1840s from sketches he made during long tours of the region.|$|E

5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were <b>pensioners</b> and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E

They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned {{about the quality of the}} opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military <b>pensioners,</b> and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell into the hands of the insurgency. Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|West Germans {{were able}} {{to cross the border}} {{relatively}} freely to visit relatives, but had to go through numerous bureaucratic formalities. East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only <b>pensioners</b> were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E

De Launay had taken various precautions, raising the drawbridge in the Comté tower and destroying the stone abutment that linked the Bastille to its bastion to prevent anyone from gaining access from that side of the fortress. The shops in the entranceway to the Bastille had been closed and the gates locked. The Bastille was defended by 30 small artillery pieces, but nonetheless, by 14 July de Launay was very concerned about the Bastille's situation. The Bastille, already hugely unpopular with the revolutionary crowds, was now the only remaining royalist stronghold in central Paris, in addition to which he was protecting a recently arrived stock of 250 barrels of valuable gunpowder. To make matters worse, the Bastille had only two days' supply of food and no source of water, making it impossible to withstand a long siege.|$|E
