40|$|We have {{introduced}} a new perturbative technique {{with the goal of}} rapidly exploring the dependence of long wavelength ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities on equilibrium proles, shaping properties, and wall parameters. Traditionally, these relations are studied with numerical parameter scans using computationally intensive stability codes. Our perturbative technique rst nds the equilibrium and stability us-ing traditional methods. Subsequent small changes in the original equilibrium proles, shaping properties, and wall parameters result in a new stability for the perturbed con-ditions. We quickly nd the new stability with an expansion of the energy principle, rather than with another complete run of the stability codes. We rst apply the technique to semi-analytic <b>screw</b> <b>pinch</b> equilibria. The <b>screw</b> <b>pinch</b> results validate the approach, but also indicate that equilibria with certain fea-tures allow only very small perturbations. Next, we extend the approach to toroidal geometry using experimental equilib-ria and a simple constructed equilibrium, with the ideal MHD stability code GATO.

In agreement with previous numerical work on the subject by Bertram [5], it is shown that field penetration is indeed strongly limited when large external bias longitudinal magnetic fields are used. However, there is a range of small external bias fields that allow for significant penetration when reasonable driving fields are used.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the three {{established}} adiabatic invariants are separating invariants in the sense of Liouville. It is widely claimed that no more than three adiabatic invariants can exist for the motion of a point charge. However, additional independent (not separating) adiabatic invariants do exist. For a force free motion, the components of angular momentum provide two additional constants of motion. This result can be generalized to the Hamilton Jacobi equation. The number of independent constants of motion is reduced if there is a global symmetry. For a gyrating particle, neglecting a gyro helix type of invariant, four 'useful' invariants could exist. A radial drift invariant, corresponding to the average of the radial coordinate of the particle, is a constant of motion for a confined gyrating particle. For the special case of a <b>screw</b> <b>pinch</b> where each gyro center moves on a magnetic flux surface without mirror trapping, the radial drift invariant is the radial coordinate of the gyro center. For a <b>screw</b> <b>pinch,</b> the set of constants of motion consising of the energy, parallel velocity and radial drift invariant is convenient to model the equilibrium. Local Maxwellian distribution functions expressed in this set of invariants are demonstrated to provide MHD-type of equilibria, for which it is straightforward to model the radial profiles of the particle and field components.

40|$|An {{axisymmetric}} plasma <b>screw</b> <b>pinch</b> is an axisymmetric {{column of}} ionized gaseous plasma radially confined by forces from axial and azimuthal currents driven in the plasma and its surroundings. This dissertation is {{a contribution to}} detailed, high resolution computer simulation of dynamic plasma <b>screw</b> <b>pinches</b> in 2 -d {ital rz}-coordinates. The simulation algorithm combines electron fluid and particle-in-cell (PIC) ion models to represent the plasma in a hybrid fashion. The plasma {{is assumed to be}} quasineutral; along with the Darwin approximation to the Maxwell equations, this implies application of Ampere`s law without displacement current. Electron inertia is assumed negligible so that advective terms in the electron momentum equation are ignored. Electrons and ions have separate scalar temperatures, and a scalar plasma electrical resistivity is assumed. Altemating-direction-implicit (ADI) methods are used to advance the electron fluid drift velocity and the magnetic fields in the simulation. The ADI methods allow time steps larger than allowed by explicit methods. Spatial regions where vacuum field equations have validity are determined by a cutoff density that invokes the quasineutral vacuum Maxwell equations (Darwin approximation). In this dissertation, the algorithm was first checked against ideal MM stability theory, and agreement was nicely demonstrated. However, such agreement is not a new contribution to the research field. Contributions to the research field include new treatments of the fields in vacuum regions of the pinch simulation.

40|$|We {{analytically}} and numerically {{study the}} analogue of the Parker (magnetic buoyancy) instability in a uniformly rotating plasma <b>screw</b> <b>pinch</b> confined in a cylinder. Uniform plasma rotation is imposed {{to create a}} centrifugal acceleration, which mimics the gravity required for the classical Parker instability. The goal {{of this study is}} to determine how the Parker instability could be unambiguously identified in a weakly magnetized, rapidly rotating <b>screw</b> <b>pinch,</b> in which the rotation provides an effective gravity and a radially varying azimuthal field is controlled to give conditions for which the plasma is magnetically buoyant to inward motion. We show that an axial magnetic field is also required to circumvent conventional current driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities such as the sausage and kink modes that would obscure the Parker instability. These conditions can be realized in the Madison Plasma Couette Experiment (MPCX). Simulations are performed using the extended MHD code NIMROD for an isothermal compressible plasma model. Both linear and nonlinear regimes of the instability are studied, and the results obtained for the linear regime are compared with analytical results from a slab geometry. Based on this comparison, it is found that in a cylindrical pinch the magnetic buoyancy mechanism dominates at relatively large Mach numbers (M> 5), while at low Mach numbers (M< 1) the instability is due to the curvature of magnetic field lines. At intermediate values of Mach number (1 <M< 5) the Coriolis force has a strong stabilizing effect on the plasma. A possible scenario for experimental demonstration of the Parker instability in MPCX is discussed...|$|R

Gross magnetohydrodynamic instabilities are found to develop whenever the current rises beyond a threshold value. These instabilities have features of helical kink modes with prevalent azimuthal m and axial n periodicity m/n = 1 / 1 and their occurrence can be described by the Kruskal-Shafranov criterion, generally used in <b>screw</b> <b>pinch</b> stability analysis.

40|$|We analyse a new {{subdomain}} {{scheme for}} a time-spectral method for solving initial boundary value problems. Whilst spectral methods are commonplace for spatially dependent systems, finite difference schemes are typically {{applied for the}} temporal domain. The Generalized Weighted Residual Method (GWRM) is a fully spectral method in that it spectrally decomposes all specified domains, including the temporal domain, with multivariate Chebyshev polynomials. The Common Boundary-Condition method (CBC) is a spatial subdomain scheme that solves the physical equations independently from the global connection of subdomains. It is here evaluated against two finite difference methods. For the linearised Burger equation the CBC-GWRM is ∼ 30 % faster and ∼ 50 % more memory efficient than the semi implicit Crank-Nicolson method at a maximum error ∼ 10 ^- 5. For a forced wave equation the CBC-GWRM manages to average efficiently over the small time-scale in the entire temporal domain.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the radial {{displacement}} of the m= 1 internal kink mode in a periodic <b>screw</b> <b>pinch</b> has a steep jump at the resonant surface where k·B= 0. In a line-tied system, relevant to solar and astrophysical plasmas, the resonant surface is no longer a valid concept. It is then of interest to see how line-tying alters the aforementioned result for a periodic system. If the line-tied kink also produces a steep gradient, corresponding to a thin current layer, it may lead to strong resistive effects even with weak dissipation. Numerical solution of the eigenmode equations shows that the fastest growing kink mode in a line-tied system still possesses a jump in the radial displacement at the location coincident with the resonant surface of the fastest growing mode in the periodic counterpart. However, line-tying thickens the inner layer and slows down the growth rate. As the system length L approaches infinity, both the inner layer thickness and the growth rate approach the periodic values.

Under certain growth assumption on the heat conductivity, we first derive a number of regularities of the approximate physical quantities in the fluid region, as well as a lot of uniform integrability in the entire spacetime domain. By virtue of these estimates we then argue in a similar manner as that in Ref. 20 to take the limit and show that the limiting functions are indeed a weak solution which satisfies the mass, momentum and magnetic field equations in the entire spacetime domain in the sense of distributions, but satisfies the energy equation only in the compact subsets of the fluid region. The analysis in this paper allows the possibility that energy be absorbed into the origin, i. e. the total energy is possibly lost in the limit as the inner radius goes to zero...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Current-driven instabilities of force-free <b>screw</b> <b>pinches</b> are {{studied for}} a large variety of {{magnetic}} configurations {{by means of a}} global linear analysis in an ideal MHD framework. The magnetic pitch, P = rBz/Bφ, in particular its value on the axis, P 0, essentially determines the growth rate of the fastest growing kink instability and allows to identify two regimes. In the large pitch regime, representative for the majority of controlled fusion devices, the stability properties are highly sensitive to the radial pitch profile. Astrophysical jets of magnetic origin are likely to have dominantly azimuthal fields. For such configurations the properties of the fastest growing kink instability become nearly independent of the details of the pitch profile. The most unstable mode grows with an e-folding time tg = 7. 52 P 0 /vA and an axial wavelength λ = 8. 43 P 0 in the rest frame of the jet. The magnetic structure of jets with dominantly azimuthal fields will be modified by the fast growing kink instability. An analysis of the eigenfunction shows however that the kink is an internal mode which does not cause a significant sidewise displacement of the jet surface.

40|$|Magneto-Plasma-Dynamic (MPD) {{thrusters}} {{are currently}} under investigation as they constitute a possible, high power electric propulsion option for primary space mission, ranging from orbit raising to interplanetary mission of large spacecraft. They are essentially electromagnetic plasma accelerators, {{in which a}} high current discharge ionises a gas, that is accelerated by the Lorentz force produced by {{the interaction between the}} current and a self induced (or applied) magnetic field. Presently, the performance of this class of thrusters is limited by the onset of critical regimes observed when the current rises beyond a threshold value. In this regime, large fluctuations in the arc voltage signals and damages to the anode are observed along with thruster performance degradation. The present experimental investigation, carried out by several arrays of magnetic and electric probes and by two photomulti- plier arrays of 16 channels each, has shown that the onset of these critical regimes is accompanied by the growth of large-scale MHD instabilities. These instabilities have m/n = 1 / 1 azimuthal and axial periodicity and have features of a helical kink mode.

The plasma column is formed by {{an array of}} seven electrostatic washer guns which can also be biased to drive plasma current. The array allows independent control over the electron density ne and current density Jz profiles of the column. Internal measurements of the plasma have been made with singletip Langmuir and magnetic induction (“B-dot”) probes {{for a range of}} bias currents (Ib = 0, 300, 500 A/gun). Streams from the individual guns are seen to merge at a distance of z ≈ 36 cm from the guns; the exact distance depends on the value of Ib. The density of the column is directly proportional to the Ohmic dissipation power, but the temperature stays at a low, uniform value (Te ≈ 3. 5 eV) for each bias level. Electron densities are on the order of ne ∼ 1020 m− 3. The electron density expands radially (across the Bz guide field) as the plasma moves along the column, though the current density Jz mainly stays parallel to the field lines. The singletip Langmuir probe diagnostic is difficult to analyze for Ib = 500 A/gun plasmas and fails as Ib is raised beyond this level.
