40|$|This work {{deals with}} the in-situ mass spectrometric (MS) {{characterization}} of gases during the atmospheric pressure plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of <b>propyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (PiB) and allylmethacrylate (AMA). By monitoring the fragments of interest, {{we are trying to}} understand the mechanisms involved in the plasma synthesis of acrylate-like coatings. For instance, while CO 2 + drastically increases when a PiB/argon plasma is ignited, it decreases in the case of AMA. This trend also appears for other fragments, which leads to the conclusion that while PiB seems to suffer from fragmentation, AMA oligomerizes into the gas phase, resulting in a better protection of the ester functionality. Mass spectrometry is used for the in-situ characterization of gases during the atmospheric pressure plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of <b>propyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (PiB) and allylmethacrylate (AMA), only differing by the number of unsaturations. We highlight a different behavior of AMA which tends to oligomerize in the gas phase while PiB deposits by a fragmentation/recombination mechanism. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the atmospheric plasma polymerization of allyl methacrylate (AMA), n-propyl methacrylate (nPMA), and <b>propyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (PiB), whose chemistry mainly differs by their number of unsaturations. The resulting material is characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) while {{the thickness of}} the coatings is determined by visible spectroscopic ellipsometry (Vis-SE). The results show that the concentration of ester groups at the surface of the plasma polymers, as well as their deposition rate strongly depends on the surrounding unsaturations present in the precursor. A stabilization of the ester groups and an increase in the deposition rate due to the carbon-carbon double bonds is suggested. This study focuses on the atmospheric pressure plasma deposition of molecules that only differ by their number of unsaturations, namely allymethacrylate, n-propylmethacrylate, and <b>propyl</b> <b>isobutyrate.</b> The chemical composition and thickness of the resulting coatings, as well as the influence of plasma power are compared. A stabilization of the ester groups and an increase in the deposition rate due to the carbon-carbon double bonds is suggested. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

40|$|Allyl {{methacrylate}} (AMA), {{methyl methacrylate}} (MMA), and <b>propyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (PiB) are plasma deposited {{at ambient temperature}} in an atmospheric DBD reactor to assess the effect of precursor carbon double bond unsaturations. The specific plasma deposition rate (k 0) {{as a function of}} the Yasuda factor (Yf) is quantified empirically by: k 0 = b (1 - exp(-a Yf/b)). Fourier transform infrared analysis indicates a loss of carbonyl functionalities with increasing plasma power, and Raman microscopy shows C£C double bonds in all plasma films. The methacrylate-like plasma films are found to be heterogeneous with a volatile and a cross-linked fraction observed by thermogravimetric analysis. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals a low glass transition temperature and a characteristic residual reactivity of the coatings. The effect of precursor carbon double bond unsaturations on the specific plasma deposition rate (k 0) and thermal properties of plasma deposited methacrylate-like films is assessed in this work. A significant increase in the plasma deposition rate with increasing number of precursor C£C bonds is found. In general, two distinctive thermal characteristics are observed by DSC: a relatively low Tg and a residual reactivity in the first heating of the DSC experiment.
