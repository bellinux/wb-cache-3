40|$|<b>Prescriptive</b> <b>{{screening}}</b> {{is defined}} as screening for diseases solely {{for the benefit of}} the individuals participating in the programme. Currently used screening programmes are examined at each stage of life-antenatal, postnatal, school age, adult life, and old age. It is concluded that most disorders for which screening can be confidently recommended {{for the benefit of the}} individual are those occurring in children: screening infants for phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, visual and auditory impairment, and probably congenital dislocation of the hip. Subject to parents' informed consent to participate, antenatal screening for Down's syndrome and neural tube defects is effective in high risk populations. Screening programmes to detect in school children visual and auditory defects and dental diseases are worth while. Two major problems arise in most programmes [...] firstly, how to achieve a high compliance rate of the population in attending for screening and accepting subsequent treatment; secondly, how to determine what treatment, if any, should be offered to borderline cases. Further evaluation of these problems is required for many programmes...|$|E
40|$|A {{screening}} {{survey for}} asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in 13464 schoolgirls aged 4 to 18 years in Newcastle upon Tyne showed an overall prevalence of 1. 9 %. In girls 4 to 6 {{years it was}} 1. 4 %, in girls aged 7 to 11 years it was 2. 5 %, in girls aged 12 to 18 years it was 1. 6 %, a statistically significant rise and fall. Renal scarring was found in 39 (15 %) of 254 girls with ASB. Neither the prevalence nor the severity of renal scarring increased with age. There was no association between ASB and social class. Of the 254 girls with ASB, 24 % had no symptoms. Infections with klebsiella were more frequently associated with renal scarring than infections with Esch. coli. The prevalence of ASB in 1595 boys aged 5 to 18 was low, 0. 2 %. Ureteric reflux was present in 15 % of girls without renal scarring and in 46 % of those with renal scarring (P less than 0. 001). Renal scarring also {{showed a significant association}} with duplication, hydroureter, or single saccules in the bladder. The greater the severity of scarring the more frequently was reflux present. This study gave no evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to progressive renal damage during childhood. It therefore does not support the recommendation for <b>prescriptive</b> <b>screening</b> of schoolchildren, but emphasizes the need for prospective studies of the natural history of ASB...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} shift between object and image in popular and philosophical attitudes towards nature by tracing the aesthetic and epistemological {{role of the}} sublime view {{through a series of}} <b>prescriptive</b> texts and <b>screen</b> technologies which became increasingly popular in Great Britain within {{the second half of the}} 19 th century. The natural sublime was symptomatic of a crisis that lies at the heart of environmental aesthetics: the inability to construct and rely on a framing mechanism when making judgments about natural spaces. Each text provided a way to mediate those experiences beginning with early 18 th century topographical literature, Romantic and picturesque tour guides written in the early 19 th century, mid 19 th century painted panoramas, and, finally, scenic filmmaking in the first two decades of the 20 th century. The project uses this discursive lineage to analyze the role of these texts and technologies in reconstructing the expectations of nature appreciation, with scenic filmmaking representing the culmination of that transition. While each catered to a separate socio-economic group, they all helped mask a persistent cultural anxiety over where spectator and natural phenomena should meet. The project proposes a shift away from previous historical models which address contemplation and astonishment as separate aesthetic models by presenting a new reading of the 18 th century natural sublime. Unlike traditional forms of appreciation like beauty, which depended upon detached contemplation, the sublime was only accessible at the precarious place where immersion and detachment met. Here specific vantage points constructed an interplay between traditionally opposed spectatorial states. The aesthetic category seemed, in fact, completely counter intuitive to both the other categories valued by the period and the stability provided by the neo-classical frame, and yet this precariousness only enhanced its cultural and conceptual cache. The concept eventually initiated its own cultural industry associated with nature appreciation which placed the problem of spectatorship at the centre of its popular discourse...|$|R
