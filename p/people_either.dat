5|$|Sorabji's fugues, {{the most}} atonal of his works, {{generally}} follow traditional methods. After a subject and {{between one and}} four countersubjects have been presented in an exposition, there follows a development section in which the subject (and countersubjects, particularly in the earlier fugues) are usually developed in their original form and in inversion, retrograde and retrograde inversion. The movement continues with a stretto and concludes with a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. His multi-subject fugues repeat this pattern for each subject, and combine thematic material from all expositions in the last section. The fugues are more conservative than most of his output, in that they rarely use polyrhythms. They can contain up to six subjects, and it is these that mark Sorabji's fugues as different from most others. Some of the subjects are among his most unconventional melodic creations, lacking the frequent changes of direction that characterise most melodies; other subjects are possibly the longest ever conceived. This has led some <b>people</b> <b>either</b> to treat them with suspicion or to criticise them.|$|E
25|$|Shipping {{container}} {{architecture is}} the use of containers as the basis for housing and other functional buildings for <b>people,</b> <b>either</b> as temporary or permanent housing, and either as a main building or as a cabin or workshop.

25|$|However, in {{some areas}} of the world, many people are known by a single name, and so are said to be mononymous. Still other {{cultures}} lack the concept of specific, fixed names designating <b>people,</b> <b>either</b> individually or collectively. Certain isolated tribes, such as the Machiguenga of the Amazon, do not use personal names.|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 1990s {{to the early}} 2000s, Indonesian paramilitaries {{organized}} and armed by Indonesian military and police killed or expelled large numbers of civilians in East Timor. After the East Timorese people voted for independence in a 1999 referendum, Indonesian paramilitaries retaliated, murdering some supporters of independence and levelling most towns. More than 200,000 <b>people</b> <b>either</b> fled or were forcibly taken to Indonesia before East Timor achieved full independence.|$|E
25|$|Endoscopy, {{the looking}} {{down into the}} stomach with a fibre-optic scope, is not {{routinely}} needed if the case is typical and responds to treatment. It is recommended when <b>people</b> <b>either</b> do not respond well to treatment or have alarm symptoms, including dysphagia, anemia, blood in the stool (detected chemically), wheezing, weight loss, or voice changes. Some physicians advocate either once-in-a-lifetime or 5- to 10-yearly endoscopy for people with longstanding GERD, to evaluate the possible presence of dysplasia or Barrett's esophagus.|$|E

5000|$|This type {{of status}} paradox {{describes}} how a migration of peoples {{can alter the}} status of these <b>peoples,</b> <b>either</b> higher or lower. It is related to economic inequality between world regions which creates incentives for transnational migrants to transfer resources earned in richer countries to poorer countries and, thereby, to gain buying power and social status.|$|R

25|$|The European {{discovery}} of Vieques is sometimes credited to Christopher Columbus, who landed in Puerto Rico in 1493. It {{does not seem}} to be certain whether Columbus personally visited Vieques, but in any case the island was soon claimed by the Spanish. During the early 16th century Vieques became a center of Taíno rebellion against the European invaders, prompting the Spanish to send armed forces to the island to quell the resistance. The native Taíno population was decimated, and its <b>people</b> <b>either</b> killed, imprisoned or enslaved by the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 {{a change}} to the Commonwealth Electoral Act allowed for a closing date for the {{lodgement}} of changes to the electoral roll before an election. The period during which new enrolments and update of details could be made was set at seven days after an election is called. Many <b>people</b> <b>either</b> enrol or change their enrolment details in this period. For example, prior to the 2004 federal election 423,993 changes to enrolment received before the roll closing date. Of these, 78,816 were new enrolments and 225,314 were changes of address.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} improper coloring problems is studied in Ramsey theory, where the graph’s edges {{are assigned to}} colors, {{and there is no}} restriction on the colors of incident edges. A simple example is the friendship theorem, which states that in any coloring of the edges of , the complete graph of six vertices, there will be a monochromatic triangle; often illustrated by saying that any group of six <b>people</b> <b>either</b> has three mutual strangers or three mutual acquaintances. Ramsey theory is concerned with generalisations of this idea to seek regularity amid disorder, finding general conditions for the existence of monochromatic subgraphs with given structure.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} the Dauphin on 4 June, which deeply {{affected}} his parents, was virtually ignored by the French people, who were instead preparing for the next meeting of the Estates General and hoping for a resolution to the bread crisis. As the Third Estate declared itself a National Assembly and took the Tennis Court Oath, and as <b>people</b> <b>either</b> spread or believed rumors that the queen wished to bathe in their blood, Marie Antoinette went into mourning for her eldest son. Her role was decisive in urging the king to remain firm and not concede to popular demands for reforms. In addition, she showed her determination {{to use force to}} crush the forthcoming revolution.|$|E
25|$|While {{deprived}} of the goal of universal monarchy, the campaigns within the Habsburg hereditary lands were relatively successful in religiously purification, although Hungary was never successfully re-Catholicized. Only in Lower Austria, and only among the nobility, was Protestantism tolerated. Large numbers of <b>people</b> <b>either</b> emigrated or converted, while others compromised as crypto-Protestants, ensuing relative conformity. The crushing of the Bohemian Revolt also extinguished Czech culture and established German as the tool of Habsburg absolutism. The Austrian monarchs thereafter had much greater control within the hereditary power base, the dynastic absolutism grip was tightened {{and the power of}} the estates diminished. On the other hand, Austria was much reduced in population and economic might and less vigorous and weakened as a nation-state.|$|E
25|$|Crucial to US {{participation}} was the sweeping domestic propaganda campaign {{executed by the}} Committee on Public Information, overseen by George Creel. The campaign consisted {{of tens of thousands}} of government-selected community leaders giving brief carefully scripted pro-war speeches at thousands of public gatherings. Along with other branches of government and private vigilante groups like the American Protective League, it also included the general repression and harassment of <b>people</b> <b>either</b> opposed to American entry into the war or of German heritage. Rumors about a German induced attempt to start uprising among Black Americans caused a wave of lynchings to occur in the Southern United States. Other forms of propaganda included newsreels, photos, large-print posters (designed by several well-known illustrators of the day, including Louis D. Fancher and Henry Reuterdahl), magazine and newspaper articles, and billboards.|$|E

25|$|St. Peter's {{is famous}} {{as a place}} of pilgrimage and for its liturgical functions. The Pope presides at a number of liturgies {{throughout}} the year, drawing audiences of 15,000 to over 80,000 <b>people,</b> <b>either</b> within the Basilica or the adjoining St. Peter's Square. St. Peter's has many historical associations, with the Early Christian Church, the Papacy, the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-reformation and numerous artists, especially Michelangelo. As a work of architecture, it is regarded as the greatest building of its age. St. Peter's is one of the four churches in the world that hold the rank of Major Basilica, all four of which are in Rome. Contrary to popular misconception, it is not a cathedral because it is not the seat of a bishop; the Cathedra of the Pope as Bishop of Rome is in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{launched a}} voluntary evacuation program in December 1943 which encouraged old people, {{children and their}} mothers {{to move from the}} main cities and stay in the homes of friends and relatives in rural areas. The government provided civilians with little assistance to evacuate, however. Few people evacuated until the first raid by American heavy bombers on Japan, an attack on Yawata, in June 1944 after which the government urged families to evacuate their children. As a result, 459,000 children and their parents moved to stay with friends and relatives. For families without contacts in the countryside, entire school classes evacuated as groups accompanied by their teachers; by August 1944, 333,000 children had been relocated to rural areas where they continued their education in inns, temples and other public buildings. A further 343,000 urban residents were forced to leave their homes when they were destroyed to create firebreaks; these <b>people</b> <b>either</b> moved to the country or lived in temporary accommodation near their workplace.|$|E
25|$|Naas Botha was, without doubt, {{the most}} {{controversial}} Northerns hero ever, because no-one was ever neutral about him. <b>People</b> <b>either</b> loved him or loved to hate him. Just like his predecessor, Hannes Brewis, Botha was a genius at fly-half and the great points machine. Amongst all true Northerns supporters, {{he was one of}} the greatest heroes of all time, however outside Northern Transvaal he was hated, because the supporters of other teams feared him. Botha's popularity was mainly due to his excellence with the boot. He was the greatest match winner SA rugby has ever seen and has a record that speaks for itself. Botha was fetched by Buurman van Zyl from the Tukkies under-20 team, and included him as a 19-year old in the most successful side of the 1970s. It was also Oom Buurman who chose him as captain of the Blue Bulls in 1980 over many other more senior players like Daan du Plessis, Jan Oberholzster and Louis Moolman. His great claim to fame came on the 1981 tour to New Zealand where he had the local public in canter. He was an absolute genius and his insight into and knowledge of the game and its rules, and his ability to motivate players, made him the ideal player-captain. Botha would probably have rewritten the record books far more often had it not been for apartheid, which robbed him of the opportunity to play regular test rugby. He was both a brilliant kicker and a true strategist. He received the SA Rugby Player of the Year award a record 4 times (1979, 1981, 1985 and 1987).|$|E
