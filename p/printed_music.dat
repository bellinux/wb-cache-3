5|$|The {{introduction}} of music into Baltimore {{public schools in}} 1843 caused a slow decline in the popularity of private youth singing instruction. In response to the growing demand for <b>printed</b> <b>music</b> in schools, publishers began offering collections with evangelical tunes, directed at rural schools. Formal, adult musical institutions, like the Haydn Society and the Euterpe Musical Association, grew in popularity following the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Though John Cole and the Carrs {{were among}} the first major music {{publishers}} in Baltimore, the city was home to a vibrant publishing tradition in the 19th century, aided by the presence of A. Hoen & Co., one of the biggest lithography firms of the era, who illustrated many music publications. Other prominent music publishers in Baltimore in this era included George Willig, Arthur Clifton, Frederick Benteen, James Boswell, Miller and Beecham, W. C. Peters, Samuel Carusi and G. Fred Kranz. Peters was well known nationally, but first established a Baltimore-based firm in 1849, with partners whose names remain unknown. His sons eventually joined the field, and the company, then known as W. C. Peters & Co., published the Baltimore Olio and Musical Gazette, which contained concert news, <b>printed</b> <b>music,</b> educational and biographical essays and articles. The pianist-composer Charles Grobe was among the contributors.|$|E

2500|$|Jacquet de Berchem (also {{known as}} Giachet(to) Berchem or Jakob van Berchem; c. 1505 – before 2 March 1567) was a Franco-Flemish {{composer}} of the Renaissance, active in Italy. [...] He was famous in mid-16th-century Italy for his madrigals, approximately 200 {{of which were}} printed in Venice, some in multiple printings due to their considerable popularity. [...] As evidence of his widespread fame, he is listed by Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel {{as one of the}} most famous musicians of the time, and the <b>printed</b> <b>music</b> for one of his madrigals appears in a painting by Caravaggio (The Lute Player).|$|E
2500|$|Two {{collections}} of the late 1630s serve as a summation of late madrigal practice. [...] Domenico Mazzocchi's 1638 book splits madrigals into continuo and ensemble works specifically intended to be performed a cappella; Mazzocchi's instructions are precise, and he even includes, {{for the first time}} in any <b>printed</b> <b>music</b> collection, symbols for crescendo and decrescendo. [...] However, these madrigals were not intended for performance so much as study, and as such show that the form was being viewed in retrospect. [...] Monteverdi's Book Eight, of the same year, contains some of the most famous madrigals of the entire epoch, including the enormous Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda, a dramatic composition much like a secular oratorio. [...] Among other innovations in this work is the stile concitato – the [...] "agitated style", which uses, among other things, string tremolo. [...] The pieces in Monteverdi's Book Eight, written over at least two decades, show just about every development in the madrigal since 1600.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Printed</b> <b>music</b> {{is often}} written on several {{different}} staves. [...] For instance, piano music is typically written {{on two different}} staves combined into the grand staff: one for treble clef and one for bass clef, while choral music often has four different staves (one each for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). [...] The notes in different staves that play simultaneously are aligned vertically. Because of the linear nature of braille music {{and the fact that}} the blind musician can typically read only one staff at a time, multiple staves are handled in several ways depending on the complexity of the music and other considerations. Bar over bar format is most similar to print music. [...] Simple piano music in bar over bar format is quite similar to print music, with right-hand notation on the top line and left-hand notation on the bottom line. [...] Some degree of vertical alignment between the right and left hands is maintained. Other ways of dealing with multiple-staff music are line over line format, , paragraph style, and bar by bar format. [...] As a rule these formats take up less space on the page but require more of the musician in working out how to fit the staves together. For instance, in a piano score notated in section by section format, the right-hand part may be written out for the first 8 measures, followed by the left-hand part. [...] No attempt is made to align the parts. The same procedure is followed for measures 9-16, and so on, section by section, throughout the score. The blind musician learns and memorizes one section right hand alone, then left hand alone, then works out the hands together by memory and referencing various spots in the braille score to work out how the sections fit together. A note from the transcriber often clarifies the format used. [...] However, with many older and more complex scores the format must be determined by examination of the music and context.|$|E

However, the aspect of the room, though homely, was cheerful, a somewhat contradictory group of furniture suggesting that the collection consisted of waifs and strays from a former home, the grimy faces of the old articles exercising a curious and subduing effect on the bright faces of the new. An oval mirror of rococo workmanship, and a heavy cabinet-piano with a cornice like that of an Egyptian temple, adjoined a harmonium of yesterday, and a harp that was almost as new. <b>Printed</b> <b>music</b> of the last century, and manuscript music of the previous evening, lay there in such quantity as to endanger the tidiness of a retreat which was indeed only saved from a chronic state of litter by a pair of hands that sometimes played, with the lightness of breezes, about the sewing-machine standing in a remote corner--if any corner could be called remote in a room so small.|$|E
