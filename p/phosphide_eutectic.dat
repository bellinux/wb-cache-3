40|$|The {{presence}} of phosphorus in cast iron has no great {{effect on the}} graphite cementite ratio but serves to make the metal very fluid due {{to the creation of}} a low melting point <b>phosphide</b> <b>eutectic.</b> This may result in shrinkage porosity in large castings. Manganese serves to remove sulphur from the casting and since sulphur promotes cementite, the manganese will harden the iron. ...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} deals with hot powder preform forging technique {{for the development}} of high density iron-phosphorus based alloys. These alloys are known for hot-shortness and are therefore not considered suitable for high temperature working. To remove this problem proper soaking at high temperature to eliminate iron- <b>phosphide</b> <b>eutectic</b> and bring entire phosphorus into solution in iron was aimed. Attempting hot forging thereafter completely eliminates hot as well as cold shortness and thereby helps to form these alloys into very thin sheets. It has also been possible to eliminate the use of costly hydrogen atmosphere during sintering by use of addition of carbon as a reducing agent to form CO gas within the compact by reacting with oxygen of iron powder particles. The glassy ceramic coating applied over the compact serves as a protective coating to avoid atmospheric oxygen attack over the compact held at high temperature. Combined application of carbon and glassy ceramic coating has lead to economy in P/M processing for soft magnetic applications. Fe- 0. 07 C- 0. 3 O- 0. 35 wt % P- 0. 35 wt % Cr alloy so formed yielded coercivity as low as 0. 42 Oe, resistivity as high as 21. 8 µΩcm and total loss as low as 0. 170 W/Kg. Such a combination of properties may suit their application in magnetic relays and transformer cores...|$|E
40|$|During recent years, in {{the area}} of Germany and Poland {{numerous}} repair and renovating works are being carried out of old (of XVIII and XIX centuries) structures of bridges and overbridges. In Germany, such works are preceded by generous research programs resulting in well-grounded diagnoses on f their wear conditions and properties of that time used construction materials. In Poland, such research works result more from own interest of the individual authors of published papers and elaborations. In Wroclaw (Breslau), in use are In this paper, the research subject were cast iron fragments of structure of the Old Mieszczanski Bridge (Wilhelmsbrücke) of 1876 and pillars of the railway overbridge built in 1899. The research was aimed at determining chemical composition of the used materials, their structure properties, as well as selected mechanical properties and referring the results to structures and properties of modern cast irons. It was found using light microscopy and SEM methods that they are grey cast irons with flake graphite, with ferritic and pearlitic matrices. Moreover, they include significant areas of <b>phosphide</b> <b>eutectics</b> and precipitates of titanium-rich phases. These observations are confirmed by results of gravimetric and spectral chemical analyses which indicate maximum phosphorus content of 1. 18 % and maximum titanium content of 0. 1 % in the examined cast irons. Together with evaluated mechanical properties (based on hardness measurements and previous results), chemical compositions and structures permit classifying the examined materials as cast irons equivalent to grades EN-GJL- 100 and EN-GJL- 150 acc. to the today's standards...|$|R
