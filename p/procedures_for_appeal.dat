50|$|The direct {{financial}} impact {{to state and}} local governments is indeterminate because of the uncertainty of how many victims choose to bring an enforcement action to protect rights guaranteed under section 43, Article I of the Oregon Constitution, but denied by the court, district attorney or other public agency. The cost of this measure could increase the number of pretrial release hearings and increase the number of criminal defendants held and the length of incarceration before, during or after trials. Current provisions of the constitution establish a victim's right to be reasonably protected from the defendant during the criminal justice process, including pretrial detention of a criminal defendant. Current constitutional provisions require that there shall be no bail for a defendant accused of a violent felony where the defendant is a danger to the victim or others. Few of these criminal defendants awaiting trial are currently released, so the number of cases affected by this measure may be minimal. The measure authorizes the legislature to enact laws providing detailed procedures for claims by victims, including the establishment of reasonable limitations on the time allowed victims to assert their rights and prescribing <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>appeal.</b> Legislation providing such procedures and limitations could change the direct costs of this measure.|$|E
50|$|The direct {{financial}} impact {{to state and}} local governments was indeterminate because the impact depended on how often a victim would choose to bring an enforcement action to protect rights guaranteed under section 42, Article I of the Oregon Constitution, but denied by the court, district attorney or other public agency. These additional challenges could arise before a criminal case is filed, after a case is filed, and after the entry of a final judgment in a criminal case. Actions could be pursued in cases involving person and property crimes in violation, misdemeanor and felony cases, and the victim could file an enforcement action more than one time in a single case. Some cases involve multiple victims, each of whom could bring an individual enforcement action. The measure authorizes the legislature to enact laws providing detailed procedures for claims by victims, including the establishment of reasonable limitations on the time allowed victims to assert their rights and prescribing <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>appeal.</b> Legislation providing such procedures and limitations could change the direct costs of this measure. Direct costs may also be impacted by the degree of change in the current practice of restitution orders and payment, how many new victims are identified by the court, and the number of challenges that are appealed to a higher court.|$|E

40|$|The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure turn fifty in 2018. During the Rules’ half-century of existence, {{the number}} of federal appeals by self-represented, incarcerated litigants has grown dramatically. This article surveys {{ways in which the}} <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> inmate <b>appeals</b> has evolved over the past 50 years, and {{examines}} the challenges of designing procedures with confined litigants in mind. In the initial decades under the Appellate Rules, the most visible developments concerning the <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> inmate <b>appeals</b> arose from the interplay between court decisions and the federal rulemaking process. But, as court dockets swelled, the circuits also developed local case management practices that significantly affect inmate appeals. And, in the 1990 s, Congress enacted legislation that produced major changes in inmate litigation, including inmate appeals. In the coming years, the most notable new driver of change in the <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> inmate <b>appeals</b> may be the advent of opportunities for electronic court filing within prisons. That nascent development illustrates {{the ways in which the}} particulars of procedure in inmate appeals are shaped by systems in prisons, jails, and other facilities – and underscores the salience of local court practices and institutional partnerships...|$|R

40|$|A {{perspective}} is presented {{on the role}} of forest certification in general and concerning small-scale forestry in particular. Certification may be viewed as a tool to communicate with consumers, as a tool to influence forest management or as a game of power and money. Market studies indicate that the end consumers have little interest in certification; the process seems to be more of an issue for some large retailers of wood products. The impact of certification on forest management and thus on the environment has not been studied extensively, and the original objective to stop devastation of tropical forests has so far failed. Certification is a new type of regulation, not based on democratic institutions. Equal treatment, correct <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>appeal</b> and transparency of decision processes are issues of governance yet to be addressed. The market penetration of certification is increasing, but its importance is an open question. One possible scenario is that large retailers and their large suppliers will adopt certification while the large number of smaller forest owners, wood processors and dealers abstain. Small-scale forest owners do well to develop their own standpoint vis-à-vis certification and marketing. Key words: forest certification, market communication, forest management...|$|E
