60|$|The chief <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> now the centre. Here {{a column}} of grenadiers, {{supported}} by a heavy line of infantry, advanced to the assault, but the Guards stoutly maintained themselves until General Coote, with his brigade, came up, and the French were then driven back. All this time the French guns kept up an incessant cannonade on the British position. The attack on the British left, which had been but a feint, was never seriously pursued, but was confined to a scattered fire of musketry and a distant cannonade. General Hutchinson, who commanded here, kept his force in hand; for, had {{he moved to the}} assistance of the centre and right, a serious attack might have been made on him, and the flank being thus turned, the position would have been taken in rear.|$|E
60|$|And {{then came}} out the real {{weakness}} of that great ill-gotten Empire, conquered for conquering's sake. To the north-west, the Romans had extended their line far beyond what they could defend. The whole of North Gaul {{was taken by the}} Franks. Britain was then isolated, and had to be given up to its fate. South Gaul, being nearer to Italy their base, they could defend, and did, like splendid soldiers as they were; but that defence only injured them. It thrust the foremost columns of the enemy on into Spain. Spain was too far from their base of operation to be defended, and was lost likewise, and seized by Vandals and Suevi. The true <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> at the other salient angle of our position, on the Roman right centre.|$|E

Rear Admiral Cockburn, Cochrane's second in command, favoured a quick attack on Washington, but Ross was not eager. His men had been confined aboard their transports for nearly three months, and he lacked cavalry, artillery and transport. Ross was also wary of the American Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, lurking in the Patuxent River. His first objective had to be the capture or destruction of the American flotilla.|$|E

5000|$|The Battle of Stones River or the Battle of Murfreesboro as it {{was known}} in the South was fought from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863, in Middle Tennessee, as the {{culmination}} of the Stones River Campaign. During the battle of Stones River, the Helena Arkansas Artillery, now under the command of Lieutenant Thomas J. Key, was assigned to Brigadier General Lucius E. Polk's 1st Brigade of Major General Patrick R. Cleburne's Division of Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps of the Confederate Army of Tennessee. Lieutenant Key, commanding Calvert's battery, filed his report of the report of the roll of his battery in the battle from the Artillery Camp at Tullahoma, Tenn., January 23, 1863: :On the morning of December 31, 1862, Captain H. Calvert's battery moved forward on the left wing of the Confederate Army, supporting General Polk's brigade. ...a brigade which was concealed in a dark cedar grove and behind large rocks, and to dislodge them Colonel Hill sent to my battery for one piece of artillery, which was immediately dispatched, under charge of Lieutenant Fitzpatrick. After {{the right wing of the}} enemy had been driven a mile, one of their batteries was discovered firing upon General Polk's lines, and immediately my battery rushed in advance of the brigade in open field and engaged the enemy. So soon as we opened upon the enemy's artillery it returned the fire with deadly aim, wounding 1 man and killing 3 horses. My artillery killed the Abolition captain, 1 sergeant, and 2 or 3 cannoneers, and cut down 1 of his caissons and a number of horses. The battery was silenced and made a hasty retreat.... :The next <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> near the Nashville and Franklin pike, where the Abolition infantry had ensconced themselves in a dense forest of timber, and were awaiting the advance of our forces to mow them down as they pursued over an open field. This battery began shelling the woods, and routed the Abolitionists in front, but they rallied and renewed the attack on our left, and promptly we turned our guns upon them, and they were hurled back in confusion.... :The fourth place of action was, after we had pursued the enemy's batteries into the clustering cedars, near the railroad, where they were masked....The contest was unequal and desperate. Their rifle guns could throw canister as far as ours could spherical case, and in order to prevent annihilation we were forced to withdraw. :The fifth position was in the field west of the enemy's concentrated artillery, where we fought them until we had exhausted our ammunition, losing in this engagement one of our bravest and most expert No. 1 cannoneers. The enemy turned a triple number of pieces upon us.... :The sixth and last action was near that same intertwined and matted grove of cedars. Here also the contest was unequal. It was in this engagement that Lieutenaut Fitzpatrick lost his left hand by a canister, and a cannoneer's head was shot off, and a number of horses were killed, and one howitzer slightly damaged. Finding that we could not move the enemy from his strong position, and that smooth-bore guns could not cope with Parrott and rifled guns, we withdrew from the contest. :The battery lost 3 men killed, 1 officer and 4 men wounded, 10 horses killed and wounded, and 4 sets of harness....|$|E
40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the psychosocial {{experiences}} of elite NFL players. Many athletes dreamed and prepared to make it to the NFL as a starter, and to participate in the Pro Bowl or Super Bowl. Only a very few succeed. For these athletes, their process of preparation and performance delivery, has worked. This study was interested in exploring what were the key factors beyond talent and beyond physical/technical training that impacted their achieving success, and becoming a starter and making it to the Pro Bowl/ Super Bowl. What was it that these athletes thought or did, at the Point of Attack, when the ball was snapped? Three elite NFL professional football players participated in this qualitative study with a narrative research design. The narratives collected from the three players provided rich and intimate personal stories related to each of their lived experiences. Specifically, the intent of this study was to explore the personal experiences of these athletes, their thoughts, motivations, and intentions, at the Point of Attack, when the ball was snapped, to begin each play. The study also sought to identify evidence in the athletes' lived experiences that reflected the principles of Self Determination Theory (SDT), and the Flourish (PERMA) model. This study also explored the importance of team chemistry as an influence in these athletes' experience. But, the primary focus of the study was what was happening in their psychosocial experience at the Point of Attack. And, what was found was profound. These athletes reported their thinking at the moment, at the <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attack,</b> <b>was</b> "It's all about me right now!" and "I play for the name on my back!" Foundations and backgrounds for these understandings were uncovered. Implications for coach's education and field application were presented. There was substantial evidence from the athletes' reports and multiple described experiences that would represent the key components of SDT: relatedness, competence, and autonomy. There were several instances that would represent the key components of Flourish through the PERMA model (Positive emotions, Engagement, positive Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement). Also, reported and described were multiple experiences that would represent the importance of team chemistry achieved through team cohesion and team environment. These athletes reported, "It's all about me right now!" and "I play for the name on my back!...|$|E

50|$|The {{end of the}} 15th century, {{which brought}} a new epoch for the Christian world, brought no relief to the Jews.

As a result, the security of information passed over an open channel has become a fundamental issue and therefore, the confidentiality and data integrity are required to protect against unauthorized access and use. This has resulted in an unstable growth in the field of information hiding. Stegnography is a popular method to provide security.
