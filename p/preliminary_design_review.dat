5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> <b>review</b> {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E

These technologies were deemed sufficiently mature to retire significant risks in the program. The remaining {{technology development}} item (the MIRI cryocooler) completed its technology maturation milestone in April 2007. This technology review represented the beginning {{step in the process}} that ultimately moved the program into its detailed design phase (Phase C). By May 2007, costs were still on target. In March 2008, the project successfully completed its <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Design</b> <b>Review</b> (PDR). In April 2008, the project passed the Non-Advocate Review.

2500|$|Congress and {{industry}} both {{agreed that the}} Navy had deviated significantly from the normal process for developing a new aircraft. [...] For nearly three years, companies developed their candidates with company funds based on assumptions about the Navyâ€™s requirements without any guidance from the service. [...] The Navy did not issue any aircraft performance specifications or draft requirements until the spring of 2013, so competitors tried to refit their aircraft for the <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> <b>review</b> phase. [...] The lack of feedback was compounded by the shift of mission statements, from a long-range penetrating strike platform to long-duration orbits over permissive airspace. [...] Endurance requirements of over 12 hours were especially hard to meet, as there are limitations of an aircraft's wingspan for holding fuel on the confined space of an aircraft carrier; the UCLASS had to maintain two [...] orbits around the ship, or one orbit at a range of , {{with the ability to}} attack lightly-defended targets out to [...] After pressure from Congress, industry, and the Government Accountability Office, the Navy took another look at the draft requirements for the UCLASS. [...] They were scheduled to be released in October 2013 but were delayed. [...] The main reason behind the internal strife was indecision over the future of the aircraft carrier fleet and their air wings, between better UAV-based ISR coverage integrated on board carriers in the near-future and integrating a new unmanned aircraft into the carrier air wing to make the carrier a more effective strike platform.|$|E

500|$|Army {{leaders say}} having a large ground army is still {{necessary}} for deterrence and [...] "regime change" [...] operations. They also {{realize that their}} equipment will be mostly modernized versions of current equipment {{for the rest of}} the decade. Technologies from the GCV program are being explored, although development and procurement of a vehicle is not. By mid-November 2013, both BAE and General Dynamics <b>designs</b> had passed <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Design</b> <b>Reviews</b> (PDR), but neither company had commenced building prototypes. The Army was increasingly willing to slow down the GCV program or push it back from EMD to research and development. While the Army had said previously that it was their highest priority acquisition program, they had since shifted their main modernization priority to an integrated electronic command network. Short-term incremental upgrades will be applied to existing weapons systems to keep them from becoming obsolete, and advanced technologies available in the future will be used to build entirely new systems when funding is restored.|$|R

40|$|During January, {{technical}} progress continued in general {{accordance with the}} MWMF FY 95 Plan. Engineering development and design continued in support of <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> of MWMF major subsystems. Certain activities are being delayed due to DOE guidance for reduced funding profiles that would not warrant new hiring, early procurements, etc. Peer <b>reviews</b> and system <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> <b>reviews</b> are now being scheduled for project elements. We continued pursuing integration of MWMF and DWTF functions maximize cost savings. We also expended considerable engineering effort to provide technical and cost tradeoff information for the FY 97 Validation. Management focus during January centered upon addressing the rebaseline for MWMF for FY 97 Validation in March, and upon progressing with the RD&D permit. Funding baselines for preparing for FY 97 Validation in March were obtained from DOE; based on the baseline, detailed scope, schedule, and budget guidance was issued to the project staff to develop Validation information.

40|$|Technical {{progress}} {{continued in}} general {{accordance with the}} Mixed Waste Management Facility (MWMF) FY 95 Plan. Engineering development and design continued in support of <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> of MWMF major subsystems. Peer reviews have begun in preparation for system <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> <b>reviews.</b> Procurements in support of engineering design/development have continued to increase. Significant effort to provide technical and cost trade-off information for the Project Baseline Revision 1. 2 (PB 1. 2) and FY 97 Validation was completed. Management focus during February centered upon addressing the rebaseline for MWMF for the FY 97 Validation in March, and upon completing the permitting strategy. We completed a consistent baseline plan for Validation that satisfied the DOE constraints of integration with DWTF, schedule stretchout, overall Project cost, and FY cost profiles. The revised permitting strategy was completed and reviewed {{by a number of}} stakeholders (LLNL, DOE, State). The proposed strategy involves no RCRA RD&D permit, since all technology demonstrations can be done with surrogates and using limited treatability studies. The expenses for February continue to run somewhat below the plan due to the limited new hiring. This is a result of uncertain DOE funding and guidance to keep personnel to a minimum. However, the spending rate is picking up due to initiation of procurements for engineering development and a minimum of essential new hires. A significant imbalance in the OPEX/CENRTC funding split for FY 95 exists (about $ 2. 1 M); DOE/OAK began to seek resolution this month. Critical-path items are DWTF construction, NEPA, and permitting (for both MWMF and DWTF). Contractual issues have delayed award of the A&E contract for DWTF, but work-arounds are in progress to avoid schedule impact. NEPA and permitting issues are discussed below.

This version will launch NASA's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) on its first autonomous flight beyond the Moon and back, {{as well as the}} first crewed Orion flight. SLS is designed to evolve to a 130 t lift capability that can reduce mission costs, simplify payload design, reduce trip times, and lower overall risk.
