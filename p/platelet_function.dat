5|$|Von Willebrand's {{disease is}} a {{hereditary}} bleeding disorder found in both dogs and humans. It {{is caused by a}} lack of von Willebrand factor which plays a role in the clotting process of blood. This can cause abnormal <b>platelet</b> <b>function</b> and prolonged bleeding times. Affected dogs can be prone to nose bleeds, and increased bleeding following trauma or surgery. There are three types of this condition with Type I being the most common, while Type II and III being rarer, but more severe. Type I von Willebrand's disease is relatively common in the Scottish Terrier.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally {{has no effect on}} <b>platelet</b> <b>function).</b>|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of elucidating the {{relationship}} between arteriosclerosis and <b>platelet</b> <b>functions,</b> <b>platelet</b> adhesiveness, aggregation, factor- 3, (14) C-serotonin uptake and thrombodynamic function were measured in 92 patients with arteriosclerosis, including 29 cases of essential hypertention, 14 cases of chronic myocardial infarction, 29 cases of cerebral thrombosis and 11 cases of cerebral hemorrhage. As to the <b>platelet</b> <b>functions</b> of these arteriosclerotic diseases, a significant elevation of the platelet adhesiveness was found in cerebral thrombosis, chronic myocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency and essential hypertention. Platelet aggregation was elevated only in chronic myocardial infarction. The platelet factor- 3 did not show any increased abnormalities in all cases but rather showed a lowering tendency in cerebral thrombosis. The (14) C-serotonin uptake was significantly decreased in cerebral thrombosis and hemorrhage. The thrombodynamic function revealed no abnormality. Considering {{the relation between the}} aging of arteriosclerotic patients and the <b>platelet</b> <b>functions,</b> <b>platelet</b> adhesiveness and aggregation were more enhanced in the group of over 51 years old than in the group of under 50 years old.

As to the arteriosclerotic lesion of the ocular fundus, platelet adhesiveness was more elevated in cases with the arteriosclerotic lesion such as Scheie Ⅰ, Ⅱ & Ⅲ degree and aggregation was observed to be accelerated only in cases with moderate arteriosclerotic lesion (Scheie Ⅰ & Ⅱ degree), compared with the normal group. But there was no significant correlation between the degree of progression of the fundus lesion and these <b>platelet</b> <b>functions.</b> <b>Platelet</b> factor- 3 was found to be higher in the arteriosclerotic group than in the normal.

40|$|Objective: Coagulation and {{fibrinolysis}} defects {{were reported}} in primary hyperparathyroid patients. However, {{there are not enough}} data regarding <b>platelet</b> <b>functions</b> in this group of patients. Our aim was to evaluate the <b>platelet</b> <b>functions</b> in primary and secondary hyperparathyroid patients and to compare them with healthy subjects. Materials and Methods: In our study 25 subjects with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), 25 subjects with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), and 25 healthy controls were included. <b>Platelet</b> <b>functions</b> of the subjects were evaluated by using plateletrich plasma and platelet aggregation tests induced with epinephrine, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen, and ristocetin. Serum P selectin levels, which indicate platelet activation level, were measured in all subjects. Bone mineral densitometry was performed for all patients. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups with PHPT and SHPT and the control group regarding the platelet aggregation tests and serum P selectin levels. There was also no significant correlation between parathormone levels and aggregation parameters (ristocetin, epinephrine, collagen, and ADP: respectively p= 0. 446, 0. 537, 0. 346, and 0. 302) and between P selectin (p= 0. 516) levels. When we separated the patients according to serum calcium levels, there was also no significant difference between aggregation parameters and serum P selectin levels between the patients with hypercalcemia and the patients with normocalcemia. We could not find any significant correlation between aggregation parameters, P selectin levels, and serum calcium levels in this group of patients. Bone loss was greater in patients with PHPT. Conclusion: There is no significant effect of PHPT or SHPT and serum calcium levels on <b>platelet</b> <b>functions</b> when evaluated by aggregation tests...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the effects of cis- and trans-diamminedichloroplatinum complexes on in vitro <b>platelet</b> <b>functions.</b> Pretreatment of <b>platelets</b> with cis-platinum (cisplatin) induced a slow, dose-dependent (0. 1 - 0. 45 mM), increase in the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration, pleckstrin (47 kDa) phosphorylation and serotonin secretion, as well as a slight shape modification with emission of a few pseudopodia. All these effects were remarkably increased in platelets exposed to trans-platinum (transplatin). The rise in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration and serotonin secretion evoked by stimulation of platelets with thrombin were not significantly influenced by cellular exposure to cis-platinum, whereas they were enhanced and inhibited, respectively, by exposure to trans-platinum. Trans-platinum also inhibited thrombin-promoted platelet aggregation {{to a greater extent than}} the cis-isomer. While the viscosity of platelet rich-plasma tended to decrease in the presence of cis-platinum, it tended to increase in the presence of trans-platinum. Taken together, these results indicate that the effects on <b>platelet</b> <b>functions</b> of the efficacious antitumor complex cis-platinum is rather different from that of the inactive complex trans-platinum. Therefore, the in vitro tests of <b>platelet</b> <b>functions</b> employed in this study might provide an index of antitumor drug toxicity and serve as a preliminary indicator of therapeutic efficacy...|$|R

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of elucidating the {{relationship}} between the spreading-out test proposed by Breddin and the current routine tests of <b>platelet</b> <b>functions,</b> the spreading-out index was studied in comparison with adhesiveness, aggregation, factor- 3 and clot retraction. The results obtained are as follows. Positive correlation was observed between the spreading-out index and platelet adhesiveness. Non-adhesive platelets obtained by filtering the platelet rich plasma through a glass wool filter was found to have a lower spreading-out index than the untreated platelets. Therefore, it was considered that the adhesive platelets {{played a role in the}} spreading-out phenomenon. Although the adding of adenosine, AMP and ATP suppressed the spreading-out of the platelet, the adding test of ADP induced a tendency to increase the spreading-out index. The above result corresponded with the relationship between platelet adhesiveness and adenine nucleotides, and also supported the finding that spreading-out test is closely related to platelet adhesiveness. No significant correlation was obserbed between the spreading-out index and the other <b>platelet</b> <b>functions,</b> i. e., aggregation, platelet factor- 3 and clot retraction...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe role of ATP-binding {{cassette}} transporter 1 (ABCA 1) in <b>platelet</b> <b>functions</b> {{is poorly}} characterized. We studied {{the impact of}} ABCA 1 deficiency on platelet responses in a mouse model and two Tangier patients. ABCA 1 -deficient platelets exhibit reduced positive feedback loop mechanisms. This reduced reactivity is dependent on external environment and independent of hematopoietic ABCA 1. Summary Background The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA 1 {{is required for the}} conversion of apolipoprotein A- 1 to high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and its defect causes Tangier disease, a rare disorder characterized by an absence of HDL and accumulation of cholesterol in peripheral tissues. The role of ABCA 1 in <b>platelet</b> <b>functions</b> remains poorly characterized. Objective To determine the role of ABCA 1 in <b>platelet</b> <b>functions</b> and to clarify controversies concerning its implication in processes as fundamental as platelet phosphatidylserine exposure and control of platelet membrane lipid composition. Methods and results We studied the impact of ABCA 1 deficiency on platelet responses in a mouse model and in two Tangier patients. We show that platelets in ABCA 1 -deficient mice are slightly larger in size and exhibit aggregation and secretion defects in response to low concentrations of thrombin and collagen. These platelets have normal cholesterol and major phospholipid composition, granule morphology, or calcium-induced phosphatidylserine exposure. Interestingly, ABCA 1 -deficient platelets display a reduction in positive feedback loop mechanisms, particularly in thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) production. Hematopoietic chimera mice demonstrated that defective eicosanoids production, particularly TXA 2, was primarily dependent on external environment and not on the hematopoietic ABCA 1. Decreased aggregation and production of TXA 2 and eicosanoids were also observed in platelets from Tangier patients. Conclusions Absence of ABCA 1 and low HDL level induce reduction of platelet reactivity by decreasing positive feedback loops, particularly TXA 2 production through a hematopoietic ABCA 1 -independent mechanism...|$|R

2500|$|When vWD is suspected, {{blood plasma}} {{of a patient}} must be {{investigated}} for quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of vWF.

Factor VIII levels are also performed because factor VIII is bound to vWF which protects the factor VIII from rapid breakdown within the blood. Deficiency of vWF can then lead {{to a reduction in}} factor VIII levels, which explains the elevation in PTT time. Normal levels do not exclude all forms of vWD, particularly type 2, which may only be revealed by investigating platelet interaction with subendothelium under flow, a highly specialized coagulation study not routinely performed in most medical laboratories. A platelet aggregation assay will show an abnormal response to ristocetin with normal responses to the other agonists used. A <b>platelet</b> <b>function</b> assay [...] may give an abnormal collagen/adrenaline closure time, and in most cases, a normal collagen/ADP time. Type 2N may be considered if factor VIII levels are disproportionately low, but confirmation requires a [...] "factor VIII binding" [...] assay. Additional laboratory tests that help classify sub-types of vWD include von-willebrand multimer analysis, modified ristocetin induced platelet aggregation assay and vWF propeptide to vWF antigen ratio propeptide. In cases of suspected acquired von-Willebrand syndrome, a mixing study should be performed. Detection of vWD is complicated by vWF being an acute phase reactant with levels rising in infection, pregnancy, and stress.|$|E

To understand the role of myosin in normal <b>platelet</b> <b>functions</b> and in pathology, we generated mice with disruption of MYH 9 in megakaryocytes. MYH 9 Delta mice displayed macrothrombocytopenia with a strong increase in bleeding time and absence of clot retraction. However, platelet aggregation and secretion in response to any agonist were near normal despite absence of initial platelet contraction. By contrast, integrin outside-in signaling was impaired, as observed by a decrease in integrin beta 3 phosphorylation and PtdIns(3, 4) P(2) accumulation following stimulation. Upon adhesion on a fibrinogen-coated surface, MYH 9 Delta platelets were still able to extend lamellipodia but without stress fiber-like formation.
