50|$|NUAA {{unmanned}} flying wing is an UAV in flying wing configuration, and it {{made its}} public debut in 2011 AVIC Industrial Cup competition of UAV designs held in Beijing. NUAA flying wing looks very similar to another completely unrelated Chinese unmanned flying wing, AVIC 601-S Wind Blade because both are intended to explore technologies of flying wing, and both are transitional designs in that in comparison to more primitive designs that still retain tailplanes, these design have tailplanes eliminated. However, these designs are not advanced enough to completely eliminate vertical control surfaces, so they utilize winglets to <b>assist</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control.</b> Propulsion of NUAA flying wing is housed in a nacelle atop of the fuselage and the nacelle is integrated smoothly into the fuselage.|$|R

However, it was decided to opt for a traditional mechanical linkage approach that was augmented by a series of electrically-driven <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> units to effectively support actuation instead.|$|R

Au-tonomous helicopter is a typical CPS application and its flight presents challenges in <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system design with scalability. In this paper, we present the integration architecture of hardware and software for the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system based TREX 600 helicopter. In order to enhance scalability, the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system uses the PC 104 and the ARM which is exerted to process the measurement data, including the posi-tion, attitude, height etc. The <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> is developed based multi-loop decoupling PI control which is easy to be implemented.

50|$|An {{example of}} {{usability}} testing {{is the development}} of fly-by-wire <b>flight</b> <b>controls.</b> Fly-by-wire <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> eliminate the mechanical linkages between the <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> and the aircraft control surfaces. Sensors communicate the demanded flight response and then apply realistic force feedback to the fly-by-wire controls using motors. The behavior of fly-by-wire <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> is defined by control algorithms. Changes in algorithm parameters can translate into more or less flight response from a given <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> input. Likewise, changes in the algorithm parameters can also translate into more or less force feedback for a given <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> input. The “correct” parameter values are a subjective measure. Therefore, it is important to get input from numerous man-in-the-loop tests to obtain optimal parameter values.|$|R

40|$|The F/A- 18 Hornet {{aircraft}} {{with the}} original <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law exhibited an out-of-control phenomenon known as the falling leaf mode. The falling leaf mode went unde-tected during the validation and verification stage of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law. Several F/A- 18 Hornet aircraft were lost due to the falling leaf mode {{which led to the}} redesign of the lateral-directional axis of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law. The revised <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law exhibited successful suppression of the falling leaf mode during flight tests with aggressive maneuvers. Prior to performing expensive flight tests, the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law was extensively validated and verified by performing linear robustness analysis at different trim points and running many Monte-Carlo simulations.

40|$|AbstractWith control using {{redundant}} multiple {{control surface}} arrangement and large-deflection drag rudders, a combat flying wing {{has a higher}} probability for control surface failures. Therefore, its <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system {{must be able to}} reconfigure after such failures. Considering three types of typical control surface failures (lock-in-place (LIP), loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) and float), <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> reconfiguration characteristic and capability of such aircraft types are analyzed. Because of the control surface redundancy, the aircraft using the dynamic inversion <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law already has a control allocation block. In this paper, its <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> configuration during the above failures is achieved by modifying this block. It is shown that such a reconfigurable <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> design is valid, through numerical simulations of <b>flight</b> attitude <b>control</b> task. Results indicate that, in the circumstances of control surface failures with limited degree and the degradation of the flying quality level, a combat flying wing adopting this <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> reconfiguration approach based on control allocation could guarantee its flight safety and perform some flight combat missions...|$|R
40|$|A <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system's task is {{to process}} and {{distribute}} signals under real time conditions. Such a <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system has to be extremely reliable and still be capable of tolerating arbitrary faults. A <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> computer system consists of several autonomous processing-units, the so-called nodes. A time-independant model was developed to abstract the communication messages of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system. This model is used to identify system assumptions, characteristic features and their relationship assuming arbitrary faults. A node has the 'jurisdiction to isolate other nodes' and is itself failure-propagation-boundary and thus potential elimination level. If a node is clearly identified as being faulty on the local level, the desire to isolate the node {{is sent to the}} so-called isolators, which will reconfigure the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system if a certain amount of other nodes are in agreement. It is proven that 'isolating' <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> systems do not require stronger minimal redundancy level constraints than ordinary 'masking' <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> systems. (orig.)
