40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the characteristics of spoiler ailerons used as speed brakes or glide-path controls on an NACA 65 - 210 wing and an NACA 65 - 215 wing equipped with full-span slotted flaps. Several <b>plug</b> <b>aileron</b> and retractable-aileron configurations were investigated on two wing models with the full-span flaps retracted and deflected. Tests were made at various Mach numbers between 0. 13 and 0. 71. The results of this investigation have indicated {{that the use of}} plug or retractable ailerons, either alone or in conjunction with wing flaps, as speed brakes or glide-path controls is feasible and very effective...|$|E
40|$|A free-flight-tunnel {{investigation}} {{has been made}} to compare the dynamic lateral control characteristics provided by step <b>plug</b> <b>ailerons</b> on a sweptback-wing model having full-span flaps. The model had a 38 degree sweptback wing with an aspect ratio of 3 and a taper ratio of 0. 05. The static stability and control characteristics of the flight-test model were determined from force tests and the time-lag characteristics of the ailerons were determined from stand tests in which there was freedom only in roll. Flight tests of the model were made over a range of lift coefficient from 1. 0 through the stall. NACA TN No. 2247. "December 1950. "Includes bibliographical references.

40|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that {{this use of}} spoiler ailerons is feasible and desirable for normal emergency operatiion of airplanes. These speed brakes or glide-path controls would probably have small effect on wing pitching moments and should retain their rolling effectiveness. Ths report contains the results and discussion of an investigation of <b>plug</b> and retractable <b>ailerons</b> used as speed brakes or glide-path controls on an NACA 65 - 210 wing and an NACA 65 ₂- 215 wing of aspect ratio 5. 76 equipped with full-span slotted flaps. Incremental lift, drag, and pitching-moment data are presented for various flap conditions through a large-scale angle-or-attack range at Mach numbers from 0. 13 to 0. 71. NACA TN No. 1933.
