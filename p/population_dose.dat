40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} the number of diagnostic x-ray examinations performed in the United States, the <b>population</b> <b>dose</b> delivered, the percentage of that dose contributed by credentialed and noncredentialed operators, and one measure of performance: collimation of the x-ray beam. An estimated 82 per cent of medical x-ray examinations are performed by voluntarily certified (ARRT or ARCRT) operators. These procedures contribute 90 per cent of the radiation dose to the population. Data from the Nationwide Evaluation of X-Ray Trends (NEXT) program indicate that certified operators collimate the x-ray beam somewhat better than noncertified for chest examinations. They also indicate that differences in collimation practices may be attributed to the type of facility as well as to the credentials of the operators. One-third of the medical x-ray machines are in states presently requiring licensure of operators. It appears from these estimates that instituting operator licensure in the remaining states may reduce <b>population</b> <b>dose</b> by a maximum of one or two per cent...|$|E

40|$|The {{downwind}} deposition {{and radiation}} doses {{was calculated for}} the tropospheric part of the ash cloud from the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, by using a large cloud diffusion model. The naturally occurring radionnuclides of radium and thorium, whose radon daughters normally seep very slowly from the rocks and soil, were violently released to the atmosphere. The largest dose to an individual from these nuclides is small, but the <b>population</b> <b>dose</b> to those affected by the radioactivity in the ash is about 100 person rem. This <b>population</b> <b>dose</b> from Mount St. Helens {{is much greater than}} the annual person rem routinely released by a typical large nuclear power plant.

40|$|The {{results of}} the various {{monitoring}} programs for 1998 indicated that radioactivity from the DOE's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) operations could generally not be distinguished from worldwide fallout and natural radioactivity in the region surrounding the INEEL. Although some radioactive materials were discharged during INEEL operations, concentrations in the offsite environment and doses to the surrounding population were far less than state of Idaho and federal health protection guidelines. Gross alpha and gross beta measurements, used as a screening technique for air filters, were investigated by making statistical comparisons between onsite or boundary location concentrations and the distant community group concentrations. Gross alpha activities were generally higher at distant locations than at boundary and onsite locations. Air samples were also analyzed for specific radionuclides. Some human-made radionuclides were detected at offsite locations, but most were near the minimum detectable concentration and their presence was attributable to natural sources, worldwide fallout, and statistical variations in the analytical results rather than to INEEL operations. Low concentrations of 137 Cs were found in muscle tissue and liver of some game animals and sheep. These levels were mostly consistent with background concentrations measured in animals sampled onsite and offsite in recent years. Ionizing radiation measured simultaneously at the INEEL boundary and distant locations using environmental dosimeters were similar and showed only background levels.

40|$|Plain lumbar spine {{radiographic}} examination (LSRE) is frequently used in medical practice and delivers a high dose of ionising radiation. The {{objectives of the}} study were to determine the annual frequency of LSRE in Switzerland and its distribution according to practitioners' and patients' characteristics, as well as the related <b>population</b> <b>dose</b> of ionising radiation. Data were extrapolated from a nationwide questionnaire survey on radiation exposure resulting from medical imaging in 1998, involving physicians and other healthcare providers performing radiological examinations in Switzerland. An estimated number of 273, 000 LSRE are performed annually in Switzerland (39 LSRE per 1000 inhabitants per year).

30|$|The main {{limitation}} of this study is the simplified approach used to estimate effective dose, using the same conversion coefficient independently of weight, age, or sex of the patient. Therefore, the estimated doses refer to a generic reference individual. For a more realistic analysis of the actual PET doses received by each patient, additional information about the individual biokinetics and anatomical and physiological properties are required. However, this simple approach is suitable for the aim of this study, which was to estimate and compare <b>population</b> <b>doses</b> for different PET/CT procedures; this approach is also used elsewhere to obtain population PET and CT doses [8]. Another limitation is that all PET coefficients were obtained from the ICRP, except for those not included in the ICPR documents. Those coefficients were obtained from other publications on individual biokinetics and dosimetric studies, where the procedure for calculating the dose may not be fully equivalent to the one used by ICRP.|$|R

At least 20 % of patients requiring admission to hospital are on established statin therapy, and this proportion is growing each year. Evidence from observational studies and basic science research suggests that statins might be associated with a reduced mortality in sepsis. Randomized trials are producing equivocal results but have not shown the marked improvement in outcome suggested by the observational studies. Continued use in current statin users appears a more fruitful area for future research than statin use de novo as an adjuvant therapy in sepsis. Statin use in patients with pneumonia, acute lung injury or early sepsis warrants further study. International practice of statin use in critically ill patients is variable, and potential toxicity mandates careful monitoring.
