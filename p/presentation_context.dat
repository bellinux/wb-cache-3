An early ERP component (150 - 300  ms) measured over occipital and fronto-central sensors was specific to viewing pleasant pictures and was not affected by <b>presentation</b> <b>context.</b> Replicating previous studies, emotional pictures prompted a larger late positive potential (LPP, 400 - 700  ms) and a larger positive slow wave (1 - 6  s) over centro-parietal sensors that also did not differ by <b>presentation</b> <b>context.</b> On the other hand, ERPs elicited when viewing neutral pictures varied as a function of context, eliciting somewhat larger LPPs when presented in blocks, and prompting smaller slow waves over occipital sensors. Taken together, the data indicate that emotional pictures prompt increased attention and orienting that is unaffected by its context of presentation, whereas neutral pictures are more vulnerable to context manipulations. © 2007 Elsevier B.

Hence, we propose to introduce functional annotations to guide the adaptation process. Theses annotations allow to refine the role of multimedia objects in the document. We show that SMIL documents could embed functional annotations encoded in RDF. These multimedia documents are then adapted thanks to an interactive adaptation tool. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay was to show the pupils as presenters from their own and their teachers’ perspective. This was done {{regarding}} presentations by studying and comparing the applicability of the two structuralist theories media ecology theory and structural semiotic theory. The theories were used as model bases, aimed to correspond to opinions and experiences of Swedish upper secondary school pupils. Through a didactic approach, I intended {{to find out how}} pupils’ relations to presentations differ depending on how they regard them. Focus was on if they thought of presentations as comprehensive experiences or found similar elements in mediated and unmediated <b>presentation</b> <b>contexts.</b> An empirical field study was accomplished through qualitative interviews with pupils and teachers. The word “presentation” was treated as a discourse since data showed that respondents included diverse meanings and functions in the word. The analysis was based on the qualitatively collected empirical data that were applied on my models. Constructionism functioned as theoretical framework. My study indicated that the discourse presentation needs to be investigated further. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{multiplication}} of <b>presentation</b> <b>contexts</b> (such as mobile phones, PDAs) for multimedia documents {{requires the}} adaptation of document specifications. In an earlier work, a semantic approach for multimedia document adaptation was proposed. This framework deals with the semantics of the document composition by transforming the relations between multimedia objects. In this chapter, we apply the defined framework to the hypermedia dimension of documents, i. e., hypermedia links between multimedia objects. By considering hypermedia links as particular objects of the document, we adapt the hypermedia dimension with the temporal dimension. However, due to the non-deterministic character of the hypermedia structure, the document is organized in several loosely dependent sub-specifications. To preserve the adaptation framework, we propose a first straightforward strategy that consists of adapting all sub-specifications generated by the hypermedia structure. Nevertheless, this strategy has several drawbacks, e. g., the profile {{is not able to}} change between user interactions. Hence, we propose an incremental approach which adapts document sub-specifications step by step according to these interactions. To validate this framework, we adapt real standard multimedia documents such as SMIL documents. Key words: Qualitative representation and reasoning, SMIL documents. ...|$|R
40|$|Money is a {{secondary}} reinforcer that acquires its value through social communication and interaction. In everyday human behavior and laboratory studies, {{money has been}} shown to influence appetitive or reward learning. It is unclear, however, if money has a similar impact on aversive learning. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the efficacy of money in aversive learning, comparing it with primary reinforcers that are traditionally used in fear conditioning paradigms. A series of experiments were conducted in which participants initially played a gambling game that led to a monetary gain. They were then presented with an aversive conditioning paradigm, with either shock (primary reinforcer) or loss of money (secondary reinforcer) as the unconditioned stimulus. Skin conductance responses and subjective ratings indicated that potential monetary loss modulated the conditioned response. Depending on the <b>presentation</b> <b>context,</b> the secondary reinforcer was as effective as the primary reinforcer during aversive conditioning. These results suggest that stimuli that acquire reinforcing properties through social communication and interaction, such as money, can effectively influence aversive learning...|$|E

40|$|The current {{experiment}} {{explored the}} effect of enhancing the quality of encoding {{on the creation of}} false memories in older participants. Three groups of participants (1 group of younger adults and two groups of older adults) were presented with a modified version (Brédart, 2000) of the DRM paradigm (Roediger & McDermott, 1995) which permitted to elicit false recall. We used a short interstimuli interval (ISI of 1. 5 sec) in the younger and the older control group. A slower rate of presentation was used in the experimental older group (ISI of 3 seconds). The comparison of younger and older controls confirmed a greater susceptibility to false memories in the elderly. In addition, supporting our predictions, when both older groups were compared, lengthening of the ISI led to : a) an improvement {{of the quality of the}} encoding, b) an improvement of the source monitoring.

Two issues in particular are considered: compositional (especially mimesis {{and the construction of}} image, and what shall be termed ‘ephemeral narrative’) and presentational (in particular multi- channel speaker deployment). While exploring several relevant works within this discussion, by way of a case study the article introduces the author’s GRIDs project – a series of four multichannel sound sculptures united in their arrangement in geometric arrays of many (in some cases potentially hundreds of) loudspeakers. These permit, by virtue of being so massively (and geometrically) multichannel, the generation of extremely intricate spatial sound environments – fabricated landscapes – that emerge directly from an acousmatic compositional aesthetic. Owing to their alternative means of <b>presentation</b> and <b>presentation</b> <b>contexts,</b> however, they offer very different experiences from those of acousmatic music encountered in the concert hall.
