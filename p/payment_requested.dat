This requested amount is often called the asking price or selling price, while the actual payment may be called the transaction price or traded price.

30|$|The payment process {{starts at}} the same time the SIP session is {{initiated}} (step 2). Thus, the vendor requests a payment when the client initiates a SIP session to access a payment-based service. The <b>payment</b> <b>requested</b> could be for the whole session or for only some amount of time or data. Then, the client sends an e-coin to the vendor with the amount of the e-coin she wants to pay. For example, the e-coin value could be 1 Euro (€)/Dollar ($) and the client could want to pay only 0.2 Euros/Dollars.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} Customer Cost was {{developed}} by Lauterborn (1990) while developing the customer oriented Marketing Mix- the 4 C concept. 4 C model replaces the earlier 4 Ps of Marketing Mix, here {{the focus is on}} customer and the current chapter is all about the second C of this model i. e. Customer Cost or Price in earlier 4 P model. The Customer Cost concept is {{based on the fact that}} customers are more concerned with the total cost of acquiring a solution of their problem (Product or Service) rather than the price being charged for the Solution (Product or Service) offered by the Company (Moller, 2006), Customer Cost is a assumed to be a better approach as customers are interested in it. price is the quantity of payment or compensation given by one party to another in return for goods or services. In modern economies, prices are generally expressed in units of some form of currency. (For commodities, they are expressed as currency per unit weight of the commodity, e. g. Rs. per kilogram). Although prices could be quoted as quantities of other goods or services this sort of barter exchange is rarely seen. Prices are sometimes quoted in terms of vouchers such as trading stamps and air miles. In some circumstances, cigarettes have been used as currency, for example in prisons, in times of hyperinflation, and in some places during World War 2. In a black market economy, barter is also relatively common. In many financial transactions, it is customary to quote prices in other ways. The most obvious example is in pricing a loan, when the cost will be expressed as the percentage rate of interest. The total amount of interest payable depends upon credit risk, the loan amount and the period of the loan. Other examples can be found in pricing financial derivatives and other financial assets. For instance the price of inflation-linked government securities in several countries is quoted as the actual price divided by a factor representing inflation since the security was issued. Price sometimes refers to the quantity of <b>payment</b> <b>requested</b> by a seller of goods or services, rather than the eventual payment amount. This requested amount is often called the asking price or selling price, while the actual payment may be called the transaction price or traded price. Likewise, the bid price or buying price is the quantity of payment offered by a buyer of goods or services, although this meaning is more common in asset or financial markets than in consumer markets. Price refers to the amount charged for a product or service (Kotler, 2007), from producer’s point of view Price generates revenue (Kotler, 2003) ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOn July 1, 1995, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service fielded the On-line Prevalidation System for processing vendor <b>payment</b> <b>requests.</b> Its {{purpose was to}} prevent new Negative Unliquidated Obligation and Unmatched Disbursements records by comparing disbursement requests to obligations prior to payment. The Objectives of this thesis were to determine the causes of rejected <b>payment</b> <b>requests</b> by analyzing sample data drawn from Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic's Operations and Maintenance appropriation and to recommend {{ways to improve the}} prevalidation process so that obligation validation is more efficient and effective. Research included an investigation into the background of the prevalidation system and an analysis of UMDs and NULOs before and after the implementation of the OPV System. Seven causes of rejected <b>payment</b> <b>requests</b> were identified, along with the penalty interest charged as a result of document numbers remaining on the Rejected <b>Payment</b> Authorization <b>Request</b> Report. It was observed that the formation of new UMDs and NULOs has decreased as a result of OPV's implementation. While the disbursements that are prevalidated generally do not result in problem disbursements, only a portion of all disbursements is prevalidated. Lowering thresholds at which disbursements must be prevalidated and expanding the types of payments that are subject to prevalidation will improve the credibility of DoD financial management and further decrease problem disbursement levels.

The k-payment problem has additional applications in other resource-sharing scenarios. Our results include a complete characterization of the k-payment problem as follows. First, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a given set of coins to solve the problem. Using this characterization, we prove that the number of coins in any solution to the k-payment problem is at least kHN=k, where Hn denotes the nth element in the harmonic series.

5000|$|When a bank {{customer}} uses an unplanned overdraft {{and then}} makes a <b>payment</b> <b>request</b> (whether by standing order, direct debit or using an ATM or debit card), banks generally make the <b>payment</b> as <b>requested,</b> and then charge fees (which may include [...] "paid item" [...] charges and unauthorised overdraft fees) which accrue {{on a daily}} basis whilst the unauthorised overdraft continues. The Office of Fair Trading ('OFT'), acting on behalf of consumers, challenged these fees under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 ('UTCCR'), which implements European Union Unfair Contract Terms Directive. OFT claimed the sizeable fees charged were not a fair reflection of the banks' costs but were instead a penalty upon the consumer or bank account holder, hence unlawful. If these fees were confirmed to be a penalty for breach of contract then under UK law the amount that could be charged would be limited to reflect the actual (and considerably lower) costs which were incurred by the bank.|$|R
