40|$|The 2014 Ebola {{epidemic}} {{is the largest}} in history and is affecting multiple countries. Likely host = bats. 1 in 2 people who get Ebola in this outbreak have dide. How {{do you get the}} Ebola virus? Direct contact with: 1. Bodily fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola. (blood, vomit, pee, poop, sweat, semen, spit, other fluids); 2. Objects contaminated with the virus (needles, medical equipment); 3. Infected fruit bats or <b>primates</b> (<b>apes</b> <b>and</b> <b>monkeys).</b> Early Symptoms: Ebola can only be spread to others after symptoms begin. Symptoms can appear from 2 to 21 days after exposure: Fever, Headache, Diarrhea, Vomiting, Stomach pain, Unexplained bleeding or bruising, Muscle pain. When is someone able to spread the disease to others? Ebola only spreads when people are sick. A patient must have symptoms to spread the disease to others. After 21 days, if an exposed person does not develop symptoms, they will not become sick with Ebola. CS 25053...|$|E
40|$|Import JabRef | WosArea ZoologyInternational audienceAmong <b>primates,</b> <b>apes</b> <b>and</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{are known}} to use their hands and to exhibit {{independent}} control of their fingers. In comparison, Prosimii {{are thought to have}} less digital individualization and to use their mouth more commonly for prehension. Unfortunately, prehension and manipulation studies in Prosimii have been conducted in conditions constraining the subject to grasp with the hand. Moreover, the effect of food size remains unexplored, even though it could affect the use of the hands versus the mouth. Thus, whether prosimians use the hand or the mouth to grasp and manipulate food items of different sizes in unconstrained conditions remains unclear. To address this question, we characterized the eating and manipulation patterns of Microcebus murinus in unconstrained conditions, using three food sizes. The results showed that M. murinus showed (i) an eating pattern similar to that of rodents, with smaller food items being grasped with the mouth, (ii) a greater tendency to use the hands for prehension of larger foods, and (iii) plasticity during food manipulation similar to that which has been observed in rodents. These results are discussed in the framework of grasping in mammals and are used to discuss the origins of prehension in primates. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
50|$|Stimulated by {{gradually}} increasing {{amounts of}} estrogen in the follicular phase, discharges of blood (menses) flow stop, and {{the lining of the}} uterus thickens. Follicles in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24-36 hours after the luteinizing hormone (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an ovocyte, in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a corpus luteum; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of progesterone. Under the influence of progesterone, the uterine lining changes to prepare for potential implantation of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation. Menstruation also occurs in some other animals including shrews, bats, and other <b>primates</b> such as <b>apes</b> <b>and</b> <b>monkeys.</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Anti-Gal is {{the most}} {{abundant}} natural antibody in humans <b>and</b> Old World <b>primates</b> (<b>apes</b> <b>and</b> Old World <b>monkeys).</b> Its ligand, the alpha-gal epitope (Galalpha 1 - 3 Galbeta 1 - 4 GlcNAc-R), is abundant in nonprimate mammals, prosimians <b>and</b> New World <b>monkeys</b> whereas it is absent in humans and Old World primates {{as a result of}} inactivation of the alpha 1, 3 galactosyltransferase (alpha 1, 3 GT) gene in ancestral Old World primates, as recent as 20 - 28 million years ago. Since anti-Gal has been a 2 ̆ 2 forbidden 2 ̆ 2 autoantibody for greater than 140 million years of evolution in mammals producing alpha-gal epitopes it was of interest to determine whether ancestral Old World primates could produce anti-Gal once alpha-gal epitopes were eliminated, i. e. did they carry anti-Gal encoding immunoglobulin genes, or did evolutionary selection eliminate these genes that may be detrimental in mammals synthesizing alpha-gal epitopes. This question was studied by evaluating anti-Gal prodution in alpha 1, 3 GT knockout (GT-KO) pigs recently generated from wild-type pigs in which the alpha-gal epitope is a major self-antigen. METHODS: Anti-Gal antibody activity in pig sera was assessed by ELISA, flow cytometry and complement mediated cytolysis and compared to that in human sera. RESULTS: The study demonstrates abundant production of the natural anti-Gal antibody in GT-KO pigs at titers even higher than in humans. The fine specificity of GT-KO pig anti-Gal is identical to that of human anti-Gal. CONCLUSIONS: Pigs and probably other mammals producing alpha-gal epitopes carry immunoglobulin genes encoding anti-Gal as an autoantibody. Once the alpha-gal epitope is eliminated in GT-KO pigs, they produce anti-Gal. These findings strongly suggest that similar to GT-KO pigs, inactivation of the alpha 1, 3 GT gene in ancestral Old World primates enabled the immediate production of anti-Gal, possibly as a protective antibody against detrimental microbial agents carrying alpha-gal epitopes...|$|R
