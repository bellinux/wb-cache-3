5|$|Augustine St. Clare – Tom's {{third owner}} {{and father of}} Eva. St. Clare is complex, often sarcastic, with a ready wit. After a rocky {{courtship}} he marries a woman he grows to hold in contempt, though he is too <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> let it show. St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but {{is not willing to}} relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.|$|E
5|$|After Collins told <b>Polite</b> <b>to</b> leave, {{she became}} {{verbally}} abusive {{of the officer}} and Collins arrested her {{on the grounds of}} disturbing the peace. Florine Roberts, the mother of Robert Bandy, a black soldier in the U.S. Army who was also present, observed the incident and asked for Polite's release. The official police report held that the soldier threatened Collins; in the report, Bandy and Mrs. Roberts then attacked Collins. Bandy hit the officer and, while attempting to flee, Collins shot Bandy in the shoulder with his revolver. In an interview with PM, the soldier said that he intervened when the officer pushed Polite. According to Bandy, Collins threw his nightstick at Bandy, which he caught. When Bandy hesitated after Collins asked for its return, Collins shot him. Bandy's wound was superficial, but he was taken to Sydenham Hospital for treatment. Crowds quickly gathered around Bandy as he entered the hospital, and also around the hotel and police headquarters, where a crowd of 3,000 amassed by 9:00 pm. The crowds combined and grew tense, as rumors that an African-American soldier had been shot soon turned to rumors that an African-American soldier had been killed.|$|E
50|$|During {{the passage}} of the Trojan Horse in the Trojan War, Polites {{was one of those who}} {{accepted}} the gift. During the fall of Troy and the attempted escape to Latium, Neoptolemus shot an arrow in Polites' leg. Polites fell, escaping Neoptolemus, who pursued <b>Polites</b> <b>to</b> his father's palace. Priam called on the gods to punish Neoptolemus, but in that scene, Priam was also killed by Neoptolemus.|$|R

25|$|Reeves and Nass ran {{the test}} again but added a voice speaker to both {{computers}} that would verbally communicate {{information to make}} the human-social theme more explicit. The test resulted in {{almost exactly the same}} results. They concluded that people are <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> computers in both verbal and textual scenarios. The respondents did not need much of a cue to respond socially to the computers. The experiment proves that social rules can apply to media and computers can be social initiators. Participants denied being intentionally <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> the computer, but the results suggest differently.|$|E
25|$|Basil Fawlty, {{played by}} John Cleese, is a cynical and snobbish misanthrope who is desperate {{to belong to}} a higher social class.

25|$|In 1783, Mozart and {{his wife}} visited his family in Salzburg. His father and sister were cordially <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> Constanze, but the visit {{prompted}} the composition of one of Mozart's great liturgical pieces, the Mass in C minor. Though not completed, it was premiered in Salzburg, with Constanze singing a solo part.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{considered}} rude to spit out wine at a winery, even {{in the presence of}} the wine maker or owner. Generally, a spittoon will be provided.

25|$|German {{soldiers}} {{were ordered to}} be <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> the islanders, and in the beginning, they were. There were no rules against them fraternising {{so long as they}} behaved like gentlemen. Soldiers were punished for crimes against civilians. As the war progressed and {{soldiers were}} rotated out to other war zones, however, the quality of soldiers decreased, affecting their manners and attitudes. Serious problems started to arise {{in the last year of}} occupation when food was in short supply.|$|E

With his son Telemachus' help and that of Athena and Eumaeus the swineherd, killed all of them except Medon, who had been <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> Penelope, and Phemius, a local singer who had only been forced to help the suitors against Penelope. Penelope tested him and made sure it was him, and he forgave her. On {{the next day the}} suitor's relatives tried to take revenge on him but they were stopped by Athena.|$|E
25|$|As {{his celebrity}} {{grew in the}} late 1950s, he grew tired of being {{approached}} by strangers, and particularly disliked being visited by them at home. Another of his unverifiable stories had him keeping a suitcase {{by the front door}} so that he could claim to be just leaving, a practice he claimed to have abandoned after a helpful young man insisted on taking him to the railway station and had to be sent off to buy a paper so that Lowry could buy a ticket for just one stop without revealing his deceit. However, he was <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> the residents of Mottram, who respected him and his privacy; he used the bus to get about the area in his retirement. A bronze statue of him was erected at the traffic lights in the village.|$|E

25|$|Once in {{his home}} land, Odysseus {{traveled}} disguised as an old beggar. He was recognised by his dog, Argos, who died in his lap. He then discovered that his wife, Penelope, had been faithful to him during the 20 years he was absent, despite the countless suitors that were eating his food and spending his property. With {{the help of his}} son Telemachus, Athena, and Eumaeus, the swineherd, he killed all of them except Medon, who had been <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> Penelope, and Phemius, a local singer who had only been forced to help the suitors against Penelope.

25|$|For {{the next}} several years Sara is abused by Miss Minchin and the other servants, except for Becky. Amelia deplores how Sara is treated but is too weak to speak up about it. Sara is starved, worked for long hours, sent out in all weathers, poorly dressed in outgrown and {{worn-out}} clothes, and deprived of warmth or a comfortable bed in the attic. Despite her hardships, Sara is consoled by her friends and uses her imagination to cope, pretending she is a prisoner in the Bastille or a princess disguised as a servant. Sara also continues to be kind and <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> everyone, including those who treat her badly. One day she finds a coin in the street and uses it to buy buns at a bakery, but despite being very hungry, she gives most of the buns away to a beggar girl dressed in rags who is hungrier than herself. The bakery shop owner sees this and wants to reward Sara, but she has disappeared, so the shop owner instead gives the beggar girl bread and warm shelter for Sara's sake.|$|E
25|$|While Genie {{lived with}} the Riglers her mother usually met with her once {{a week at a}} park or restaurant, and their {{relationship}} continued to grow stronger. Although the Riglers never expressed antipathy towards Genie's mother their efforts to be <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> her inadvertently came off as condescension, and years later Marilyn said she was uncomfortable acting as a mother to Genie in her house with Genie's real mother present. With the exception of Jay Shurley, who felt the other scientists did not treat her as an equal, Genie's mother did not get along well with the other researchers, some of whom disliked her due to her apathy during Genie's childhood. The scientists speculated Genie's mother gave them a mostly cool reception because they reminded her of her earlier inaction on behalf of her children, and David Rigler also thought she was in denial about Genie's condition and the hand she had in causing it. Curtiss wrote that Genie's mother often gave conflicting statements about her married life and Genie's childhood, seemingly saying what she thought people wanted to hear, which the research team believed was out of fear of reprobation or ostracism for telling the truth.|$|E

500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Chris Hunt, {{in the weeks}} after writing the song, McCartney [...] "test his latest composition on anyone too <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> refuse. And that meant everyone." [...] On 30 June, after recording the Black Dyke Mills Band's rendition of his instrumental [...] "Thingumybob", in Yorkshire, McCartney stopped at a village in Bedfordshire and performed [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at a local pub. He also regaled members of the Bonzo Dog Band with the song while producing their single [...] "I'm the Urban Spaceman", in London, and interrupted a recording session by the Barron Knights to do the same. Ron Griffith of the group the Iveys – soon to be known as Badfinger and, like the Black Dyke Mills Band, an early signing to the Beatles' new record label Apple Records – later recalled that on their first day in the studio, McCartney [...] "gave us a full concert rendition of 'Hey Jude'".|$|E
500|$|Mulder tells Scully his version. In his recollection, he is {{sensitive}} and <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> Scully, {{while she is}} dismissive and irritable, and clearly enamored with Sheriff Hartwell (who, in Mulder's version, is far less refined and has obvious buck teeth). While Scully is performing the autopsy, Mulder and Hartwell get a call {{to go to the}} local RV park, where there is [...] "a situation". They find another dead body, apparently a victim of the same attacker. Mulder returns to the motel room; after Scully has left, he eats her pizza and realizes that he has been drugged. Ronnie enters, with glowing green eyes, and prepares to attack Mulder, but Mulder manages to postpone his demise by scattering sunflower seeds all over the floor, which Ronnie compulsively starts to pick up. Scully enters and shoots Ronnie, but the bullets have no effect, and Ronnie runs out with Scully in pursuit. Mulder recovers from being drugged and chases after Ronnie.|$|E

[...] Accounts of Delphine LaLaurie's treatment of her slaves between 1831 and 1834 are mixed. [...] Harriet Martineau, writing in 1838 and recounting tales told to her by New Orleans residents during her 1836 visit, claimed LaLaurie's slaves were observed to be [...] "singularly haggard and wretched;" [...] however, in public appearances LaLaurie was seen to be generally <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> black people and solicitous of her slaves' health, and court records of the time showed that LaLaurie manumitted two of her own slaves (Jean Louis in 1819 and Devince in 1832). Nevertheless, Martineau reported that public rumors about LaLaurie's mistreatment of her slaves were sufficiently widespread that a local lawyer was dispatched to Royal Street to remind LaLaurie of the laws relevant to the upkeep of slaves. [...] During this visit, the lawyer {{found no evidence of}} wrongdoing or mistreatment of slaves by LaLaurie.|$|E
