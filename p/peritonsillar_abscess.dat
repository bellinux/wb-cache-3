5|$|Strep throat is {{a common}} {{bacterial}} infection in children. It {{is the cause of}} 15–40% of sore throats among children and 5–15% among adults.

5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and <b>peritonsillar</b> <b>abscess.</b> The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E
5|$|The first {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) of Brussels. In his landmark book published in 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into the trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently. Antonio Musa Brassavola (1490–1554) of Ferrara successfully treated a patient suffering from <b>peritonsillar</b> <b>abscess</b> by tracheotomy. Brassavola published his account in 1546; this operation {{has been identified as}} the first recorded successful tracheotomy, despite the many previous references to this operation. Towards the end of the 16th century, Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) described a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. Fabricius was the first to introduce the idea of a tracheostomy tube. In 1620 the French surgeon Nicholas Habicot (1550–1624) published a report of four successful tracheotomies. In 1714, anatomist Georg Detharding (1671–1747) of the University of Rostock performed a tracheotomy on a drowning victim.|$|E

Aerobic or facultative aerobic bacteria were isolated from 23 % aspirates, mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 60 %, and anaerobic bacteria from only 3 % aspirate. A total of 69 bacterial isolates (34 aerobic and 35 anaerobic) were recovered. The most common aerobic isolate was Streptococcus sp, with Streptococcus pyogenes being identified in 23 % of aspirates.

25|$|However, when Nur ad-Din was on {{the verge}} of invading Egypt, he was seized by a fever due to {{complications}} from a <b>peritonsillar</b> <b>abscess.</b> He died at the age of 59 on 15 May 1174 in the Citadel of Damascus. He was initially buried there, before being reburied in the Nur al-Din Madrasa. His young son As-Salih Ismail al-Malik became his legitimate heir, and Saladin declared himself his vassal, although he really planned to unify Syria and Egypt under his own rule. He married Nur ad-Din's widow, defeated the other claimants to the throne and took power in Syria in 1185, finally realizing Nur ad-Din's dream.|$|E
25|$|Tonsillectomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which each}} tonsil is removed from a recess {{in the side of}} the pharynx called the tonsillar fossa. The procedure is performed in response to repeated occurrence of acute tonsillitis, sleep surgery for obstructive sleep apnea, nasal airway obstruction, diphtheria carrier state, snoring, or <b>peritonsillar</b> <b>abscess.</b> For children, the adenoids (also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil) are usually removed, a procedure called adenoidectomy (or tonsilloadenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy when combined). Adenoidectomy is uncommon in adults in whom the adenoids are usually vestigial. Although tonsillectomy is performed less frequently than in the 1950s, it remains a common surgical procedures in children in the United States and many other western countries.|$|E
25|$|The Renaissance saw {{significant}} {{advances in}} anatomy and surgery, and surgeons became increasingly open to surgery on the trachea. Despite this, {{the mortality rate}} failed to improve. From 1500 through 1832 there are only 28 known descriptions of successful tracheotomy in the literature. The first detailed descriptions on tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) of Brussels. In his landmark book published in 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into the trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently.

Antonio Musa Brassavola (1490–1554) of Ferrara treated a patient suffering from <b>peritonsillar</b> <b>abscess</b> by tracheotomy after the patient had been refused by barber surgeons.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{bacteria}} in consecutive <b>peritonsillar</b> <b>abscesses</b> using semiquantitation {{of the primary}} culture findings and correlated the results to clinical parameters. Puncture-aspirated pus from 42 abscesses yielded 133 isolates. Group A streptococci were isolated 10 times and, unlike other bacteria, were isolated 4 times in pure culture; other beta-hemolytic streptococci were found in 8 abscesses, and anaerobes were found in 28. The infections were polymicrobial, with two to seven bacteria in 83 %. Anaerobes were more abundant than nonanaerobes; members of the genera Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Fusobacterium {{were the most important}} quantitatively, considering both frequency and abundance. In patients with ongoing antibiotic treatment, nonanaerobes (but not anaerobes) were less abundant than in untreated patients. The abundance of obligate anaerobes (specifically cocci and gram-positive rods) correlated to the severity of illness as defined by fever and short duration before hospitalization. With other groups of bacteria, no such correlation was found. The correlation was not explained by a difference between the antibiotic-treated and the untreated patients.

Both kinds of microorganisms were lost in some cases but appeared as additional flora in others. The poor results from the swab technique was ascribed to overgrowth of respiratory flora contaminating the sample after incision.

40|$|Although interpatient {{variations}} in the course and anatomy of extracranial internal carotid arteries (EICAs) have been described previously, intrapatient variability is rarely cited in the literature. Distance between EICAs and the pharyngeal wall is an important determinant of vascular injury risk. A retropharyngeal EICA has crucial implications in patients undergoing pharyngeal procedures, and important in otorhinolaryngology and emergency medicine. Surgical exploration without identification of anatomical landmarks, or emergent intubation {{in the emergency room}} poses high risk for EICA injury. Other critical clinical considerations include intra-arterial involvement of tonsillitis, <b>peritonsillar</b> <b>abscesses,</b> or parapharyngeal neoplasms due to close proximity to the EICA. We present 2 cases with short-term change in retropharyngeal course of EICA to highlight this further. Although no clear etiology for these changes has been identified, we hypothesize that embryology, weight alterations, atherosclerotic disease, and postradiation changes are contributory.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to present our {{clinical}} outcome on deep neck infections. Material and Methods: A retrospective chart review of 50 patients with deep neck infection, presenting between 1998 and 2005, was evaluated. Thirty four of 50 patients were male and 16 were female, with an age ranging between 1 to 70 years (mean 30. 7 yrs). The findings of physical examinations, laboratory tests and radiologic and microbiologic studies were evaluated. Results: Sixteen of the 50 patients were diagnosed with <b>peritonsillar</b> <b>abscesses.</b> Other deep neck infections included parapharyngeal abscess (n= 12), submandibular abscess (n= 8), parotid abscess (n= 5), retropharyngeal abscess (n= 4), submental abscess (n= 3) and Ludwig’s angina (n= 2). Staphylococcus Aereus is the most common etiologic agent. The length of hospitalization period ranged from 2 to 24 days (mean 9 days). Forty-one patients of the 50 patiens required surgery, including open drainage in 36 patients, repeat needle aspiration in 6 patients and closed drainage in 3 patients.

40|$|Both the {{introduction}} of antibiotics and improvements in oral hygiene have made deep neck infections occur less frequently today than in the past. Nevertheless, the complications from these infections are often life-threatening. The {{purpose of this article}} was to review the clinical findings of deep neck infections and identify the predisposing factors of these complications. The present study reviewed 158 cases of deep neck infections between the years of 1995 to 2004, 23 of which had life-threatening complications. Cases were excluded if they had <b>peritonsillar</b> <b>abscesses,</b> superficial infections, infections related to external neck wounds, or head and neck tumors. The authors used multiple linear regression and the logistic regression analysis {{in order to determine the}} clinical parameters that are associated with longer hospitalizations and complicated deep neck infections, respectively. The multiple linear regression showed that patients with a large number of involved spaces, diabetes mellitus, and complications required longer hospitalizations (p < 0. 05). The logistic regression showed that patients with more than two involved spaces were more likely to have complicated deep neck infections (p < 0. 05). Patients with odontogenic causes had negative correlation (p < 0. 05). We recommend that high-risk groups, such as diabetic patients and/or patients with more than two involved spaces, should be more closely monitored throughout their hospitalization...|$|R
40|$|To gain {{an insight}} into the {{mechanisms}} of chronic and acute inflammation, the production of neutrophil chemokines in different types of tonsillitis – hyperplastic tonsillitis (HT), recurrent tonsillitis (RT) and <b>peritonsillar</b> <b>abscesses</b> (PA) – was investigated. The chemokines interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), growth-related oncogene-α (GRO-α), epithelial cell-derived neutrophil attractant- 78 (ENA- 78) and granulocyte chemotactic protein- 2 (GCP- 2) were detected and shown to have different biological activities. With respect to the biological properties of CXC chemokines, the biological activity of the chemokines was identified using a three-step high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique, a bioassay involving measurement of neutrophil chemotaxis in a single Boyden chamber in tissue of HT, RT and PA. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the chemokine concentrations were determined in the different tonsillitis entities. The chemokine pattern was dominated in PA by IL- 8 and GRO-α and in RT by GRO-α. Hyperplastic tonsils of patients without a history of infection generated about five times lower IL- 8 than PA. A protein concentration of GCP- 2 was induced in PA and RT, whereas ENA- 78 remained the same in all entities. In conclusion, {{it would appear that}} IL- 8 was up-regulated in acute inflammation, whereas GRO-α dominated in chronic inflammation. ENA- 78 seems not to play a pivotal role in inflammatory processes in tonsils.
