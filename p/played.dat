40|$|An {{observational}} {{study was conducted}} examining the social and cognitive <b>play</b> of young children with hearing-impairment <b>playing</b> in small groups composed of both hearing and hearing-impaired peers. The questions addressed {{the effects of the}} hearing status of the <b>play</b> partner upon the social/cognitive <b>play</b> patterns of children with hearing-impairment, and the relationship between their <b>play</b> patterns and their communicative competence, social competence and speech intelligibility. Forty-eight hearing-impaired subjects ranging in age from 3 - 6 to 6 - 1 were observed <b>playing</b> with partners of same and different hearing status during integrated <b>play</b> sessions at 13 school sites. The social <b>play</b> categories included solitary, parallel and group <b>play,</b> while the cognitive <b>play</b> categories included functional, constructive and dramatic <b>play.</b> Results of the study showed that the <b>play</b> patterns of the hearing-impaired children differed significantly for each group of partners. When <b>playing</b> with hearing-impaired partners, subjects engaged in group functional and constructive <b>play</b> more frequently than parallel functional and constructive <b>play,</b> and with equal frequency in parallel dramatic and group dramatic <b>play.</b> When <b>playing</b> with hearing partners, subjects engaged with equal frequency in group and parallel <b>play.</b> When <b>playing</b> with mixed groups of hearing and hearing-impaired partners, subjects engaged in group dramatic <b>play</b> more frequently than parallel dramatic <b>play,</b> and with equal frequency in group functional and constructive <b>play,</b> and parallel functional and constructive <b>play.</b> Communicative competence was negatively correlated to functional <b>play.</b> A positive correlation was found between social competence and constructive <b>play,</b> and between speech intelligibility and dramatic <b>play.</b> These correlations remained significant when age was partialed out. The hearing-impaired subjects spent similar percentages of time in social/cognitive <b>play</b> as those reported for hearing children. The study supports the premise that the <b>play</b> of young hearing-impaired children varies according to the hearing status of the <b>play</b> partner and is neither delayed nor deficient...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} prevalence of tablets in families, tablets have become a major platform for computer <b>play</b> for pre-school children. While children may potentially learn great deal from tablet <b>play,</b> it is at present unclear to what extent tablets support {{the wide variety of}} <b>play</b> activities that characterise their <b>play</b> and that form a necessary basis for children's development. This thesis presents the results of a heuristic evaluation, inspecting the <b>play</b> modes that presently are supported by children’s tablet games. The evaluation focused {{on the extent to which}} the mode of <b>play</b> was designed to correlate with children’s stage of development. Theoretical models representing the social and cognitive stages of <b>play</b> were used to examine all tablet games, examining how they support solitary <b>play,</b> parallel <b>play,</b> group <b>play,</b> functional <b>play</b> and dramatic <b>play.</b> The results show that for most of the investigated games, the age declaration correlates with their supported mode of <b>play.</b> More specifically, the investigated games supported solitary <b>play,</b> group <b>play,</b> functional <b>play,</b> constructive <b>play</b> and dramatic <b>play</b> in ways that were appropriate for their target age. However, none of the games supported parallel <b>play,</b> which is an important <b>play</b> form for children between 2 to 3 years old. Furthermore, very few games supported group <b>play</b> and constructive <b>play.</b> The conclusion is that while tablet game designers seem to understand and acknowledge the cognitive development of their target users, they pay less attention to the social modes of <b>play</b> corresponding to children's development stages. ...|$|R
