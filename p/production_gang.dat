50|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Our Gang, many similar kid comedy short film series were created by competing studios. Among the most notable are The Kiddie Troupers, featuring future comedian Eddie Bracken; Baby Burlesks, featuring Shirley Temple; the Buster Brown comedies (from which Our Gang received Pete the Pup and director Gus Meins); and Our Gang's main competitor, the Toonerville Trolley-based Mickey McGuire series starring Mickey Rooney. Less notable imitations series include The McDougall Alley <b>Gang</b> (Bray <b>Productions,</b> 1927-1928), The Us Bunch and Our Kids. There is evidence that Our Gang-style productions were filmed in small towns and {{cities around the country}} using local children actors in the 1920s and 1930s. These productions {{did not appear to be}} affiliated with Hal Roach, but often used storylines from the shorts of the period, and sometimes went so far as to identify themselves as being Our <b>Gang</b> <b>productions.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{procedure}} {{uses the}} reductive amination of phenylacetone with methylamine, P2P was usually obtained from phenylacetic acid and acetic anhydride, and phenylacetic acid might arise from benzaldehyde, benzylcyanide, or benzylchloride. Methylamine {{is crucial to}} all such methods, and is produced from the model airplane fuel nitromethane, or formaldehyde and ammonium chloride, or methyl iodide with hexamine. This was once the preferred method of <b>production</b> by motorcycle <b>gangs</b> in California, until DEA restrictions on the chemicals made the process difficult. Pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylacetone, and phenylacetic acid are currently DEA list I and acetic anhydride is list II on the DEA list of chemicals subject to regulation and control measures. This method can involve the use of mercuric chloride and leaves behind mercury and lead environmental wastes. The methamphetamine produced by this method is racemic, consisting partly of the less-desired levomethamphetamine isomer, though separation of the two enantiomeric forms through selective recrystallization of the tartrate salt can occur in order to isolate the more active dextromethamphetamine.|$|R

5000|$|After {{completing}} his military service in 1967 {{he moved to}} Manhattan's Lower East Side, beginning a [...] "quest for self" [...] that many went through in that period. At a friend's suggestion, he attended a workshop with avant-garde theatrical director Robert Wilson in 1970. Wilson was looking for actors with no prior theater experience, and Neu became involved with Wilson's work as a performer with the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds troupe and as a contributor {{to some of his}} plays.
