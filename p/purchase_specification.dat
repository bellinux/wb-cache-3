40|$|Globalization has {{significantly}} influenced {{the distribution of}} the world's food supply. There were now greater opportunities to procure raw material supply. However, with recent food industry scandals, an increased pressure was placed on food manufacturers to ensure high quality raw materials were used to produce safe products for consumers. This paper discusses a global food company's approach, {{to improve the quality of}} the raw materials used for food manufacturing, while also consolidating the <b>purchasing</b> <b>specifications.</b> The key area of focus was the commodity dairy proteins as these were important to the quality of the finished products. This consolidation and quality update was achieved through SAP, as this was used companywide for raw material data and <b>purchasing</b> <b>specifications.</b> The <b>purchasing</b> <b>specifications</b> became centrally managed while the requirements were standardized, reducing the inconsistency amongst specifications. Through this project, the number of <b>purchasing</b> <b>specifications</b> was 3 reduced and more volume was purchased from a single specification. As predicted by the literature, centralizing the specifications and consolidating the requirements, reduced the duplication of work, the inconsistencies between specifications, and brought further ownership and responsibility to one group.

Boxed pork was obtained to represent four different <b>purchasing</b> <b>specifications</b> common in the industry to conduct a study on yields, labor requirement, and value and profit assessment. Boxes of bone-in loins (n = 180), boneless loins (n = 94), Boston butts (n = 148), fresh hams (n = 28), and boneless hams (n = 23) were shipped to the Rosenthal Meat Science and Technology Center at Texas A&M University to perform cutting yields and time tests in a simulated retail cutting room. Subprimals within each <b>purchasing</b> <b>specification</b> were allotted randomly to cutting styles. Processing times (sec) and retail weights (kg) were obtained to determine relative value and retail yields (%). Retail yields ranged from 71. 12 to 95. 28 % for bone-in loins, 94. 92 to 98. 57 % for boneless loins, 88. 45 to 98. 59 % for Boston butts, 59. 54 to 60. 24 % for fresh hams, 99. 97 to 100. 12 % for inside fresh pork leg, 99. 36 to 100 - 01 % for outside fresh pork leg, and 98. 88 to 100. 45 % for tenderloins. Cutting times were increased up to three-fold when bone-in subprimals were taken to boneless endpoints. Cutting style affected (P [. 05) retail yield, total processing time, and value differential (US $/. 4536 kg) for bone-in loins. Cutting time and value for boneless loins differed (P [. 05) by cutting style. Boston butt retail yield and cutting time were affected (P [. 05) by cutting style. When cutting styles within subprimals were pooled, bone-in loin, boneless loin, Boston butt, and outside fresh pork leg percentage of retail yield were influenced (P [. 05) by <b>purchasing</b> <b>specification.</b> <b>Purchasing</b> <b>specification</b> affected (P [. 05) processing time for bone-in loins, boneless loins, fresh hams, inside fresh pork leg, and outside fresh pork leg. Value differential was impacted (P [. 05) by <b>purchasing</b> <b>specification</b> for bone-in loins, boneless loins, Boston butts, and inside fresh pork leg. With cutting style and <b>purchasing</b> <b>specification</b> influencing retail yield and cutting time the following linear regression model was developed for each subprimal with more than one cutting style: y g + si +pj +spij + eijk where y is the predicted percentage retail yield or processing time, g is the intercept, si is the effect of cutting style, pj is the effect of <b>purchasing</b> <b>specification,</b> spij is the effect of the interaction of cutting style and <b>purchasing</b> <b>specification,</b> and eijk is the error term which is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance of a 2. This model explained between 21 and 93 % of the variability associated with percentage of retail yield and between 81 and 91 % of the variability associated with cutting time for subprimals with more than one cutting style. Due to the numerous combination of factors that can affect retail yield, cutting time, and retail value of pork the computer program generated from this data will aid the retailer in making marketing and purchasing decisions that have been time consuming in the past...|$|R

40|$|Antifoam 747 {{is added}} to {{minimize}} foam produced by process gases and water vapor during chemical processing of sludge in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). This allows DWPF to maximize acid addition and evaporation rates to minimize the cycle time in the Chemical Processing Cell (CPC). Improvements in DWPF melt rate due to the addition of bubblers in the melter {{have resulted in the}} need for further reductions in cycle time in the CPC. This can only be accomplished with an effective antifoam agent. DWPF production was suspended on March 22, 2011 {{as the result of a}} Flammable Gas New Information/(NI) Potential Inadequacy in the Safety Analysis (PISA). The issue was that the DWPF melter offgas flammability strategy did not take into account the H and C in the antifoam, potentially flammable components, in the melter feed. It was also determined the DWPF was using much more antifoam than anticipated due to a combination of longer processing in the CPC due to high Hg, longer processing due to Actinide Removal Process (ARP) /Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) additions, and adding more antifoam than recommended. The resolution to the PISA involved and assessment of the impact of the antifoam on melter flammability and the implementation of a strategy to control additions within acceptable levels. This led to the need to minimize the use of Antifoam 747 in processing beginning in May 2011. DWPF has had limited success in using Antifoam 747 in caustic processing. Since starting up the ARP facility, the ARP product (similar chemically to caustic sludge) {{is added to}} the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) at boiling and evaporated to maintain a constant SRAT volume. Although there is very little offgas generated during caustic boiling, there is a large volume of water vapor produced which can lead to foaming. High additions and more frequent use of antifoam are used to mitigate the foaming during caustic boiling. The result of these three issues above is that DWPF had three antifoam needs in FY 2011 : (1) Determine the cause of the poor Antifoam 747 performance during caustic boiling; (2) Determine the decomposition products of Antifoam 747 during CPC processing; and (3) Improve the effectiveness of Antifoam 747, in order to minimize the amount used. Testing was completed by Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) researchers to address these questions. The testing results reported were funded by both DWPF and DOE/EM 31. Both sets of results are reported in this document for completeness. The results of this research are summarized: (1) The cause for the poor Antifoam 747 performance during caustic boiling was the high hydrolysis rate, cleaving the antifoam molecule in two, leading to poor antifoam performance. In testing with pH solutions from 1 to 13, the antifoam degraded quickly at a pH 10. As the antifoam decomposed it lost its spreading ability (wetting agent performance), which is crucial to its antifoaming performance. During testing of a caustic sludge simulants, there was more foam in tests with added Antifoam 747 than in tests without added antifoam. (2) Analyses were completed to determine the composition of the two antifoam components and Antifoam 747. In addition, the decomposition products of Antifoam 747 were determined during CPC processing of sludge simulants. The main decomposition products were identified primarily as Long Chain Siloxanes, boiling point > 400 C. Total antifoam recovery was 33 % by mass. In a subsequent study, various compounds potentially related to antifoam were found using semi-volatile organic analysis and volatile organic analysis on the hexane extractions and hexane rinses. These included siloxanes, trimethyl silanol, methoxy trimethyl silane, hexamethyl disiloxane, aliphatic hydrocarbons, dioctyl phthalate, and emulsifiers. Cumulatively, these species amounted to less than 3 % of the antifoam mass. The majority of the antifoam was identified using carbon analysis of the SRAT product (40 - 80 % by mass) and silicon analysis (23 - 83 % by mass) of the condensate. Both studies recommended a better solvent for antifoam and more specific tests for antifoam degradation products than the Si and C analyses used. (3) The DWPF Antifoam 747 <b>Purchase</b> <b>Specification</b> was revised in Month, 2011 with a goal of increasing the quality of Antifoam 747. The <b>purchase</b> <b>specification</b> was changed to specify the manufacturer and product for both components that are blended by Siovation to produce Antifoam 747 for DWPF. Testing of Antifoam produced using both the old and new antifoam specifications perform very similarly in testing.

We recommend that future batches of MST received at SRS be tested for particle size and filtration performance.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The temperature-time-location {{relationships}} during steam {{conditioning and}} pressure treatment of timber poles {{have been studied}} and mathematical models that take into account both the thermal properties of the poles and {{the parameters of the}} treatment process have been developed. Although much work has been previously done in this area, the standard "recipe" to sterilize wood fails to bring the interiors of large diameter wood poles to the required temperature. Recent studies (DOST, 1984; NEWBILL et al., 1988) indicated that commonly used charts, initially made by MACLEAN (1930, 1932, 1935, 1952), predict a much faster temperature increase than actually measured. In all previous modeling work it has been assumed that during pressure treatment, operational changes result in step changes of the surface temperatures of the poles. However, from actual measurements it was found that when operating conditions changed, there was a time interval, ' time lag', during which no effect was observed on the surface temperature of the poles. These time lags are due to the thermal capacity of the process equipment and were found to be an important element for accurate prediction. The unknown parameters of several mathematical models were estimated by fitting experimental data taken from commercial scale equipment (NEWBILL et al., 1988). The best model was discriminated among rival ones and the sensitivity and reliability of its estimated parameters were analyzed.

The inoculated beef strip loins were chilled at 2 degrees C for 24 h, and then vacuum packaged and aged for 7 to 24 days at 2 degrees C. The beef strip loins were subjected to one of five treatments or control (no treatment). Spray treatments were: 2. 5 % L-lactic acid, 5. 0 % L-lactic acid, 1, 050 ppm acidified sodium chlorite, 205 ppm peroxyacetic acid, and tap water. Lactic acid treatments were applied at ~ 53 degrees C, whereas the other sprays were applied at room temperature (~ 25 degrees C). Treated and control pieces were tumble marinated using a commercial marinade. Sample counts were collected throughout the experiment to track reductions in inoculated microorganisms as impacted by antimicrobial treatment and processing. For the high-inoculated strip loins, the 5. 0 % L-lactic acid treatment was most effective (P < 0. 05) across treatments and control at reducing surrogate organisms on meat surfaces before marination, producing a 2. 6 log 10 CFU/cm 2 reduction. The water treatment accounted for the least (P < 0. 05) reductions across treatments and control of surrogate organisms on the meat surface before marination. Peroxyacetic acid produced the greatest reduction of surface surrogate organisms in the finished, marinated product. The water treatment resulted in greater internalization of surrogate microorganisms {{when compared to the}} control. Furthermore, certain less effective antimicrobial sprays such as water may facilitate internalization of surface bacteria, more so than non-treated subprimals.

The level of impact on the obtained nut factor was found to be significant enough that the likelihood of joint leakage would have increased several-fold. These defects have been found to be relatively common in bolts delivered for testing and simple modifications to the industry standards are proposed in order to remedy the potential for any such defect causing joint leakag...|$|R

40|$|Results of {{material}} compatibility experiments using hydrocarbon fuels {{in contact with}} copper-based combustion chamber liner materials are presented. Mil-Spec RP- 1, n- dodecane, propane, and methane fuels were tested in contact with OFHC, NASA-Z, and ZrCu coppers. Two distinct test methods were employed. Static tests, in which copper coupons were exposed to fuel for long durations at constant temperature and pressure, provided compatibility data in a precisely controlled environment. Dynamic tests, using the Aerojet Carbothermal Test Facility, provided fuel and copper compatibility data under realistic booster engine service conditions. Tests were conducted using very pure grades of each fuel and fuels to which a contaminant, e. g., ethylene or methyl mercaptan, was added to define {{the role played by}} fuel impurities. Conclusions are reached as to degradation mechanisms and effects, methods for the elimination of these mechanisms, selection of copper alloy combustion chamber liners, and hydrocarbon fuel <b>purchase</b> <b>specifications...</b>|$|R

50|$|Because Canada {{uses the}} {{accreditation}} {{model of a}} national accrediting authority, if an organisation tests a firestop in or for use in Canada, {{in accordance with the}} correct standard (ULC-S115), but is not accredited by the SCC, the test results cannot be used to in any approvals of field installations on Canadian construction sites. If, on the other hand, the test laboratory is also accredited for product certification, then before the test takes place, a follow-up or certification agreement is anticipated between the certifier and the submitter of the test who desires a rating or a listing. An inspector from the certifying organisation witnesses the manufacture of the product or products to be tested, and checks the manufacturing procedures against the process standard that is in place and by then on file with the certifying organisation. The process standard includes all information necessary to manufacture the product or products, including equipment descriptions, tolerances, chemical formulas and <b>purchasing</b> <b>specifications</b> for ingredients or components. The manufactured goods are sealed by the inspector and then shipped to the laboratory, where the contents are used to build the test specimen in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.|$|R
