He had written and sent to Mr. Crawley to inquire, but had been assured that nothing had been found.

5000|$|In Marx's {{theory of}} the {{capitalist}} mode of production, not just anything has a value in the economic sense, even if things can be priced. Only the products of human labour have the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> and their [...] "value" [...] is the total current labour cost implicated in making them, on average. Value relationships among physical products or labour-services and physical assets — as proportions of current labour effort involved in making them — exist according to Marx quite independently from price information, and prices can oscillate {{in all sorts of}} ways around economic values, or indeed quite independently of them. However, the expression of product-value by prices in money-units in most cases does not diverge very greatly from the actual value; if there was a very big difference, people {{would not be able to}} sell them, or they would not buy them.|$|E

In other words, for Marx, the fact that commodities have the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> in the first place, {{has nothing to do}} with exchange as such. It has to do with the reality that the commodities are the products of quantities of social labour (they have an average replacement cost in labour time; some people have to do work, so that others can acquire the products). There do not exist any [...] "substantialist" [...] scholars in economics who think that [...] "value" [...] is literally a kind of [...] "stuff" [...] inserted into every commodity when it is produced. Modern money is fiduciary currency, or money of account, that actually has very little intrinsic value. The [...] "value of money" [...] is that one can acquire real product-value with it.|$|E

Article 1, 17. And the possessory right to the range, though held by aliens, was respected by their neighbors and all cattle dealers of the country, and had a market value, as shown by the price which others were ready to pay for it. The responsibility of trustees does not depend upon the validity of the title of the grantor of the trust property. If the right or interest transferred to them can be sold for a valuable consideration, it is to be treated as property, and corresponding duties devolve upon the trustees with respect to its sale as upon the sale of property, the title of which is undisputed.|$|E

30|$|But {{there is}} another, perhaps more commonsense, {{argument}} for not destroying {{the instruments of}} utter destruction. This is that those instruments (in the broad sense) remind of people of horrible sins committed against innocent people and mankind in general. And this is important and good. But ‘Reminds’ is a relation that can hardly be called a unequivocal or pure value. In many cases we use things {{to remind us of}} other people we want to continue hating. Or want to take revenge. In fact, nothing precludes that certain people take inspiration from the sight of Ausschwitz to carry out similar crimes, or, to be more modest, that they get disillusioned by the moral prospects of mankind and become cynics; or that they simply begin to despise the victims for not having resorted to violent resistance against the horrors, and so on. The possible effects of ‘reminds of something disvaluable/worthless’ are by no means unequivocally or necessarily positive. Whether or not they are positive depends usually on the character, and, axiologically, the worth of those affected. If the relation in question participates in the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> at all, the value, and through it, the property of being a value, is instantiated only if the affected particular (the person reminded) displays the expected positive reactions. The person’s worth plays here a decisive role not only in the instantiation of a relation value, but also in instantiation of the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> too 26.|$|E

In this paper we develop and evaluate two general planning algorithms for PSR models. First, we show how planning algorithms for POMDPs that exploit the piecewise linear <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> functions for finite-horizon problems can be extended to PSRs. This requires an interesting replacement of the role of hidden nominalstates in POMDPs with linearly independent predictions in PSRs. Second, we show how traditional reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning can be extended to PSR models. We empirically evaluate both our algorithms on a standard set of test POMDP problems. ...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{assessment}} in information security traditionally analyzes threats to assets. An asset is a persistent item or <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> {{and has an}} owner. Attacks damage assets; security controls prevent attacks to preserve their value. Expected attack loss is calculated from {{the value of the}} attacked assets. This common analytic approach works satisfyingly if an IT system runs in an enclosed environment within an organization. Nowadays, IT systems are accessed and used across organizational boundaries by a multitude of independent stakeholders employing them for their own interests and with particular expectations regarding their trustworthiness. The asset paradigm cannot support estimating consequences of security incidents that may harm these complex stakeholder collaborations. We propose t o model the stakeholder collaboration networks and to analyze scenarios of how security incidents affect relationships between stakeholders. Collaboration continuously creates value for all participants. Security incidents change the behavior of stakeholders and their willingness to collaborate, but in complicated ways. Transmission factors characterizing a relationship help us {{to assess the impact of}} incidents. We apply the conventional method and our new approach to a case study and compare the results...|$|E

30|$|The general {{approach}} to using cooperative game theory to understand rate or capacity regions involves the following steps. (i) Formulate {{the region of}} interest as the aspiration set of a cooperative game. This is frequently {{the right kind of}} formulation for multiuser problems. (ii) Study the <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> the <b>value</b> function <b>of</b> the game, starting with checking if it is balanced, if it is exact, if it has a large core, and ultimately by checking convexity or concavity. (iii) Interpret the <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> the game that follow from the discovered <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> the <b>value</b> function.

40|$|Continuation-passing style (CPS) is {{a method}} of {{representing}} program evaluation order in a purely functional manner. Many applications of CPS rely on CPS transformations which explicitly encode evaluation strategies (e. g., call-by-name, call-by-value, etc.) into the structure of programs. Existing CPS transformations are based almost entirely on the call-by-name and call-by-value CPS transformations dened by Plotkin, Reynolds, and Fischer over twenty years ago. These transformations introduce {{the same pattern of}} evaluation (either call-by-name or call-by-value) throughout the entire program. Such rigidness ignores additional computational properties such as strictness and termination that are used to optimize program evaluation. We take a more general approach to CPS | we direct CPS transformations by computational properties instead of by xed evaluation strategies. For example, a CPS transformation directed by strictness properties subsumes both the call-by-name transformation (in case all functions are non-strict) and the call-by-value transformation (in case all functions are strict). Moreover, it can transform programs with both strict and non-strict functions such as a call-by-name program after strictness analysis. Considering termination properties allows CPS transformations to avoid introducing unnecessary continuations. Based on the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> we show how CPS transformations (e. g., the strictness-directed transformation) can be factored into the call...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversification}} property {{requires that}} the insurer’s reduction in uncertainty arising out of risk diversification {{be accompanied by a}} reduction in the insurer’s certainty equivalent price for the portfolio. Diversification is shown to alter the insurer’s aversion to risk by reducing its risk aversion parameter. For a portfolio consisting of uncorrelated Normally distributed exposures, the risk margin for each exposure subsequent to diversification is proportional to the variance of the damages. Prices after diversification satisfy the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> additivity. For a portfolio of Normally distributed exposures, the completely diversified component of risk is shown to be irrelevant for risk pricing. This principle is adopted for other than Normal distributions, and is used to demonstrate that the certainty equivalent price for any exposure after taking diversification into consideration is µ + λρσ, where µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the outcomes, ρ is the correlation coefficient between the exposure and the portfolio, and λ is a constant for all exposures within the portfolio. Provided that the insurer’s expenses are not excessive, the insurer’s price reduction obtained through diversification permits the insurer and the insured to find a mutually acceptable price for the transfer of risk. Market supply and demand curves, and hence the market price, are derived from the certainty equivalent prices for the market participants. In a perfectly competitive market, the insurer’s fixed overhead expense is not included in the insurer’s price. For investments in securities, the risk pricing model is shown to be consistent with the Capital Asset Pricing Model. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{prevalent}} {{market structure}} in the Internet economy consists of buyers and sellers connected by a platform (such as Amazon or eBay) that acts as an intermediary and keeps {{a share of the}} revenue of each transaction. While the optimal mechanism that maximizes the intermediary's profit in such a setting may be quite complicated, the mechanisms observed in reality are generally much simpler, e. g., applying an affine function to the price of the transaction as the intermediary's fee. Loertscher and Niedermayer [2007] initiated the study of such fee-setting mechanisms in two-sided markets, and we continue this investigation by addressing the question of when an affine fee schedule is approximately optimal for worst-case seller distribution. On one hand our work supplies non-trivial sufficient conditions on the buyer side (i. e. linearity of marginal revenue function, or MHR <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> and value minus cost distributions) under which an affine fee schedule can obtain a constant fraction of the intermediary's optimal profit for all seller distributions. On the other hand we complement our result by showing that proper affine fee-setting mechanisms (e. g. those used in eBay and Amazon selling plans) are unable to extract a constant fraction of optimal profit in the worst-case seller distribution. As subsidiary results we also show there exists a constant gap between maximum surplus and maximum revenue under the aforementioned conditions. Most of the mechanisms that we propose are also prior-independent with respect to the seller, which signifies the practical implications of our result.
