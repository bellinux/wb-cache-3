5|$|Public {{transport}} services in Greater Manchester are co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), a public body with powers between {{those of a}} <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> executive and Transport for London, established as SELNEC PTE in 1969 {{in accordance with the}} Transport Act 1968. The original SELNEC <b>Passenger</b> <b>Transport</b> Executive was renamed as the Greater Manchester <b>Passenger</b> <b>Transport</b> Executive (GMPTE) when taken over by the Greater Manchester County Council on 1 April 1974 to co-ordinate public transport modes within the new county. The council had overall responsibility for strategic planning and all policy decisions covering public transport (such as bus and rail services) and highways. GMPTE's purpose was to secure the provision of a completely integrated and efficient system of <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> for Greater Manchester on behalf of the county council. In 1977, it was noted as the largest authority for public transport in the United Kingdom after London Transport. GMPTE was renamed as Transport for Greater Manchester in April 2011 when it became a functional body of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and obtained powers additional to those of a regular <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> executive from central government.|$|E

5|$|After it {{was decided}} that <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus {{division}} and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the concession to operate the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as if the other operator did not exist. At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession to operate <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time.|$|E
