5|$|Another {{simplified}} experiment {{indicated that}} lawyers trained {{in a systematic}} selection method made better predictions of juror verdicts in two of four cases – the sale of illegal drugs and a military court-martial (the other two cases were murder and drunk driving). The systematic method was more effective in those two cases where the <b>predictive</b> relationships between demographic variables and attitudes/verdicts were strongest, and least effective where such <b>predictive</b> relationships were weak or nonexistent.|$|E

25|$|Since 2002 Hood has {{progressively}} {{expanded his}} vision of the future of medicine: first focusing on <b>predictive</b> and preventive (2P) Medicine; then <b>predictive,</b> preventive and personalized (3P) Medicine; and finally <b>predictive,</b> preventive, personalized and participatory, also known as P4 Medicine. Hood states that P4 Medicine is the convergence of systems medicine, big data and patient (consumer) driven healthcare and social networks.|$|E
25|$|The prior <b>predictive</b> {{distribution}} and posterior <b>predictive</b> distribution {{of a new}} normally distributed data point when a series of independent identically distributed normally distributed data points have been observed, with prior mean and variance as in the above model.|$|E
25|$|Another {{class of}} methods assesses whether the {{inference}} {{was successful in}} light of the given observed data, for example, by comparing the posterior <b>predictive</b> distribution of summary statistics to the summary statistics observed. Beyond that, cross-validation techniques and <b>predictive</b> checks represent promising future strategies to evaluate the stability and out-of-sample <b>predictive</b> validity of ABC inferences. This is particularly important when modeling large data sets, because then the posterior support of a particular model can appear overwhelmingly conclusive, even if all proposed models in fact are poor representations of the stochastic system underlying the observation data. Out-of-sample <b>predictive</b> checks can reveal potential systematic biases within a model and provide clues on to how to improve its structure or parametrization.|$|E
25|$|To {{avoid such}} sources of {{inaccuracy}} by using likelihood ratios, the optimal method {{would be to}} gather a large reference group of equivalent individuals, {{in order to establish}} separate <b>predictive</b> values for use of the test in such individuals. However, with more knowledge of an individual's medical history, physical examination and previous test etc. that individual becomes more differentiated, with increasing difficulty to find a reference group to establish tailored <b>predictive</b> values, making an estimation of post-test probability by <b>predictive</b> values invalid.|$|E
25|$|Until we {{find out}} what the {{relevant}} psychological predictors are for which racial classification per se is merely a 'stand-in' variable, {{we have no choice but}} to include race (or other group membership) as a <b>predictive</b> variable along with the test scores or other <b>predictive</b> measures. On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight <b>predictive</b> bias to the presumably disadvantaged group.|$|E
25|$|In {{these trials}} DirectHit {{analysis}} of estrogen receptor and HER-2/neu displayed a higher <b>predictive</b> accuracy for treatment outcomes with anti estrogen drugs and Trastuzumab than standard methods.

25|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that self-reported and Trait EI measures retain a fair amount of <b>predictive</b> validity for job performance after controlling Big Five traits and IQ. Newman, Joseph, and MacCann contend that the greater <b>predictive</b> validity of Trait EI measures is due to their inclusion of content related to achievement motivation, self efficacy, and self-rated performance. Meta-analytic evidence confirms that self-reported emotional intelligence predicting job performance is due to mixed EI and trait EI measures' tapping into self-efficacy and self-rated performance, in addition to the domains of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and IQ. As such, the <b>predictive</b> ability of mixed EI to job performance drops to nil when controlling for these factors.|$|E

25|$|Plots of {{the four}} results above in the ROC space are given in the figure. The result of method A clearly shows the best <b>predictive</b> power among A, B, and C. The result of B lies on the random guess line (the {{diagonal}} line), {{and it can be}} seen in the table that the accuracy of B is 50%. However, when C is mirrored across the center point (0.5,0.5), the resulting method C′ is even better than A. This mirrored method simply reverses the predictions of whatever method or test produced the C contingency table. Although the original C method has negative <b>predictive</b> power, simply reversing its decisions leads to a new <b>predictive</b> method C′ which has positive <b>predictive</b> power. When the C method predicts p or n, the C′ method would predict n or p, respectively. In this manner, the C′ test would perform the best. The closer a result from a contingency table is to the upper left corner, the better it predicts, but the distance from the random guess line in either direction is the best indicator of how much <b>predictive</b> power a method has. If the result is below the line (i.e. the method is worse than a random guess), all of the method's predictions must be reversed in order to utilize its power, thereby moving the result above the random guess line.|$|E

25|$|For exchanging the {{extracted}} models – {{in particular}} {{for use in}} <b>predictive</b> analytics– the key standard is the <b>Predictive</b> Model Markup Language (PMML), which is an XML-based language developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG) and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications. As the name suggests, it only covers prediction models, a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications. However, extensions to cover (for example) subspace clustering have been proposed independently of the DMG.|$|E

25|$|The {{nasogastric}} aspirate {{can help}} determine the location of bleeding and thus direct initial diagnostic and treatment plans. Witting found that nasogastric aspirate has sensitivity 42%, specificity 91%, negative <b>predictive</b> value 64%, positive <b>predictive</b> value 92% and overall accuracy of 66% in differentiating upper GI bleeding from bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz. Thus, in this study a positive aspirate is more helpful than a negative aspirate. In a smaller study, Cuellar found a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 55%, somewhat opposite results from Witting.|$|E
25|$|Legal {{writing is}} of two, broad categories: (i) legal {{analysis}} and (ii) legal drafting. Legal analysis is two-fold: (1) <b>predictive</b> analysis, and (2) persuasive analysis. In the United States, in most law schools students must learn legal writing; the courses focus on: (1) <b>predictive</b> analysis, i.e., an outcome-predicting memorandum (positive or negative) {{of a given}} action for the attorney's client; and (2) persuasive analysis, e.g., motions and briefs. Although not as widely taught in law schools, legal drafting courses exist; other types of legal writing concentrate upon writing appeals or on interdisciplinary aspects of persuasion.|$|E
