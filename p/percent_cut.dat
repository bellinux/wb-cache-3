5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 <b>percent</b> <b>cut</b> of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors {{were willing to take}} a pay cut, but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead. At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent pay cut in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a pay cut of 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut. This included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saves money, as the animation of the show becomes more efficient.|$|E

This included the abolishment of some government monopolies and increased public investment. This and a second agreement were both cancelled by the mid-1980s, as the Somali army refused to accept a proposed 60 <b>percent</b> <b>cut</b> in military spending. New agreements were made with the Paris Club, the International Development Association and the IMF {{during the second half}} of the 1980s.

25|$|The State of Maryland {{granted the}} B a charter {{to build a}} line from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., in 1831, and the Washington Branch was opened in 1835. This line joined to the {{original}} mainline at Relay, Maryland, crossing the Patapsco on the Thomas Viaduct, which {{remains one of the}} B's signature structures. This line was partially funded by the state, and was operated separately until the 1870s, with the state taking a 25 <b>percent</b> <b>cut</b> of gross passenger receipts. This line was built in stone, much like the original mainline. By this time, however, strap rail was no longer used for new construction. Most of the stone bridges on the Old Main Line did not last long, being washed out by the periodic flooding of the Patapsco River and replaced at first by Bollman Truss bridges. The Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad to Annapolis connected to this line at Annapolis Junction in 1840. As an unwritten condition for the charter, it was understood that the state would not charter any competing line between Baltimore and Washington.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1928, Disney {{traveled}} to New York City in hopes of negotiating a more profitable contract with his producer Charles Mintz. But as economic problems were apparent at the time, Mintz figured Disney should settle for a 20 <b>percent</b> <b>cut,</b> although large turnarounds were promised if the studio's finances showed considerable growth. While most of his fellow animators left for Mintz's studio, Disney decided to quit and therefore leave the character he created. On his long train ride home, {{he came up with}} an idea to create another character, and retain rights to it. He and Iwerks would go on to develop a new cartoon in secret, starring a new character which would soon become the most successful and popular cartoon character in film history and later become the foundation of a global entertainment empire. The first Mickey Mouse cartoon to be filmed was Plane Crazy in the summer of 1928, but it was produced as a silent and held back from release. The first Mickey Mouse film with a synchronized soundtrack, Steamboat Willie, reached the screen that fall and became a major hit, eclipsing Oswald. Plane Crazy was later given its own synchronized soundtrack and released on May 15, 1928.|$|E

Oblivious to what the word means, Butters attends a pimp convention where he seeks advice from more-experienced pimps, including one called Keyshawn.

500|$|When Ettelson {{joined the}} congregation, it had 650 member families. To {{accommodate}} growth, in 1926 the synagogue built an annex for the children's religious school. That year the congregation also established the [...] "Temple Men's Club", which had over 200 members, {{and joined the}} National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods. In 1928, the congregation purchased an adjoining house south of the synagogue, for Junior Congregation meetings, and began broadcasting its Friday evening services on the radio. The costs for both endeavors were donated anonymously by synagogue member Abe Plough, founder and chairman of Schering-Plough. The synagogue was hard-hit by the Great Depression. Income from dues dropped from $47,000 in 1928 (today $) to $23,000 in 1932, and membership fell from 750 families in 1929 to as low as 629 families. The Talmud Torah was closed {{due to lack of}} funds, and board meetings focused on finding ways to keep the congregation going financially. Ettelson requested a pay reduction of $1,000 (today $) in 1931, and a further 10 <b>percent</b> <b>cut</b> in 1933, and the salaries of other synagogue employees were also cut. The Junior Congregation did well, though; it had 189 paid members by 1933, held Saturday morning and High Holy Days services, and conducted a number of other programs. The congregation eventually recovered as a whole, assisted by members who were leaders in the civic and business worlds. By 1936, membership had increased to 650, and the synagogue paid off the remaining mortgage on the Poplar and Montgomery synagogue building.|$|E

2500|$|Starting {{in early}} 2005, Cunningham was heavily courted by Lehigh Valley democrats {{to run for}} {{executive}} of Lehigh County. No Democrat had ever won the executive's office since the county's home rule charter {{went into effect in}} 1978, and Lehigh County Democratic Committee Chairman Charles F. Smith Jr. called Cunningham the party's [...] "dream candidate". Cunningham announced his candidacy for the position in March, and he formally resigned from the Rendell administration on April 8. He ran with no opposition in the Democratic primary, clearing the way for a challenge against Republican Executive Jane R. Ervin, who was seeking a second four-year term. During his campaign, Cunningham strongly criticized Ervin for a 69 percent county tax increase in 2003, calling it [...] "unconscionable" [...] declaring that a change in leadership was necessary. Cunningham raised other campaign issues as the election continued, including crime prevention, the cost of a planned courthouse expansion, and priorities in county construction projects. Ervin responded aggressively to Cunningham's campaign, raising questions about his record in Bethlehem and Rendell's administration and defending her tax increase as {{the right thing to do}} for the county. Cunningham defeated Ervin by a margin of 33,263 to 20,721, capturing 62 percent of the vote, becoming the first Democrat ever elected to the executive post. He had spent roughly $500,000 in the election. The county executive position paid $65,000 annually, a 41 <b>percent</b> <b>cut</b> from Cunningham's salary as a cabinet secretary.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, the United States Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{released}} a paper called [...] "Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 <b>Percent</b> <b>Cut</b> in Income Tax Rates'. This paper considered {{the impact of}} a stylized reduction of 10% in the then existing marginal rate of federal income tax in the US (for example, if those facing a 25% marginal federal income tax rate had it lowered to 22.5%). Unlike earlier research, the CBO paper estimates the budgetary impact of possible macroeconomic effects of tax policies, that is, it attempts to account for how reductions in individual income tax rates might affect the overall future growth of the economy, and therefore influence future government tax revenues; and ultimately, impact deficits or surpluses. In the paper's most generous estimated growth scenario, only 28% of the projected lost revenue from the lower tax rate would be recouped over a 10-year period after a 10% across-the-board reduction in all individual income tax rates. In other words, deficits would increase by nearly the same amount as the tax cut in the first five years, with limited feedback revenue thereafter. Through increased budget deficits, the tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy will be paid for—plus interest—by taxes borne relatively evenly by all taxpayers. The paper points out that these projected shortfalls in revenue would have to be made up by federal borrowing: the paper estimates that the federal government would pay an extra US$200 billion in interest over the decade covered by the paper's analysis.|$|E
