60|$|It was low, {{and covered}} with thick vegetation,--chiefly a kind of palm, that was new to me. From one point a thin white thread of vapour rose slantingly to an immense height, and then frayed out like a down feather. We were now within the embrace of a broad bay flanked on either hand by a low promontory. The beach was of dull-grey sand, and sloped steeply up to a ridge, perhaps sixty or seventy feet above the sea-level, and irregularly set with trees and undergrowth. Half way up was a square {{enclosure}} of some greyish stone, which I found subsequently was built partly of coral and partly of <b>pumiceous</b> <b>lava.</b> Two thatched roofs peeped from within this enclosure. A man stood awaiting us at the water's edge. I fancied while we were still far off that I saw some other and very grotesque-looking creatures scuttle into the bushes upon the slope; but I saw nothing of these as we drew nearer. This man was of a moderate size, and with a black negroid face. He had a large, almost lipless, mouth, extraordinary lank arms, long thin feet, and bow-legs, and stood with his heavy face thrust forward staring at us. He was dressed like Montgomery and his white-haired companion, in jacket and trousers of blue serge. As we came still nearer, this individual began to run to and fro on the beach, making the most grotesque movements.|$|E

40|$|Transitions between {{explosive}} and effusive {{phases of}} silicic volcanic eruptions have been related either to stratification of volatiles in the source magma body {{or to the}} loss of volatiles through the permeable host rock of the conduit. One way to distinguish between these two models is to map and analyze the vesicular and glassy textures found in silicic lava flows. In this paper we present textural observations and isotopic evidence from active and Recent silicic lava flows which show thaI at least some vesiculation occurs during surface advance of extrusions, after magma has reached the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. This view is in contrast to the widely promoted 2 ̆ 2 permeable foam 2 ̆ 2 model, which states that all volatiles escape during ascent of the magma, and that all dense glassy material in lava flows forms from the collapse of <b>pumiceous</b> <b>lava,</b> i. e., that silicic lavas emerge as highly inflated foam flows. Such interpretations which claim that silicic lavas are completely degassed upon extrusion, and that all degassing must take place on the time scale of the eruption, neglect several important pieces of evidence, including the presence of obsidian in extremely small domes, and of vesicular zones in the interiors of silicic flows; the copious loss of volatiles through eruption plumes between eruptive phases; and direct observations of surface vesiculation during growth of the Mount St. Helens lava dome. The permeable foam model also implies the unlikely requirement that explosive-to-effusive transitions be associated with an increase in eruption rate. We present a more comprehensive model for the emplacement of silicic extrusions that allows for early gas loss during ascent, as well as late-stage vesiculation. We then discuss how the redistribution of volatiles during surface flow can increase explosive hazards from silicic lavas days, weeks, or months after the lava emerges from the vent...|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} forms of vesicles. Most pumice {{contains}} tubular microvesicles that can impart a silky or fibrous fabric. The elongation of the microvesicles occurs due to ductile elongation in the volcanic conduit or, {{in the case of}} <b>pumiceous</b> <b>lavas,</b> during flow. The other form of vesicles are subspherical to spherical and result from high vapor pressure during eruption.|$|R
40|$|An {{eruption}} along a 2. 5 km-long rhyolitic dyke at Krafla volcano, northern Iceland {{during the}} last glacial period formed a ridge of obsidian (Hrafntinnuhryggur). The ridge rises up to 80 m above the surrounding land and is composed {{of a number of}} small-volume lava bodies with minor fragmental material. The total volume is < 0. 05 km 3. The lava bodies are flow- or dome-like in morphology and many display columnar-jointed sides typical of magma-ice interaction, quench-fragmented lower margins indicative of interaction with meltwater and pumiceous upper surfaces typical of subaerial obsidian flows. The fragmental material compromises poorly-sorted perlitic quench hyaloclastites and poorly-exposed <b>pumiceous</b> tuffs. <b>Lava</b> bodies on the western ridge flanks are columnar jointed and extensively hydrothermally altered. At {{the southern end of the}} ridge the feeder dyke is exposed at an elevation ~ 95 m beneath the ridge crest and flares upwards into a lava body. Using the distribution of lithofacies, we interpret that the eruption melted through ice only 35 - 55 m thick, which is likely to have been dominated by firn. Hrafntinnuhryggur is therefore the first documented example of a rhyolitic fissure eruption beneath thin ice/firn. The eruption breached the ice, leading to subaerial but ice/firn-contact lava effusion, and only minor explosive activity occurred. The ridge appears to have been well-drained during the eruption, aided by the high permeability of the thin ice/firn, which appears not to have greatly affected the eruption mechanisms. We estimate that the eruption lasted between 2 and 20 months and would not have generated a significant jökulhlaup (< 70 m 3 s- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Rhyolite eruptions often begin explosively {{and change}} into {{effusion}} of lava and the glasses of both contrasting eruptive deposits commonly have vesicle and water content heterogeneously distributed. The distribution of bubbles in magma and water content in silicic melt {{is thought to}} {{play a key role}} on the style and flow dynamics of volcanic eruptions, however the source of these heterogeneities remain unclear. The Mt. Pilato-Rocche Rosse sequences on the north-eastern corner of Lipari Island, Italy, represent an explosive-effusive eruptive event. The exceptionally preserved glasses on these deposits provide a rare opportunity to study processes associated with dewatering and flow dynamics of melts thought to be formed during the same explosive and effusive volcanic cycle. The Rocche Rosse lava is texturally heterogeneous, yet compositionally homogeneous, except in terms of water-content. The study reveals that the flow evolved dynamically during surface emplacement between obsidian and <b>pumiceous</b> <b>lava</b> locally, foaming into pumice, and degassing into obsidian as a function of variations in water content and dynamic pressures. Thus, the final and current textural configuration observed in silicic flows does not reflect a simple history of output from the conduit, but a complex history of dehydration of the magma in the conduit and during flow. This study shows for the first time evidence of water loss associated with melt fracturing during rhyolite explosive eruptions. Results indicate that dynamic pressure (P) and temperature (T) variations along faults probably play an important role during magma autobrecciation and that rising rhyolite magma can indeed degas while fracturing, prior to its welding and forming dense obsidian magma. It is proposed that pervasive fracturing is a potential degassing mechanism to defuse rhyolite explosive eruptions. Further studies on the deposits that from the Mt Pilato-Rocche Rosse sequences reveal that magma fracturing with consequent water loss and healing of the melt occurred repeatedly and pervasively, both during the explosive and the effusive silicic eruptions. Findings presented here indicate that increased permeability, due to syn-eruptive magma fracturing, leads to progressive magma dewatering and explains the formation of dense water-poor obsidian and the temporal evolution from explosive to effusive rhyolite eruptions. Analysis on the distribution of water content on the glass of the Rocche Rosse lava shows that glass from hinge zones at or near the surface of folded lava records water content values that imply significant viscosity variations over distances at the scale of 1 mm. Results also reveal that locally the values of water content are notably less than those predicted for surface pressures and, therefore, require sub-atmospheric pressures. It is proposed that these values are associated with a complex and varied history of dynamic pressures resulting from divergent and convergent flow of viscous magma. This process would be common to any flowing lava, and helps explain well-documented local variations in water content of silicic glass. The significant variation in viscosity resulting from water content variations would also trigger further flow perturbations that might reinforce in a positive feedback loop, further water fluctuations through variations in dynamic pressure, thus explaining the significant water-content variability...|$|E
