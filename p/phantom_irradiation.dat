40|$|Purpose: Boron {{neutron capture}} therapy (BNCT) is a {{promising}} technique {{for the treatment}} of malignant disease targeting organs of the human body. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to calculate optimum design parameters of an accelerator based beam shaping assembly (BSA) for BNCT of brain cancer setup. Methods: Epithermal beam of neutrons were obtained through moderation of fast neutrons from 3 H(p,n) reaction in a high density polyethylene moderator and a graphite reflector. The dimensions of the moderator and the reflector were optimized through optimization of epithermal / fast neutron intensity ratio as a function of geometric parameters of the setup. Results: The results of our calculation showed the capability of our setup to treat the tumor within 4 cm of the head surface. The calculated peak therapeutic ratio for the setup was found to be 2. 15.

40|$|Abstract-The {{concept of}} Health Physics {{dosimetry}} for external quantum radiation, as deve 10 ped in this paper, started from the basic {{assumption that the}} dose reading ofpersonnel dosimeters and area dosimeters shall indicate the radiation hazard to a person to the same extent.

Phantom measurements show to what extent the reading of personne 1 dosimeters deviates from the free-space determined area dose. The possibilities of realizing absorbed dose measurements in free space and in conjunction with a phantom will be discussed. The new concept of Health Physics dosimetry is characterized by absorbed dose quantity measurement and by different calibration of area dosimeter (free-space irradiation) and personnel dosimeter (<b>phantom</b> <b>irradiation).</b> Dosimeter systems are described which realize the agreement between dosimeter reading of area dosimeters and personne 1 dosimeters and therefore provide a reasonable interpretation of personne 1 dosimeter readings. jONES(4) with LiF dosimeters in a man-phantom show the amount of the dose actually absorbe...|$|E

IMRT treatment plans are recalculated for the <b>phantom</b> <b>irradiation</b> in QA. Phantoms are made in different geometrical shapes to measure the doses of different types of irradiation techniques. Comparison of measured and calculated dose distributions for IMRT can be made by using gamma analysis. In this study, 10 head-and-neck IMRT QA plans were created with Varian Eclipse 8. 9 treatment planning system.

40|$|Clinical {{implementation}} of novel advanced treatment techniques in adaptive radiation therapy requires proper workflow verification. However, this subject is not satisfactorily solved yet as current experimental validation techniques {{do not reflect}} the complexity of real patient treatments. In this thesis, several methods for patient-specific end-to-end tests were developed and applied to clinical workflows especially including treatments of moving tumors. End-to-end-tests were performed with geometrically well-defined phantoms as well as with an anthropomorphic dynamic ex-vivo porcine lung phantom in combination with a 3 -dimensional (3 D) polymer gel dosimeter (PGD). Different experimental settings of increasing complexity were tested in terms of (i) accuracy, (ii) feasibility of clinical workflows testing, (iii) validation of clinical concepts for motion-compensated treatments, (iv) additional integration of real-time markerless fluoroscopic imaging, and (v) validation of 4 D dose calculation algorithms. <b>Phantom</b> <b>irradiations</b> were performed under static and dynamic conditions with and without beam gating. PGD evaluation revealed good tumor coverage for all treatment concepts and beam gating significantly reduced normal tissue exposure.

The treatment plan was 4500 cGy to the rectum over 25 fractions with 15 MV photon beams. All beams avoided the pump and leads. The response to electromagnetic interference (EMI) was evaluated by observing a duplicate driver in the treatment configuration as the patient’s fields were delivered to a solid water equivalent phantom. Pretreatment dose assessment included calculations with Pinnacle treatment planning system, AAPM TG 36 data analysis, and MOSFET measurements {{on the surface of}} the driver during the <b>phantom</b> <b>irradiation.</b> During the first patient treatment, MOSFETs were placed on the pump and leads, approximately 1 cm from the left lateral treatment portal. No additional shielding was applied to the VAD. EMI was absent and the VAD operated normally during the pretreatment test and throughout the treatment course. Radiation to the driver was too low to be detected by the MOSFETS. Cumulative dose estimates to the pump were 425 cGy to 0. 1 cc (DVH), 368 cGy (TG 36), and 158. 5 cGy (MOSFET). MOSFET readings to the leads were 70. 5 cGy. External beam radiation treatment was safely delivered to a VAD dependent patient. The VAD exhibited no adverse response to EMI and doses up to 425 cGy.

40|$|The use of {{stereotactic}} body {{radiation therapy}} (SBRT) for lung treatments is very popu-lar in radiotherapy clinics. This {{is because of}} its better results {{compared to the other}} treatments. The development of flattening filter free (FFF) beams has given a new per-spective to this treatment. In this thesis, the commissioning of SBRT FFF beam for cen-tral lung treatment was aimed. Two spherical volumes of diameter 3 cm (PTV 3) and 6 cm (PTV 6) representing the planning target volumes were created within the central lung area in Alderson phantom. The dose plan for the treatment was done for 6 MV FFF photon beam using stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and dose fractions of 4 Gy, 7. 5 Gy, 11 Gy and 18 Gy. Dose distribution calculations were performed in Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Radiation Ther-apy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol was utilized to obtain the required dose confor-mity within the target. Dose plan verification was done by ionization chamber matrix detector (in two different setups: combined with the cubic solid water phantom and mounted in the gantry) and radiochromic film inserted within the cubic solid water <b>phantom.</b> <b>Irradiation</b> was done with Varian TrueBeam STx linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Results of dose conformity were checked using dose-volume histograms (DVH) and were in accordance with the RTOG protocol. Moreover, measured and calculated dose distribution data were compared using gamma analysis with the acceptance criteria of 3 %, 3 mm. According to the suggested criteria (less than 5 %) of technical reports se-ries (TRS) 398, the general average values of the disagreement between measured and calculated data obtained from the ion chamber matrix detector for PTV 6 were within the required limits, 4. 2 % for both of the detector setups. However, {{this was not the case}} for PTV 3 because the general average values were 6. 2 % and 6. 5 % for each of the de-tector setups. Main reasons for these unacceptable results were mostly due to the small field sizes and poor resolution of the matrix detector. Film measurements showed very satisfactory results regarding the shape of the measured dose profile compared to the calculated one. The only problem with film results was the unacceptable absolute dose difference between these two dose profiles, approximately 10 %, which most likely was due to inaccuracies from film calibration or post processing. Based on those results, it was concluded that the commissioning of the 6 MV FFF pho-ton beam for SBRT lung treatment was partly successful. Before its clinical application, further studies are needed related to the mentioned dosimetric uncertainties...|$|E

At the Radiation Plant of the Vinča Institute of Nuclear Sciences we compared two recommended protocols of irradiation procedures in the calibration of dosimetry systems in radiation processing: (1) by irradiation of routine dosimeters (ethanol-chlorobenzene - ECB) at the calibration laboratory and (2), by in-plant calibration with alanine transfer - dosimeters. The critical point for in-plant calibration is irradiation geometry, so we carefully positioned the phantom carrying both dosimeters in order to minimize dose gradients across the sample. The analysis of results obtained showed that the difference among determined absorbed doses for the construction of calibration curves between these two methods, (alanine vs. ECB), is less than 1 %. The difference in combined standard uncertainty for each calibration procedure is 0. 1 %.

In preparation for such a trial, the cooperative group prepares a protocol to define {{the goals of the}} trial, the rationale for its design, and the details of the treatment procedure to be followed. The Radiological Physics Center (RPC) is one of several QA offices that is is charged with assuring that participating institutions deliver doses that are clinically consistent and comparable. The RPC does this by conducting a variety of independent audits and credentialing processes.

(Glenwood, Ill.) measuring 10 x 10 x 2 mm 3. A square, 20 (L) x 20 (W) x 0. 5 (H) cm 3 piece of solid water was fabricated with pockets to allow OSLDs and TLDs to be irradiated simultaneously and perpendicular to the beam. Irradiations were performed at 5 cm depth in photons, {{and in the center}} of a 10 cm SOBP in a 200 MeV proton beam. Additionally, the Radiological Physics Center’s anthropomorphic pelvic phantom was used to test the angular dependence of OSLDs in photons and protons. A cylindrical insert in the phantom allows the dosimeters to be rotated to any angle with a fixed gantry angle. OSLDs were irradiated at 12 angles between 0 and 360 degrees. The OSLDs were read out with a MicroStar reader from Landauer, Inc. Dose response indicates that at angles where the dosimeter is near parallel with the radiation beam response is reduced slightly. Measurements in proton beams do not show significant angular dependence. Post-irradiation fading of OSLDs was studied in proton beams to determine if the fading was different than that of photons. The fading results showed no significant difference from results in photon beams. OSLDs and TLDs are comparable within 3 % in photon beams and a correction factor can be posited for proton beams. With angular dependence characteristics defined, OSLDs can be implemented into multiple-field treatment plans in photons and protons and used in the RPC’s quality assurance program...|$|R

40|$|The Radiological Physics Center (RPC) uses both on-site {{and remote}} reviews to {{credential}} institutions {{for participation in}} clinical trials. Anthropomorphic quality assurance (QA) phantoms are one tool the RPC uses to remotely audit institutions, which include thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and radiochromic film. The RPC desires to switch from TLD as the absolute dosimeter in the phantoms, to optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters (OSLDs), but a problem lies in the angular dependence exhibited by the OSLD. The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize the angular dependence of OSLD and establish a correction factor if necessary, to provide accurate dosimetric measurements as a replacement for TLD in the QA phantoms. A 10 cm diameter high-impact polystyrene spherical phantom was designed and constructed to hold an OSLD to study the angular response of the dosimeter under the simplest of circumstances for both coplanar and non-coplanar treatment deliveries. OSLD were irradiated in the spherical phantom, and the responses of the dosimeter from edge-on angles were normalized to the response when irradiated with the beam incident normally on the surface of the dosimeter. The average normalized response was used to establish an angular correction factor for 6 MV and 18 coplanar treatments, and for 6 MV non-coplanar treatments specific to CyberKnife. The RPC pelvic phantom dosimetry insert was modified to hold OSLD, in addition to the TLD, adjacent to the planes of film. Treatment plans of increasing angular beam delivery were developed, three in Pinnacle v 9. 0 (4 -field box, IMRT, and VMAT) and one in Accuray’s MultiPlan v 3. 5. 3 (CyberKnife). The plans were delivered to the pelvic phantom containing both TLD and OSLD in the target volume. The pelvic phantom was also sent to two institutions to be irradiated as trials, one delivering IMRT, and the other a CyberKnife treatment. For the IMRT deliveries and the two institution trials, the phantom also included film in the sagittal and coronal planes. The doses measured from the TLD and OSLD were calculated for each irradiation, and the angular correction factors established from the spherical <b>phantom</b> <b>irradiations</b> were applied to the OSLD dose. The ratio of the TLD dose to the angular corrected OSLD dose was calculated for each irradiation. The corrected OSLD dose was found to be within 1 % of the TLD measured dose for all irradiations, with the exception of the in-house CyberKnife deliveries. The films were normalized to both TLD measured dose and the corrected OSLD dose. Dose profiles were obtained and gamma analysis was performed using a 7 %/ 4 mm criteria, to compare the ability of the OSLD, when corrected for the angular dependence, to provide equivalent results to TLD. The results of this study indicate that the OSLD can effectively be used as a replacement for TLD in the RPC’s anthropomorphic QA phantoms for coplanar treatment deliveries when a correction is applied for the dosimeter’s angular dependence...|$|R

An increase of slow protons (20 < y < 110 keV. mum(- 1)) and a decrease of fact protons (2 < y < 20 keV. mum(- 1)) was seen for irradiation outside the direct beam. During moving beam irradiation, different positions on the same isodose curves (55 % or 35 %) showed differences in (y) over bar (D) of up to 5 %. Variations in the quality parameter.

40|$|PURPOSE: Various {{tools are}} {{currently}} available for dose reconstruction in individuals after accidental exposure to ionizing radiation. Among the available biological analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and biophysical methods, such as {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR), the latter has proved its usefulness for retrospective dosimetry. Although EPR spectroscopy {{is probably the most}} sensitive technique, it does not provide spatial dosimetric data. This information is, however, highly desirable when steep dose gradient irradiations are involved. The purpose of this work was to explore the possibilities of EPR imaging (EPRI) for spatial dose reconstruction in irradiated biological material. METHODS: X-band EPRI was used to reconstruct ex vivo the relative dose distribution in human bone samples and hydroxyapatite <b>phantoms</b> after <b>irradiation</b> with brachytherapy seeds or x rays. Three situations were investigated: Homogeneous, stepwise gradient, and continuous gradient irradiation. RESULTS: EPRI gave a faithful relative spin density distribution in bone samples and in hydroxyapatite phantoms. Measured dose ratios were in close agreement with the actual delivered dose ratios. EPRI was able to distinguish the dose gradients induced by two different sources (125 I and 192 Ir). However, the measured spatial resolution of the system was 1. 9 mm and this appeared to be a limiting factor. The method could be improved by using new signal postprocessing strategies. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that EPRI can be used to assess the regional relative dose distribution in irradiated bone samples. The method is currently applicable to ex vivo measurements of small size samples with low variation in tissue density but is likely to be adapted for in vivo application using L-band EPRI...|$|R

Methods and Materials: A set of 20 TLDs was used for this study. An Oven type PCL 3 was used to anneal the TLDs. The response of the TLDs was read using the Reader type LTM manufactured by Harshaw Bicron, United State of America. Vacuum tweezers were used to transfer the TLDs at the time of measurements and calibration. TLDs were kept in a subdued ultra-violet environment between the annealing and irradiation process.

The base of {{the cone}} is either 2 or 3 cm diameter. They are intended to treat skin lesions, being the typical prescription depth 3 mm. In patients with eyelid lesions, an internal shielding is very useful to reduce the dose to the ocular globe. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the dose enhancement from potential backscatter and electron contamination due to the shielding. Material and methods: Two methods were used: a) Monte Carlo simulation, performed with the GEANT 4 code, 2 cm Valencia applicator {{was placed on the}} surface of a water phantom in which 2 mm lead slab was located at 3 mm depth; b) radiochromic EBT films, used to verify the Monte Carlo results, positioning the films at 1. 5, 3, 5 and 7 mm depth, inside the <b>phantom.</b> Two <b>irradiations,</b> with and without the lead shielding slab, were carried out. Results: The Monte Carlo results showed that due to the backscatter component from the lead, the dose level raised to about 200 % with a depth range of 0. 5 mm. Under the lead the dose level was enhanced to about 130 % with a depth range of 1 mm. Two millimeters of lead reduce the dose under the slab with about 60 %. These results agree with film measurements within uncertainties. Conclusions: In conclusion, the use of 2 mm internal lead shielding in eyelid skin treatments with the Valencia applicators were evaluated using MC methods and EBT film dosimetry. The minimum bolus thickness that was needed above and below the shielding was 0. 5 mm and 1 mm respectively, and the shielding reduced the absorbed dose delivered to the ocular globe by about 60 %...|$|R

40|$|Heavy-ions beams offer several {{advantages}} {{compared to other}} radiation such as low lateral scattering and high biological effectiveness (RBE) in the Bragg peak region, making them particularly attractive {{for the treatment of}} radio-resistant tumours localized close to organs at risk [1]. The extension of ion therapy to new clinical cases requires the exploitation of a dedicated treatment planning system (TPS) based on the existing version of TRiP 98 [2, 3], established TPS for carbon ions. The theoretical models and experimental databases included in TRiP 98 are presently mainly based on measurements in water. This approximation can be applied successfully to reproduce many biological tissues with the exception of bones, where the presence of heavy elements, like calcium, might change significantly the composition of the resulting mixed radiation field. Presently, the TriP 98 physical beam model takes into account for the bone only its density variation, but it neglects difference between bones and water in attenuation of the primary and production of secondary particles through nuclear fragmentation. However, a detailed knowledge of the particle field at each point of the treatment area is crucial for an accurate estimate of the actual dose. A previous study [4] investigated the influence of different types of bone on the carbon particles range. In the present work we aim at understanding the influence of medium inhomogeneities on the 12 C beam dose distribution. For the experiment, a bone target was placed inside a water <b>phantom.</b> The <b>irradiation</b> of the target volume positioned partially behind the bone target and partially directly in water was simulated with TRiP 98 and the dose at the interface measured at several depths along the primary beam direction.

The rapid evolution of MRT towards clinical trials demands accurate treatment planning systems (TPS), {{as well as}} independent tools for the verification of TPS calculated dose distributions {{in order to ensure}} patient safety and treatment efficacy. Monte Carlo computer simulation represents the most accurate method of dose calculation in patient geometries and is best suited for the purpose of TPS verification. A Monte Carlo model of the ID 17 biomedical beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility has been developed, including recent modifications, using the Geant 4 Monte Carlo toolkit interfaced with the SHADOW X-ray optics and ray-tracing libraries. The code was benchmarked by simulating dose profiles in water-equivalent <b>phantoms</b> subject to <b>irradiation</b> by broad-beam (without spatial fractionation) and microbeam (with spatial fractionation) fields, and comparing against those calculated with a previous model of the beamline developed using the PENELOPE code. Validation against additional experimental dose profiles in water-equivalent phantoms subject to broad-beam irradiation was also performed. Good agreement between codes was observed, with the exception of out-of-field doses and toward the field edge for larger field sizes. Microbeam results showed good agreement between both codes and experimental results within uncertainties. Results of the experimental validation showed agreement for different beamline configurations. The asymmetry in the out-of-field dose profiles due to polarization effects was also investigated, yielding important information for the treatment planning process in MRT. This work represents an important step {{in the development of a}} Monte Carlo-based independent verification tool for treatment planning in MRT...|$|R

Written consent for participation in the study was obtained from all the subjects voluntarily. A total of 3 healthy donors, 1 male and 2 female between the age of 21 and 55  years old participated in this study. On the day of blood irradiation, informed consent was obtained from the volunteers. Prior to phlebotomy, a single certified radiation physicist programmed the Varian 21 EX (3100 Hansen Way, Palo Alto, CA 94306) at the following settings.: 20  MeV, 20 cone, and the following Monitor Unit (MU): 212, 414 and 636 MU for 2, 4 and 6  Gy. The blood <b>irradiation</b> <b>phantom</b> was put {{in the center of the}} table and raised to 100  cm source to surface distance (SSD). Samples containing 4  ml of peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers in glass vacutainer tubes (12.35  mg Sodium Citrate, 2.21  mg Citric Acid) (VWR International, Pittsburg, PA). The vacutainers were transported by batches of 5 for irradiation. The blood was exposed to 0, 2, 4 and 6  Gy X-rays using the Varian 21 EX LINAC. After irradiation, blood samples were diluted 1 : 1 with RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and incubated for 6, 24 and 48  hours at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5 % CO 2. After the indicated exposure times, the sample tubes were removed from the incubator and set up in a sterile field. The blood samples were aliquoted in 2  ml Eppendorf tubes and an equal volume of CLPA reaction buffer was added (1 : 1). The samples were stored at 4 °C.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper focuses on numerically investigating the thermal response of gold nanoshells-embedded biological tissue phantoms with potential applications into photo-thermal therapy wherein the interest is in destroying the cancerous cells with minimum damage to the surrounding healthy cells. The tissue phantom has been irradiated with a pico-second laser. Radiative transfer equation (RTE) has been employed to model the light-tissue interaction using discrete ordinate method (DOM). For determining the temperature distribution inside the tissue phantom, the RTE has been solved in combination with a generalized non-Fourier heat conduction model namely the dual phase lag bio-heat transfer model. The numerical code comprising the coupled RTE-bio-heat transfer equation, developed {{as a part of the}} current work, has been benchmarked against the experimental as well as the numerical results available in the literature. It has been demonstrated that the temperature of the optical inhomogeneity inside the biological tissue phantom embedded with gold nanoshells is relatively higher than that of the baseline case (no nanoshells) for the same laser power and operation time. The study clearly underlines the impact of nanoshell concentration and its size on the thermal response of the biological tissue sample. The comparative study concerned with the size and concentration of nanoshells showed that 60 nm nanoshells with concentration of 5 x 10 (15) mm(- 3) result into the temperature levels that are optimum for the irreversible destruction of cancer infected cells in the context of photo-thermal therapy. To. the best of the knowledge of the authors, the present study is one of the first attempts to quantify the influence of gold nanoshells on the temperature distributions inside the biological tissue <b>phantoms</b> upon laser <b>irradiation</b> using the dual phase lag heat conduction model.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to use NASA {{radiation}} transport codes to compare astronaut organ dose equivalents resulting from solar particle events (SPE), geomagnetically trapped protons, and free-space galactic cosmic rays (GCR) using phantom models representing Earth-based and microgravity-based anthropometry and positioning. Methods: The Univer sity of Florida hybrid adult phantoms were scaled to represent male and female astronauts with 5 th, 50 th, and 95 th percentile heights and weights as measured on Earth. Another set of scaled phantoms, incorporating microgravity-induced changes, such as spinal lengthening, leg volume loss, and the assumption of the neutral body position, was also created. A ray-tracer was created and used to generate body self-shielding distributions for dose points within a voxelized <b>phantom</b> under isotropic <b>irradiation</b> conditions, which closely approximates the free-space radiation environment. Simplified external shielding consisting of an aluminum spherical shell was used to consider the influence of a spacesuit or shielding of a hull. These distributions were combined with depth dose distributions generated from the NASA radiation transport codes BRYNTRN (SPE and trapped protons) and HZETRN (GCR) to yield dose equivalent. Many points were sampled per organ. Results: The organ dos e equivalent rates were on the order of 1. 5 - 2. 5 mSv per day for GCR (1977 solar minimum) and 0. 4 - 0. 8 mSv per day for trapped proton irradiation with shielding of 2 g cm- 2 aluminum equivalent. The organ dose equivalents for SPE irradiation varied considerably, with the skin and eye lens having the highest organ dose equivalents and deep-seated organs, such as the bladder, liver, and stomach having the lowest. Conclus ions: The greatest differences between the Earth-based and microgravity-based phantoms are observed for smaller ray thicknesses, since the most drastic changes involved limb repositioning and not overall phantom size. Improved self-shielding models reduce the overall uncertainty in organ dosimetry for mission-risk projections and assessments for astronaut...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Nowadays {{radiosensitive}} polymer gels {{are used}} as a reliable dosimetry tool for verification of 3 D dose distributions. Special characteristics of these dosimeters have made them useful for verification of complex dose distributions in clinical situations. The aim of this work was to evaluate the capability of a normoxic polymer gel to determine electron dose distributions in different slab phantoms in presence of small heterogeneities. Materials and Methods: Different cylindrical phantoms consisting gel were used under slab <b>phantoms</b> during each <b>irradiation.</b> MR images of irradiated gel phantoms were obtained to determine their R 2 relaxation maps. 1 D and 2 D lateral dose profiles were acquired at depths of 1 cm for an 8 MeV beam and 1 and 4 cm for the 15 MeV energy, and then compared with the lateral dose profiles measured using a diode detector. In addition, 3 D dose distributions around these heterogeneities for the same energies and depths were measured using a gel dosimeter. Results: Dose resolution for MR gel images at the range of 0 - 10 Gy was less than 1. 55 Gy. Mean dose difference and distance to agreement (DTA) for dose profiles were 2. 6 % and 2. 2 mm, respectively. The results of the MAGIC-type polymer gel for bone heterogeneity at 8 MeV showed a reduction in dose of approximately 50 %, and 30 % and 10 % at depths 1 and 4 cm at 15 MeV. However, for air heterogeneity increases in dose of approximately 50 % at depth 1 cm under the heterogeneity at 8 MeV and 20 % and 45 % respectively at 15 MeV were observed. Discussion and Conclusion: Generally, electron beam distributions are significantly altered {{in the presence of}} tissue inhomogeneities such as bone and air cavities, this being related to mass stopping and mass scattering powers of heterogeneous materials. At the same time, hot and cold scatter lobes under heterogeneity regions due to scatter edge effects were also seen. However, these effects (increased dose, reduced dose, hot and cold spots) at deeper depths, are compensated with the contributions of scattered electrons. Our study showed that normoxic polymer gels are reliable detectors for determination of electron dose distributions due to their characteristics such as tissue equivalence, energy independence, and 2 D and 3 D dose visualization capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Normal 0 21 false false false ES X-NONE X-NONE The {{induction}} {{of secondary}} cancer {{as a consequence}} of the radiotherapy treatment is an issue of concern nowadays. This fact makes relevant to consider all the dose delivered to the patient and, thus, it is necessary to include the peripheral dose. In this work we focused on the neutron radiation generated by high energy (i. e. ≥ 10 MV) photon radiotherapy beams given that the accurate determination of the neutron equivalent doses is still a challenging task in radiotherapy. This situation is responsible of the fact that, in the implementation of modern techniques (such as intensity modulated radiotherapy), a blind choice has to be done between low energies (i. e., 6 MV) (with no neutrons but throwing away the potential benefit of better conformality) and high energies (with the subsequent secondary cancer risk associated to neutrons). The aim of this work was to develop a model for the estimation in real time of neutron equivalent doses and propose a methodology to include the effect of this neutron contamination (through the associated secondary cancer risk or probability) in the evaluation of the radiotherapy treatment success by means of an integral radiobiological approach. The neutron equivalent dose model is based on the correlation between the readings of a new digital detector, which allows a real time measurement of the neutron production inside the treatment room, and the equivalent doses inside an anthropomorphic <b>phantom</b> for several <b>irradiation</b> conditions. This correlation model has been further extended to estimate neutron equivalent dose at specific organs in patients. Using current risk model from international organisms, estimation of the secondary cancer risk due to neutrons has been performed. The methodology was applied to 1377 patients in a total of 50 different facilities. Those measurements covered 15 different combinations of linac manufacturer and nominal energy. A data base has been generated with such information. The main result is that equivalent dose and secondary cancer probability scale with the number of monitor units (MU). Thus, a procedure has been established in order to makes estimates of both magnitudes from the number of MU of any treatment. This enables a quick estimation of cancer risk during treatment planning. The selection of the best radiotherapy treatment strategy is starting to routinely involve the evaluation of dose distributions in terms of the radiobiological response of tissues through the application of tumour control and normal tissue complication probabilities functions. In this work, it is proposed that secondary cancer probability can be included as an extra complication term. Thus, a new function, termed Uncomplicated and Cancer-Free tumour Control Probability has been defined representing a biologic objective function which estimates the probability to achieve complication-free tumour control, without cancer induction. This function was applied to a selected prostate case planned with all available radiotherapy treatment strategies. The results of this analysis showed that the better sparing capabilities of modern techniques can compensate the higher neutron production of high energies by means of efficient use of MU. Thus, neutron collateral effect might not represent an “a priori” limiting factor in the selection of the strategy. However, it is mandatory to perform a complete evaluation of the plan taking into account both types of complications and a clinical judgement taking into account other factors such as illness prognosis and, consequently, life expectancy. /* Style Definitions */ table.
