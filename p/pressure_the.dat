5000|$|For example, if the {{temperature}} in the evaporator increases, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> in <b>the</b> diaphragm increases causing the needle to lower.

Since <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> before <b>the</b> valve is higher than <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> after <b>the</b> valve, the working fluid naturally flows into <b>the</b> evaporator. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> at <b>the</b> inlet of the evaporator acts on the diaphragm.

Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing <b>pressure</b> <b>the</b> Allies were placing on Sweden to end their neutral stance.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of thermal {{expansion}} valves: internally or externally equalized. The difference between externally and internally equalized valves is how <b>the</b> evaporator <b>pressure</b> affects <b>the</b> position of the needle.
