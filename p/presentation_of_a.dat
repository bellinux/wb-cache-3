5|$|Critics {{generally}} praised The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill for Hill's <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman's view on {{life and}} love, {{along with her}} artistic range. New Ark, however, felt Hill and her record label did not properly credit the group on the album; {{a lawsuit filed by}} the group was settled out of court in 2001. Since the record's release, it has been ranked in numerous best-album lists, with a number of critics regarding it {{as one of the greatest}} albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2015, it was included by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry.|$|E
5|$|In the {{classical}} <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> three-set Venn diagram as three overlapping circles, the central region (representing elements belonging {{to all three}} sets) takes {{the shape of a}} Reuleaux triangle. The same three circles form one of the standard drawings of the Borromean rings, three mutually linked rings that cannot, however, be realized as geometric circles. Parts of these same circles are used to form the triquetra, a figure of three overlapping semicircles (each two of which form a vesica piscis symbol) that again has a Reuleaux triangle at its center; just as the three circles of the Venn diagram may be interlaced to form the Borromean rings, the three circular arcs of the triquetra may be interlaced to form a trefoil knot.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people who}} develop SCSFLS feel the sudden onset of a severe and acute {{headache}}. It is a headache usually {{made worse by}} standing, typically becoming prominent throughout the day, with the pain becoming less severe when lying down. Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling {{to the point of}} incapacitation. Some patients with SCSFLS will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon. This is known as second-half-of-the-day headache. This may be an initial <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{scholarships}} {{are available}} at both 11+ and 13+ for music, academic achievement, and one for art at thirteen. Music and academic scholarships range in value between 5%–20% with one Kings Scholarship available for a 20% reduction in fees. These scholarships are awarded based on performance in subject specific exams or performances, and {{an interview with the}} headmaster for academic or music scholarships, or the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> portfolio of work for the art scholarship. Until the start of the 2009/2010 academic year, the value of scholarships was substantially higher with the King's Scholarships worth 50% of the fees and a range of lower scholarships between 10–30%.|$|E

Benefits are priority reservations wait-listing, airport stand-by and check-in and baggage handling; an additional checked luggage allowance of 20kg (or one extra piece, where the piece rule applies), and access to designated Star Alliance Gold lounges the day and place of departure with the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Star Alliance boarding pass. Some airlines also offer preferred seating (an exit seat or a special section of the plane); guaranteed seating on fully booked flights, subject to the booking class code and notice period, and free upgrades {{in the form of a}} voucher, certificate or automatic upgrade at check-in. United restricts US lounge access for their Gold Members to long-haul international passengers; Gold members from other carriers are welcome in US lounges run by United on all itineraries.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} work to {{represent}} this new orthography was Elihu Doty's Anglo-Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect, published in 1853. The manual {{can therefore be}} regarded as the first <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pre-modern POJ, a significant step onwards from Medhurst's orthography and different from today's system in only a few details. From this point on various authors adjusted some of the consonants and vowels, but the system of tone marks from Doty's Manual survives intact in modern POJ. John Van Nest Talmage has traditionally been regarded as the founder of POJ among the community which uses the orthography, although it now seems that he was an early promoter of the system, rather than its inventor.|$|E
40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} the impact <b>of</b> the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> undesirable group member on group stereotype judgments among participants {{with varying degrees}} of ingroup identification. In Study 1 (N = 67), identification was associated with stereotype change following <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> undesirable, but not a desirable, ingroup member. This relationship was mediated by evaluations of the undesirable ingroup member: the stronger the identification, the more negative the evaluation, and the greater the shift towards a more positive ingroup stereotype. In Study 2 (N = 180), identification was positively associated with ingroup stereotype ratings following <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> undesirable ingroup member but was negatively associated with outgroup ratings following <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> undesirable outgroup member. As in Study 1, the association between ingroup identification and ingroup stereotype ratings was mediated by evaluations of the undesirable ingroup member. Results are discussed in relation to the black sheep effect and identity maintenance strategies...|$|R

5|$|When {{the book}} edition of The Vicar of Bullhampton {{appeared}} in April 1870, it bore a preface; Trollope, who ordinarily scorned prefaces and dedications, {{felt compelled to}} justify the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> character like Carry Brattle. He reiterated the points he had made regarding Formosa: that while depicting a fallen woman as glamourous or noble might lead impressionable readers to vice, a true depiction of such a woman's misery might deter readers from yielding to temptation; and might soften the hearts of parents whose daughters have fallen, and thus afford an opportunity of returning to decency.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} {{purpose of the}} bombing campaign in Malaya was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving {{them out of their}} bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops. Operation Kingly Pile, which involved two sorties by No.1 Squadron and one by English Electric Canberra jet bombers of No.12 Squadron RAF on 21February 1956, was considered the most successful of the more than 4,000 missions conducted by the Lincolns, killing at least 14 communist troops. By the time it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, the squadron had dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs—85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency. Its service was recognised with the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Squadron Standard by the Commander-in-Chief Far East Air Force, Air Marshal The Earl of Brandon. Until 2014, the Malayan Emergency had marked the last occasion that the unit took part in combat operations.|$|E
5|$|As more {{information}} about 's notoriety among neighbors surfaced, focus of investigation shifted towards {{the circumstances under which}} he gained and retained gun license and firearms. In order to be granted a gun license in the Czech Republic, a person must pass a qualification exam, receive a health clearance by a general practitioner, who may require a further examination by a specialist, such as a psychological or psychiatric evaluation, and must pass a background check. According to Section 23 of the Czech Firearms Act, an applicant may not be granted a license if he has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in the previous three years. Similarly, the law further makes gun license unaccessible to people with mental illnesses. The license must be renewed every five years (every ten years for licenses issued after 1 July 2014). The renewal requires the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new health clearance, while the police conduct a new background check. 's license was renewed in January 2015.|$|E

5|$|From 1936 on, several admirers {{tried unsuccessfully}} to persuade Sorabji to record Opus clavicembalisticum. Given that Sorabji had not {{recorded}} any of his works, and {{that none of them}} had been published since 1931, his friends and admirers began {{to be concerned about the}} fate of his output. The most ambitious attempt to ensure the preservation of his music and writings was initiated by Frank Holliday (1912–1997), who met Sorabji in 1937 and was his closest friend for about four decades. In the early 1950s Holliday organised the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> letter inviting Sorabji to make recordings of his own music. Sorabji received the letter in 1953, but made no recordings then, in spite of the enclosed cheque for 121 guineas (just over £127). Holliday's perseverance and closeness to Sorabji did, however, eventually change Sorabji's attitude, and several recordings were made in Sorabji's house between 1962 and 1968. Holliday also helped with the WNCN broadcast of Sorabji's music in 1970 (which took place without Sorabji's consent). Their friendship ended in 1979 as a result of disagreements about some of Sorabji's decisions.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Wizards {{began an}} {{association}} with The Beanstalk Group, a brand licensing agency and consultancy, to license the Magic brand. After {{the success of}} Magic, Wizards published RoboRally in 1994, and it soon won the 1994 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game and Best Graphic <b>Presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Board Game. Wizards also expanded its role-playing game line by buying SLA Industries from Nightfall Games and Ars Magica from White Wolf, Inc. in 1994. In 1995, Wizards published another card game by Richard Garfield, The Great Dalmuti, which won the 1995 Best New Mind Game award from Mensa. In August 1995, Wizards released Everway and then four months later closed its roleplaying game product line. Peter Adkison explained {{that the company was}} doing a disservice to the games with lack of support and had lost money on all of Wizards' roleplaying game products. Also in 1995, Wizards' annual sales passed US$65million.|$|E
5|$|In recent times, local bodies {{such as the}} {{municipality}} of Castellar del Riu or Berga or the local branch of the Catalan National Assembly, have adopted the practice of presenting a young three-branched pine tree or sapling {{claimed to be a}} descendant of Pi de les Tres Branques to other bodies, as symbols of solidarity. Early examples include presentations to the Castle of Gallifa in 1986, and the Castle of St. Ferran in Berga in 1992 (along with a sapling of the Tree of Guernica). The practice gained momentum following the February 2014 <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young tree to the town of Folgueroles, to commemorate Jacint Verdaguer who was born there; that tree has since been vandalised. Subsequent 2014 recipients have included Andorra la Vella, Sant Hipòlit de Voltregà, and Saldes.
