50|$|Cover, <b>Water</b> <b>Canteen</b> - The group {{rejected}} the test item and retained the M-1967 nylon <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover modified by stiffening the closing flaps {{so that they}} would not collapse and interfere with the insertion of the water canteen; to enlarge the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover somewhat for easier insertion and extraction of the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cup; to add a reinforcement band {{to the inside of the}} <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover to help prevent the lip of the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cup from rubbing through; and add a grommet drain hole in the bottom. As requested by the NCO Board, the test cover was made without a pile liner, whose purpose was to provide evaporative cooling, and with openings in the bottom to provide better drainage and to make extraction of the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cup easier. However, the test indicated that the pile liner added shape to the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover and kept it from collapsing completely when empty, making insertion of the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cup much easier. The tests also determined that the openings in the bottom constituted a camouflage hazard as the metal of the <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cup bottom was exposed.|$|R

The lid of this small pocket is secured by means of hook and pile fastener tape. The cover attaches to the individual equipment belt by means of two belt-strap keepers with interlocking slides. The <b>water</b> <b>canteen</b> cover is designed to accommodate the <b>Canteen,</b> <b>Water</b> (NSN 8465-00-889-3477).

Contestants are often sent to Exile Island for one or both of these strategic reasons.|$|R
