40|$|Although {{the initial}} {{euphoria}} about Internet-enabled reverse auctions {{has given way}} to a cautious but widespread use of reverse auctions in business-to-business (B 2 B) procurement, there is a limited understanding of the effect of auction design parameters on buyer surplus. In this paper, we study the effect of bidding competition, information asymmetry, reserve price, bid decrement, auction duration, and bidder type on buyer surplus. We collected field data on more than 700 online procurement auctions conducted by a leading auctioneer and involving <b>procurement</b> <b>items</b> worth millions of dollars. Consistent with the predictions of auction theory, the results indicate that bidding competition, reserve price, and information sharing affect buyer surplus. Unlike previous findings in the consumerto-consumer context, we find that bid decrement and auction duration have no effect in B 2 B procurement auctions. Our results suggest that use of the rank-bidding format increases buyer surplus when incumbent suppliers participate in the auction. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings for future research and for optimal design of online procurement auctions.

40|$|The {{design-build}} (DB) {{project delivery}} system (PDS) {{has been widely}} applied and studied in the construction industry. Its advantages include shortened project duration, lowered risk to the owner, improved project performance, and possibly reduced cost. Researchers have also studied the factors related to the improved performance in DB projects, especially in the building and transportation industries. Compared to the building and highway industries, the application of DB in water/wastewater (WW) projects has been rarely studied before. One of the potential factors that may influence project performance is procurement duration (PD). By focusing on DB applied to WW projects, this study explored the relationship between PD (from Request for Proposal issue date to proposal due date) and project success. The project success criteria was defined as cost and schedule growth, which were objective measurements and thus provided more convincing data analysis. Project data was collected through an on-line questionnaire given to owners and design-builders who had experience in DB WW projects. The data was used to analyze how PD impacts project performance in terms of cost and schedule growth. The relationships between PD and performance in DB WW projects were compared to DB transportation projects. Both similarities and differences were found. To explore the reasons of these similarities and differences, content analysis was conducted to compare the DB WW and transportation procurement documents. Variables were defined and analyzed based on their frequency of use within procurement documents. Hypotheses were given based on {{the similarities and differences}} found between DB WW and transportation projects’ <b>procurement</b> <b>items</b> as to which might influence the project success. Related suggestions were provided for owners in the DB WW industry regarding the time given for design-builders to prepare proposals and items that should be required in the DB proposal.

The revised CLV upper stage will use the J- 2 X engine, a derivative of NASA s Apollo Program Saturn V s S-II and S-IVB main propulsion, which will also serve as the Earth Departure Stage (EDS) engine. This paper gives details of how the J- 2 X engine effort mitigates risk by building on the Apollo Program and other lessons learned to deliver a human-rated engine that is on an aggressive development schedule, with first demonstration flight in 2010 and human test flights in 2012. It is well documented that propulsion is historically a high-risk area. NASA s risk reduction strategy for the J- 2 X engine design, development, test, and evaluation is to build upon heritage hardware and apply valuable experience gained from past development efforts. In addition, NASA and its industry partner, Rocketdyne, which originally built the J- 2, have tapped into their extensive databases and are applying lessons conveyed firsthand by Apollo-era veterans of America s first round of Moon missions in the 1960 s and 1970 s. NASA s development approach for the J- 2 X engine includes early requirements definition and management; designing-in {{lessons learned from the}} 5 - 2 heritage programs; initiating long-lead <b>procurement</b> <b>items</b> before Preliminary Desi& Review; incorporating design features for anticipated EDS requirements; identifying facilities for sea-level and altitude testing; and starting ground support equipment and logistics planning at an early stage.

Historically, these carcasses have been difficult to manage because, when they broke, maintenance personnel were primarily concerned with replacing them with ready-for-issue units; what happened to the carcass was of little concern.
