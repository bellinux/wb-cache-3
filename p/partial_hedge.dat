5000|$|A {{pension fund}} {{following}} an LDI strategy {{focuses on the}} pension-fund assets {{in the context of}} the promises made to employees and pensioners (liabilities). This is in contrast to an approach which focuses purely on the asset side of the pension fund balance sheet. There is no single accepted definition or approach to LDI and different managers apply different approaches. Typical LDI strategies involve hedging, in whole or in part, the fund's exposure to changes in interest rates and inflation. These risks can eat into a pension scheme's ability to keep their promises to members. Historically, bonds were used as a <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> for these interest rate risks but the recent growth in LDI has focused on using swaps and other derivatives. Various approaches will pursue a [...] "glide path" [...] which over time seeks to reduce interest rate and other risks while achieving a return that matches or exceeds the growth in projected pension plan liabilities. [...] These various approaches offer significant additional flexibility and capital efficiency compared to bonds, but also raise issues of added complexity, especially when the rebalancing of an LDI portfolio following changes in interest rates is considered.|$|E
40|$|A hedger of a {{contingent}} claim {{may decide to}} partially replicate on some states of nature {{and not on the}} others: A <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> initially costs less than a perfect hedge. However, a <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> may lead to a default position. It is of interest in that context to estimate the gain and the default risk. Some partial hedging strategies based on the final primitive asset price, its maximum over the trading period, and the time to maximum, are analyzed. Closed-form solutions are derived in the Black and Scholes (1973) model and efficient Monte Carlo estimates are computed using a stochastic volatility model. The results show how the gain and the default risk inversely change depending on the hedging event. 1 Introduction The basic idea used to evaluate {{a contingent}} claim in a frictionless, arbitragefree and complete market is the possibility of hedging it with certainty by Research supported by NSERC, Canada and by ' Ecole des Hautes ' Etudes Commerciales.

40|$|Hedging {{has been}} one of the most {{important}} topics in finance. How to effectively hedge the exposed risk draws significant interest from both academicians and practitioners. In a complete financial market, every contingent claim can be hedged perfectly. In an incomplete market, the investor can eliminate his risk exposure by superhedging. However, both perfect hedging and superhedging usually call for a high cost. In some situations, the investor does not have enough capital or is not willing to spend that much to achieve a zero risk position. This brings us to the topic of <b>partial</b> <b>hedging.</b> In this thesis, we establish the risk measure based <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> model and study the optimal <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies under various criteria. First, we consider two of the most common risk measures known as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We derive the analytical forms of optimal <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies under the criterion of minimizing VaR of the investor's total risk exposure. The knock-out call hedging strategy and the bull call spread hedging strategy are shown to be optimal among two admissible sets of hedging strategies. Since VaR risk measure has some undesired properties, we consider the CVaR risk measure and show that bull call spread hedging strategy is optimal under the criterion of minimizing CVaR of the investor's total risk exposure. The comparison between our proposed <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies and some other <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies, including the well-known quantile hedging strategy, is provided and the advantages of our proposed <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies are highlighted. Then we apply the similar approaches in the context of reinsurance. The VaR-based optimal reinsurance strategies are derived under various constraints. Then we study the optimal <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies under general risk measures. We provide the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions and use these conditions to study some specific hedging strategies. The robustness of our proposed CVaR-based optimal <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> strategy is also discussed in this part. Last but not least, we propose a new method, simulation-based approach, to formulate the optimal <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> models. By using the simulation-based approach, we can numerically obtain the optimal <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> strategy under various constraints and criteria. The numerical results in the examples in this part coincide with the theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> problem in financial markets {{with a large}} agent. An agent {{is said to be}} large if his/her trades influence the equilibrium price. We develop a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a single large agent parameter to model such a market. We focus on minimizing the expected value {{of the size of the}} shortfall in the large agent model. A Bellman-type partial differential equation (PDE) is derived, and the Legendre transform is used to consider the dual shortfall function. An asymptotic analysis leads us to conclude that the shortfall function (expected loss) increases when there is a large agent, which means that one would need more capital to hedge away risk in the market with a large agent. This asymptotic analysis is confirmed by performing Monte Carlo simulations. <b>Partial</b> <b>hedging,</b> large agent, Bellman PDE,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Purpose of the {{research}} is to get evidence how returns on assets are related against inflation. In other words, idea {{is to find out}} if some assets can offer hedge against inflation. More specifically, aim of the study is to get global evidence of hedging ability of assets against inflation in the long run. Moreover, this research presents findings how assets are related with inflation in different time periods. Additionally, this study shows how returns on assets react against inflation shocks. First of all, this study points out how nominal and real returns differ from each other between different asset classes. Then, autocorrelation is tested for nominal and real returns. Existence of unit-roots is tested by using ADF-, PP- and KPSS-test. Basic OLS estimation is used to get evidence how returns on assets are related against inflation. More deeply, ARIMA model shows how returns on assets are related against expected and unexpected inflation. Quantile regression presents how returns on assets behave against inflation in different quantiles. Finally, VAR analysis is used to get information of Granger causality, impulse-response function and cointegration. The results show clearly that Goldman Sachs Commodity Index offers the best hedge against inflation. In fact, Goldman Sachs Commodity Index offers hedge against both, expected and unexpected inflation in the long run. However, quantile regression and periodic analysis show that even Goldman Sachs Commodity Index cannot offer hedge against inflation during extremely high inflation periods. On the other hand, gold seems to offer at least <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> against inflation during high inflation periods. REITs can offer <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> against inflation, but the hedge does not hold when the rate of inflation is high. Interestingly, stocks cannot offer hedge against inflation in the long run. However, in the case when the rate of inflation is low, stocks seems to offer at least <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> against inflation. Interest rates are positively related with inflation, but cannot offer any hedge against it. Finally, bonds are the worst assets against inflation, but U. S TIPS can offer some hedge. Generally speaking, these results show clearly that when investment decisions are done between different asset classes, the rate of inflation should be taken into consideration with high importance. More specifically, the rate of inflation can be extremely harmful for the returns on assets. Finally, {{it should be noted that}} the results show that different asset classes react completely differently against inflation...|$|E

40|$|Financial risk {{management}} is an inherent {{part of each}} business activity. The analysis of available hedging strategies, theirs interconnection with efficient market and firm value theories, as well as various empirical studies are regular theme of scientific papers. In this study we focus on an alternative approach to hedging of financial risk of non-financial institutions – the <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> approach with shortfall acceptation. This approach initiates from Föllmer and Leukert (1999) method of quantile hedging. It is also related to cashflow at risk approach of Stein et al. (2001). The approach to hedging {{presented in this paper}} is based on a combined option position, so that a substantial decrease in initial capital needs can be achieved by accepting of some probability of shortfall. The strategy is studied under various circumstances given e. g. by risk neutral and real market probabilities. Simultaneously, it is compared to more standard strategies of hedging. Finally, we present two interesting findings: (i) real world probability of shortfall significantly differs from the risk neutral one, (ii) at first sight insignificant error in simulation results can have important influence on the interpretation of <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the past}} couple of decades, the surge in the sale of equity linked {{products}} has led to many discussions on the valuation of surrender options embedded in these products. However, most studies treat such options as American/Bermudian style options. In this thesis, a different approach is presented where only a portion of the policyholders react optimally, due to the belief that not all policyholders are rational. Through this method, a probability of surrender is found and the product is partially hedged by iteratively reducing the measure of risk to a non-positive value. This <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> framework is versatile since few assumptions are made. To demonstrate this, the initial capital requirement for an equity linked product is found under a bivariate equity/interest model with a copula based dependence structure. A numerical example is presented in order to demonstrate some of the dynamics of this valuation method. In addition, a surprising result is found during the adjustment of the surrender parameters which directly implies that under a particular valuation method, an increased number of policy surrenders causes a drop in the initial capital requirement. This counter-intuitive result is directly caused by the <b>partial</b> <b>hedging</b> method...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} an agent between risky and riskless assets is {{complicated}} by the existence of idiosyncratic risk. In this paper the agent chooses state-dependent shares of aggregate marketable income (a sharing rule) to provide a <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> against the idiosyncratic risk. The agent's Utility function exhibits positive, decreasing absolute risk aversion and prudence. Then the higher the idiosyncratic risk, the more the agent purchases claims in states with low aggregate income and the less in states with high aggregate income. The sensitivity of the equilibrium to an increase in the idiosyncratic risk across all investors is analyzed. These results are made more specific by considering the special case of the Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion (HARA) family of Utility functions. In this case, the precautionary premium can be defined more precisely and the sharing rules can be derived explicitly...|$|E

40|$|An {{investor}} {{may choose}} to partially hedge his or her obligations on a claim they have written by constructing a portfolio replicating the claim on only some outcomes. This <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> costs less than the complete hedge, however it may lead to default. Analytical results for price and default risk for partial hedges on vanilla options are developed via a Geometric Brownian Motion asset price model. Monte Carlo simulation is then used to estimate prices and risks for a stochastic volatility model, for which closed form solutions are not known, via a pathwise Euler approximation of the stochastic differential equations. The efficiency of these estimates is increased via the variance reduction techniques Antithetic Variates and Control Variates.

40|$|In {{the first}} half of 2008, rising {{inflation}} became a concern, but by the fall the focus was on deflation. Such shifts in the outlook for inflation represent a significant risk for some companies, particularly those whose revenues and profits are negatively affected by increases in inflation and rates.

Less widely appreciated is that even companies whose profits move up and down with inflation face considerable risk from fluctuations in interest rates. Conventional wisdom holds that floating-rate debt hedges this risk. But this article argues that floating-rate debt still leaves a company exposed to increases in real interest rates. Inflation-sensitive companies such as utilities can use corporate inflation-protected securities (CIPS) to hedge their real interest rate risk as well as inflation risk. In addition to its hedging benefits, CIPS also have the potential to reduce borrowing costs by satisfying growing investor demand for high-quality securities that provide inflation protection (including demand sources like the recent restoration of French savings accounts to inflation) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyze residential, unsecuritized and securitized real estates’ ability to hedge inflation in Sweden and compare it to stocks’, bonds’ and gold’s ability to hedge inflation. This research is based on both descriptive statistical and econometric analysis methodology with use of both quarterly and annual data series. First are the correlations between assets and actual, expected and unexpected inflation analyzed. Inflation betas are then estimated for all assets based on an ordinary least square model. The results indicate that, during the researched period 1993 - 2011, none of the studied exposures of real estate are a hedge against actual, expected nor unexpected inflation. As expected the results also indicate that both stocks and bonds have a negative relation to inflation, while gold seems to be a <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> against inflation. However, all inflation betas have a low R square and low statistical significance in general.

40|$|While {{industry}} commentators {{point to}} the supposed inflation hedging qualities of real estate, research {{on the relationship between}} inflation and property returns provides variable results. While {{there is some evidence that}} directly-owned private real estate provides a <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> against some components of inflation, public securitised real estate is often shown to exhibit the same negative relationships found in stock market research – particularly with respect to unexpected inflation. A number of explanations for the observed negative relationship between inflation and stock returns have been advanced. Following Fama (1981), it has been suggested that the observed inflation-stock relationships are spurious as a result of missing variables – notably real activity, price uncertainty and monetary shocks. Distinctions are also made between short-run and long-run relationships with the hypothesis that longer time horizons will result in a positive relationship in accordance with the expected Fisher relationship [...] Equilibrium models suggest that the relationship between price changes and equity returns depends on the source of the change in inflation (monetary or real).

40|$|It {{appears from}} discussions held with {{practitioners}} on forums and conferences that hedging products with CDSs is often {{considered to be}} an easy task. For instance, a bond-CDS position is frequently seen to be a perfect hedge as is the index CDS and its corresponding single-name counterparts. On the other hand, theoreticians claim that a perfect hedge is impossible to achieve with credit derivatives: currently it seems there is no model from which a perfect hedge of credit derivatives can be set up. So, who's right? This paper aims to show that, surprisingly, both are right, in some sense. The misunderstanding comes from a misspecification of the “hedge” term, together with a confusion between hedging and arbitraging. We focus on Credit Default Swaps and explain why, among other things, the “Bond-CDS on the Bond” position does not result in a perfect hedge (except in a very specific case, which is not market standard). By contrast, <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> (that is, hedging some parts of the risk) can be obtained and, of course, arbitrage opportunities could be found. We then explain, adopting a philosophical point of view, why it is so problematic to set up a credit portfolio being perfectly hedged (even in a first-order approximation sense). It appears that the nature of the derivative's underlying prevents us reaching this with the currently available financial instruments...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Similar to real estate, {{infrastructure}} {{investments are}} regarded as providing a good inflation hedge and inflation protection. However, the empirical literature on infrastructure and inflation is scarce. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the short- and long-term inflation-hedging characteristics, as well as the inflation protection associated with infrastructure and real estate assets. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a unique data set for direct infrastructure performance, a listed infrastructure index, common direct and listed real estate indices, the authors test for short- and long-term inflation-hedging characteristics of these assets in the USA from 1991 - 2013. The authors employ the traditional Fama and Schwert (1977) framework, as well as Engle and Granger (1987) co-integration tests. Granger causality tests are further conducted, so as to gain insight into the short-run dynamics. Finally, shortfall risk measures are applied to investigate the inflation protection characteristics of the different assets over increasingly long investment horizons. Findings – The empirical results indicate that in the short run, only direct infrastructure provides a <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> against inflation. However, co-integration tests suggest that all series have a long-run co-movement with inflation, implying a long-term hedge. The causality tests reveal reverse unidirectional causality – while real estate asset returns are Granger-caused by inflation, infrastructure asset returns seem to cause inflation. These findings further confirm that both assets represent a distinct asset class. Ultimately, direct infrastructure investments exhibit the most desirable inflation protection characteristics among the set of assets. Research limitations/implications – This study only presents results based on a composite direct infrastructure index, as no sub-indices for sub-sectors are available yet. Practical implications – Investors seeking assets that are sensitive to inflation and mitigate inflation risk should consider direct infrastructure investments in their asset allocation strategy. Originality/value – This is the first study to examine the ability of direct infrastructure to assess inflation risk...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers how housing wealth impacts household behavior. The essays {{pay close}} attention to the borrowing collateral role of housing wealth, and address how changing house prices affect household spending. Chapter II of the dissertation investigates the relationship between house values and consumption. The chapter demonstrates that house values impact consumption by serving as borrowing collateral for households to finance and smooth their consumption. Changing house values have little effect, however, on the expenditures of households without apparent borrowing needs. In addition, the chapter shows that the impact of falling house prices on aggregate consumption is relatively small. Chapter III examines how households’ home equity extraction during 2001 to 2003 and 2003 to 2005 affects their spending and saving behavior. The chapter finds that a 1 dollar increase in equity extraction leads to 95 or 98 cent higher consumption expenditures. Nearly all of this spending increase is reversed in the subsequent period. Households who extract extract equity are somewhat more likely to pay down their higher cost credit card debt as well as invest in other real estate and businesses. Overall, the results in the chapter are consistent with households extracting equity to fund one-time durable good type consumption needs. The final chapter of this dissertation considers the theoretical relationship between collateralized borrowing and household consumption. The chapter examines households’ consumption decisions when they can borrow against their equity in an illiquid asset (house) to finance their consumption. This theoretical approach addresses questions that are not easily answered empirically such as whether household spending responds symmetrically to positive versus negative house price shocks. The paper finds that collateralized borrowing capacity acts as a <b>partial</b> <b>hedge</b> against future labor income risk. Indeed, households borrow to smooth their consumption somewhat in response to negative labor income shocks. In addition, the consumption growth responses to illiquid asset price shocks are relatively symmetric. Also, the impact of house price shocks on consumption is not large compared to income shocks...|$|E

For the optimization we consider once the maximization of the expected success ratio of the worst possible case as well as the minimization of the shortfall risk. These problems lead to stochastic games which do not need to have a value. We provide an example for this in a CRR model for an american put. Alternatively we might fix a minimal expected success ratio or a boundary for the shortfall risk and look for the minimal amount of initial capital for which there is a self-financing strategy fulfilling one or the other restriction. For all these problems we show the optimal strategy consists in hedging a modified american claim for some ``randomized test process''. <b>Partial</b> <b>Hedging,</b> Efficient Hedging, Expected Loss, American Claims, Incomplete Markets, Dynamic Measures of Risk. ...|$|R
