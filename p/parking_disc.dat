The road is mostly one lane in each direction, but is paved and open year-round. There are no paved roads from Akureyri to the unpopulated interior of the island. However, the F821 mountain road is open in summer: it climbs southwards from Akureyri and connects with the F26 mountain road across the interior to the SW of the country. Parking in the central area requires use of a <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> indicating the time that parking has commenced. [...] Parking is free but is limited in certain areas to a maximum period ranging from 15 minutes to 2 hours.|$|E
50|$|On 6 December 2007 the Ministre de l'Intérieur {{implemented}} a regulation on a <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> {{that would only}} have one window to show the arrival time. This new <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> differs somewhat from the EU <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> - it is colored in brown tone (EU disc is blue), it is square with 150 mm on each side (EU disc is rectangular) and the marks on the clock face are set in intervals of ten minutes.|$|E

50|$|The EU <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> {{regulation}} was skipped in France for a {{long time}} where a general time limit of 1 hour 30 was the only regulation in effect. The EU <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> however allows a much wider range of parking regulations which were tested first in Bron at the beginning of January 2001 when a new tramway line reached the city center. The Franklin Roosevelt Avenue was switched to a maximum of 30 minutes at the time that would a require a different clock disc. Finally the EU <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> was officially introduced into the road statutory on 19 October 2007.|$|E
50|$|Within Europe {{only the}} United Kingdom and Denmark have a {{disabled}} persons parking scheme where a <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> {{is required in}} certain circumstances.

50|$|<b>Disc</b> <b>parking</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} in Paris in 1957 and adopted in Kassel in 1961—in both cases the new parking system was introduced {{in an attempt to}} move away long-term parkers without erecting parking meters, which was considered too expensive. The concept proved to be effective and it spread throughout European countries in the 1960s. The first <b>parking</b> <b>discs</b> showed two clock faces—one with the arrival time and one with the departure time. Over time different variations of <b>parking</b> <b>discs</b> were created, including the Swiss variant that allowed for a fifteen-hour maximum parking time.|$|R
50|$|The city of Kassel was {{the first}} to take over the French {{regulation}} on <b>parking</b> <b>discs</b> in Germany. The concept spread quickly as it was supported by the powerful ADAC automobile club - it was considered the better alternative over charging meters as <b>disc</b> <b>parking</b> is free of charge.|$|R
5000|$|The Blue Zone parking {{regulations}} are effective continuously i.e. {{they are not}} restricted to the time span of the arrival time - a <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> must always be used when parking {{a car in the}} Blue Zone (unlike in other countries where a <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> {{does not need to be}} used outside the indicated times). The police regulations set the parking scheme as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{system had}} been introduced along with establishing a Blue Zone area. The blue zones in the city centers allow for free parking of about 2 hours by using a <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> issued by the city while other parking zones may have stricter control by parking meters. The current unified EU <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> regulations allow for {{a wider range of}} time restrictions that are indicated on the signs.|$|E
5000|$|In the Blue Zone every parked vehicle {{must show}} a <b>parking</b> <b>disc.</b> On weekdays (Monday through Saturday) {{vehicles}} may be parked {{for one hour}} between 8:00 and 11:30 {{as well as between}} 13:30 and 18:00. With an arrival time between 11:30 and 13:30 the parking allowance is valid until 14:30. With an arrival time between 18:00 and 8:00 is valid until 09:00. Between 19:00 and 7:59 a <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> {{does not need to be}} shown provided that the vehicle enters traffic before 08:00.|$|E

50|$|<b>Parking</b> <b>discs</b> (bifreiðastæðaklukkur) were {{introduced}} to Iceland {{in the town of}} Akureyri in August 2005 allowing an indicated parking time between 30minutes and two hours depending on the distance to the city centre. Former parking meters were removed.|$|R
50|$|The latest {{departure}} time is {{calculated from the}} displayed arrival time on the <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> based on the indicated maximum parking time. For example, if the <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> was set to 10:30 and the parking sign indicated a one-hour maximum parking time, then free parking would end at 11:30. The system is intentionally {{set up in a}} way that only full and half hours are used to indicate arrival and departure. Arriving at 10:02 in a <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> zone of one hour maximum parking time invokes a {{departure time}} of 11:30, and hence an effective time interval of eighty-eight minutes for free parking after arrival. In short, if the parking sign shows a limit of one hour maximum parking time, then the effective maximum parking time is sixty-one to ninety minutes because the difference to the next half hour is added.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{arrival at}} {{a parking lot}} {{requiring}} <b>parking</b> <b>disc,</b> the <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> is set and put on display behind the front windshield. The disc has a thumb wheel (or knurling wheel) at the upper side that makes the clock face turn around its center point, allowing it to show different clock times. The standard parking clock can show a full twelve hours, with additional marks for each half-hour. The time to be set is rounded up from the actual arrival time, for example a 10:00:01 arrival would be set to 10:30, while a 10:29:59 arrival would also be set to 10:30. The legal requirements are that [...] "parking is allowed when the vehicle shows a <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> that is easily readable from the outside and whose clockhand points to {{the mark of the}} half hour that follows the time of arrival".|$|E
50|$|Modern parking signs {{demanding}} disc parking {{include a}} pictogram of the standardized EU <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> {{along with a}} number showing the maximum parking time in hours.|$|E
50|$|In some roads on the {{outskirts}} of St Helier and in the harbours, and also in some car parks in St Brelade, parking is free but controlled by <b>parking</b> <b>discs</b> (time wheels) - obtainable from the Town Hall for a small charge.|$|R

50|$|On March 31, 1979 {{the conference}} of ministers of {{transportation}} in the European Union decided that a European standard should only use designs with a single clock face. The standardized clock disc was introduced as federal law in Germany in November 1981, and similar designs were adopted in other European countries. From 1998 the old <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> designs began to be abolished. France set the last date to 2007, while in Switzerland (not an EU member) the EU <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> design was introduced in 2000 and the old designs abolished in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of the EU <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> in 1994 came about with a little variation as it required to set the mark to the next quarter of an hour:(§ 4 Abs. 3) ...|$|E
5000|$|After the EU level {{had asked}} for a common <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> with a single clock face in 1979 it was Germany to {{introduce}} a new design in November 1981 already - the [...] "Verkehrsblattverlautbarung Nr. 237 vom 24. Nov. 1981" [...] did specify a blue rectangle of 150 mm height and 110 mm width. The clock face has a mark per each half of an hour and the car drivers are required to put the clockhand on the mark. Germany's neighbouring countries would adopt the same design in the following decades that would eventually be the design chose for the EU <b>parking</b> <b>disc.</b>|$|E

The electoral ward of Milverton in Leamington Spa lies to the south.|$|R
5000|$|While Salzburg {{took over}} the <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> from Paris there was also another variant in Vienna. The city {{introduced}} a <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> on 16 March 1959 that had a single clock face with a clock hand with two marks that were exactly on hour away. When the black mark of the clock hand was set {{to the time of}} arrival on the clock face the red mark would point to the time of departure. This design was introduced by the director of urban planning Aladar Pecht so that it would also be nicknamed [...] "Pechtscheibe" [...] (Pecht Disc).|$|E
50|$|A later {{development}} in Switzerland was {{the introduction of}} red zones allowing for a maximum of 15 hours. This scheme required another <b>parking</b> <b>disc</b> that would allow for 24 hours to be shown.|$|E

50|$|The {{appearance}} of the roads in Stolberg is unique for Germany. At the entrances to the town there are signs indicating a speed limit of 30 kph and no parking zones (cars may park in designated areas for one hour {{with the use of}} <b>parking</b> <b>discs).</b> Otherwise there are no road signs in the town.Although there is a clear separation between pavement and road, this may be seen as an early form of the shared space concept.|$|R
50|$|Region Sønderjylland-Schleswig is also {{active in}} voicing {{concerns}} {{specific to the}} border region. Region Sønderjylland-Schleswig has for example pointed out the need for mutual recognition of business educations. Also building projects of current interest like the Fehmarn Belt Bridge and general infrastructure within the border region has the attention of Region Sønderjylland-Schleswig. In order to support the cross-border business community {{there has also been}} some actual projects like the development of Danish-German <b>parking</b> <b>discs</b> and a pocket dictionary.|$|R
50|$|Many {{cities in}} Switzerland {{borrowed}} the blue zone concept {{in the same}} way as in France with a maximum time of 1 h 30. In cities like Basel the blue zones meant that parking lots were marked with blue lines where the scheme would be effective while other (non blue) parking lots were free. No other signposting was used in these blue zones to mark the controlled space - instead the <b>parking</b> <b>discs</b> showed the regulations on the back side.|$|R
