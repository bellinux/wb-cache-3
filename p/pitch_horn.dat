40|$|Several {{research}} {{studies have indicated}} that pitch link loads for various rotorcraft types can reach high or even unacceptable values, both in steady state and manoeuvring flight. This is especially the case for high-speed aggressive manoeuvres. An investigation into the nature of the pitch link loads for the FLIGHTLAB Generic Rotorcraft has been conducted and the model is expanded with a dynamic stall component and a flexible pitch link component to improve its fidelity. The investigation also shows that steady state pitch link loads are large for high-speed flight and they are amplified significantly whilst executing aggressive manoeuvres at high-speed flight. An active controller is designed to alleviate these loads for longitudinal manoeuvres at high- speed. A new structural load severity scale is defined in this paper to evaluate structural loads in combination with the load quickness parameter. The pitch link loads of the non-linear FLIGHTLAB Generic Rotorcraft simulation model can be reduced effectively with the controller but the agility of the aircraft is consequently reduced. The structural load metrics are shown to be effective in evaluating the controller.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a cooperative research program joined by ZF Luftfahrttechnik GmbH (ZFL), NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), and Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) it was agreed to develop and manufacture a fullscale UH- 60 Individual Blade Control (IBC) system to be installed in the LRTA and tested in the NASA National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex. The LRTA is NASA’s new Large Rotor Test Apparatus which was designed to test helicopter and tilt rotors in the 40 - by 80 -foot and 80 - by 120 -foot Wind Tunnels. The objectives of the UH- 60 IBC wind tunnel test program were to demonstrate the feasibility of the IBC system and to quantify the benefits to be gained when applied to and operated with a UH- 60 main rotor. This paper describes the UH- 60 IBC system engineering design, development, manufacturing, and component testing conducted by ZFL. The servo-hydraulic IBC actuators to be installed between the swashplate and blade <b>pitch</b> <b>horn</b> were designed to withstand the control forces produced by a full-scale UH- 60 rotor in a centrifugal field of up to 40 g. They were designed to produce up to ± 6. 0 deg blade pitch motion at the 2 /rev frequency, diminishing to ± 1. 6 deg at the 7 /rev frequency. A set of actuator test specimens was manufactured and fatigue tested with simulation of the control forces and centrifugal load. Prior to the 80 - by 120 -foot wind tunnel testing, that was concluded by the end of September 2001, the complete IBC system was functionally tested (non-rotating and rotating, blades off). This paper discusses the IBC system integration issues as well as the test stand set-up used for actuator and system level testing...|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{wind tunnel}} test was recently conducted (March 2009) in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) 40 - by 80 -FootWind Tunnel to evaluate the potential of an individual blade control (IBC) system to improve rotor performance and reduce vibrations, loads, and noise for a UH- 60 A rotor system [1]. This test {{was the culmination of}} a long-termcollaborative effort between NASA, U. S. Army, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, and ZF Luftfahrttechnik GmbH (ZFL) to demonstrate the benefits of IBC for a UH- 60 Arotor. Figure 1 shows the UH- 60 Arotor and IBC system mounted on the NFAC Large Rotor Test Apparatus (LRTA). The IBC concept used in the current study utilizes actuators placed in the rotating frame, one per blade. In particular, the pitch link of the rotor blade was replacedwith an actuator, so that the blade root pitch can be changed independently. This concept, designed for a full-scale UH- 60 A rotor, was previously tested in the NFAC 80 - by 120 -FootWind Tunnel in September 2001 at speeds up to 85 knots [2]. For the current test, the same UH- 60 A rotor and IBC system were tested in the 40 - by 80 -FootWind Tunnel at speeds up to 170 knots. Figure 2 shows the servo-hydraulic IBC actuator installed between the swashplate and the blade <b>pitch</b> <b>horn.</b> Although previous wind tunnel experiments [3, 4] and analytical studies on IBC [5, 6] have shown the promise to improve the rotor s performance, in-depth correlation studies have not been performed. Thus, the current test provides a unique resource {{that can be used to}} assess the accuracy and reliability of prediction methods and refine theoretical models, with the ultimate goal of providing the technology for timely and cost-effective design and development of new rotors. In this paper, rotor performance and loads calculations are carried out using the analyses CAMRAD II and coupled OVERFLOW- 2 /CAMRAD II and the results are compared with these UH- 60 A/IBC {{wind tunnel test}} data...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{concerns the}} mechanical response of binder coated carbon tow preforms and laminates. The main {{focus is on}} evaluating and modelling the robustness of preforms whilst the methodologies developed are also applied to cured laminates produced using the binder coated preforms. Conventional manufacturing techniques were altered to address the differences in behaviour due {{to the presence of}} the binder with the development of infusion schedules. These involve lower temperatures, which eliminate the possibility of binder reactivation during processing. Different development versions of the material {{in the form of an}} inhomogeneously or homogeneously bindered tow were characterised in terms of their mechanical response in the preform state. It was observed that the inhomogeneously bindered material had higher modulus and strength in both tension in the fibre direction and shear, while the behaviour of the homogeneous preform is significantly more robust in the transverse to the fibre direction. Laminates produced, using the homogeneously bindered material, were compared to a reference unbindered laminate system, using an aerospace epoxy as a matrix. The out-of-plane properties of the material with binder were superior to the reference laminate, whereas in-plane properties were similar or inferior. The development of models of the mechanical response built around continuum damage mechanics models allowed the simulation of the behaviour of preforms under loading. The implementation of these constitutive models necessitated the development of appropriate parameter estimation techniques capable of solving the inverse problem of identifying the values of 27 material constants that minimise the error between experimental and modelling results. Two novel methodologies were developed and compared to a conventional technique following simplified laminate analysis. The first method performed a gradient-based error minimisation and the second uses the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. The gradient-based technique results in a close fit, while this method requires proper definition of the constraints to yield an appropriate solution set. Markov Chain Monte Carlo yields satisfactory results with the additional advantages of overcoming the ill-posedness of the inverse problem without regularisation and providing an output in the form of multivariate probability distributions that can be used directly instochastic simulations. The material parameters obtained and the corresponding constitutive models were used in finite element models of the mechanical response of preforms and laminates. The models were based on the concept of a combination of shell elements representing sub-laminates and cohesive elements simulating the delamination behaviour of interfaces between them. The performance of the models was evaluated using the case of impact of a spar section for preforms and three point bending for the laminates. The agreement between experimental and simulation results was satisfactory. The validated model was used in the context of a design case study based on a helicopter <b>pitch</b> <b>horn</b> component. The aim was to use the results of a draping analysis in the finite element model to evaluate the effects of the assumption of nominal fibre orientations on design and to combine the results of drape optimisation in respect to fibre shear angle with finite element analysis incorporating damage. The results showed that the use of nominal fibre orientation predicts a good performance of the component, whereas the influence of optimising draping on the mechanical performance was inferior.

50|$|The {{swashplate}} {{consists of}} two main parts: a stationary swashplate and a rotating swashplate. The stationary (outer) swashplate is mounted on the main rotor mast and {{is connected to the}} cyclic and collective controls by a series of pushrods. It is able to tilt in all directions and move vertically. The rotating (inner) swashplate is mounted to the stationary swashplate by means of a bearing and is allowed to rotate with the main rotor mast. An anti-rotation link prevents the inner swash from rotating independently of the blades, which would apply torque to the actuators. The outer swashplate typically has an anti-rotation slider as well to prevent it from rotating. Both swashplates tilt up and down as one unit. The rotating swashplate is connected to the <b>pitch</b> <b>horns</b> by the <b>pitch</b> links. Alternative mechanics to the stationary (outer) swashplate are the hexapod and the universal joint.Swashplates for helicopters having two rotors mounted on the same shaft are much more complex than the single rotor helicopters.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a multi-body {{analysis of the}} 1 / 5 scale wind tunnel model of the V- 22 tiltrotor, the Wing and Rotor Aeroelastic Testing System (WRATS), currently tested at NASA Langley Research Center. An original multi-body formulation has been developed at the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Aerospaziale of the Politecnico di Milano, Italy. It {{is based on the}} direct writing of the equilibrium equations of independent rigid bodies, connected by kinematic constraints that result in the addition of algebraic constraint equations, and by dynamic constraints, that directly contribute to the equilibrium equations. The formulation has been extended to the simultaneous solution of interdisciplinary problems by modeling electric and hydraulic networks, for aeroservoelastic problems. The code has been tailored to the modeling of rotorcrafts while preserving a complete generality. A family of aerodynamic elements has been introduced to model high aspect aerodynamic surfaces, based on the strip theory, with quasi-steady aerodynamic coefficients, compressibility, post-stall interpolation of experimental data, dynamic stall modeling, and radial flow drag. Different models for the induced velocity of the rotor can be used, from uniform velocity to dynamic in flow. A complete dynamic and aeroelastic analysis of the model of the V- 22 tiltrotor has been performed, to assess the validity of the formulation and to exploit the unique features of multi-body analysis with respect to conventional comprehensive rotorcraft codes; These are the ability to model the exact kinematics of mechanical systems, and the possibility to simulate unusual maneuvers and unusual flight conditions, that are particular to the tiltrotor, e. g. the conversion maneuver. A complete modal validation of the analytical model has been performed, to assess the ability to reproduce the correct dynamics of the system with a relatively coarse beam model of the semispan wing, pylon and rotor. Particular care has been used to model the kinematics of the gimbal joint, that characterizes the rotor hub, and of the control system, consisting in the entire swashplate mechanism. The kinematics of the fixed and the rotating plates have been modeled, with variable length control links used to input the controls, the rotating flexible links, the <b>pitch</b> <b>horns</b> and the <b>pitch</b> bearings. The investigations took advantage of concurring wind tunnel test runs, that were performed in August 1998, and allowed the acquisition of data specific to the multi-body analysis...|$|R

40|$|In 2007, the {{helicopter}} community celebrated 100 years of helicopter flight. Although no photos or film evidence is available {{it is widely}} assumed that Paul Cornu experienced the first man-carrying powered helicopter flight. Even more, a recent analysis revealed that a permanent hovering flight has not been possible. Since then, helicopters experienced a tremendous improvement in performance, safety, controllability and handling qualities. Yet still a niche product, they concurred their market {{and can not be}} replaced by any other aircraft. The ability to take-off and land vertically, to hover and the excellent low speed flight performances and handling qualities in comparison to other VTOL aircraft enable and consolidate this success. On the other hand, helicopters still suffer from many problems that hinder a further increase in their market share. The high level of vibrations and the noise generated by the rotor are the most important reasons for this. While vibrations are a concern of pilot and passenger comfort, but give also rise to an increase in maintenance effort and costs, the high levels of noise limit the acceptance of helicopters in the public, e. g. landing of helicopters on or close to hospitals during EMS missions. High noise levels also lead to an early aural detection during military missions. Further drawbacks of helicopters are the high fuel consumption in high speed forward flight due to the excessive power required, the limited speed of flight, the low range for the same reason, low lead-lag damping etc. Nobody, however, realized that in 2002 active rotor control celebrated its 50 th anniversary. In 1952 first theoretical studies started to address the principle of Higher Harmonic Control (HHC) to alleviate typical helicopter problems. In 1965 a first flight with a HHC system on a Bell 212 has been done. HHC is based on actuators located under the swashplate, thus limiting mechanically the applicable control frequencies in the rotating frame for rotors with more than 3 blades. Although HHC demonstrated its capabilities to reduce vibrations and noise caused by blade-vortex-interaction (BVI), other active control means were investigated more and more in the 1980 s. The main drawback of HHC is the limitation to certain applications due to reduced control frequencies, and the fact, that noise and vibrations could often not be reduced at the same time. The most promising alternative to HHC is Individual Blade Control (IBC). IBC is based on actuators in the rotating frame and hence gives the engineer the opportunity to overcome the limits inherent to HHC. Many IBC concepts have been designed and tested, both in wind tunnel as well as in flight. Early concepts focussed on blade root actuation where hydraulic actuators replace the control rods that connect the swashplate with the <b>pitch</b> <b>horns.</b> Advanced designs address the principle of smart actuators that drive a trailing edge flap. Even more advanced applications of smart actuation integrate distributed actuators into the blade (blade spar or skin) to generate active twist along the rotor blade radius. Further concepts are nose droop or leading edge flaps, Gurney flaps or soft trailing edges, multi-swashplate systems and so on. Despite more than 50 years on R&D on rotor active control technology, no serial production helicopter makes use of such a powerful system. This sad fact is a tribute to the challenging requirements on minimum system complexity, high reliability and of course effectiveness with respect to the mentioned problems, minimum weight, costs, and last but not least the high loads acting on the rotor and the blades. The paper gives a survey of the typical problems and explains the vibration and noise issues in more detail. Since active means have to compete with passive ones, such methods are also addressed briefly. Next, the paper gives a historic review on important HHC and IBC achievements. Due to the limited space, the paper mainly focuses on wind tunnel and flight test results. Recent results gathered with IBC are shown before an overview on some DLR activities is given. An outlook on the idea of the swashplateless helicopter concludes the paper. ...|$|R
