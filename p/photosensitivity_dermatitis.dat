40|$|In {{this article}} are {{reviewed}} the various hypotheses concerning the etiology of the persistent light reaction and <b>photosensitivity</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> which occurs among older people and is characterized by an extreme photosensitivity that sometimes evolves into a pseudolymphoma, that is, actinic reticuloid. An etiologic agent can sometimes be demonstrated, but the precise pathogenetic mechanism is unknown. Clinical experience and experimental research indicate that the cause is most probably multifactoral: contact allergenic, photoallergenic, phototoxic, immunologic, and metabolic factors are involved, but their precise roles in {{the origin of the}} extreme photosensitivity are still unclear. Localized persistent light reactivity could result from the continued effects of the original photoallergen, but generalized photosensitivity is more difficult to account for. Among the many different hypotheses, two are of special interest: autosensitization of skin proteins with endogenous photosensitizers and cellular hypersensitivity to light, as is manifested by fibroblast cultures of actinic reticuloid patients. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|The Leccese or Moscia Leccese is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep indigenous to the Salento peninsula, in Puglia, southern Italy. Its name derives {{from that of}} Lecce, the principal city of the peninsula. Like the Pinzirita and the Altamurana, {{it belongs to the}} Zackel sheep group. It is a hardy and frugal breed, usually kept in semi-feral herds, capable of surviving year-round on pasture alone. The wool is normally white and the skin flesh-coloured with darker mottlings. In a small proportion of animals the wool is entirely black, and the skin is also black; these black-skinned sheep are resistant to the effects of the poisonous Hypericum crispum, common in the Salento, which in the white-woolled, pale-skinned sheep causes <b>photosensitivity</b> and thus <b>dermatitis.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Factitious {{cheilitis}} is {{a chronic}} condition characterized by crusting and ulceration {{that is probably}} secondary to chewing and sucking of the lips. Atopy, actinic damage, exfoliative cheilitis, cheilitis granulomatosa or glandularis, contact <b>dermatitis,</b> <b>photosensitivity</b> reactions and neoplasia {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of crusted and ulcerated lesions of the lip. Case presentation We present a 56 year-old female with an ulcerated and crusted lesion on her lower lip. The biopsy showed granulation tissue and associated inflammation but no malignancy. Based on the tissue examination and through clinical evaluation the diagnosis of factitious cheilitis was rendered. Conclusion Thorough clinical history, utilization of basic laboratory tests and histopathologic evaluation are required to exclude other diseases and a thoruough psychiatric evaluation and treatment is vital for successful management of these patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fluoroquinolone {{antibacterial}} agents cause <b>photosensitivity</b> <b>dermatitis</b> as {{an adverse}} effect and can function immunologically as photohapten. In a murine model of quinolone photoallergy, Langerhans cells are photomodified with a systemically given quinolone upon ultraviolet A irradiation {{of skin and}} thus present photohaptenic moieties to sensitize and restimulate T cells. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the site of peptides/proteins photobound to quinolones and to assess the T cell antigenicity of quinolone-photocoupled peptides using Langerhans cells as photoadduct-presenting cells. On an amino acid composition analysis, lysine was preferentially degraded in bovine serum albumin that was ultraviolet A-conjugated with a representative quinolone ofloxacin. An affinity chromatographic study using a quinolone photoadduct-specific monoclonal antibody as ligand demonstrated preferential photocoupling of ofloxacin with a lysine-containing peptide. CD 4 + T cells were purified from lymph nodes of BALB/c mice sensitized subcutaneously with ofloxacin-photomodified epidermal cells and from those sensitized epicutaneously via barrier-disrupted skin with a major histocompatibility complex class II (I-Ad) -binding, ofloxacin-photoconjugated peptide. These immune T cells proliferated in vitro in response to Langerhans cells loaded with class II-binding, lysine-containing peptides when photomodified with ofloxacin. Furthermore, epicutaneous application of the ofloxacin-photoconjugated peptide was able to prime mice for subsequent elicitation of photoallergy evoked with systemic ofloxacin and ultraviolet A light. This study suggests that lysine affords quinolone photocoupling of peptides and quinolone-photomodified peptides on class II molecules stimulate pathogenetic T cells in quinolone photoallergy...|$|E
30|$|Whether PDT is {{performed}} under general anesthesia or sedation depends on each surgeon’s decision. In our institution, PDT under general anesthesia {{was selected for}} the stable operation field. The technique of pulse oximetry {{is based on the}} principle that oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb red and near-infrared light differently [5]. The MASIMO pulse oximeter probe emits red light at 660  nm and infrared light at 940  nm. Moreover, talaporfin sodium has a longer absorption at 664  nm, and the laser light of 664  nm activates talaporfin sodium as an anticancer drug [3, 4]. Both the red light emitted by pulse oximetry and the laser light are characterized by the same wavelength zone, leading us to conclude that the blister was <b>photosensitivity</b> <b>dermatitis</b> caused by the red light from the pulse oximeter. All pulse oximeter probes use similar wavelengths. Pulse oximeter sensory associated blisters must occur when using other probes. There were two previous reports of skin burns related to pulse oximetry using photofrin and mTHPC during PDT. Probes were continuously applied to patients’ fingers for 3 and 48  h [6, 7]. We predicted that shorter exposure time to red light from pulse oximetry would prevent skin phototoxicity. Nevertheless, this case showed that pulse oximetry can cause skin burns regardless of the length of pulse oximetry attachment time and the kinds of photosensitizers. Pulse oximetry is a standard monitor in anesthesia cases to detect hypoxia [5]. The World Health Organization recommends pulse oximetry for all anesthetic patients for perioperative safety [8]. There is no superior monitoring to pulse oximetry for measuring oxygenation, even during PDT. Therefore, we should monitor peripheral oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry as little as possible or intermittently. In future cases, we might need arterial cannulation to assess blood oxygenation, if {{we will not be able}} to apply pulse oximetry.|$|E
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} is {{a common}} disease which varies widely in clinical presentation at different ages and places. Although authors working in western countries on white races have suggested many criteria, there is no uniform set {{which can be used}} in large population studies {{in this part of the}} world. Hence keeping in mind differences in environment and ethnicity of population, the present study was carried out. Seventy- three patients of atopic dermatitis and 71 age matched controls were studied. All the subjects were examined using a set of 34 potentially useful clinical features selected from different studies, including features for evaluation of photosensitivity. Multiple regression technique was used for analysing the data. It was found that 6 clinical features were diagnostic, 1. presence of itch, 2. history of flexural involvement, 3. history of dry skin, 4. family history of atopy, 5. personal history of diagnosed asthma and 6, visible flexural <b>dermatitis.</b> <b>Photosensitivity</b> was not a significant feature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Pityriasis alba is {{a common}} hypomelanosis which is {{generally}} seen in young children. There is no specific known cause for this condition; however, studies to elucidate pathogenic factors {{seem to suggest that}} there are at least five separate causes for the condition. This list includes <b>dermatitis,</b> <b>photosensitivity,</b> fungal and bacterial pathogenesis, and post-inflammatory alterations. An evaluation into causative factors translates into alternative therapeutic options, which may be advantageous with affected individuals. When a disease has diverse clinical presentations and no known cause, it is possible that one is looking at slightly different diseases with similar clinical characteristics. Pityriasis alba {{is a common}} condition in practice mostly occurring in {{children between the ages of}} 3 and 16, but can be additionally seen in young adults. It usually appears as dry, fine scaled, pale patches, 0. 5 to 6 cm in diameter; how-ever, often the flakiness is not present.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the Consciousness Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect®) Treatment based test formulation and medium (DMEM) against various skin health parameters using three cell lines i. e., HFF- 1, HaCaT, and B 16 -F 10. The various study parameters viz. collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid, melanin, cell viability against UV-B induced stress, and wound healing were evaluated. The test formulation and DMEM were divided into two parts. One part of the test formulation and one part of the DMEM received the Consciousness Energy Healing Treatment by Janice Patricia Kinney and were defined as the Biofield Energy Treated samples, while the other parts were denoted as the untreated test samples. Cell viability using MTT assay showed more than 70 % cells were viable in all the tested concentrations in three cells, indicating that the test formulation was safe and nontoxic. The collagen synthesis was significantly (p≤ 0. 001) increased by 22. 42 % and 17. 48 % in the UT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group at 0. 63 and 2. 5 µg/mL, respectively in relation to the UT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation group. The Elastin level was significantly (p≤ 0. 001) increased by 28. 41 % in the BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group at 5 µg/mL compared to the untreated group. Hyaluronic acid at 0. 63 µg/mL was increased significantly by 15. 90 % in the BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group compared to the untreated group. The level of melanin was reduced significantly by 9. 25 % and 7. 26 % in the BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group at 0. 013 and 0. 063 µg/mL, respectively in relation to the untreated group. Protection of skin cells after UV-B exposure data displayed that the cell viability was increased significantly by 17. 88 %, 20. 10 %, and 25. 77 % in the BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group at 0. 625, 1. 25, and 2. 5 µg/mL, respectively compared to the UT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation group. Wound healing data exhibited significant wound closure and cell migration activities in the HFF- 1 and HaCaT cells compared to the UT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation. Overall, the data suggests that the Biofield Energy Treated DMEM and test formulation demonstrated better responses compared to the untreated medium and test formulation with respect to the tested skin health parameters. Therefore, the Biofield Energy Healing and the Treated test formulation could be developed as an effective cosmetic product to protect and treat the various skin problems including infection, <b>photosensitivity,</b> erythema, contact <b>dermatitis,</b> seborrheic dermatitis, athlete's foot, psoriasis, erythema, cutis rhomboidalis nuchae, skin aging, wrinkles and/or change in skin color, etc...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Skin {{cancer is}} the most widely {{diagnosed}} form of cancer and it is split in to non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). Cutaneous melanoma has a high propensity for malignancy {{and it has the}} highest mortality rate of all skin cancers (de Gruijl, 1999 : 2004). The first line of treatment for most skin cancers is surgical excision but instances do arise in which surgery is not feasible due {{to the health of the}} patient or the location of the lesion. Therefore, viable alternatives are necessary in cases where surgery is not possible (Telfer et al., 2008 : 36). The skin is readily available for delivery of cytotoxic drugs to treat carcinomas and melanomas so the topical delivery of 5 -fluorouracil was investigated in this study. 5 -Fluorouracil is a pyrimidine anti-metabolite which interferes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis by inhibiting the nucleotide synthetic enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) and by becoming misincorporated into RNA and DNA. Thymidylate is essential for replication as well as repair of DNA, in the event of TS inhibition thymidylate is not formed and “thymineless deaths” of cells occur (Chu & Sartorelli, 2009 : 935; Longley et al., 2003 : 330). This active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) causes death of atypical and rapidly dividing cells (Tsuji & Karasek, 1986 : 474). The intravenous and topical routes are approved for 5 -fluorouracil and in the case of skin cancer the obvious choice would be topical application (Chu & Sartorelli, 2009 : 935). Topical application of 5 -fluorouracil results in the occurrence of terrible side effects such as severe inflammation, stomatitis, <b>photosensitivity</b> and <b>dermatitis.</b> A reduction in side effects would reduce the stigma associated with topical 5 -fluorouracil and in turn increase patient compliance. Topical drug delivery entails the delivery of an API onto or into the various layers of the skin (Flynn & Weiner, 1993 : 33) in order to treat conditions on or within the skin. Topical application of APIs is non-invasive, painless and simple plus the target site is readily accessible for topical therapy, thus the API is delivered directly to the site of action (Naik et al., 2000 : 318). In the case of skin cancer, 5 -fluorouracil should be able to reach the epidermis because NMSC originates from the keratinocytes (Marks & Hanson, 2010 : 305) and CMM from melanocytes (de Gruijl, 1999 : 2004) which are both found in the epidermis. The barrier function of the skin limits the penetration of molecules into the skin and the rate-limiting step is usually penetration into the stratum corneum (Foldvari, 2000 : 418). The aim of this study was to investigate the diffusion of 5 -fluorouracil from formulations into and through the skin. Two physico-chemical properties of 5 -fluorouracil that influence skin permeation were determined (aqueous solubility and n-octanol-buffer partition coefficient (log D)). The Pheroid™ drug delivery system was used to enhance the delivery of 5 -fluorouracil (Grobler et al., 2008 : 284). Pheroid™ is a novel technology that is used in the delivery of APIs in pharmaceutical products. It enhances the efficacy of delivered compounds while allowing for the reduction of unwanted adverse effects (Grobler et al., 2008 : 284). Franz cell skin diffusion studies and tape-stripping were conducted with Pheroid™ and non-Pheroid™ formulations to allow for comparison and determination of the effect of Pheroid™. The in vitro efficacy of 5 -fluorouracil in inducing apoptosis of human melanoma cells was investigated using a flow cytometric apoptosis assay. Different concentrations of 5 -fluorouracil in formulation were utilised in the experiments so as to observe the cytotoxic effect of 5 -fluorouracil. The effect of the drug delivery vehicle on the efficacy of 5 -fluorouracil was investigated by utilising API solutions in addition to Pheroid™ and non-Pheroid™ formulations in the experiments. Relatively high concentrations of 5 -fluorouracil diffused into and through the skin with Pheroid™ formulations resulting in a greatly enhanced in vitro skin permeation of 5 -fluorouracil. The tape-stripping revealed that the Pheroid™ lotions resulted in higher concentrations of 5 -fluorouracil in the epidermis and dermis after 12 h as compared to the lotions. There was no deducible trend with respect to the distribution of 5 -fluorouracil between the epidermis and dermis. Subsequent to the apoptosis assay it was found that 5 -fluorouracil was able to induce apoptosis in A 375 cells after a 24 h incubation period. The Pheroid™ treatment of cells resulted in a greater response (mean fluorescence intensity) as compared to treatments with the other drug delivery vehicles at three of the four concentrations. This showed that the drug delivery vehicle played a role in the in vitro efficacy of 5 -fluorouracil. Further research must be done in order to combine these results. Optimum and highly effective topical formulations with low doses of 5 -fluorouracil must be formulated for the purpose of treating cutaneous cancers with a reduced incidence of side effects.
