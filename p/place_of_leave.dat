Introduction: The two great methods which the plant uses to resist drouth are, 1 st, {{the prevention of}} over-transpiration and, 2 nd, the storing of water. The first head may be divided into the methods used by mature plants, and those used by young plants. These are each sub-divided, and each sub-division will be taken up in its turn. Mature plants resist over-evaporation, first, by surface reduction. This is accomplished in two ways, by fleshy plants and by slender plants. In thick, succulent plants, the cactiform, the stems are fleshy and take the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaves.</b> Thus the transpiring surface is reduced {{in proportion to the}} volume of the plant. The Euphorbia Cananensis has a very large, long stem and branches, and no leaves, but large prickles. These fleshy plants are found in deserts, and other tracts where the climate is especially arid. Another reduction of surface is accomplished by the asparagus and by switch plants which grow on islands near Australia and in the Mediterranean District. These latter are straight, slender and rigid, and have many long branches which take the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaves.</b> They grow close together in large districts. In Australia the chief kind is Papilionaceae; and in the Mediterranean District, the Asparagineae Polygalaceae...|$|R

50|$|Nucleophilic acyl {{substitution}} {{describe a}} class of substitution reactions involving nucleophiles and acyl compounds. In this type of reaction, a nucleophile - such as an alcohol, amine, or enolate - displaces the <b>leaving</b> group <b>of</b> an acyl derivative - such as an acid halide, anhydride, or ester. The resulting product is a carbonyl-containing compound in which the nucleophile has taken the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaving</b> group present in the original acyl derivative. Because acyl derivatives react {{with a wide variety}} of nucleophiles, and because the product can depend on the particular type of acyl derivative and nucleophile involved, nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions can be used to synthesize a variety of different products.|$|R

Both steps are reversible and as a result, nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions are equilibrium processes. Because the equilibrium will favor the product containing the best nucleophile, the leaving group must be a comparatively poor nucleophile in order for a reaction to be practical.|$|R

The power struggle latter attracted the junior princes and a princess; this led to a total split of the roving empire of Gawulubi. Galabe who was his fourth Son, one of the strongest soldiers, bookkeeper or treasurer of his father was the first to leave with his large supporters to create his Balikumbat chiefdom.

5|$|The {{study of}} the natural world {{extended}} to a detailed examination of plants. The work done was directly useful in the unprecedented growth of pharmacology across the Islamic world. Al-Dinawari popularised botany in the Islamic world with his six-volume Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants). Only volumes 3 and 5 have survived, with part of volume 6 reconstructed from quoted passages. In what survives, 637 plants are described in alphabetical order from the letters sin to ya, so the whole book must have covered several thousand kinds of plants. Al-Dinawari described the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit. Zakariya al-Qazwini's thirteenth century encyclopedia ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt (The Wonders of Creation) contained, among many other topics, both realistic botany and fantastic accounts. For example, he described trees which grew birds on their twigs in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaves,</b> but which could only be found in the far-distant British Isles. The use and cultivation of plants was documented in the 11th century by Muhammad bin Ibrāhīm Ibn Bassāl of Toledo in his book Dīwān al-filāha (The Court of Agriculture), and Ibn al-'Awwam al-Ishbīlī of Seville in his 12th century book Kitāb al-Filāha (Treatise on Agriculture). Ibn Bassāl had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy. His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate and care for them. It covered leaf and root vegetables, herbs, spices and trees. Abū l-Khayr described in minute detail how olive trees should be grown, grafted, treated for disease, and harvested. He gave similar detail for crops such as cotton.|$|R

50|$|Approximately {{the lower}} {{two thirds of}} the {{province}} is covered in rain forest, which grows progressively thicker as one travels south. The forests are composed of hardwood evergreens of species such as dibetu, ebony, iroko, mahogany, obeche, and sapelli, some of which grow to heights of 70 metres or more. There are also numerous ferns and orchids. This forest is stratified into several levels. The first is composed of straight, thick-rooted trees averaging about 40-metres tall. After this grow shorter, thinner trees with highly <b>placed</b> clusters <b>of</b> <b>leaves.</b> Sparse grasses and other plants make up the ground layer. In areas closer to settlements and roads, human groups have harvested the larger trees, thus exposing the forest floor to more direct sunlight and allowing thick vegetation to thrive. The upper third of the province (beginning at about the latitude of Bertoua and Batouri) is dominated by humid, wooded savanna. Trees here are sparser, but still may grow to be as tall as 20 metres.|$|R
