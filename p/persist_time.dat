40|$|A new {{detection}} method {{has been proposed}} to study the transition process of abrupt climate change. With this method, the climate system transiting from one stable state to another can be verified clearly. By applying this method to the global sea surface temperature over the past century, several climate changes and their processes are detected, including the start state (moment), <b>persist</b> <b>time,</b> and end state (moment). According to the spatial distribution, the locations of climate changes mainly {{have occurred in the}} Indian Ocean and western Pacific before the middle twentieth century, in the 1970 s in the equatorial middle-eastern Pacific, and in the middle and southern Pacific {{since the end of the}} twentieth century. In addition, the quantitative relationship between the transition process parameters is verified in theory and practice: (1)  the relationship between the rate and stability parameters is linear, and (2)  the relationship between the rate and change amplitude parameters is quadratic...|$|E

40|$|How do objects <b>persist</b> through <b>time?</b> According to endurantism, objects <b>persist</b> through <b>time</b> and do {{not have}} {{temporal}} parts. According to the transcendentist version of endurantism, objects exist at times by participating in events that occur at those times. This version of transcendentism offers specific metaphysical and semantical advantages over other versions of endurantism. In this paper, we defend transcendentist endurantism against a series of criticisms that have been recently offered by Kristie Miller...|$|R

Le Poidevin has argued that four-dimensionalism better accommodates two common assumptions concerning persistence and continuity; namely, that time itself is continuous and that objects <b>persist</b> in <b>time</b> in a continuous way. To this purpose, he has offered two independent arguments, each of which moves from a different understanding of continuity.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} free cash flow on the agency costs and how these free cash flow and agency costs affect the performance of REITs in Asia.

The results indicate that free cash flow and agency costs <b>persist</b> over <b>time</b> in Asian REITs even though REITs are in a highly regulated industry. The findings also imply that REIT managers face substantial costs when they wish {{to adjust to the}} equilibrium level of agency costs, whereby the optimum level is always dynamic and not constant over time and moves with the changes in the determinants of agency costs. These agency costs <b>persist</b> over <b>time</b> and have significant impacts on the performance of REITs in Asia...|$|R
