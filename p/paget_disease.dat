40|$|Abstract Background Mammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> and extramammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> are {{neoplastic}} conditions, {{in which}} there is intraepithelial (usually intraepidermal) infiltration by neoplastic cells showing glandular differentiation. Mammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> occurs exclusively on the nipple/areola complex from where it may spread to the surrounding skin. Case presentation We here describe a case of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> occurring on the thoracic wall site of a previous simple mastectomy, and also briefly summarise the most important aspects leading to a diagnosis of mammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease.</b> Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of mammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> occurring after mastectomy. The absence of the nipple/areola complex obviously raised some questions concerning whether it was mammary or extra-mammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease,</b> and how it could occur {{in the absence of the}} nipple/areola complex. </p...|$|R

50|$|Acute rheumatic fever post-inflammatory is {{the cause}} of less than 10% of cases. Rare causes of aortic {{stenosis}} include Fabry disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, <b>Paget</b> <b>disease,</b> high blood uric acid levels, and infection.|$|E
50|$|Chronic spinal {{inflammatory}} {{conditions such}} as <b>Paget</b> <b>disease,</b> neurosarcoidosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, ankylosing spondylitis and chronic tuberculosis can cause it.

40|$|Mammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> {{is a rare}} intraepithelial adenocarcinoma, {{located on}} the nipple/areola complex, highly {{associated}} with breast cancer. Although the international literature emphasizes the dermatoscopic pattern of mammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> pigmented variant, the authors describe the dermoscopic findings of classical <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> and demonstrate the presence of chrysalis-like structures, criteria recently described in the literature and not yet reported in <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of {{the penis}} {{may also be}} primary or secondary, and is even rarer than genital <b>Paget’s</b> <b>disease</b> in women.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the pathogenesis of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva and the breast remains limited. Current evidence supports the fact that angiogenesis {{plays an important role}} in the pathogenesis of several diseases. Therefore, we sought to define its role, as correlated with microvessel density, in <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva and the breast. Microvessels were analysed using anti-von Willebrand factor antibody in 105 cases of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva and the breast comprising 71 cases of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva, including 8 cases with invasive disease, and 34 cases of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the breast. The latter included 12 cases with DCIS, 5 cases with both DCIS and invasive carcinoma, and 6 with carcinoma alone. Eleven cases had no underlying tumour identified. Increased microvessel density was demonstrated in <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the breast with DCIS and with carcinoma alone compared to <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the breast alone, < 0. 08 and < 0. 013, respectively. There were no significant differences in microvessel density in the vulval cases. Neovascularisation is an important process in the development of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the breast. Other biological and molecular processes are more involved in the pathogenesis of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva...|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{hereditary}} {{factor in the}} development of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of bone.

40|$|Mammary and extramammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> are {{uncommon}} intraepithelial adenocarcinomas. Both {{conditions have}} similar clinical features, which mimic inflammatory and infective diseases. Histological diagnostic confusion can arise between <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> and other neoplastic conditions affecting the skin, {{with the most}} common differential diagnoses being malignant melanoma and atypical squamous disease. The glandular differentiation of both mammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> and extramammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> is indicated by morphological appearances, the presence of intracellular mucin in many cases, and positive immunohistochemical staining for glandular cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, and carcinoembryonic antigen. This article {{provides an overview of}} mammary and extramammary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> and discusses recent evidence regarding the cell of origin. The concepts of primary and secondary <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> are presented and the differential diagnosis is discussed with reference to immunohistochemical markers that might be of diagnostic value...|$|R

5000|$|Inclusion body {{myopathy}} with early-onset <b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> and {{frontotemporal dementia}} (IBMPFD) is an autosomal dominant and caused by mutations in VCP, HNRPA2B1 or HNRNPA1; it is a multisystem degenerative disorder that {{is characterized by}} muscle weakness that sets in during adulthood, early-onset <b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> of bone, and premature frontotemporal dementia. It spreads to other systems and results in respiratory or cardiac failure. [...] A condition with mutations in the same genes has been called Multisystem proteinopathy (MSP) or Inclusion body myopathy with frontotemporal dementia, Paget’s disease of bone, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“IBMPFD/ALS”). [...] 2013 review sought to explain the degenerative process in diseases like MSP, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, via the development of pathological granules containing RNA and protein.|$|E
50|$|Vulvar <b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> {{presents}} as {{a variety}} of clinical lesions that may occur over a protracted course. Initially it is velvety, soft, and red or bright pink with scattered white islands of hyperkeratosis. (a strawberry and cream appearance) The lesions become erythematous, plaque like, and desquamating especially when located in dry areas. Rarely the appearance is ulcerated. The borders appear irregular, slightly elevated, and sharply demarcated. The visible borders of vulvar <b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> are often misleading as Paget cells may spread along the basal layers of normal appearing skin with multicentric foci. Involvement may be extensive including the perianal region, genitocrural, and inguinal folds. Clinical examination should determine the presence of periurethral and perianal lesions. In these cases an involvement of the skin by a noncutaneous internal neoplasm may occur.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> varies considerably with geographic location. Paget's predominantly affects people of European descent, whereas people of African, Asian, or Indian descent are less commonly affected. <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> is less common in Switzerland and Scandinavia {{than in the}} rest of Western Europe. <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> is uncommon in the native populations of North and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

40|$|<b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva {{and breast}} are rare <b>diseases.</b> Unlike <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the breast, where the {{consensus}} is that the great majority of cases are associated with an in- situ or invasive ductal carcinoma, only approximately 10 - 30 % of cases of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva have an invasive adenocarcinoma present. It is believed that the Paget cells in <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the breast are derived from the underlying in-situ or invasive breast carcinoma, and these cells migrate up through the ducts onto the nipple epidermis. The histogenesis underlying vulval <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> is unclear. <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva may become secondarily invasive {{even in the absence of}} an underlying malignancy. The aim of the study was to identify abnormalities present in <b>Paget's</b> <b>diseases</b> of the vulva and the breast and to investigate whether there are any differences in molecular markers in the Paget cells of those cases with invasive disease compared to those cases without invasive disease. Such an analysis may identify some of the molecular pathways underlying both vulval and breast <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease,</b> as well as generating potential markers for clinical prognosis. Archival paraffin wax-embedded sections of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva or breast were used. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to analyse markers involved in the cell cycle (p 53, pRb, cyclin Dl, Ki 67), in angiogenesis (e. g. VEGF, PD-ECGF/TP, MVD) and cell adhesion molecules (e. g. plakoglobin, E-cadherin, ~-catenin). Sections that were immunopositive for the tumour marker p 53 were microdissected, the DNA extracted, amplified and sequenced. In situ hybridisation was also used to determine the presence ofmRNA of the adhesion molecules in the tissue sections. A national register for <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva was established requesting that clinicians who have patients with <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva should enrol them. Results suggest E-cadherin, plakoglobin and pRb and p 53 may have a role to play in the pathogenesis of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva and pRb, plakoglobin, VEGF and PD- ECGF/TP in <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the breast. Wide local excison was the preferred treatment option for patients registered in the PDV database. The information form the Paget's register and the results obtained from the thesis may increase the understanding of <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the vulva and breast.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Hyperprolactinemia is an {{uncommon}} cause of erectile dysfunction in men. <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> {{of the skull}} is a relatively common disease. This case proposes a rare example of a causative link between the two and how treatment of the <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> with bisphosphonates helped the patient regain erectile function. Case presentation A 67 -year-old man with <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the skull presented with prostatitis, erectile dysfunction, and hyperprolactinemia. Radio-isotope scanning showed increased vascularity around the sphenoid bone. Treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates improved the active <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> as indicated by declining alkaline phosphatase levels and the patient's erectile function while serum prolactin levels became normal and serum testosterone levels remained unchanged. Conclusion It is possible that hyperprolactinemia is unrecognised in other patients with <b>Paget's</b> <b>disease</b> of the skull.

40|$|Background: Pigmented mammary <b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> {{represents}} a rare variant of mammary <b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> that clinically and dermoscopically simulates a melanoma. We report {{a case of}} pigmented mammary <b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> mimicking a melanoma and describe the dermoscopic, reflectance-mode confocal microscopic, histological, and immunohistochemical features. Observations: A 70 -year-old woman had a 5. 5 X 4 -cm pigmented plaque with a thin, scaly surface on her left breast; the plaque had slowly but progressively grown during the preceding 10 years. Dermoscopic examination showed a diffuse, light brown pigmentation with irregular black dots, small gray-blue structures, and irregular vessels.

40|$|<b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a common}} bone disease {{characterized}} by abnormal osteoclasts that are large, multinucleated, and overactive and that contain paramyxovirus-like nuclear inclusions. There is evidence for a major genetic component to <b>Paget</b> <b>disease,</b> with up to 40 % of patients having affected first-degree relatives; however, the locus (loci) and gene(s) involved are unknown. Another bone disorder, familial expansile osteolysis (FEO), although extremely rare, also is characterized by similar osteoclast abnormalities but has an earlier age at onset and a more aggressive clinical progression. The causative gene for FEO has been localized to a region of human chromosome 18 q. On {{the basis of the}} presence of similar clinical findings and of viral-like nuclear inclusions in osteoclasts, we hypothesized that FEO and <b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> are allelic versions of the same locus. Therefore, a large kindred with a high incidence of <b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> was examined to determine if <b>Paget</b> <b>disease</b> was linked to genetic markers in the same region of chromosome 18 as that for FEO.

This study aims to summarize the clinicopathologic characteristics related to the prognosis of scrotal <b>Paget’s</b> <b>disease</b> with underlying sweat gland adenocarcinoma. Clinical datum of four patients with scrotal <b>Paget’s</b> <b>disease</b> with sweat gland carcinoma, treated in Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital from 2002 to 2009 was analyzed, and a literature review was conducted. The typical manifestation of scrotal <b>Paget’s</b> <b>disease</b> with sweat gland carcinoma was eczematoid-like skin lesions. All patients underwent primary lesion resection plus inguinal lymphadenectomy. Three patients had inguinal lymph metastasis. One of them developed distant metastases in bone and bone marrow and died of metastatic carcinoma. The dead patient had higher serum carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA) level, Her- 2 overexpression and shorter disease course than the other patients.
