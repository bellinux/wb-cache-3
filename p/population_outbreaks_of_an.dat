40|$|In Brazil, the {{custard apple}} or sugar apple (Annona squa-mosa L.) (Annonaceae) {{is the most}} widely {{cultivated}} of all spe-cies of Annona {{because of the high}} commercial value of its fruit pulp and seeds. It also has a considerable potential for export as an exotic fruit (Cordeiro et al. 2000; Pereira et al. 2009). One of the most important of the wide range of pests known to attack Annona spp. is the fruit borer Cerconota anonella Sepp., 1830 (Lepidoptera, Oecophoridae) (Gallo et al. 2002). This moth causes significant direct and indirect damage to the fruit and pulp reducing the commercial value for consumption in natura and for industrial processing (Broglio-Micheletti et al. 2001; Gallo et al. 2002).

40|$|PosterSince the 1970 s, {{changes in}} {{agricultural}} practices in French mountain areas have produced large homogeneous grassland ecosystems. This {{has led to}} <b>population</b> <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grassland rodent, the fossorial water vole (Arvicola terrestris) which causes severe damages on harvests and economic losses. Predators {{are believed to be}} an important regulating factor of the water vole population dynamics. During 8 years, A. terrestris populations and their diurnal predators were monitored on 5 study sites in Auvergne. Here we focus on the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), the most abundant predator locally, and we examine if this species responds to vole population and landscape feature variations. Analyses were performed using generalized linear mixed effect models. Results showed positive relationships between A. terrestris and B. buteo densities in autumn without time-lag and in spring with <b>a</b> time-lag <b>of</b> one year. Furthermore, large abundances of common buzzard were associated with <b>an</b> important number <b>of</b> patches of forest and small size plots of grassland. In the literature and compared to open grassland, those areas have lower population densities and smaller fluctuations <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> terrestris in average. However, although our results were suggestive, here we failed to detect such a difference statistically, probably due to the relatively small sample size used in our study. This study confirms that the common buzzard favours fine grain landscape mosaic of wood and grasslands and that current or past abundance of water voles modulate the common buzzard foraging strategy. This has important consequences in term of pest control and biological conservation...|$|R

Limited understanding <b>of</b> crown-of-thorns <b>outbreaks</b> is due, at least in part, to <b>a</b> critical lack <b>of</b> data on the structure and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> planci populations. Therefore, this study examined fine-scale (within reef) patterns in the size structure, distribution, and abundance <b>of</b> starfish <b>populations,</b> during <b>an</b> <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> planci in the northern Great Barrier Reef. The outbreak resulted from steady and prolonged increase in starfish densities, over a three year period. Furthermore, starfish populations comprised individuals from at least four different year classes, suggesting that the outbreak was caused by progressive accumulation of starfish from multiple recruitment events. Overall densities <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> planci increased to 1. 0 starfish per 200 m ² (± 0. 1 SE), in January 1997, and then remained fairly constant until June 1998, after which time starfish densities declined rapidly. During the <b>outbreak,</b> densities <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> planci varied greatly among locations (separated by 0. 5 - 8 km), and also between reef zones (7 metres) in some exposed locations.

40|$|International audienceThe loss or gain {{of certain}} host species may either dilute or amplify {{the risk of}} {{pathogen}} and parasite infection through direct or indirect effects. The relative contribution of host communities combined with climate and landscape characteristics on non-vector-borne parasite transmission to humans has been a relatively neglected area of investigation. Based on a case study, we explore how landscape epidemiology and landscape ecology can contribute to better understand spatial and temporal processes of pathogen dynamics. Research carried out in different intermediate host communities of Western Europe and continental China indicate more intensive zoonotic transmission of the cestode E. multilocularis in homogeneous landscapes with larger areas of optimal habitats for one or some host species in low diversity small mammal communities, making multi-annual <b>population</b> <b>outbreaks</b> more likely. Those results {{support the notion that}} landscape, small mammal host diversity and their population dynamics alter prey - predator relationships and associated host/parasite transmission, hence modify the transmission of endemic infections. Here, landscape and biodiversity may protect humans from zoonotic parasite transmission where they prevent <b>population</b> <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few specific small mammal host species. Most landscapes, e. g. changing mosaics of habitats and communities, are anthropogenic and characterized by various degrees of habitat fragmentation with emergent properties. Those spatial configurations have direct and indirect effects on ecological processes, and may cause <b>a</b> cascade <b>of</b> factors that exacerbate or slow down the spread of pathogens. Retrospective analyses strongly suggest that increased transmission of E. multilocularis in the Jura massif, eastern France, and in China, even though habitats and species are different, originate from anthropogenic landscape alterations. Encouraged by the European agriculture common policy, farmers in the Doubs department, France, specialized in milk/cheese production in the 1960 s and converted most ploughed fields into permanent grassland in mountain areas. With the destruction of hedges, this shifted the regional systems towards a more highly productive agriculture and triggered large scale small mammal <b>outbreaks</b> with <b>a</b> cascade <b>of</b> consequences in agriculture, biological conservation and public health. In China, similar effects came from deforestation and agriculture encroachments during the 1980 s, extending areas favourable to small mammal intermediate host species prone to multiannual <b>population</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> This strongly suggests that functional invariants are at stake whatever the ecosystems, and that the impacts of landscape on community processes and population dynamics interfere with disease regulation and lead to more or less "healthy" landscapes. In such a context, disease regulation cannot be contemplated alone. It should be considered in a systems approach and taken into account together with other associated issues such as biodiversity, landscape management, small mammal pest control, conservation of protected species, game management, etc. Following Patz et al. (2004), we believe that strong transdisciplinary research partnerships need to be forged to approach the research with the degree of creative thinking and comprehensiveness required by the nature of those system issues. Investigators must consider how they can integrate their findings into the social, economic, and political dialogue on both the ecosystems and health, globally and locally...|$|R
40|$|Many {{echinoderm}} larvae exhibit phenotypic plasticity: {{a change}} in phenotype in response to environmental food levels. We investigated phenotypic plasticity in the larvae of the crown-of-thorns seastar Acanthaster planci, an opportunistic boom-and-bust species with larvae that have a strong response to food conditions. The increased predation pressure resulting from <b>outbreaks</b> (<b>population</b> explosions) <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> planci is deleterious to coral reefs, but the link between <b>population</b> <b>outbreaks</b> and larval ecology is poorly understood. We hypothesised that the larvae <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> planci would have a different morphological profile in the oligotrophic conditions typical of tropical waters than in the eutrophic conditions associated with increased nutrients. We predicted that larvae reared in low food conditions would increase their ciliated band length to enhance feeding potential. Larvae were fed algal concentrations representing starvation (0 cells ml- 1), low food (oligotrophic; 1000 cells ml- 1), high food (eutrophic; 10000 cells ml- 1) or excessive food (100000 cells ml- 1) conditions. A phenotypic response was evident. Larvae in the 2 high food treatments had a shorter ciliated band length relative to body size. Conversely, larvae in the starvation and low food treatments had longer ciliated bands relative to body size, a change that would enhance particle capture capacity and facilitate larval success. This plastic response of the larvae <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> planci could have flow-on effects to adult populations, potentially facilitating <b>population</b> <b>outbreaks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{resilience}} of networks to various types <b>of</b> failures is <b>an</b> undercurrent {{in many parts}} of graph theory and network algorithms. In this paper we study the {{resilience of}} networks in the presence of cascading failures — failures that spread from one node to another across the network structure. One finds such cascading processes at work in the kind of contagious failures that spread among financial institutions during a financial crisis, through nodes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> power grid or communication network during a widespread outage, or through a human <b>population</b> during the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> epidemic disease. A widely studied model of cascades in networks assumes that each node v of the network has a threshold ℓ(v), and fails if it has at least ℓ(v) failed neighbors. We assume that each node selects a threshold ℓ(v) independently using a probability distribution µ. Our work centers on a parameter that we call the µ-risk <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graph: the maximum failure probability of any node in the graph, in this threshold cascade model parameterized by threshold distribution µ. This defines a very broad class of models; for example, the large literature on edge percolation, in which propagation happens along edges that are included independently at random with some probability p, takes place in <b>a</b> small part <b>of</b> the parameter space of threshold cascade models, and one where the distribution µ is monotonically decreasing with the threshold.
