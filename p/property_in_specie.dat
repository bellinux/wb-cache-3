40|$|There are notable {{differences}} <b>in</b> functional <b>properties</b> {{of primary}} visual cortex (V 1) neurons among mammalian species, particularly those concerning the occurrence of simple and complex cells and the generation of orientation selectivity. Here, we present quantitative data on receptive field (RF) structure, response modulation, and orientation tuning for single neurons in V 1 of the tree shrew, a close relative of primates. We find that spatial RF subfield segregation, a criterion for identifying simple cells, was exceedingly small in the tree shrew V 1. In contrast, many neurons exhibited elevated F 1 /F 0 modulation that is often used as a simple cell marker. This apparent discrepancy {{can be explained by}} the robust stimulus polarity preference in tree shrew V 1, which inflates F 1 /F 0 ratio values. RF structure mapped with sparse-noise—which is spatially restricted and emphasizes thalamo-cortical feed-forward inputs—appeared unrelated to orientation selectivity. However, RF structure mapped using the Hartley subspace stimulus—which covers a large area of the visual field and recruits considerable intracortical processing—did predict orientation preference. Our findings reveal a number of striking similarities in V 1 functional organization between tree shrews and primates, emphasizing the important role of intracortical recurrent processing in shaping V 1 response <b>properties</b> <b>in</b> these <b>specie...</b>|$|R
