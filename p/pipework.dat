5|$|The organ {{was totally}} reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, {{retaining}} the existing instrument {{as far as}} was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals, and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than {{the sides of the}} case. New 75percent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in Saxmundham, Suffolk, was provided to allow sound egress {{from the bottom of the}} case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some <b>pipework</b> from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 <b>pipework,</b> and 21 contain 1895 <b>pipework.</b> Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new <b>pipework,</b> 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has tracker key action on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout.|$|E
5|$|The 1883 Hill and Son organ, {{including}} 844 pipes, costing a {{total of}} £550, was installed in 1884, and located in the north-east corner of the transept. It is still in use, with original <b>pipework,</b> making it faithful to the original tones. The organ was refurbished and rebuilt in 1950, 1975, and 2008.|$|E

50|$|Part of Digital Bros, <b>Pipeworks</b> Studio began {{life as an}} {{independent}} studio with senior artists, designers, and programmers from such titles as Tribes, Pro Pilot, Populous, Aces, 3D Ultra, Front Page Sports, and Coaster. <b>Pipeworks</b> is a key developer of software and technology for PC, Consoles, and Mobile. Based in Eugene, Oregon, the studio is known for creating live games. <b>Pipeworks</b> develops games for platforms including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Mobile, Nintendo Wii U, and the PC. Some of their released titles include Godzilla - Smash3 for iOS and Android; and World Series of Poker: Full House Pro on Xbox 360. Deadliest Warrior: The Game for the X360 and PS3 {{is one of its}} most popular creations. <b>Pipeworks</b> is currently developing a variety of original IP.

5|$|The metal <b>pipework</b> {{was stolen}} after {{the closure of}} the chapel, and, as part of the {{restoration}} project discussed above, it was decided to bring in a replacement instrument. The one chosen was by the same maker and had become redundant after having been used in two churches in the Manchester area (Kersal Moor and Ordsall).|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s until 2009 the {{buildings}} were used as a barn for animals and agricultural machinery. It has since been restored and had a biomass boiler installed. During the restoration an unexplained series of unusual <b>pipework</b> was discovered in {{the floor of the}} building. The building now acts as a visitor centre, which includes access to the dynamo room where acetylene gas was produced along with a thermalume generator which produced gas from petrol and air.|$|E
5|$|It {{was again}} rebuilt by them in 1930, {{and then by}} Hill, Norman and Beard in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58. In 1972 this was {{increased}} {{to a total of}} 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence– the 1895 <b>pipework</b> contrasting sharply with that of 1972– and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{comfortable}} upbringing and {{his high}} social status, Pearson was a radical, and {{throughout his life}} he fought a number of campaigns on progressive and reforming issues including the removal from the Monument inscription blaming the Great Fire of London on Catholics, the abolition of packed special jury lists for political trials, and the overturning of the ban on Jews becoming brokers in the City. Pearson was in favour of the disestablishment of the Church of England and opposed capital punishment. Politically, he supported universal suffrage and electoral reform to balance the sizes of parliamentary constituencies. He unsuccessfully attempted to break the local monopolies developed by the gas companies, calling for the distribution <b>pipework</b> to be owned collectively by the consumers.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, {{an organ}} by Gray & Davison of London was {{installed}} in the cathedral, replacing an instrument with parts dating back to 1626. The organ was rebuilt and enlarged by Whiteley Bros of Chester in 1876, to include harmonic flutes and reeds by Cavaillé-Coll. It was later moved to its present position {{at the front of}} the north transept. In 1910 William Hill and Son of London extensively rebuilt and revoiced the organ, replacing the Cavaillé-Coll reeds with new pipes of their own. The choir division of the organ was enlarged and moved behind the choirstalls on the south side. The instrument was again overhauled by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool in 1969, when a new mechanism and some new <b>pipework</b> made to a design by the organist, Roger Fisher, was installed. Since 1991 the organ has been in the care of David Wells of Liverpool.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pipeworks</b> Brewing Company is a brewery in Chicago, Illinois. The brewery {{opened in}} January 2012 by founders Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis. <b>Pipeworks</b> began their brewing {{different}} from other microbreweries in that they initially brewed their beers entirely {{as a series of}} 'one off' beers that were aimed specifically to the niche market of beer connoisseurs. The brewery's stated goal is to release a new beer every week. This approach gave the brewery and its beers somewhat of a cult status among beer enthusiasts, with its offerings selling out relatively quickly. After seeing significant growth, both in output brand and identity, <b>Pipeworks</b> has since augmented their one-off beers with several of its 'core' beers in 16 ounce can 4-Packs now regularly available widley throughout the Chicago area.|$|R

25|$|Even {{before the}} {{downlink}} signal was lost due to distance, the hydrazine attitude control {{fuel on board}} the spacecraft was considered likely to freeze, as the radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) failed to generate enough power for the heaters to overcome radiative heat loss into space. Once the hydrazine froze, the spacecraft {{would no longer be}} able to maneuver to keep its high gain antenna pointing towards Earth, and the downlink signal would then be lost in a matter of days. The failure of the X-band communications subsystem hastened this, because the coldest part of the fuel <b>pipework</b> was routed over the X-band TWTAs, because when one of them was operating, this kept this part of the <b>pipework</b> warm enough.|$|E
