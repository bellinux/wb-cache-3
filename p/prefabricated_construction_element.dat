The second part of the graduation work dives deeper into the creation of parametric dinamic construction components and development of plug-ins for 3 D modelling software SketchUp, which does not yet include such a set of parametric components. We created a database of components for prefabricated concrete elements and SketchUp plug-ins, which are then used to create a 3 D model of an industrial facility, that serves as an example for all the advantages of component use (easier, faster and more precise modelling).

40|$|AbstractConstruction {{elements}} {{manufacturing plants}} functioning {{on the global}} market face different types of risks. It is necessary to consider and manage all of the risk occurrences {{in order to maintain}} a leading position in construction market, regardless of its influence on the manufacturing plant. Achieving this is possible, among other things, through the development of appropriate models including operating procedures [6, 11], which are combined with each other chronologically. This paper presents procedure based on the measurement of selected risk occurrences related to manufacturing plant and within a usage of a statistical method. For this purpose, a specific manufacturing plant was used and survey-based research was carried out. The selected measurement method uses a probabilistic approach, including random variables and probability distributions, by which the risks occurring in the manufacturing plant can be described. The potential costs were assigned to each risk occurrence using the Delphi method and by consulting the experts in the field of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> <b>elements.</b> In addition, 2 or 3 scenarios concerning minimum and maximum or minimum, average and maximum values of potential cost associated with each risk occurrence, have been developed. As a result, it was possible to estimate the total value of risk occurrences in the manufacturing plant and present it in the form of a probability density function. For this purpose, the Central Limit Theorem was used. The summary of the paper contains the further information related to determination of correlation coefficient between risk occurrences...|$|R

40|$|Wood is a pure, sustainable, {{renewable}} material. The {{increasing use of}} {{wood for}} construction can improve its sustainability. There are various techniques to assemble multi-layer wooden panels into <b>prefabricated,</b> load-bearing <b>construction</b> <b>elements.</b> However, comparative market and economy studies are still scarce. In this study, the following assembling techniques were compared: laminating, nailing, stapling, screwing, stress laminating, doweling, dovetailing, and wood welding. The production costs, durability, and ecological considerations were presented. This study was based on reviews of published works and information gathered from 27 leading wood product manufacturing companies in six European countries. The study shows that the various techniques of assembling multi-layer wooden <b>construction</b> panel <b>elements</b> are very different. Cross laminated timber (CLT) exhibited the best results in terms of cost and durability. With regard to ecological concerns, dovetailing is the best. Taking into account both durability and ecological considerations, wooden screw-doweling is the best. These alternatives give manufacturers some freedom of choice regarding the visibility of surfaces and the efficient use of lower-quality timber. CLT is the most cost-effective, is not patented, and is a well-established option on the market today. Validerad; 2015; Nivå 2; 20150827 (aliwan) </p...|$|R
40|$|Many {{types of}} archival {{material}} and cultural heritage objects {{can only be}} preserved in an adequate store or archive. Most museums continue to collect but the space to store growing collections is rarely expanded, {{and in many cases}} it may even be reduced in favour of additional exhibition space. Archives face a comparable situation. Every archive has the duty to conserve historical documents, which results in hundreds of kilometres of new archival documents every year to be stored and preserved. The probability that during an archivist's lifetime a new archive building will be built or the existing one will have to be extended is about 100 %. Museums designed in the last 40 years are characterised by a series of specific functions. However, as all architectural typologies are subject to a process of change and modernisation, museums have also evolved over time to become more complex. Museums have changed from spaces of permanent exhibition, storage and conservation to public places with various functions including permanent and temporary exhibitions, study and science, storage and conservation, restaurants, commercial and education facilities and other multi-use activities. During this development, provision of sufficient storage space for collections has occasionally been overlooked. Few museums are able to store their entire collections permanently inside their main buildings. Large parts of museum or archive collections may be located in off-site storage, where they can be exposed to significant risks of damage. Although storage {{is at the heart of}} a museum's function, in some cases surprisingly little attention is paid to providing adequate storage conditions. International standards prescribe tight climate control values, which lead to energy- and cost- consuming airconditioning systems. However, these systems do not achieve the desired results for collections nor are they affordable in the long term. Even in times of reduced cultural budgets and rising energy prices many museums and archives pour resources into unique and expensive buildings designed to meet those climate requirements and satisfy design aesthetics. Extensive heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems are installed to achieve stable environments and the high energy and maintenance costs are accepted. This situation was the starting point for a study in 2011 at the Fraunhofer-Institute for Building Physics (IBP). Its main focus was on passively conditioned zero-energy storage and archive buildings. The objective was to develop an economical and sustainable solution for a zero-energy building, which achieved conservation requirements, neutral energy balance and modular design. The Fraunhofer-Institute designed a new zero-energy storage system with the following research objectives: 1. Easy and economical storage and archive solutions 2. Sustainable planning 3. Multipliable concepts by modular components 4. Cost-efficiency by applying <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> 5. Providing market-ready energy-efficient concepts. Museums and archives are repositories of knowledge for a modern society; therefore, energy-efficient solutions for these buildings are necessary to maintain valued collections over generations. The results of the study demonstrate that zero-energy storage systems are possible and that technical solutions are partially ready for the market...|$|R

40|$|<b>Prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> is a {{sustainable}} alternative to traditional on-site construction methods. However, many challenges still {{exist in the}} <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> process. For example, self-manufacturing or outsourcing decisions are vital to the industrial structure and organization of the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> industry, and the company’s production and operation decision-making. This paper considers a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> supply chain, which is composed of one upstream component manufacturing company and two downstream contractors. The large contractor can get the precast component through self-manufacturing or outsourcing, while the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) contractor can only buy components from the component manufacturer. A comprehensive game model (Cournot-Stackelberg model) under different decisions, that is, component self-manufacturing or outsourcing, was established. By solving the profit functions of different companies in the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> supply chain, the equilibrium solutions of output, price and profit can be achieved. These solutions of equilibrium indicate the optimal decision on the production and operation, and the profit’s boundary conditions. After assuming relevant parameters, the profit levels of the companies in the supply chain are analyzed via a dynamic simulation in the changing process of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> market size under different behavioral decisions. The conclusions are as follows: (1) the profit levels of all supply chain enterprises and the whole supply chain are increasing with an increase of market size; (2) the downstream contractors and the whole supply chain have a higher profit level under the component self-manufacturing decision, however, on the contrary, the upstream component suppliers get a higher profit level under the component outsourcing decision; (3) the equilibrium output of the SME contractor is reduced under the outsourcing decision of the large contractor, and the SME contractor is at a disadvantage in market competition, which is particularlyfull of risk when the market size is not big enough, but higher profit level can be expected as the market size increases. According {{to the results of}} the game-theoreticanalysis and the numerical simulation, managerial implications are put forward from the angles of extensive publicity, mandatory implementation, strengthening industrial chain integration, and intensifying component factory guidance to promote the development of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction.</b> Finally, the main problems which need to be studied further in the future are presented...|$|R
40|$|<b>Prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> is {{believed}} to be energy conserving though opportunities for achieving higher energy efficiency have yet to be fully harnessed. From investigation of a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> project in Hong Kong, two main problems have been revealed relating to energy consumption, including: i) inefficient management of resources such as labours and machines, and ii) inefficient production, transportation, and on-site assembly of prefabricated components. These problems are primarily caused by lagged information communication and human errors. This paper seeks to offer a solution by developing a Physical Internet-enabled Building Information Modelling System (PI-BIMS) that integrates Auto-ID technologies, BIM, and cloud computing. The PI-BIMS enables real-time collection, communication, and visualization of information across the processes of production, transportation, and on-site assembly. Practical issues of the system implementation are provided through a pilot prototype. It is found that the PI-BIMS helps enhance the resource allocation efficiency and decrease human errors.

On the other hand, prefabrication for residential construction has been used in Thailand for only less than two decades. However, the prefabrication construction in Thailand has grown rapidly from the past five years. Recently, there are many new developers, and contractors who have switched from a traditional construction to prefabrication to keep up the rising in Thai residential market. Moreover, the new minimum wage policy from Thai government has hit Thai construction business very hard. The labor cost has raised more than 40 % in some area (Thai Department of labor, 2013) since 2012. Thai developers see prefabrication as a future and ready to invest more in this type of construction. (Krunthep Thurakit, 2013) Currently, there are many construction products from the U.

40|$|As a {{sustainable}} <b>construction</b> method, <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> is increasingly being adopted worldwide to enhance productivity and {{to alleviate the}} adverse environmental and social effects {{as a result of}} conventional construction activities. In addressing management issues of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction,</b> an impressive number of studies have been published by internationally renowned journals related to construction management over the past decades. However, it seems that a systematic summary on the research development in the management of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> (MPC) discipline is lacking. Therefore, this paper examines the latest research trend in this discipline by analyzing published construction management research in 10 leading journals during the period from 2000 to 2013 (as of end of June) in terms of the annual number of MPC papers, contributions of institutions, adopted data collection and processing methods, and research interest. The analysis reveals that prefabrication is becoming increasingly important to the entire construction industry. Researchers from developed countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, Sweden, and Australia, have made significant contributions {{to the development of the}} prefabrication domain, while those from developing countries, including China, Turkey, and Israel where construction remains as their main economic activity, have shown increasing interest in promoting prefabrication-related research. Major research topics in MPC include “industry prospect”, “development and application”, “performance evaluation”, “environment for technology application”, and “design, production, transportation and assembly strategies”. Moreover, some innovative technologies, such as Global Position System (GPS), and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), have been effectively applied in this field and are considered as strong vehicles in improving the performance of future <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> practices. This study is of value in helping scholars gain an in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art of MPC research and allows them to continue from the findings of previous studies.

However, some other concerns such as design considerations and coordination of factory and on-site activities, may be easily undermined if an appropriate procurement method is not selected. In a precast concrete construction, for instance, precast members require highly skilled workers, more complex techniques, and a more complex design. Because the design professionals need to concentrate on perfecting the modular design, the intensive administrative work may be neglected. To include these managerial task in a modular construction's equation, this study presents a fundamental understanding of modular and/or pre-fabricated systems and suggests a construction procurement method based on project type to satisfy this short coming and to achieve sustainable modular construction...|$|R
