50|$|After quitting Hanover Beamish devoted much {{attention}} to Norse antiquities, and in 1841 published {{a summary of the}} researches of Professor Carl Christian Rafn, relative to the discovery of America by the Northmen in the tenth century. Although the fact had been notified as early as 1828 (in a letter in Niles' Register, Boston, U.S.), it was very little known. Beamish's modest volume not only popularised the discovery by epitomising the <b>principal</b> <b>details</b> in Rafn's great work Antiquitates Americanæ (Copenhagen, 1837), but it contains, in the shape of translations from the Sagas, one of the best summaries of Icelandic historical literature anywhere to be found within an equal space.

For a considerable while he was engaged in teaching: classics, six years; rhetoric, one year; philosophy, four years. After this he became a celebrated pulpit orator, preaching for the next twenty-five years in the more important cities of France. During {{the remainder of his}} life he was principally occupied in writing sermons. He died on 21 March 1729, at Paris. His obituary in the archives of the Society, besides his talent as an orator, praises his never-tiring industry, both as a speaker and a writer. Among his virtues, his faithful observance of the rules, even to the ninety-ninth year of his life, is especially mentioned.|$|E

The three houses have feature curved windows with projecting low pitched canopies - and coopered water butts (illus).The <b>principal</b> <b>details</b> not shared with the main house are the round stair towers, the absence of dressed masonry to the entrances, and the deliberately contrary vertical walls with battered chimney stacks.

40|$|The <b>principal</b> <b>details</b> of Cr film {{growth on}} Mo 110 at {{elevated}} temperature are described. Cr films form nanostripes by the step-flow growth mechanism for film coverages up to 3 monolayers. In {{contrast to the}} Fe/Mo 110 system, {{there is no indication}} of strain relaxation in either the first, second, or third layers. The Cr nanostripes remain pseudomorphic up to the onset of Stranski-Krastanov growth, which is typified by the formation of nanowedge islands. This is accompanied by the formation of a two-dimensional dislocation network within the nanowedge islands. Two types of steps can be observed on top of the Cr nanowedges, unlike the Fe/Mo 110 system where the 110 surface of the Fe nanowedges is unbroken by any steps. The first are monatomic steps formed by incomplete Cr layers, while the second are fractional steps formed between adjacent layers with different degrees of tetragonal distortion. The fractional steps are modeled using the first principles calculations...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{describe}} a new technique for tricuspid valve repair in Ebstein’s anomaly and to report early echocardiographic results, as well as early and midterm clinical outcomes. MethodsFrom November 1993 through August 2005, 40 consecutive patients with Ebstein’s anomaly (mean age, 16. 8 ± 12. 3 years) underwent a new surgical repair modified from Carpentier’s procedure, the <b>principal</b> <b>details</b> of which are as follows. The anterior and posterior tricuspid valve leaflets are mobilized from their anomalous attachments in the right ventricle, and the free edge of this complex is rotated clockwise to be sutured to the septal border of the anterior leaflet, thus creating a cone the vertex of which remains fixed at the right ventricular apex and the base of which is sutured to the true tricuspid valve annulus level. Additionally, the septal leaflet is incorporated into the cone wall whenever possible, and the atrial septal defect is closed in a valved fashion. ResultsThere was 1 (2. 5 %) hospital death and 1 late death. Early postoperative echocardiograms have shown good right ventricular morphology and reduction in tricuspid regurgitation grade from 3. 6 ± 0. 5 to 1. 2 ± 0. 5 (P <. 0001). After mean follow-up of 4 years, the functional class (New York Heart Association) improved from 2. 6 ± 0. 7 to 1. 2 ± 0. 4 (P <. 0001). Two patients required late tricuspid valve re-repair, and there was neither atrioventricular block nor tricuspid valve replacement at any time. ConclusionsThis surgical technique for Ebstein’s anomaly can be performed with low mortality and morbidity. Early echocardiograms showed significant reduction of tricuspid insufficiency, and the follow-up showed improvement in patients’ clinical status and low incidence of reoperation...|$|E
