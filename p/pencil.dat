Frank accepted the position, and traveled to Germany to study <b>pencil</b> manufacturing at the Eberhard Faber <b>pencil</b> factory. After a nine-month apprenticeship, Frank returned to the United States and began working at the National <b>Pencil</b> Company in August 1908.

5|$|Banksia aquilonia adapts {{readily to}} {{cultivation}} in humid or temperate climates, but is rarely cultivated. A fast-growing plant, it can grow in acidic soils from pH 3.5 to 6.5. Propagation is generally by seed, and plants flower at {{four to six}} years of age. Vegetative propagation is possible from semi-hardened cuttings of <b>pencil</b> thickness. The flower spikes attract birds to the garden. It can also be grown in a pot, with its branches heavily pruned to keep foliage dense.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its growing importance as a tourist centre, Keswick developed a reputation for its manufacture of pencils during the 19th century. It had begun on a modest scale in or about 1792, as a cottage industry, using graphite mined locally. This developed on more industrial lines in factories purpose-built by several companies. <b>Pencil</b> making was the town's most important manufacturing industry by the mid-19th century, textiles and leather goods having declined.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{continued}} effort to produce families of strong linearizations of a matrix polynomial P(λ), regular and singular, with good properties. As a consequence of this research, families such as the family of Fiedler <b>pencils,</b> the family of generalized Fiedler <b>pencils</b> (GFP), the family of Fiedler <b>pencils</b> with repetition, and the family of generalized Fiedler <b>pencils</b> with repetition (GFPR) were constructed. In particular, one of the goals was to find in these families structured linearizations of structured matrix polynomials. For example, if a matrix polynomial P(λ) is symmetric (Hermitian), it is convenient to use linearizations of P(λ) that are also symmetric (Hermitian). Both the family of GFP and the family of GFPR contain block-symmetric linearizations of P(λ), which are symmetric (Hermitian) when P(λ) is. Now the objective is to determine which of those structured linearizations have the best numerical properties. The main obstacle for this study is the fact that these <b>pencils</b> are defined implicitly as products of so-called elementary matrices. In this paper we consider the family of block-minimal bases <b>pencils,</b> whose <b>pencils</b> are defined in terms of their block-structure, as a source of canonical forms for block-symmetric <b>pencils.</b> More precisely, we present four families of block-symmetric <b>pencils</b> which, under some generic nonsingularity conditions are block minimal bases <b>pencils</b> and strong linearizations of a matrix polynomial. We show that the block-symmetric GFP and GFPR, after some row and column permutations, belong to the union of these four families. Hence, these four families of <b>pencils</b> provide an alternative but explicit approach to the block-symmetric Fiedler-like <b>pencils</b> existing in the literature...|$|R
