40|$|There is {{a growing}} desire to reduce peak {{temperatures}} within non-domestic buildings by accessing the thermal mass of separating floors. These floors are typically formed of concrete and can store reasonable amounts of heat. Unfortunately, they are usually thermally isolated from the room below by a suspended ceiling. Therefore, some architects try to access the concrete by leaving a <b>perimeter</b> <b>gap</b> in the suspended ceiling in each room to allow airflow across {{the underside of the}} separating floor. For visual and acoustic reasons, there is the desire to make this gap as small as possible. Using computational fluid dynamics we examine the relationship between gap size and airflow above the suspended ceiling for naturally ventilated spaces. We show that although the precise details of the airflow depends {{on the size of the}} room, levels of incidental gains, ventilation rates and the location of heat sources, in all cases increasing the perimeter width within realistic bounds results in a linear increase in the mean tangential speed of airflow across the underside of the ceiling. This is common for both single sided and cross ventilated rooms and for both single and double raft designs; however, the double raft design performs significantly better. EPSR...|$|E

5000|$|The {{village of}} Tell Touqan is built atop a large tell ("artificial mound"). The mound has {{an area of}} about 27 hectares, encircled by {{the remains of a}} tall wall as well as an inner wall within the <b>perimeter</b> and <b>gaps</b> in between the walls. This {{suggests}} the previous existence of a citadel with gates. The ruins of an acropolis are also located on the mound. It has been suggested that Tell Touqan corresponds with Thaknu in Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III's list of settlements and the Tukhan of Assyrian emperor Tiglath-pileser II's list. The site, situated 15 kilometers north of the Dead City of Ebla, has been identified with the Bronze Age city of [...] "Ursa'um" [...] which served as a major regional center in the 24th century BCE. More comprehensive research suggests Ursa'um to be closer to Gaziantep in Turkey. A number of archaeology experts have said Tell Touqan's identification with Ursa'um is not possible. It was destroyed by the Assyrians around the same time as Ebla, but was later rebuilt after Ebla's reestablishment.|$|R

40|$|A {{two-phase}} Cryogenic Avalanche Detector (CRAD) with electroluminescence (EL) gap, {{operated in}} argon doped {{with a minor}} (49 ± 7 ppm) admixture of nitrogen, has been studied. The EL gap was optically read out using cryogenic PMTs located on the <b>perimeter</b> of the <b>gap.</b> We present {{the results of the}} measurements of the N_ 2 content, detector sensitivity to X-ray-induced signals, EL gap yield and electron lifetime in the liquid. The detector sensitivity, at a drift field in liquid Ar of 0. 6 kV/cm, was measured to be 9 and 16 photoelectrons recorded at the PMTs per keV of deposited energy at 23 and 88 keV respectively. Such two-phase detectors, with enhanced sensitivity to the S 2 (ionization-induced) signal, are relevant in the field of argon detectors for dark matter search and low energy neutrino detection.

40|$|Abstract. The {{proliferation}} of cheap portable, wireless computing devices (e. g., {{cell phones and}} PDAs) promises {{the availability of a}} large number of computing devices in a relatively small geographic region. Researchers have proposed using such an ensemble of wireless devices to create a wireless ad-hoc lattice computer (WAdL) to harness the collective computing capabilities of the devices for the common cause of scientific computing via analogical simulations. Faulty devices or lack of wireless coverage leads to “gaps ” in a WAdL, rendering it ineffective for analogical simulations. In this paper we discuss our soultion to the problem of bridging gaps in WAdLs by assigning active devices on the <b>perimeter</b> of the <b>gap</b> as proxies for the defective devices in the gap. We establish lower bounds on the communication dilation witnessed by such proxy assignments for singlerow gaps and general row-column convex gaps, and present dilationoptimal, constant time algorithms for computing proxy assignments for single-row gaps and gaps that are rectangular in shape. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{enlargement}} of 21 canopy gaps {{associated with the}} root pathogen Heterobasidion annosum (Fr. :Fr.) Bref. (; Fomes annosus (Fr.) Karst.) in the mixed-conifer forest of Yosemite Valley was monitored between 1971 and 1998. Mean expanded gap area was 232 m 2 (range 38 – 802 m 2) in 1971 and 1455 m 2 (range 150 – 4216 m 2) in 1998.

5|$|By dawn it {{was clear}} that they had succeeded in {{penetrating}} the <b>perimeter</b> through a <b>gap</b> between the Australian platoons, and they began to engage them with machine-guns from a defilade position covered from fire by a steep dip in the ridgeline, and concealed by thick scrub. In the growing light, 1 and 3 Platoon were soon pinned down and suffered a number of casualties as they attempted to gain better fire positions with which to engage their attackers. At 06:00 a fighting patrol was dispatched to make contact with Company Headquarters, and as the section passed over a false crest on their way down the spur line they encountered the Chinese positions by chance. Attacking immediately, six Chinese were killed for the loss of one Australian, and the threat to A Company was eliminated. O'Dowd then launched a counter-attack with 3 Platoon assaulting the Chinese occupying the original 1 Platoon position. By 07:00 they had regained the feature and the Chinese were forced to withdraw under heavy fire from the Australians on the high ground, who again exacted a heavy toll. The night's fighting had cost A Company dearly however, and among the dead were the two New Zealand forward observers. In total they suffered more than 50 casualties—half their original strength. Meanwhile, on the right flank, D Company—under Captain Norm Gravener—held the summit of Hill 504 and was not heavily engaged during the night, while C Company—commanded by Captain Reg Saunders—was attacked only once.|$|R
40|$|Background and aims. In various {{clinical}} situations, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) {{may come}} into direct contact or even be mixed with blood. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the effect of exposure to blood on marginal adaptation and surface microstructure of MTA. Materials and methods. Thirty extracted human single-rooted teeth were used. Standard root canal treatment was carried out. Root-ends were resected, and retrocavities were prepared. The teeth were randomly divided into two groups (n = 15) : in group 1, the internal surface of the cavities was coated with fresh blood. Then, the cavities were filled with MTA. The roots were immersed in molds containing fresh blood. In group 2, the aforementioned procedures were performed except that synthetic tissue fluid (STF) was used instead of blood. To assess the marginal adaptation, “gap perimeter” and “maximum gap width” were measured under scanning electron microscope. The surface microstructure was also examined. Independent samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze the data. Results. Maximum gap width and <b>gap</b> <b>perimeter</b> in the blood-exposed group were significantly larger than those in the STF-exposed group (p < 0. 01). In the blood-exposed group, the crystals tended to be more rounded and less angular compared with the STF-exposed group, and there was a general lack of needle-like crystals. Conclusion. Exposure to blood during setting has a negative effect on marginal adaptation of MTA, and blood-exposed MTA has a different surface microstructure compared to STF-exposed MTA...|$|R
40|$|The “polar data gap” is {{a region}} around the North Pole where {{satellite}} orbit inclination and instrument swath for SMMR and SSM/I-SSMIS satellites preclude retrieval of sea ice concentrations. Data providers make the irregularly shaped data gap round by centering a circular “pole hole mask” over the North Pole. The area within the pole hole mask has conventionally been {{assumed to be}} ice-covered {{for the purpose of}} sea ice extent calculations, but recent conditions {{around the perimeter of the}} mask indicate that this assumption may already be invalid. Here we propose an objective, partial differential equation based model for estimating sea ice concentrations within the area of the pole hole mask. In particular, the sea ice concentration field is assumed to satisfy Laplace’s equation with boundary conditions determined by observed sea ice concentrations on the <b>perimeter</b> of the <b>gap</b> region. This type of idealization in the concentration field has already proved to be quite useful in establishing an objective method for measuring the “width” of the marginal ice zone—a highly irregular, annular-shaped region of the ice pack that interacts with the ocean, and typically surrounds the inner core of most densely packed sea ice. Realistic spatial heterogeneity in the idealized concentration field is achieved by adding a spatially autocorrelated stochastic field with temporally varying standard deviation derived from the variability of observations around the mask. To test the model, we examined composite annual cycles of observation-model agreement for three circular regions adjacent to the pole hole mask. The composite annual cycle of observation-model correlation ranged from approximately 0. 6 to 0. 7, and sea ice concentration mean absolute deviations were of order 10 − 2 or smaller. The model thus provides a computationally simple approach to solving the increasingly important problem of how to fill the polar data gap. Moreover, this approach based on solving an elliptic partial differential equation with given boundary conditions has sufficient generality to also provide more sophisticated models which could potentially be more accurate than the Laplace equation version. Such generalizations and potential validation opportunities are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Failure to {{identify}} the vehicle {{by the side of}} the vehicle or in other word as blind spot area, especially larger vehicles are one of the causes of the accident. For some drivers, the simple solution is to place an additional side mirror. However, it is not the best solution because this additional side mirrors do not provide an accurate picture of actual or estimated distance to the object or another vehicle. The objective of this project is {{to identify}} the causes of automobile collisions, notably the side collision impact causes by the blind spot, to develop a system that can detect the presence vehicles on the side and to develop a system that are affordable for normal car users. To achieve this objective, flow chart was designed to help write coding using Arduino 1. 0. 2 and design hardware. This system can detect the obstacle within range 2 cm to 320 cm from the edge of the project vehicle. Before this system developed, the survey was conducted to determine what the driver wants. After that, the design process is carried out. The input to this system is Ping ultrasonic sensor, LCD, LED, and siren for the output part. LCD and LED were displaying the distance from the vehicle and the siren will be switched on to warn the driver when have obstacle in the blind spot area. As a conclusion, the Mitigating Blind Spot Collision Utilizing Ultrasonic <b>Gap</b> <b>Perimeter</b> Sensor System has successfully completed. This system able to detect the presence of other vehicles on the side of the project vehicle, especially in the blind spot area and will alert the driver when the vehicle is nearby when the alarm system is operated. The efficiency of this system to detect objects in the blind spot area is 79. 82 %. Others, it will give the display value less than one second after obstacle exists in front of the sensor. This operating time is most important because if the system is slow, the main function of this system to detect the obstacle in the blind spot area is not achieved...|$|R
