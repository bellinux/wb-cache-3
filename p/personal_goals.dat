5|$|In {{adopting}} Christianity as {{the state}} religion, Mieszko sought to achieve several <b>personal</b> <b>goals.</b> He saw Poland's baptism {{as a way of}} strengthening his hold on power, as well as using it as a unifying force for the Polish people. It replaced several smaller cults with a single, central one, clearly associated with the royal court. It would also improve the position and respectability of the Polish state on the international, European scene. The Church also helped to strengthen the monarch's authority, and brought to Poland much experience with regard to state administration. Thus, the Church organisation supported the state, and in return, bishops received important government titles (in the later era, they were members of the Senate of Poland).|$|E
5|$|Personal {{interaction}} with the gods took many forms. People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles, run by temples, {{that were supposed to}} convey gods' answers to questions. Amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well-being or to impart the god's positive characteristics to the wearer. Private rituals invoked the gods' power to accomplish <b>personal</b> <b>goals,</b> from healing sickness to cursing enemies. These practices used heka, the same force of magic that the gods used, which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune. The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth, or even threatened a deity, to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal. Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers, and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help.|$|E

40|$|In daily life, {{individuals}} must {{balance the}} tasks necessary to fulfill goals spanning several domains of life. In the current studies, we examined what impact ongoing <b>personal</b> <b>goal</b> pursuits have on how individuals attend to and process information relevant to relational goals. In four experiments, we employed a manipulation that evokes the cognitive tuning and biased processing {{associated with the}} mindsets that arise naturally during goal striving (Gollwitzer, 1990), and examined the consequences of these mindsets for the relationship. Results indicated that when an individual focused on pursuing a <b>personal</b> <b>goal,</b> they failed to attend to their relational goals (Study 1), were unwilling to engage in pro-relationship behavior that incurred cost for the <b>personal</b> <b>goal</b> (Study 2), and processed their relational goal achievement in a one-sided (i. e., without nuance or variability; Study 3), evaluatively polarized (Study 4) fashion. Together, these findings provide {{a greater understanding of}} how pursuing a <b>personal</b> <b>goal</b> can undermine relationship maintenance. ...|$|R

The classroom goal condition had a significant effect on help seeking and achievement, with the combined condition showing the most beneficial pattern. <b>Personal</b> mastery <b>goals</b> were beneficial for 11 of 12 outcomes including achievement; <b>personal</b> performance-approach <b>goals</b> were detrimental for achievement and test anxiety and unrelated to the remaining outcomes. The effect of the classroom goal condition did not vary on the basis of entering <b>personal</b> <b>goal</b> orientations.

25|$|Negative coping {{responses}} of procrastinating individuals {{tend to be}} avoidant or emotional rather than task-oriented or focused on problem-solving. Emotional and avoidant coping is employed to reduce stress (and cognitive dissonance) associated with putting off intended and important <b>personal</b> <b>goals.</b> This option provides immediate pleasure and is consequently very attractive to impulsive procrastinators at their first knowledge of achievable goals. There are several emotion-oriented strategies, similar to Freudian defense mechanisms, coping styles and self-handicapping.|$|E

25|$|Agent-neutral consequentialism {{ignores the}} {{specific}} value {{a state of}} affairs has for any particular agent.

Agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent.

40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of {{different}} types of feedback and goals on endurance performance, a laboratory experiment was conducted with 80 physical education students 18 – 21 years of age. After a baseline trial on a submaximal test on a cycle ergometer, participants were assigned to one of four experimental conditions and performed the task again. Group 1 participants set a <b>personal</b> <b>goal</b> for lowering their heart rate and were provided with concurrent heart rate feedback. Group 2 participants set a <b>personal</b> <b>goal</b> for lowering their heart rate during the task and were provided with concurrent heart rate feedback as well as time on task feedback. Group 3 participants set a <b>personal</b> <b>goal</b> for increasing time on task and were provided with respective concurrent feedback. Group 4 participants were given the instruction “do your best ” but not any feedback. The results showed that Groups 1 and 2 improved their performance significantly, with Group 1 showing the largest improvement. It seems that heart rate feedback coupled with goal setting for heart rate decrease is effective in enhancing endurance performance. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical as well as practical implications for understanding relationships between goal setting and external or internal types of feedback...|$|R

500|$|Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits was {{announced}} on March 5, 2009, and released on June 9, 2009. Reflecting its title, Modern Hits incorporates songs published {{within the last}} five years of its release, and the developers had to balance what songs were included {{in order to make a}} setlist with a wide appeal. The engine of the game has no major changes, but Vicarious Visions stated that it has continued to work on strum detection on the DS touchpad to meet a wide range of playstyles. The interface, however, has been revised over the previous two On Tour titles to feature a more modernized look (particularly in-game on the touch screen side). The game includes a new single player career progression using [...] "Fan Requests" [...] to create a new non-linear progression through the songs in the games. These were added to help move away from gameplay that was [...] "just going, playing a venue, and then moving on to the next one" [...] and instead to [...] "open the world up". The developers also noted that the Fan Requests helped to tap into the way that players had previously played games in the series, setting their own <b>personal</b> <b>goals</b> for certain songs. Audio designer Jason Willey created the game's theme song (titled [...] "S.U.P.R.A.H.U.M.A.N.") through his two-man band, Protoshredanoid, to capture the Modern Hits theme of the game, and after demonstrating a sampling of the song to the rest of the team, were asked to create the whole song.
