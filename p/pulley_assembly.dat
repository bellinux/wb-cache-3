25|$|Vibraphones {{usually have}} an {{electric}} motor and <b>pulley</b> <b>assembly</b> mounted on {{one side or the}} other to drive the disks in the resonators. The early vibraphones used motors that were intended to power record player turntables, and had limited or no speed adjustment capabilities. Whatever speed adjustments were possible were made by moving the drive belt among a small number of pulleys (usually three) of varying diameters.|$|E

The tail rotor cables have failed under tensile overload. Pitch change link, <b>pulley</b> <b>assembly</b> and the tail rotor control rod were found damaged/fractured due to impact...|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{phenomena}} {{taking place}} in lifting and hoist installations may influence the dynamic performance of their components. For example, in an elevator system they may affect ride quality of a lift car. Lateral and longitudinal vibrations of suspension ropes and compensating cables may result in an adverse dynamic behaviour of the entire installation. Thus, {{there is a need}} to develop reliable mathematical and computer simulation models to predict the dynamic behaviour of suspension rope and compensating cable systems. The aim of this paper is to develop a model of an aramid suspension rope system in order to predict nonlinear modal interactions {{taking place in}} the installation. A laboratory model comprising an aramid suspension rope, a sheave/ <b>pulley</b> <b>assembly</b> and a rigid suspended mass has been studied. Experimental tests have been conducted to identify modal nonlinear couplings in the system. The dynamic behaviour of the model has been described by a set of nonlinear partial differential equations. The equations have been solved numerically. The numerical results have been validated by experimental tests. It has been shown that the nonlinear couplings may lead to adverse modal interactions in the system...|$|E
50|$|Every lift {{involves}} {{at least}} two terminals and may also have intermediate supporting towers. A bullwheel in each terminal redirects the rope, while sheaves (<b>pulley</b> <b>assemblies)</b> on the towers support the rope well above the ground. The number of towers is engineered based on the length and strength of the rope, worst case environmental conditions, {{and the type of}} terrain traversed. The bullwheel with the prime mover is called the drive bullwheel; the other is the return bullwheel. Chairlifts are usually electrically powered, often with Diesel or gasoline engine backup, and sometimes a hand crank tertiary backup. Drive terminals can be located either at the top or the bottom of an installation; though the top-drive configuration is more efficient, practicalities of electric service might dictate bottom-drive.|$|R

40|$|Issue: Increasing {{amounts of}} {{equipment}} are being advertised, purchased, and installed for crushing glass. There {{are two reasons}} for the proliferation of equipment. First, container manufacturers are using higher percentages of recycled glass in their batches, requiring greater supplies of recycled glass. Second, in areas where glass cannot be economically shipped to container manufacturers, or for mixed color glass that has no value to container manufacturers, local groups are investing in equipment to process collected glass for local uses. There are no “one-size-fits-all ” glass processing systems. Purchasing decisions generally are reduced to a trade-off between cost and quality. Any group considering the purchase of glass processing equipment should consider the factors described in this Best Practice. Best Practice: Maintenance and warranty Crushing equipment should be easy to operate and maintain, and training should be available from the manufacturer. In addition to the expected wear of impact surfaces, all surfaces coming {{into contact with the}} glass stream will wear. Therefore, every part of the equipment should be able to be replaced without cutting welds or special fabrication. Easy access should be available to all moving parts, especially the motor and belts, for inspection and repair. Motor, belt, and <b>pulley</b> <b>assemblies</b> should b...|$|R
40|$|A {{hoisting}} installation {{represents a}} multi-body system deployed to provide vertical transportation. Vibration phenomena {{taking place in}} hoist installations may influence their dynamic performance. In particular lateral and longitudinal vibrations of suspension cables may result in an adverse dynamic behaviour of the entire installation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop a multibody dynamics model of a hoisting cable system in order to predict its nonlinear behaviour. The model comprises an aramid suspension cable, a sheave/ <b>pulley</b> <b>assembly</b> and a rigid suspended mass. The dynamic response of the model is described by a set of nonlinear partial differential equations which is treated using the Galerkin method and numerical integration. Subsequently, an ADAMS simulation model has been used to validate the theoretical model. A laboratory system has also been developed and experimental tests have been conducted to identify the dynamic characteristics and to quantify the response of the system. It is shown that the numerical solutions are in good agreement with the ADAMS simulation results and with the results of experimental tests. Subsequently a suitable vibration control can be sought to mitigate the effects of nonlinear interactions taking place in the system...|$|E
40|$|Three {{severely}} retarded {{young adults}} {{between the ages}} of 19 and 21 years participated in a prevocational training program, and worked regularly on six different tasks during the scheduled six-hour day. The study attempted to assess each subject's preferences for the six tasks: collating, stuffing, sorting, <b>pulley</b> <b>assembly,</b> flour-sifter assembly, and circuit-board stuffing. In Phase I, the procedure consisted of randomly pairing each task with all other tasks in a two-choice situation that required the subjects to select one task from each pair combination to work for a seven-minute period. The selection procedure consisted of presenting two representative task objects on a tray and requesting the subject to pick up one object and place it on the work table. The object selected represented the task worked for that period. The 15 possible pair combinations were presented randomly every two days for a period of 34 days to determine the preferences. During the validation phase (Phase II), each subject's least- and most-preferred tasks were paired separately with moderately-preferred tasks. As expected, these manipulations confirmed the baseline data, as choices for the moderately-preferred tasks decreased when consistently paired with the preferred tasks and increased when consistently paired with the least-preferred tasks...|$|E
40|$|A {{universal}} {{input device}} for interfacing a human operator with a slave machine {{such as a}} robot or the like includes a plurality of serially connected mechanical links extending from a base. A handgrip {{is connected to the}} mechanical links distal from the base such that a human operator may grasp the handgrip and control the position thereof relative to the base through the mechanical links. A plurality of rotary joints is arranged to connect the mechanical links together to provide at least three translational degrees of freedom and at least three rotational degrees of freedom of motion of the handgrip relative to the base. A cable and <b>pulley</b> <b>assembly</b> for each joint is connected to a corresponding motor for transmitting forces from the slave machine to the handgrip to provide kinesthetic feedback to the operator and for producing control signals that may be transmitted from the handgrip to the slave machine. The device gives excellent kinesthetic feedback, high-fidelity force/torque feedback, a kinematically simple structure, mechanically decoupled motion in all six degrees of freedom, and zero backlash. The device also has a much larger work envelope, greater stiffness and responsiveness, smaller stowage volume, and better overlap of the human operator's range of motion than previous designs...|$|E
