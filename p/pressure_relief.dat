40|$|BACKGROUND Neovascular {{glaucoma}} is {{a highly}} intractable form of secondary glaucoma caused {{by the development of}} a fibrovascular membrane in the angle of the anterior chamber. It can occur following a variety of diseases, but diabetes mellitus and central retinal vein occlusion are the commonest causes implicated. Initial management of neovascular glaucoma involves use of antiangiogenic agents, laser or cryotherapy and medical therapy or filtering surgery for reducing intraocular pressure. However, cyclodestructive procedures or enucleation is required for cases of intractable glaucoma. The present study was undertaken to assess the role of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation in the management of neovascular glaucoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty one eyes of twenty one patients with intractable glaucoma were treated with transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and assessed for control of intraocular <b>pressure</b> and <b>relief</b> of symptoms. RESULTS There was significant reduction in intraocular <b>pressure</b> and <b>relief</b> of symptoms following the procedure in all patients.

25|$|Intermediate {{pressure}} creep: This {{is a slow}} leak of {{the first}} stage valve. The effect is for the interstage pressure to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second stage valve than can be resisted by the spring, and the valve opens briefly, often with a popping sound, to relieve the pressure. {{the frequency of the}} popping <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> depends on the flow in the second stage, the back pressure, the second stage spring tension and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it will get worse, and it wastes gas.|$|E

25|$|A 2015 Cochrane review {{found that}} people who lay on high {{specification}} or high density foam mattresses were 60% less likely to develop new pressure ulcers compared to regular foam mattresses. Sheepskin overlays on top of mattresses were also found to prevent new pressure ulcer formation. There is unclear research on the effectiveness of alternating pressure mattresses. Pressure-redistributive mattresses are used to reduce high values of pressure on prominent or bony areas of the body. There are several important terms used to describe how these support surfaces work. These terms were standardized through the Support Surface Standards Initiative of the NPUAP. Many support surfaces redistribute pressure by immersing and/or enveloping the body into the surface. Some support surfaces, including antidecubitus mattresses and cushions, contain multiple air chambers that are alternately pumped. Methods to standardize the products and evaluate the efficacy of these products have only been developed in recent years through the work of the S3I within NPUAP. For individuals with paralysis, pressure shifting on a regular basis and using a wheelchair cushion featuring <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> components can help prevent pressure wounds.|$|E
25|$|If {{the water}} {{in direct contact with}} the {{pressure}} transfer mechanism (diaphragm or piston and the spring balancing the internal pressure) of the regulator freezes, the mechanism will be locked in the position at which the freezing takes place, as the ice will prevent the movement required to close. Since the cooling takes place during flow through the regulator, it is common for the freezing to occur when the first stage valve is open, and this will freeze the valve open, allowing a continuous flow through the first stage. This will cause the inter-stage pressure to rise until the second stage opens to relieve the excess pressure, the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve on the first stage opens, or a low pressure hose or fitting bursts. All of these effects will allow the flow through the first stage to continue, so the cooling will continue, and this will keep the ice causing the problem frozen. To break the cycle it is necessary to stop the gas flow or expose the ice to a heat source capable of melting it. While underwater, it is unlikely to find a heat source to thaw the ice and stopping the flow is only option. Clearly the flow will stop when the pressure in the cylinder drops to ambient, but this is undesirable as it means total loss of the breathing gas. The other option is to close the cylinder valve, shutting off the pressure at the source. Once this is done, the ice will normally melt as heat from the surrounding water is absorbed by the slightly colder ice, and once the ice has melted, the regulator will function again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- <b>Pressure</b> safety <b>relief</b> valve {{is the key}} {{component}} in any system where pressure rising could be hazardous to safety of the workers as well as plant. Though electronically operated safety controls are there, but {{to take care of}} any malfunctioning in it, mechanically operated relief valve is necessary. In oil refinery sector, safety is of prime important. The clay canisters are used to refine the oil. Sometimes these canisters get clogged and pressure rising may take place. The key requirement of process is to relieve this pressure rise in no time. Conventional valves are unable to fulfill that requirement. This paper focuses on design and analysis of an emergency safety valve by Design by Analysis (DBA) approach. From the data given by the client, suitable valve is designed using FEA. The working environment is hazardous & explosive; hence ASME code is used to design. This valve is a onetime operating valve used as tertiary safety arrangement for critical applications...|$|R

40|$|Background Pressure ulcer {{is one of}} {{many health}} {{problems}} in the healthcare system. Pressure ulcer prolongs the suffering of patients and the cost of treating them is high. In 2006, in the USA almost US$ 11 billion was spent on hospitalizations in which the patient was dignosed with pressure ulcer as primary or secondary causes, excluding neonatal and maternal conditions. This reflects an increase of nearly 80 % since 1993. Most pressure ulcers are potentially preventable; early and proper intervention to high risk groups can decrease the incidence of newly developed pressure ulcer and its consequence impacts. Moreover, pressure ulcer is a key performance index for assessing the quality of hospital service and patient safety. Maintaining a low incidence and prevalence of the pressure ulcer leads to both reduced health expenditure and patient’s suffering from wound pain. Aims and objectives The paper aims to study the current literature of pressure relieving devices application and its effectiveness to risk group. There are lots of pressure relieving devices in the market and here to assess its effectiveness to the risk group in hospital. Methods The electronic search was done through searching of electronic database, PubMed, MEDLINE ProQest; and hand search through Google Scholar and other online resources. Search strategies and criteria for inclusion and exclusion had been applied. The key words were used in retrieving studies through databases: (pressure ulcer OR decubitus ulcer) AND(prevention) AND (pressure relieving OR repositioning OR mattress OR cushion OR overlay OR re-distributing) Results There were twelve English articles for reviewing finally. Those articles were grouped into three pressure relieving device categories; they are cushion, re-positioning and mattresses for the review. In Defloor 2005, it found an obvious reduction in newly developed pressure ulcer if it combines 4 -hourly turning with <b>pressure</b> <b>reliefing</b> mattress; only 3 % of participants had newly developed pressure ulcer. Furthermore, the frequect turning may not reduce the pressure ulcer development in lower risk group. The proper intervention of pressure relieving and tailor to individuals are essential. Conclusions It demonstrated the effectiveness of pressure relieving devices to patient at risk, but the present of significant differences is not consistent. It is essential to ensure the utilization of the pressure relieving support surfaces function with right skill to the right person in order to maximize patient’s benefit during hospitalization.
