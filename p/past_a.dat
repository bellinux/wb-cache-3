5|$|Additionally {{there are}} often {{transient}} phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses. In the case of solar eclipses these {{can be used to}} date events in the <b>past.</b> <b>A</b> solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E

5|$|An ephemeral natural pool {{system is}} located in the {{vicinity}} of Scotch Run. In the <b>past,</b> <b>a</b> reservoir was created on the stream by damming it. In the 21st century, a small residential area and a number of roads are present near it. The forests and vernal pools on Scotch Run are fragmented by dirt roads. The habitat quality of the area may also be impaired by All Terrain Vehicles. Additionally, the vernal pools may be used as breeding grounds for mosquitos.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface <b>past</b> <b>a</b> moving taxi model {{in the center of}} the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the number of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games.|$|E

Divorce takes place by mutual consent and legal approval is sought.|$|E

Combining the magnitudes and phases yields the full Fourier transform F(q), which may be inverted to obtain the electron density f(r).|$|E
