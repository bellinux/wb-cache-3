40|$|We {{propose a}} {{disposable}} multiwell microcartridge with integrated amorphous silicon <b>photosensors</b> <b>array</b> for bio- and chemiluminescence-based bioassays, where the enzymatic reactions and the detection unit are coupled {{on the same}} glass substrate. Each well, made in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) unit, hosts an enzymatic reaction that is monitored by one <b>photosensor</b> of the <b>array.</b> <b>Photosensors</b> were characterized {{in terms of their}} dark current background noise and response to different wavelengths of visible light in order to determine their suitability as detection devices for chemical luminescent phenomena. Calibration curves of the photosensors' response to different luminescent systems were then evaluated by using the chemiluminescent reactions catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase and the bioluminescent reaction catalyzed by firefly luciferase. Limits of detection in the order of attomoles for chemiluminescence enzymes and femtomoles for luciferase and sensitivities in the range between 0. 007 and 0. 1 pA pmol- 1 L were reached. We found that, without the need of cooling systems, the analytical performances of the proposed cartridge are comparable with those achievable with state-of-the-art thermoelectrically cooled charge-coupled device-based laboratory instrumentation. In addition, thanks to the small amount of generated output data, the proposed device allows the monitoring of long-lasting reactions with significant advantages in terms of data-storage needs, transmission bandwidth, ease of real-time signal processing and limited power consumption. Based on these results, the operation in model bioanalytical assays exploiting luminescent reactions was tested demonstrating that a-Si:H <b>photosensors</b> <b>arrays,</b> when integrated with PDMS microfluidic units, provide compact, sensitive and potentially low-cost microdevices for chemiluminescence and bioluminescence-based bioassays {{with a wide range of}} possible applications for in-field and point-of-care bio-analyses. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|A {{novel and}} {{disposable}} cartridge for chemiluminescent (CL) -lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) with integrated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) <b>photosensors</b> <b>array</b> {{was developed and}} applied to quantitatively detect human serum albumin (HSA) in urine samples. The presented analytical method {{is based on an}} indirect competitive immunoassay using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a tracer, which is detected by adding the luminol/enhancer/hydrogen peroxide CL cocktail. The system comprises an <b>array</b> of a-Si:H <b>photosensors</b> deposited on a glass substrate, on which a PDMS cartridge that houses the LFIA strip and the reagents necessary for the CL immunoassay was optically coupled to obtain an integrated analytical device controlled by a portable read-out electronics. The method is simple and fast with a detection limit of 2. 5 mg L− 1 for HSA in urine and a dynamic range up to 850 mg L− 1, which is suitable for measuring physiological levels of HSA in urine samples and their variation in different diseases (micro- and macroalbuminuria). The use of CL detection allowed accurate and objective analyte quantification in a dynamic range that extends from femtomoles to picomoles. The analytical performances of this integrated device were found to be comparable with those obtained using a charge-coupled device (CCD) as a reference off-chip detector. These results demonstrate that integrating the a-Si:H <b>photosensors</b> <b>array</b> with CL-LFIA technique provides compact, sensitive and low-cost systems for CL-based bioassays {{with a wide range of}} applications for in-field and point-of-care bioanalyses...|$|R

The analysis consists of determining the fringe position errors which result when various noise sources {{are included in the}} fringe forming and detection process.

40|$|When {{optimizing}} {{the timing}} {{performance of a}} time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) detector based on a monolithic scintillation crystal coupled to a <b>photosensor</b> <b>array,</b> time walk {{as a function of}} annihilation photon interaction location inside the crystal needs to be considered. In order to determine the 3 D spatial coordinates of the annihilation photon interaction location, a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm was developed, based on a detector characterization by a scan of a 511 key photon beam across the front and one of the side surfaces of the crystal. The time walk effect was investigated using a 20 mm x 20 mm x 12 mm LYSO crystal coupled to a fast 4 x 4 multi-anode photomultiplier tube (MAPMT). In the plane parallel to the <b>photosensor</b> <b>array,</b> a spatial resolution of 2. 4 mm FWHM is obtained. In the direction perpendicular to the MAPMT (depth-of-interaction, DOI), the resolution ranges from 2. 3 mm FWHM near the MAPMT to 4 mm FWHM at a distance of 10 mm. These resolutions are uncorrected for the similar to 1 mm beam diameter. A coincidence timing resolution of 358 ps FWHM is obtained in coincidence with a BaF(2) detector. A time walk depending on the 3 D annihilation photon interaction location is observed. Throughout the crystal, the time walk spans a range of 100 ps. Calibration of the time walk vs. interaction location allows an event-by-event correction of the time walk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The system is comprised of a front end rapid scan solid state camera, a high speed digitizer, and a PCM line driver in a downhole package and a memory buffer system in an uphole trailer. The downhole camera takes a snapshot of a nuclear device created flux stream, digitizes the image and transmits it to the uphole memory system before being destroyed. The memory system performs two functions: it retains the data for local display and processing by a microprocessor, and it buffers the data for retransmission at slower rates to a computational facility.

40|$|Highly {{flexible}} organic nanofiber phototransistors {{are fabricated on}} {{a highly}} flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) textile/poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) composite substrate. Organic nanofibers are obtained by electrospinning, using a mixture of poly(3, 3 '''-didodecylquarterthiophene) (PQT- 12) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as the semiconducting polymer and processing aid, respectively. PDMS is used as both a buffer layer for flattening the PET textile and a dielectric layer in the bottom-gate bottom-contact device configuration. PQT- 12 : PEO nanofibers can be well-aligned on the textile composite substrate by electrospinning onto a rotating drum collector. The nanofiber phototransistors fabricated on the PET/PDMS textile composite substrate show highly stable device performance (on-current retention up to 82. 3 (+/- 6. 7) %) under extreme bending conditions, with a bending radius down to 0. 75 mm and repeated tests over 1000 cycles, while those prepared on film-type PET and PDMS-only substrates exhibit much poorer performances. The photoresponsive behaviors of PQT- 12 : PEO nanofiber phototransistors have been investigated under light irradiation with different wavelengths. The maximum photoresponsivity, photocurrent/dark-current ratio, and external quantum efficiency under blue light illumination were 930 mA W- 1, 2. 76, and 246 %, respectively. Furthermore, highly flexible 10 x 10 <b>photosensor</b> <b>arrays</b> have been fabricated which are able to detect incident photonic signals with high resolution.

Each of 12 leaflet pairs was positioned in an individual light-proof container, with one leaflet immobilized. The angle of the mobile leaflet was monitored by a <b>photosensor</b> <b>array</b> using a low intensity infrared beam.

40|$|A {{monolithic}} intelligent CMOS <b>photosensor</b> <b>array</b> specifically {{aimed at}} spectrophotometry {{is presented in}} which a linear photodiode array is integrated together with a charge amplifier, an analogue-to-digital converter, a digital programmable polynomial solver for pixel-level calibration, a set of control registers and a processor interface. This architecture reduces noise effects by using large pixels and by closely coupling the analogue-to-digital converter to the photosensors. This also simplifies the user interface as all analogue circuits are on chip. A digital polynomial solver performs pixel-by-pixel calibration to compensate for source, transmission medium and sensor nonlinearities. Low power consumption and 5 V operation render the sensor suitable for portable applications. The sensor was fabricated in a standard 1. 2 mu m analogue CMOS technology with added light shield...|$|E

Comparisons of absolute radiometric calibrations of the four cameras selected for the mission to Mars with performance predictions based on their design data revealed minor discrepancies. These discrepancies were caused primarily by the method used to calibrate the <b>photosensor</b> <b>array</b> and apparently also from light reflections internal to the array. The sensitivity and dynamic range of all camera channels {{are found to be}} sufficient for high quality pictures, providing that the commandable gains and offsets can be optimized for the scene radiance; otherwise, the quantization noise may be too high or the dynamic range too low for an adequate characterization of the scene...|$|E

The best parameters were obtained for the wavelength sub-band 1. 0 - 1. 8 μ, which includes the 2 nd and 3 rd overtones of C-H stretching vibrations (near 1. 7 and 1. 2 μ) and the combination band (1. 42 μ).

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) detectors based on monolithic scintillation crystals show excellent intrinsic spatial resolution and allow depth-of-interaction (DOI) reconstruction using a single <b>photosensor</b> <b>array.</b> The inclusion of time-of-flight (TOF) {{information in the}} image reconstruction significantly reduces the image noise variance, effectively increasing the PET system sensitivity. For optimal detection efficiency, thick crystals are needed. However, the attainable spatial resolution decreases as the crystal thickness is increased. A maximum-likelihood-estimation (MLE) algorithm was developed to determine the 3 D gamma interaction position. We present results on positioning and timing performance vs. crystal thickness for three monolithic LYSO crystals (16. 2 mm x 18 mm x z, z = 10 mm, 15 mm, or 20 mm) coupled to a multi-anode photomultiplier (MA-PMT). The positioning performance varied with {{the distance to the}} MA-PMT. For the 20 mm thick LYSO crystal the position resolution parallel to the MA-PMT varied between 2. 5 and 4. 5 mm FWHM with the distance, while the DOI could be reconstructed with a resolution varying between 2 and 5 mm FWHM. For the 20 mm thick LYSO crystal in coincidence with a fast BaF 2 detector, a coincidence resolving time (CRT) of 324 ps FWHM was obtained using digital time pickoff. We observed a signal propagation time variation with gamma interaction position from 30 ps for the 10 mm thick crystal to 65 ps for the 20 mm thick crystal. We conclude that thick monolithic scintillation crystals for optimal detection efficiency show very good timing resolution, which hardly degrades when increasing the crystal thickness from 10 mm to 20 mm, and allow for accurate position reconstruction (including DOI) at minimal detector costs (using a single <b>photosensor</b> <b>array</b> to read out the crystal) ...|$|E

The principle of operation of the contour mode is described. The accuracy is limited by the stereo base, resolution of camera picture elements, and geometric calibration.

The system is able to give quantitative information by measuring the fluorescence of the analyte during the chromatographic run. In particular, the system has been tested to detect and quantify aflatoxins B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2. The aflatoxin quantity is proportional to the photocurrent flowing in the p-i-n amorphous silicon diode junction, as the effect of the analyte fluorescence excited by a 365 nm UV radiation. Characterization performed diluting 5 - 20 ng of aflatoxin in 2 μl of methanol demonstrate the capability of the system to detect in real time the analyte separation and to quantify the toxin.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{research}} {{is to build a}} compact, high performance lightstripe rangefinder using a Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) smart <b>photosensor</b> <b>array.</b> Rangefinding, the measurement of the three-dimensional profile of an object or scene, is a critical component for many robotic applications, and therefore many techniques were developed. Of these, lightstripe rangefinding {{is one of the most}} widely used and reliable techniques available. Though practical, the speed of sampling range data by the conventional light stripe technique is severely limited. A conventional light stripe rangefinder operates in a step-and-repeat manner. A stripe source is projected on an object, a video image is acquired, range data is extracted from the image, the stripe is stepped, and the process repeats. Range acquisition is limited by the time needed to grab the video images, increasing linearly with the desired horizontal resolution. During the acquisition of a range image, the objects in the scene being scanned must be stationary. Thus, the long scene sampling time of step-and-repeat rangefinders limits their application. The fast range sensor proposed is based on the modification of this basic lightstripe ranging technique in a manner described by Sato and Kida. This technique does not require a sampling of images at various stripe positions to build a range map. Rather, an entire range image is acquired in parallel while the stripe source is swept continuously across the scene. Total time to acquire the range image data is independent of the range map resolution. The target rangefinding system will acquire 1, 000 100 x 100 point range images per second with 0. 5 percent range accuracy. It will be compact and rugged enough to be mounted on the end effector of a robot arm to aid in object manipulation and assembly tasks...|$|E

It integrates a heating chamber, an electrowetting-based droplet handling system and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) <b>photosensor</b> <b>array</b> for biomolecule detection. The heating chamber incorporates a thin metal film heater whose geometry has been optimized for uniform temperature distribution over a 1 cm 2 area. An a-Si:H p-i-n junction integrated with the heater and biased with a forward current acts as temperature monitoring, achieving a sensitivity - 3. 3 mV/K with a linear behavior in the investigated range. The droplet-handling unit, relying on the electrowetting method, is designed to move the sample from the heating chamber to the sensor array. The unit includes a set of metal pads beneath a layer of PDMS that provides both the electric insulation of the electrodes and the hydrophobic surface needed by the electrowetting technique. The detection unit {{has been applied to}} quantify Ochratoxin A (OTA) based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) sensors. 2 µl of acidified toluene containing OTA at different concentrations were spotted on the silica side of a High Performance Thin Layer Cromatography plate and aligned with a a-Si:H p-i-n photodiode deposited on the LOC. Results show a very good linearity between OTA concentration and the sensor photocurrent down to 0. 1 ng, showing that the presented system has the potential for a low cost system suitable for the early detection of toxins.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{a novel approach}} {{to the design of}} circuits found in a very large scale integration (VLSI) implementation of an artificial neural network. A robust hybrid architecture with analog and digital elements has been developed for a fully-parallel single-chip realization of multilayer neural networks. The proposed architecture is highly modular and creates regular silicon structures that well suit a VLSI realization. The architecture employs an innovative universal building block consisting of an improved digital-analog multiplier, a new analog active nonlinear resistor and a digital weight register. The key circuit called a unified synapse-neuron allows one to realize a self-scaling sigmoidal neuron characteristic that {{does not have to be}} constantly redesigned to accommodate a varying dynamic input range that is dependent upon the number of synaptic weights connected to the input of the neuron. The effects of synaptic weight quantization noise are also shown to be reduced using a stochastic model developed in the thesis. A new resistive-type neuron circuit is presented that exhibits inherently low characteristic variations based on analyses, simulations and fabrication measurements. Moreover, as each neuron is realized by a number of compact sub-neurons that are distributed over the die area, the effects of process variations on the neuron 2 ̆ 7 s characteristics are minimized due to the distributed averaging effect that takes place. Increased robustness is achieved as there is a simultaneous reduction of both digital quantization effects and analog variation effects. The distributed nature of the analog neuron also has the potential to contribute to increased fault tolerance for certain types of neuron circuit failure. Circuit design, implementation and characterization are performed in a standard CMOS process at 5 V and 3. 3 V supply voltages so as to lead to an optimized design. The purpose for this research was to develop a smart non-contact optical sensor based on a programmable neural network with an integrated photosensitive array. The theoretical and experimental work has lead to the design and realization of a highly modular and robust neural-based smart CMOS sensor with reduced interconnection areas and increased synaptic density. As a result, a larger <b>photosensor</b> <b>array</b> and a larger neural network classifier are implemented on a restricted die area.
