50|$|The {{simplest}} type of snorkel is a <b>plain</b> <b>tube</b> that {{is allowed}} to flood when underwater. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (blast clearing) or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (displacement method) and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath. The displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.|$|E
50|$|A <b>plain</b> <b>tube</b> {{can be used}} as a siphon. An {{external}} pump has to {{be applied}} to start the liquid flowing and prime the siphon. This can be a human mouth. This is sometimes done with any leak-free hose to siphon gasoline from a motor vehicle's gasoline tank to an external tank. (Siphoning gasoline by mouth often results in the accidental swallowing of gasoline, or aspirating it into the lungs, which can cause death or lung damage.) If the tube is flooded with liquid before part of the tube is raised over the intermediate high point and care is taken to keep the tube flooded while it is being raised, no pump is required. Devices sold as siphons often come with a siphon pump to start the siphon process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{test tubes}} in which blood is {{collected}} may contain {{one or more}} of several additives. In general, tests requiring whole blood call for blood samples collected in test tubes containing some form of the anticoagulant EDTA. EDTA chelates calcium to prevent clotting. EDTA is preferred for hematology tests because it does minimum damage to cell morphology. Sodium Citrate is the anticoagulant used in specimens collected for coagulation tests. The majority of chemistry and immunology tests are performed on serum, which is produced by clotting and then separating the blood specimen via centrifuge. These specimens are collected in either a non-additive tube or one containing a clotting activator. This clotting activator can interfere with some assays, and so a <b>plain</b> <b>tube</b> is recommended in these cases, but will delay testing. Tubes containing lithium heparin or sodium heparin are also commonly used for a variety of chemistry tests, as they do not require clotting and can be centrifuged immediately after collection. A combination of sodium flouride and potassium oxalate is used for glucose tests, as these additives both prevent clotting and stop glycolosis, so that blood glucose levels are preserved after collection. another specialty tube is an opaque amber colored tube used to collect blood for light sensitive analytes, such as bilirubin.|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the stability of analytes in serum gel <b>tubes</b> and <b>plain</b> <b>tubes</b> exposed to a range of storage temperatures and times after centrifugation. Materials and methods: Fifteen healthy volunteers were recruited and venous blood was collected into four tubes, two with and two without gel separator. Analyzing the baseline samples in 30 min, all were stored at 4 ºC or 24 ºC for 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48 and 72 hours and 1 week. Sixteen biochemi-cal anaytes were measured on each sample.

Results: On day three, most analytes remained stable including albumin, protein, creatinine, choles-terol, triglycerides, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminot-ransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LD) regardless of tube types.

The paper deals with the investigations on heat transfer characteristics of a circular tube as well as tube banks with integral downstream splitter plates in cross flow of air in a rectangular duct. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} Reynolds number range 5 x 103 to 105 on single plain cylinder and single cylinder of various splitter length-to-tube diameter ratios, L/D = 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0. Further, tube banks consisting of 12 rows and 3 tubes per row in equilateral triangle arrangement with transverse pitch to diameter ratio, a = 2, were also investigated, the banks being made up of <b>plain</b> <b>tubes</b> or tubes with splitters. Heat transfer characteristics were studied for tubes with L/D = 0, 0. 5 and 1. 0 under constant heat flux conditions. Tube banks with L/D = 1. 0 yielded the highest heat transfer rates. They were also superior to single tubes with L/D = 1. 0. cs 201...|$|R
