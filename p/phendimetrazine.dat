50|$|Fenbutrazate (INN), {{also known}} as phenbutrazate (BAN), is a {{psychostimulant}} used as an appetite suppressant under the trade names Cafilon, Filon, and Sabacid in Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong.

50|$|Phenmetrazine (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand name Preludin, {{and many}} others) is a {{stimulant}} drug that was previously {{used as an}} appetite suppressant, but has since been withdrawn from the market. It was initially replaced by its analogue <b>phendimetrazine</b> which functions as a prodrug to phenmetrazine, {{but now it is}} rarely prescribed, due to concerns of abuse and addiction. Chemically, phenmetrazine is a substituted amphetamine with a morpholine ring.|$|E
50|$|Pseudophenmetrazine is a {{psychostimulant}} {{compound of}} the morpholine class. It is the N-demethylated and cis-configured analogue of <b>phendimetrazine</b> {{as well as}} the cis-configured stereoisomer of phenmetrazine. In addition, along with phenmetrazine, it is believed {{to be one of the}} active metabolites of <b>phendimetrazine,</b> which itself is inactive and behaves merely as a prodrug. Relative to phenmetrazine, pseudophenmetrazine is of fairly low potency, acting as a modest releasing agent of norepinephrine (EC50 = 514 nM), while its (+)-enantiomer is a weak releaser of dopamine (EC50 = 1,457 nM) whereas its (−)-enantiomer is a weak reuptake inhibitor of dopamine (Ki = 2,691 nM); together as a racemic mixture with the two enantiomers combined, pseudophenmetrazine behaves overall more as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (Ki = 2,630 nM), possibly due to the (+)-enantiomer blocking the uptake of the (−)-enantiomer into dopaminergic neurons and thus preventing it from inducing dopamine release. Neither enantiomer has any significant effect on serotonin reuptake or release (both Ki = >10,000 nM and EC50 = >10,000 nM, respectively).|$|E
50|$|Its {{structure}} {{incorporates the}} backbone of methamphetamine, a potent CNS stimulant. Whilst adding an N-methyl group {{to the structure of}} amphetamine significantly increases its potency and bioavailability, in the case of <b>phendimetrazine</b> the added methyl group results in the compound becoming virtually inactive, at least until the methyl group is removed by the body's metabolism. This results in a steady, continued activation of the drug in the body, both lowering abuse potential and allowing for once-daily administration.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of less {{commonly}} used medications. Some are only approved for short term use, others are used off-label, and still others are used illegally.

Testimony from a Deputy Attorney General during the trial indicated that Turner had pressured him to conduct a police raid on Gewertz's home after bags containing the drug <b>phendimetrazine</b> had been planted in Gewertz's home by one of Turner's co-conspirators; the nature and urgency of the pleas - as well as Turner's certainty that drugs would be found - only raised suspicions and led to the conspiracy unraveling. Turner was sentenced to serve five years on prison, but was free on bail pending an appeal, which allowed him to run for office.|$|E

40|$|Obesity is an {{increasingly}} serious socioeconomic and clinical problem. Between 1 / 4 - 1 / 3 of {{population in the}} developed countries can be classified as obese. Four major etiological factors for development of obesity are genetic determinants, environmental factors, food intake and exercise. Obesity increases the risk of the development of various pathologic conditions including: insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, endocrine problems, and certain forms of cancer. Thus, obesity is a negative determinant for longevity. In this review we provide broad overview of pathophysiology of obesity. We also discuss various available, and experimental therapeutic methods. We highlight functions of adipocytes including fat storing capacity and secretory activity resulting in numerous endocrine effects like leptin, IL- 6, adiponectin, and resistin. The anti-obesity drugs are classified according to their primary action on energy balance. Major classes of these drugs are: appetite suppressants, inhibitors of fat absorption (i. e. orlistat), stimulators of thermogenesis and stimulators of fat mobilization. The appetite suppressants are further divided into noradrenergic agents, (i. e. phentermine, <b>phendimetrazine,</b> benzphetamine, diethylpropion), serotoninergic agents (i. e. dexfenfluramine), and mixed noradrenergic-serotoninergic agents (i. e. sibutramine).

When drugs used therapeutioally as anoreccs were tested, they con-sistendy produced greater than 80 % of AMPH-appropnate re-sponding. The order of potency for substifuting for AMPH was: mazindol> AMPH = phenmetrazine = phentermine> chior-phentern*ie = <b>phendimetrazine</b> = dlethyipropion> clortermine = mefenorex. Other anorectics such as phenyipropanolamine (0. 3 - 30. 0 mg/kg) and fenfluramine (1. 0 -i 7. 0 mg/kg) only sub-stituted paralIy for AMPH whereas benzphetamine (1. 0 -i 00. 0 mg/kg) resufted primarily in saline-appropriate responding. Corn-pounds related to AMPH in biochemical mechanism of action or psychomotor stimulant activity also were tested. Methyipheni-date (0. 1 - 3. 0 mg/kg), piribedil (0. 3 -i 7. 0 mg/kg) and nisoxetine (0. 03 - 1. 0 mg/kg) shared discriminative stimulus properties with AMPH whereas bupropion (1. 0 - 30. 0 mg/kg) and propyihexed-nne (1 0. 0 - 1 00. 0 mg/kg) substituted for AMPH in two of three pigeons tested.

The mass detector, with a nominal resolving power of 100, 000 (FWHM at m/z 200), operated in full scan mode in ESI positive ionization mode. Analytes were identified by retention times, accurate masses and correspondence of experimental and calculated isotopic patterns. The limits of detection (LOD) obtained varied from 1 to 25 ngg(- 1) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were 50 ngg(- 1) for all compounds. The method was linear for all the analytes in the ranges from 50 to 2000 ng g(- 1), giving correlation coefficients> 0. 99. Accuracy (intended as %E) and repeatability (% CV) were always lower than 15 %. The method {{was applied to the}} analysis of 36 dietary supplements, revealing the presence of ephedrine and/or pseudoephedrine in four of them, caffeine in eight of them and sildenafil in four of them. In one case, ephedrine was not reported on the label of the dietary supplement, as well as for caffeine in other two cases. A further confirmation of the analytes identity in positive samples was obtained through in-source fragmentation and comparison of the obtained fragments and their relative abundances with those from certified standards.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} {{captured in}} patent and scientific research literature stimulates {{new ideas and}} fosters new drug development efforts. Manufacturers and entrepreneurs dedicated to the sale of 'research chemicals' and/or new psychoactive substances (NPS) also make use of access to information to identify, prepare, and launch a range of new substances. One {{of the most recent}} compounds to appear on the NPS market is the phenmetrazine analog 3 -fluorophenmetrazine (3 -FPM) which represents one of many phenylmorpholines designed to explore treatment options in areas such as obesity and drug dependence. The anorectic drug analogs phenmetrazine and <b>phendimetrazine,</b> used as prescription medicines before they were withdrawn, feature amphetamine-like properties associated with monoamine release. Available data on 3 -FPM suggest that the effects might show mechanistic overlaps. This study describes the synthesis and extensive analytical characterization of 3 -FPM and its differentiation from synthesized ortho- and para- substituted isomers, 2 -FPM and 4 -FPM, respectively. This study was triggered by the purchase of five powdered samples advertised as 3 -FPM by five different Internet vendors based in the United Kingdom. The analytical data obtained for the vendor samples were consistent with the synthesized 3 -FPM standard and differentiation between all three isomers was possible. The presence of positional isomers and the absence of suitable reference material can cause difficulties in the day-to-day operation of forensic work and given the rate at which many of the newly emerging NPS appear on the market, a comprehensive approach is needed when attempting to decipher the identity of NPS arriving onto the drug market.
