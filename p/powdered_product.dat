40|$|Avaliou-se o processo de secagem por nebulização em "spray dryer" para a obtenção de leite bubalino em pó. Foram {{realizadas}} análises físico-químicas no leite in natura e no leite desidratado, para averiguar perdas de macronutrientes ocorridas durante a secagem; análises microbiológicas para assegurar a qualidade higiênico-sanitária do processo e produto e análises sensoriais para estabelecer a aceitabilidade do produto. Foram obtidas isotermas de adsorção e dessorção de umidade a 25 °C, para o produto em pó, visando observar o seu comportamento higroscópico. O leite bubalino em pó obtido apresentou como características físicoquímicas: 3, 4 % de umidade, 23, 2 % de proteínas, 46, 1 % de gordura, 4, 2 % de cinzas, 0, 5 % de lecitina de soja e 22, 6 % de carboidratos totais. De acordo com os exames microbiológicos está apto para o consumo humano. O produto foi caracterizado como integral por não ter sofrido qualquer padronização. As perdas ocorridas para a maioria dos macronutrientes durante o processamento, foram inferiores a 5 % e apenas o teor de proteínas apresentou variação superior a 15 %, devido à desnaturação da caseína em temperatura superior a 80 °C. O produto apresentou isotermas de adsorção do tipo III, mesmo comportamento apresentado pelo leite bovino. Através da isoterma de dessorção determinou-se o valor de umidade equivalente à monocamada, obtendo-se o valor médio de 4, 4 g H 2 O/ 100 g b. s., o que validou o processo utilizado. O comportamento de histerese apresentado pelo produto foi similar ao do leite em pó integral, sendo a sua aceitabilidade de 74 %, muito próxima a 80 % obtido para um leite em pó integral comercial. This work aims to {{show the}} process development based on the spray dryer for the obtaining of powdered buffalo milk. For that, physiochemical analyses {{were made in the}} milk in natura and later in the <b>powdered</b> <b>product,</b> which was also submitted to microbiological analysis to be sure that it could be consumed by humans; and to sensorial analysis for obtaining information about the product's acceptance. Sorption isotherms for the <b>powdered</b> <b>product</b> were obtained at 25 ºC with the purpose of perceiving the hygroscopic behavior. The buffalo's powdered milk presented the following characteristics: 3, 4 % moisture content, 23, 2 % proteins, 46, 1 % fat, 4, 2 % ash, 0, 5 % soybean lecithin and 22, 6 % of total carbohydrates. The product was characterized as whole powdered buffalo milk, because it didn't suffer any standardization. Nutrient losses, during the process, were less then 5 %, and just for proteins the variation was more than 15 %. It can be justified by the desnaturation of the casein due to high temperatures (> 80 ºC). The <b>powdered</b> <b>product</b> presented type III sorption isotherms and the same behavior was observed for the whole powdered milk. Through sorption isotherms, the moisture content value, referent to the monolayer, was on an average of 4, 4 g H 2 O/ 100 g dry solids, which confirms the process efficiency. The hysteresis behavior presented by the <b>powdered</b> <b>product</b> was similar of the whole powdered milk.

40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} several factors that {{influence}} {{the accuracy of the}} plate count technique to estimate low numbers of micro-organisms in liquid and solid food. Concentrations around 10 CFU/mL or 100 CFU/g in the original sample, which can still be enumerated with the plate count technique, are considered as low numbers. The impact of low plate counts, technical errors, heterogeneity of contamination and singular versus duplicate plating were studied. Batches of liquid and powdered milk were artificially contaminated with various amounts of Cronobacter sakazakii strain ATCC 29544 to create batches with accurately known levels of contamination. After thoroughly mixing, these batches were extensively sampled and plated in duplicate. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for samples from both batches of liquid and <b>powdered</b> <b>product</b> as a measure of the dispersion within the samples. The impact of technical errors and low plate counts were determined theoretically, experimentally, as well as with Monte Carlo simulations. CV-values for samples of liquid milk batches were found to be similar to their theoretical CV-values established by assuming Poisson distribution of the plate counts. However, CV-values of samples of powdered milk batches were approximately five times higher than their theoretical CV-values. In particular, powdered milk samples with low numbers of Cronobacter spp. showed much more dispersion than expected which was likely due to heterogeneity. The impact of technical errors was found to be less prominent than that of low plate counts or of heterogeneity. Considering the impact of low plate counts on accuracy, it would be advisable to keep to a lower limit for plate counts of 25 colonies/plate rather than to the currently advocated 10 colonies/plate. For a <b>powdered</b> <b>product</b> with a heterogeneous contamination, it is more accurate to use 10 plates for 10 individual samples than to use the same 10 plates for 5 samples plated in duplicat...|$|E
