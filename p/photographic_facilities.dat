2500|$|In late 1936, while {{passing the}} National Geographic Society, Wentzel {{decided on the}} spur of the moment to ask for a tour of their <b>photographic</b> <b>facilities.</b> The request was granted, and Wentzel toured the lab with his {{photographs}} of the city under his arm. [...] The employee giving the tour told Wentzel he was quitting, and Wentzel applied for the position after the tour ended. [...] The personnel director was initially dismissive of Wentzel's interest in the job, but was impressed with the awards his photographs had won. He was granted a job interview, and offered a position in the photography lab in late December 1936.|$|E

5000|$|As World War II began, Bill Gaines was {{rejected}} by the United States Army, United States Coast Guard and United States Navy, so he went to his draft board and requested to be drafted. He trained as an Army Air Corps photographer at Lowry Field in Denver. However, when he was assigned to an Oklahoma City field which did not have a <b>photographic</b> <b>facility,</b> he wound up on permanent KP duty. As he explained in 1976 to Bill Craig of Stars and Stripes, [...] "Being an eater, this assignment was a real pleasure for me. There were four of us, and we always found all the choice bits the cooks had hidden away. We'd be frying up filet mignon and ham steaks every night. The hours were great, too. I think it was eight hours on and 40 off." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. An experiment {{to evaluate the}} Skylab earth resources package for observing ocean currents was performed in the Straits of Florida in January 1974. Data from the S 190 <b>photographic</b> <b>facility,</b> S 191 spectroradiometer and S 192 multispectral scanner, were compared with surface observations. The anticyclonic edge of the Gulf Stream could be identified in the Skylab S 190 A and B photographs, but the cyclonic edge was obscured by clouds. The aircraft photographs were judged not useful for spectral analysis because vignetting caused the blue/green ratios {{to be dependent on}} the position in the photograph. The spectral measurement technique could not identify the anticyclonic front, but mass of Florida Bay water which {{was in the process of}} flowing into the Straits could be identified and classified. Monte Carlo simulations of the visible spectrum showed that the aerosol concentration could be estimated and a correction technique was devised...|$|R

50|$|The Glen Innes {{district}} {{has been a}} producer of wool, sheep and beef cattle since it was first settled. Sapphires are mined in the creek valleys immediately west of town, and while tin is no longer commercially mined, mineral exploration is ongoing. The town holds regular livestock sales in the local saleyards. The town contains all of the regular service industries required by the community. Notable individual businesses include a <b>photographic</b> processing <b>facility,</b> an exporter of waste material balers, a large cattle feedlot, and transport depots. Sawmilling was historically a major industry of the district, but is now only conducted on a reasonable scale by the local minimum-security prison. The conversion of State Forests into National Parks has led to tourism becoming an important employer.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, the VHFS's mission {{changed to}} research, {{development}} {{and support of}} intelligence and electronic warfare for the Army, Department of Defense and foreign allies of the United States. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took over operation of the <b>facility's</b> <b>photographic</b> interpretation center from the Defense Intelligence Agency and the center was renamed the Environmental Photographic Interpretation Center. In the late 1970s, VHFS {{was put on the}} military base closure list, and all maintenance and construction at the facility was halted. In 1981, the facility was removed from the closure list and funding for maintenance and construction was restored.|$|R
40|$|A {{facility}} {{to simulate the}} effects of space debris striking an orbiting spacecraft is described. This facility was purchased in 1965 {{to be used as}} a micrometeoroid simulation facility. Conversion to a Space Debris Simulation Facility began in July 1984 and it was placed in operation in February 1985.

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1842 (pre-dating Kodak in the {{photography}} business) as E. Anthony & Co. (later E. and H. T. Anthony & Company, when Edward Anthony's brother officially joined the business) and became the Anthony & Scovill Co. in 1901, after a merger with the camera business of Scovill Manufacturing (Connecticut), founded by James Mitchell Lamson Scovill and William Henry Scovill. That year the company headquarters relocated to Binghamton, New York. This was already a site of one of Ansco's <b>photographic</b> paper manufacturing <b>facilities.</b> Just after that, in 1905 it settled a landmark patent infringement case against Eastman Kodak, which had been violating the Goodwin flexible film patent (Hannibal Goodwin of Newark, New Jersey) held by Ansco. The settlement received from Eastman Kodak was very small compared to {{the damage done to}} Ansco, which already had financial problems as a result of business lost to Eastman Kodak.|$|R

40|$|The APM Bright Galaxy Catalogue lists positions, magnitudes, {{shapes and}} {{morphological}} types for 14, 681 galaxies brighter than $b_J$ magnitude 16. 44 over a 4, 180 square degree {{area of the}} southern sky. Galaxy and stellar images have been located from glass copy plates of the United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (UKST) IIIaJ sky survey using the Automated <b>Photographic</b> Measuring (APM) <b>facility</b> in Cambridge, England. The majority of stellar images are rejected by the regularity of their image surface brightness profiles. Remaining images are inspected by eye on film copies of the survey material and classed as stellar, multiple stellar, galaxy, merger or noise. Galaxies are further classified as elliptical, lenticular, spiral, irregular or uncertain. The 180 survey fields are put onto a uniform photometric system by comparing the magnitudes of galaxies in the overlap regions between neighbouring plates. The magnitude zero-point, photometric uniformity and photographic saturation are checked with CCD photometry. Finally, the completeness and reliability of the catalogue is assessed using various internal tests and by comparing with several independently constructed galaxy catalogues. Comment: 52 pages, uuencoded, gzipped tar archive, includes all figures. The catalogue data is available from ftp://adc. gsfc. nasa. gov/pub/adc/archives/journal_tables/MNRAS/ 278 / 1025...|$|R
