The World Bank dismissed the EU and the United States' argument that small farmers needed protection, noting {{that more than half of}} the EU's Common Agricultural Policy subsidies go to 1% of producers while in the United States 70% of subsidies go to 10% of its producers, mainly agribusinesses. These subsidies end up flooding global markets with below-cost commodities, depressing <b>prices,</b> <b>and</b> <b>undercutting</b> producers in poor countries, a practice known as dumping.|$|E

STT R&D is found to be unacceptably risky for private industry in the absence of federal support. Energy cost savings were projected to range from $ 0 to $ 10 billion (1990 values in 1981 dollars), dependng on the system cost <b>and</b> fuel <b>price</b> scenario.

40|$|The {{economic}} and social benefits of developing cost competitive solar thermal technologies (STT) were assessed. The analysis was restricted to STT in electric applications for 16 high insolation/high energy price states. Three fuel <b>price</b> scenarios <b>and</b> three 1990 STT system costs were considered, reflecting uncertainty over fuel <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> STT cost projections. After considering the numerous benefits of introducing STT into the energy market, three primary benefits were identified and evaluated: (1) direct energy cost savings were estimated to range from zero to $ 50 billion; (2) oil imports may be reduced by up to 9 percent, improving national security; and (3) significant environmental benefits can be realized in air basins where electric power plant emissions create substantial air pollution problems. STT research and development {{was found to be}} unacceptably risky for private industry in the absence of federal support.

In imperfectly competitive markets, quality decisions {{are known to}} create the rival¡¯s <b>price</b> <b>undercutting,</b> <b>and</b> thus the equilibrium quality level becomes suboptimal. This paper takes a view that a quality level of a product subject to network externalities is positively related to its degree of compatibility to other brands {{as well as to}} the size of its own network. It shows that in the presence of network externalities, contrary to the literature, the suppliers tend to provide an excessive degree of compatibility because compatibility provision relaxes subsequent price competition.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{response}} of collusive prices to changing demand conditions when firms operate under capacity constraints {{in the presence of}} demand uncertainty. We find support for the conventional view that periods of low demand lead, through the emergence of excess capacity, to a breakdown of collusive pricing. We also find that the nature of price wars depends on the degree of excess capacity in the industry; while small amounts of excess capacity can lead firms to engage in "mild" price wars, characterized by uniform <b>price</b> reductions <b>and</b> market share stability, more "severe" price wars, characterized by <b>price</b> <b>undercutting</b> <b>and</b> market share instability, can emerge if excess capacity is sufficiently great. Finally, our results lend support to the view that market share instability is a symptom of ineffective collusion. ...|$|R

At the time the area was known for metal working, a natural result of the iron deposits discovered locally in the 15th century. Watchmaking flourished in and around Fleurier during the late 18th century but because production was sold on credit for the international markets, <b>prices</b> were <b>undercut</b> <b>and</b> economic destabilization {{brought about by the}} Napoleonic wars caused watch making in the area to decrease significantly.

40|$|Past {{research}} has been concerned with the potential of embedding deterministic pricing algorithms into pricebots: software agents used by on-line sellers to automatically price Internet goods. In this work, probabilistic pricing algorithms based on no-regret learning are explored, in both high-information and low-information settings. It is shown via simulations that the long-run empirical frequencies of prices in a market of no-regret pricebots can converge to equilibria arbitrarily close to an asymmetric Nash equilibrium; however, instantaneous price distributions need not converge.

40|$|Should the Uruguay Round negotiators on the Antidumping Code {{take the}} {{approach}} of the Tokyo Round and concentrate on a still more systematic interpretation of the existing notions embodied in current GATT texts on antidumping? Or should they adopt a wider approach to improve the basic notions on which GATT antidumping rules are based or to introduce new ones? So far, the proposals received by the Negotiating Group on antidumping rules have followed the first approach. They aim at tightening the interpretation of the basic notions embodied in GATT texts such as export <b>price,</b> normal <b>and</b> constructed values, comparison of normal value <b>and</b> export <b>price,</b> threat of injury, <b>price</b> <b>undercutting,</b> <b>and</b> undertaking.

40|$|The report {{identifies}} {{concerns with}} the EU anti-dumping instrument, as applied today, {{regardless of the}} fact that the investigation procedures and methods might be in line with the current regulation and practice. The report's arguments are based on the recent anti-dumping investigation – and imposition of anti-dumping measures – on imports of ceramic tiles from China, but the observations and conclusions from the analysis are valid for most EU anti-dumping investigations. The report observes that price dumping is evaluated differently depending on whether the product is manufactured in the EU or imported from third countries. What is considered to be price dumping when imported is considered normal competition for a product manufactured in the EU. This is due to the fact that spatial price differentiation within the EU is covered by competition rules, and that competition rules have higher requirements for market share <b>and</b> <b>price</b> <b>undercutting</b> than the anti-dumping legislation. The report, accordingly, advocates that the criteria for imposing anti-dumping duties should be harmonized to the EU competition rules in order to ensure fair competition on the EU market. In the absence of a reformed anti-dumping regulation, the anti-dumping measures will most likely only contribute to a distorted competition where the complaining EU manufacturing industry will be protected to the detriment of the consumers. ...|$|R

The appropriate question is not how much money to spend (since funding increases {{over the years have}} not made a dent in the drug problem), but how to spend the money. The solution should be obvious to any careful student of neoclassical economics, which has provided the intellectual underpinning for most domestic policy initiatives in recent years: Increase supply <b>and</b> <b>undercut</b> demand for drugs {{in order to reduce the}} <b>price</b> <b>and</b> profitability of drug distribution.

40|$|A {{numerical}} modelling {{strategy has been}} developed in order to quantify the magnitude of induced stresses at the boundaries of production level <b>and</b> <b>undercut</b> level drifts for various in situ stress environments <b>and</b> <b>undercut</b> scenarios. The results of the stress modelling were in line with qualitative experiential guidelines and {{a limited number of}} induced stress measurements documented from caving sites. A number of stress charts were developed which quantify the maximum boundary stresses in drift roofs for varying in situ stress regimes, depths <b>and</b> <b>undercut</b> scenarios. This enabled many of the experiential guidelines to be quantified and bounded. A limited number of case histories of support and support performance in cave mine drifts were compared to support recommendations using the NGI classification system, The stress charts were used to estimate the Stress Reduction Factor for this system. The back-analyses suggested that the NGI classification system might be able to give preliminary estimates of support requirements in caving mines with modifications relating to rock bolt length and the support of production level intersections.
