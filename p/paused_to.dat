5|$|The {{experience}} reinforced Drake's {{decision to}} retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> retune between numbers.|$|E
5|$|As the Union army retreated towards Washington, it <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> re-group at Centreville, Virginia. On August 31, 1862, Gen. Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Jackson to flank the Union {{right and}} {{to cut the}} Union army off from Washington. This {{flanking}} effort resulted in the Battle of Chantilly which {{would prove to be}} the most disastrous engagement of the entire war for the 21st Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|E

5|$|Middlesbrough, {{also from}} the Premier League, were the {{opposition}} in the semi-final at the neutral venue of Villa Park in Birmingham. Before the game both players and supporters <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> remember the life of West Ham's recently deceased former manager, John Lyall. The first half saw Middlesbrough dominate, but {{they were unable to}} convert any of their chances into goals. They also lost goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to injury. A long pass by defender Anton Ferdinand was headed down by Ashton to Harewood, whose goal ensured a 1–0 victory for West Ham and a place in the final.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the scope}} of his work expanded. On the one hand, Phipps wished to avoid rehashing the same {{information}} that was available, but the careers of the marshals required some duplication. The published works were often filled with inconsistencies, {{not only in the}} French sources, but from the French to the English sources. The French sources frequently misinterpreted the English sources, and vice versa. Phipps wrote both an introduction to his work and a summary of the histories of the armies of the Republic and the Consulate, from 1791 to 1804, and at certain points in his narrative, he <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> review the positions of the various future marshals and other well-known generals. He reflected on the development of their experience, the characteristics of their leadership, and the relationships to one another and to Napoleon. Critically, he posited that generals rarely improved with practice.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{fighting}} between 1648 and 1649, the Third English Civil War {{broke out in}} 1651. Royalist forces {{under the command of}} Charles II advanced as far as Worcester, where the army <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> reinforce the walls further and await reinforcements in relative safety. The Parliamentary forces under Oliver Cromwell attacked in early September; the ensuing battle of Worcester saw the Royalist forces pushed steadily back into the city. Fort Royal was successfully stormed by the Essex militia and its guns turned on the city itself. Cromwell's men began forcing their way into the city from west, south and east and by the evening the city had fallen. The collapse marked the end of the Third Civil War. In the aftermath the bastions and other fortifications were mostly destroyed by Parliament, although the medieval walls and gates were spared.|$|E

5|$|The Wiyot {{tribe of}} California {{say that the}} condor recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped {{humanity}} out with a flood. However, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed the condor as a destroyer, not a creator. They say that Condor seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood {{so that it would}} flood Ground Squirrel's home. Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, the condor sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California believed that the condor was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire.|$|E
5|$|When Archduke Charles {{withdrew from}} the Rhine valley, he left about 30,000 troops in garrisons along the river. There were 15,000 foot and 1,200 horse in Mainz, 3,000 {{infantry}} in Ehrenbreitstein, 8,800 infantry and 300 cavalry in Mannheim and 2,500 foot soldiers in Philippsburg. To contain the first two, Jourdan left 28,545 troops under François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers while Moreau only detailed 2,800 infantry and 240 cavalry to watch the last two places. For the most part, the Austrian garrisons remained quiescent. But the Austrians in Mannheim caused mischief by attacking Kehl on 18 September. More might have been accomplished in that assault, but the Austrian soldiers <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> pillage the French camp and were driven off by their enemies. Even so, Charles not only lost the services of the 30,000 men in the fortresses {{but also of the}} Swabians, Saxons and other German allies when he retreated from the Rhine. These auxiliary forces began to negotiate with the French when their territories were occupied.|$|E
5|$|The Union flanks {{were being}} pushed back, but not decisively. Hardee and Polk caused Sherman and McClernand on the Union right to retreat in the {{direction}} of Pittsburg Landing, leaving the right flank of the Hornet's Nest exposed. Just after Johnston's death, Breckinridge, whose corps had been in reserve, attacked on the extreme left of the Union line, driving off the understrength brigade of Col. David Stuart and potentially opening a path into the Union rear and the Tennessee River. However, the Confederates <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> regroup and recover from exhaustion and disorganization, then followed the sounds of the guns toward the Hornet's Nest, and an opportunity was lost. After the Hornet's Nest fell, the remnants of the Union line established a solid three-mile (5km) front around Pittsburg Landing, extending west from the river and then north, up the River Road, keeping the approach open for the expected, although belated, arrival of Lew Wallace's division. Sherman commanded the right of the line, McClernand took the center, and on the left, the remnants of W. H. L. Wallace's, Hurlbut's, and Stuart's men mixed with thousands of stragglers who were crowding on the bluff over the landing. The advance of Buell's army, Col. Jacob Ammen's brigade of Bull Nelson's division, arrived in time to be ferried over and join the left end of the line. The defensive line included a ring of more than 50 cannons and naval guns from the river (the gunboats USS Lexington and USS Tyler). A final Confederate charge of two brigades, led by Brig. Gen. Withers, attempted to break through the line but was repulsed. Beauregard called off a second attempt after 6 p.m., as the sun set. The Confederate plan had failed; they had pushed Grant east to a defensible position on the river, not forced him west into the swamps.|$|E
