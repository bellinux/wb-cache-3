50|$|The Epimenides {{paradox is}} the same {{principle}} as <b>psychologists</b> <b>and</b> sceptics using arguments from psychology claiming humans to be unreliable.

5|$|Charles Cardell (1892–1977) was {{the founder}} of a Pagan Witchcraft {{tradition}} that rivalled that of Gerald Gardner's in southern England during the 1950s.

5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today {{subjective}} {{position of}} a Russian patient toward a medical <b>psychologist</b> <b>and</b> psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence {{is related to the}} primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E
