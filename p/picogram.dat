2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious {{structural}} characteristic of bacteria is (with some exceptions) their small size. For example, Escherichia coli cells, an [...] "average" [...] sized bacterium, are about 2µm (micrometres) long and 0.5µm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6 - 0.7 μm3. [...] This corresponds to a wet mass of about 1 <b>picogram</b> (pg), assuming that the cell consists mostly of water. The dry mass of a single cell can be estimated as 23% of the wet mass, amounting to 0.2 pg. About half of the dry mass of a bacterial cell consists of carbon, and also about half of it {{can be attributed to}} proteins. Therefore, a typical fully grown 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli (at an optical density of 1.0, corresponding to ca. 109 cells/ml) yields about 1 g wet cell mass. Small size is extremely important because it allows for a large surface area-to-volume ratio which allows for rapid uptake and intracellular distribution of nutrients and excretion of wastes. At low surface area-to-volume ratios the diffusion of nutrients and waste products across the bacterial cell membrane limits the rate at which microbial metabolism can occur, making the cell less evolutionarily fit. The reason for the existence of large cells is unknown, although it is speculated that the increased cell volume is used primarily for storage of excess nutrients.|$|E
