50|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a rapid {{increase}} in online lead generation: banner and direct response advertising that works off a CPL pricing model. In a <b>pay-per-action</b> (PPA) pricing model, advertisers pay only for qualified leads resulting fromthose actions, irrespective of the clicks or impressions that went into generating the lead. PPA advertising is playing an active role in online lead generation.|$|E
50|$|The {{final step}} {{that led to}} {{auctioning}} off domain names was Google’s Pay per click (PPC) auction model which allowed bidders to buy search terms. This allowed webpage owners to sponsor a keyword so that their ad could appear each time a user searched the term on Google, and thus increased {{the likelihood of the}} ‘clickthroughs’ their sponsor ad obtained. Gradually, as advertisement placement and sponsoring or trademarking search terms on the World Wide Web became a viable source of profit, so did domain names that attracted attention from Internet users and advertisers. Additionally, new business models for monetizing domain names are emerging. In addition to the Pay per click (PPC) model, the Cost per action (CPA) or <b>pay-per-action</b> model is being used as a new strategy for online advertising.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} current {{trend in}} advertising is {{the replacement of}} traditional pay-per-exposure (aka pay-per-impression) pricing models with performance based mechanisms in which advertisers pay only for measurable actions by consumers. Such <b>pay-per-action</b> mechanisms are becoming the predominant method of selling advertising on the Internet. Well-known examples include pay-per-click, pay-per-call and pay-per-sale. This work highlights an important, and hitherto unrecognized, side-effect of <b>pay-per-action</b> advertising. I find that, if the prices of advertised goods are endogenously determined by advertisers to maximize profits net of advertising expenses, <b>pay-per-action</b> mechanisms induce firms to distort the prices of their goods (usually upwards) relative to the prices that would maximize profits in settings where advertising is sold under pay-per-exposure methods. Upward price distortions reduce consumer surplus and {{one or both of}} advertiser profits and publisher revenues, leading to a net reduction in social welfare. They persist in current quality-weighted <b>pay-per-action</b> schemes, such as the ones used by Google and Yahoo. In the latter settings they always reduce publisher revenues relative to pay-per-exposure methods. I propose enhancements to today’s quality-weighted <b>pay-per-action</b> schemes that resolve these problems and show that the steady state limit of my enhanced mechanisms has identical allocation and revenue properties to those of an optimal pay-per-exposure mechanism.

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} draft for consideration by workshop committee only. Please do not circulate. An important current trend in advertising is {{the replacement of}} traditional pay-per-exposure (some-times {{also referred to as}} pay-per-impression) pricing models, in which advertisers pay a lump sum for the privilege of exposing an audience of uncertain size and interests to their message, with performance-based mechanisms in which advertisers pay only for measurable actions by consumers. Such <b>pay-per-action</b> mechanisms are becoming the predominant method of selling advertising on the Internet. Well-known examples include pay-per-click, pay-per-call and pay-per-sale. This work highlights an important, and hitherto unrecognized shortcoming of <b>pay-per-action</b> advertising mechanisms. I find that, if the prices of advertised goods are endogenously determined by advertisers to maximize profits net of advertising expenses, <b>pay-per-action</b> advertising induces firms to distort the prices of their goods (usually upwards) relative to the prices that would maximize profits in settings where there is no advertising or where ad-vertising is sold under pay-per-exposure methods. Such price distortions reduce consumer surplus and one or both of advertiser profits publisher revenues, leading to a net reduction in social welfare. They persist even in current quality-weighted <b>pay-per-action</b> schemes, such as the ones used by Google and Yahoo. In the latter settings they always lead to lower publisher revenues relative to pay-per-exposure methods.

40|$|Abstract. The online {{advertising}} industry is currently {{based on two}} dominant business models: the pay-per-impression model and the pay-per-click model. With the growth of sponsored search {{during the last few}} years, there has been a move toward the pay-per-click model as it decreases the risk to small advertisers. An alternative model, discussed but not widely used in the advertising industry, is pay-per-conversion, or more generally, <b>pay-per-action.</b> In this paper, we discuss various challenges involved in designing mechanisms for the <b>pay-per-action</b> model, and approaches to tackle some of them. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{important}} current {{trend in}} online advertising is {{the shift from}} traditional, “pay-per-exposure” mechanisms to, allegedly more efficient, “pay-per-action ” methods, such as pay-per-click, pay-per-call and, in some cases, even pay-per-sale. While {{there is a growing}} stream of research examining sponsored search and other types of online advertising, an important area that has not yet received sufficient attention is the interplay between payment mechanisms and the strategies of firms who choose to invest in such types of advertising. Our objective in this work is to examine how the shift from pay-per-exposure to various <b>pay-per-action</b> mechanisms affects prices and demand, the allocation of advertising slots to different firm types (high vs. low quality), and the payoffs to the publisher and the advertisers. Contrary to conventional wisdom we find that, under certain conditions, the move to <b>pay-per-action</b> can lead to an increase in prices, a decrease in the average quality of firms advertising in these markets, and a decrease in payoffs for all stakeholders. We further observe that, most current and proposed forms of <b>pay-per-action</b> advertising constitute a conceptually flawed {{solution to the problem of}} risk-sharing between advertisers and the publisher in settings where there is two-sided uncertainty. We explore alternative mechanisms with better properties. 1 Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don’t know which half.

40|$|An {{important}} current {{trend in}} advertising is {{the replacement of}} traditional pay-per-exposure (pay-per-impression) pricing models with performance-based mechanisms in which advertisers pay only for measurable actions by consumers. Such <b>pay-per-action</b> (PPA) mechanisms are be-coming the predominant method of selling advertising on the Internet. Well-known examples include pay-per-click, pay-per-call and pay-per-sale. This work highlights an important, and hith-erto unrecognized, side-effect of PPA advertising. I find that, if the prices of advertised goods are endogenously determined by advertisers to maximize profits net of advertising expenses, PPA mechanisms induce firms to distort the prices of their goods (usually upwards) relative to prices that would maximize profits in settings where advertising is sold under pay-per-exposure meth-ods. Upward price distortions reduce both consumer surplus and the joint publisher-advertiser profit, leading to a net reduction in social welfare. They persist in current auction-based PPA mechanisms, {{such as the ones}} used by Google and Yahoo. In the latter settings they always reduce publisher revenues relative to pay-per-exposure methods. In extreme cases they also lead to rat-race situations where, in their effort to outbid one another, advertisers raise the prices of their products to the point where demand for them drops to zero. I show that these phenomena constitute a form of double marginalization and discuss a number of enhancements to today’s PPA mechanisms that restore equilibrium pricing of advertised goods to efficient levels...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a study of}} position auctions, with an explicit modeling of user navigation through ads. We refer to our model as the PPA model, since it is most applicable {{in the context of}} <b>pay-per-action</b> position auctions. In this model, which is consistent with other recent approaches to user modeling, a typical user searches sequentially over the ordered list of ads. At each point the user has some probability of performing the action associated with the given ad, some probability of moving to the next ad, and some probability of quitting. In the framework of this model, we re-consider two basic mechanisms: the VCG position auction and the generalized second price (GSP) position auction. We study properties of these mechanisms {{in the context of the}} PPA model, and in particular show that the GSP position auction possesses a pure strategy equilibrium, and characterize a set of its equilibria. Our main corollary is that the highest revenue one may obtain in an equilibrium of the GSP position auction matches the revenue obtained in the VCG position auction. This suggests that the VCG position auction is preferable to the ad publisher upon the GSP position auction in the context of the PPA position auctions model. The latter is in sharp distinction to the basic result of the usefulness of GSP over VCG in the standard position auctions model, where user behavior is not modeled explicitly. We also study various possibilities for corruption in the PPA setting, and the relative robustness of the mechanisms against the corresponding manipulations. 1...|$|E
