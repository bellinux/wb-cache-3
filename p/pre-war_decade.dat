40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{patterns}} of sectoral specialisation in Italian provinces over half a century following the Unification of the country. To this end we propose a multivariate graphical technique named dynamic specialisation biplots. In 1871 specialisation vocations toward the different manufacturing sectors were limited in size and no clear geographical path emerged. A regional specialisation divide resulted clearly in 1911. In 1871 as in 1911 the foodstuffs, the textile, and the engineering sectors represented the three pillars delimiting the arena of the specialisation race. Within that arena, sharp changes in the directions of specialisation trajectories characterise a group of selected Northern provinces, largely attracted by the textile sector from the 1880 s and from the engineering sector in the <b>pre-War</b> <b>decade.</b> Within region homogeneity and smooth specialisation trajectories are instead representative {{of most of the}} remaining provinces. Among them, Southern provinces exhibit specialisation paths revealing that little more than a composition effect occurred among manufacturing sectors. ...|$|E
40|$|Treason is a {{ubiquitous}} historical phenomenon, {{one particularly}} associated with regime instability or wartime loyalties. This paper explores {{the practice and}} prosecution of treason in the last decades of the Habsburg monarchy with a special focus on some notorious wartime treason trials. It first sets the rhetoric and law of treason in a comparative historical context before assessing the legal framework supplied by the Austrian penal code of 1852. Although the treason law was exploited quite arbitrarily after 1914, the state authorities in the <b>pre-war</b> <b>decade</b> were already targeting irredentist suspects due to major anxiety about domestic and foreign security. In the Great War, the military were then given extensive powers to prosecute all political crimes including treason, causing a string of show-trials of Bosnian Serbs and some leading Czech politicians. By 1917 – 18, however, this onslaught on disloyalty was backfiring {{in the wake of}} an imperial amnesty: as loyalties shifted away from the Habsburg regime, the former criminals themselves proudly began to assume the title of ‘traitor’. The paper is a case-study of how regimes in crisis have used treason as a powerful moral instrument for managing allegiance. It also offers a new basis for understanding instability in the late Habsburg monarchy...|$|E

German ambitions brought an Anglo-German naval arms race in which the Imperial German Navy was built up from a small force to the world's most modern and second most powerful. The 1916 Battle of Jutland demonstrated the excellence of German ships and crews, but also showed that the High Seas Fleet was not big enough to challenge openly the British blockade of Germany.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the functional distribution of income in Spain from a historical perspective has created many obstacles to historiography {{due to the lack}} of statistical sources. The main objective of this research is to offer a new quantitative tool which lets empirically test many arguments sustained in this field —with little statistical support— until this moment. The proposed indicator is defined as the ratio between the income corresponding to the industrial workers and the enterprise profits in Spain from 1914 to 1959. Its long-term behaviour identifies, firstly, some interesting trends on the distributive guidelines in the Spanish economy before and after the Civil War. Secondly, the quantitative evidence reveals that the capital income was clearly favoured in the post-War period at the same time as the labour income was clearly damaged. As a consequence, the prevailing distributive pattern in this economy over the course of the <b>pre-War</b> <b>decades</b> was modified.

40|$|For decades, {{scholars}} {{outside of}} economics have explained Japanese economic growth through prudent government management. Although economists {{have been more}} critical, even they have usually viewed favorably the role the government played in finance. In these favorable accounts, they often give the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ; Kogin) a central place. Founded in 1902 to encourage long-term industrial investment, the bank maintained a reputation as the "central bank for manufacturing. " During those <b>pre-war</b> <b>decades,</b> observers continue, it also developed the monitoring technology now basic to the "main bank system. " In the article that follows, we show that the IBJ never lived up to this reputation. We make four broad points. First, the IBJ never received from the government subsidies sufficient to have significantly increased the funds available to manufacturing firms. The subsidies it could offer began modest, and stayed modest. Second, despite its billing, during the early decades it did not lend primarily to manufacturing firms. Third, when {{in the early years}} it lent to borrowers dictated by the government, it lent pursuant to a political rather than high-growth dynamic. When it lent to government-dictated borrowers in the later pre-war years, it did so to subsidize the war. Last, the IBJ never developed any unusual ability to monitor borrowers. In the end, the manufacturing firms in pre-war Japan simply did not need another bank. Granted, to fuel their expansion they needed vast amounts of investment. But it was money they could [...] and did [...] obtain directly from the financial markets themselves. ...|$|R
40|$|Attempting to {{investigate}} works of music through frank examination of possible influences {{is a delicate}} thing, sometimes maybe dangerous - as has been suggested by Jonathan Cross in his book, The Stravinsky Legacy. While the originality of a composer {{may appear to be}} threatened with such types of critique, for musicologists it is important to draw upon a deeper appreciation for how a composer searched for his/her own creative voice. The music of Ljubica Marić (1909 - 2003), {{one of the most important}} Serbian composers of the 20 th century, has been chosen to demonstrate how composers need different influences during different phases of their maturation and how they deeply integrate them in order to create an individual utterance. Ljubica Marić first studied composition with Josip Slavenski at the Belgrade Music School (1925 - 29), and continued her studies with Josef Suk at the Master School of the Prague Conservatory (1929 - 32) where she obtained her diploma. Finally, she took Alois Hába’s course in quarter-tone music at the same institution from 1936 to 1937. The works she composed during the 1930 ’s were characterized by a radical will to break ties with traditional, mainly romantic music, so she chose to be influenced by the free atonal pre-dodecaphonic works of Arnold Schoenberg. Following World War II, she introduced some changes of expression that were more in keeping with links from the past. Her music became tonally stabilized, and thematic-motivational developments were rediscovered, resulting in an expression that became milder. But the changes need not necessarily be linked exclusively to the post-war climate of socialist realism. Rather, the previous style may have met up with some type of impasse - the sort that confounds or ultimately transforms an artist. For Ljubica Marić, however, it appears she was never truly satisfied with her first post-war works (1945 - 1950). What is certain is that she composed nothing during the several years that preceded her first masterpiece, the cantata The Songs of Space (1956). It is however worth examining whether or not they were really "dry years". It is certain that for Ljubica Marić, they were fresh discoveries of Serbian traditional singing, both folk and church, poetic and artistic treasures of the Middle Ages - but she also revived earlier experiences (from the <b>pre-war</b> <b>decade)</b> that she had rejected at the time, mainly the music of Stravinsky, Bartók and Slavenski. Although those influences can be detected in the score of The Songs of Space, the work has a strong individual imprint, an identity of its own. In the works that followed, The Passacaglia for orchestra and in several compositions belonging to the cycle Musica octoicha (Octoicha 1, The Byzantine Concerto, Ostinato super thema octoicha, The Threshold of Dreams) original traits of Ljubica Marić’s poetics became even more pronounced. The last works that she produced (in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s) are all for instrumental soloists or chamber ensembles. They continue with, and refine the main characteristics of the earlier ones. Ljubica Marić’s evolvement thus presents a search for originality of expression that was reached only after a process of selective assimilation and creative transformation of tradition had been fulfilled - but not until any "anxiety of influences" had been abandoned. It has been shown that Ljubica Marić, like other artists needed to be ready to be influenced, in order to absorb such influences in a creative way...|$|E
40|$|The present licentiate thesis {{analyses}} {{developments in}} Swedish marine insurance during the interwar period, including both direct marine insurance and marine reinsurance. This {{is done in}} order to provide insights on how companies of a highly internationalised and vulnerable line of insurance were affected by and responded to new risks during a period of far-reaching international financial and economic crises. Finally, the consequences of new risks and strategies are assessed. This thesis argues that during the interwar period Swedish maritime trade and Swedish marine insurance greatly depended on each other for marine insurance cover and marine insurance premium incomes. The business results in Swedish marine insurance partly depended on the development of Swedish trade. These business results were also vulnerable to currency risks. Swedish marine insurers faced no similar trade or currency risks during the two decades preceding World War I, and accordingly the returns on Swedish marine insurance were lower during the interwar period than during the last two <b>pre-war</b> <b>decades.</b> These factors probably bore their most severe consequences during the early 1920 s when Swedish marine insurance on average induced losses to insurers. The remaining years of the period constituted a long-run recovery, and the Great Depression of the early 1930 s caused no difficulties of the same order. This thesis also indicates that interwar Swedish marine insurers responded to new risks by increasing the level of cession to reinsurers. Another response was to increase the level of differentiation among insurance lines. This thesis describes the consequences of new risks and strategies in interwar Swedish marine insurance, focusing {{on the development of the}} Swedish marine insurance market structure and on the business results of Swedish marine insurers. Though this market shrunk and grew excessively, the relative importance of stock and mutual insurers showed only minor fluctuations. The importance of specialised marine reinsurance companies, however, fluctuated greatly. Also, cooperation between interwar marine insurers and the formation of insurance groups set new trends of concentration for the future. Finally, even though Swedish marine insurance during some years induced losses the Swedish marine insurers never experienced true losses on their total businesses...|$|R
40|$|The car {{industry}} has been a leading industrial sector of Japan's economy since {{the second half of}} the twentieth century. However, its rapid growth over the last decades has sometimes overshadowed the fact that the {{industry has}} undergone substantial evolution since its establishment in the 1950 s. Changes - mainly implemented through the continuous interplay between corporates strategies and central government's policies - have involved design- and manufacturing-related processes and operations, the carmakers' organizational structure, and the industry's geographical footprint both nationwide and overseas. Based on these premises, after providing basic understanding of the factors and conditions leading to the consolidation and development of the Japanese car industry in the <b>pre-war</b> and postwar <b>decades,</b> this working paper aims to investigate the triggers laying behind the evolution of northern Kyushu industrial cluster that, in the last years, has become to be known as Japan's "car island". In particular, attention will be drawn to those changing production-related, organizational and spatial features characterizing car companies and interfirm relations in Japan which led to the declustering of domestic manufacturers from historical core regions to peripheral areas such as Kyushu. In order to accomplish this task, research has been primarily conducted by the authors on the following categories : 1) agents of change; 2) processes and operations (i. e. product development and manufacturing); 3) organizational structure (i. e. inter-corporate and corporate-supplier relations); 4) geography (i. e. global, national, local scales). Even if national and local government intervention in automotive industry-related matters has also been taken into consideration, further research is required...|$|R
