5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents.

5|$|Single cross hybrids {{result from}} the cross between two true-breeding organisms which {{produces}} an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|E
5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E

Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega suffered its first <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. This decision effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year.
