5|$|One of {{the first}} {{questions}} which was voted over, was the EU issue. Hagen formally submitted a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> the factual aspects of this issue should not be debated, and this was passed with 113 against 44 votes.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} reason for this ambition is growing international concern about human-induced climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by 60% was incorporated into the UK government's 2003 Energy White Paper. The 2006 Stern Review proposed a 55% reduction by 2030. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report has further increased {{the profile of the}} issue.|$|E

5|$|He was {{a trustee}} of both the National Gallery and Tate Gallery. His <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> a wing of the latter should be devoted to his sculptures aroused hostility among some artists. In 1975, {{he became the first}} President of the Turner Society, which had been founded to {{campaign}} for a separate museum in which the whole Turner Bequest might be reunited, an aim defeated by the National Gallery and Tate Gallery.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Raytheon Engineers and Constructors {{proposed}} {{to build and}} operate a Dulles Corridor Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. In January 1999, the Tysons-Dulles Corridor Group (which included Bechtel Corporation and West*Group) offered a competing BRT <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> would ultimately extend the rail line to Ashburn. These proposals prompted the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to evaluate the merits of BRT and heavy rail public transit in the corridor.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to {{criticism of the}} virtual duopolies and sharing agreements, the FCC began to consider potential changes to address these loopholes. In March 2013, the Commission first tabled a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> would make joint sales agreements count the same as ownership.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{immediately}} {{embark on}} {{the creation of a new}} Tintin adventure, Hergé agreed to a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> Le Soir crime writer, Paul Kinnet, would author a detective story featuring Thomson and Thompson.

5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth that Jesus {{was a political}} national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> Jesus was a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.|$|E

5|$|Early {{mediation}} {{attempts in}} March 1499 had failed because of mutual distrust between the parties. But {{after the battle}} of Dornach, the Swabian League was war-weary and had lost all confidence in the king's abilities as a military leader, and thus refused Maximilian's demands to muster a new army. The Swabian and Habsburg armies had suffered far higher human losses than the Swiss, and were also short on artillery, after repeatedly having lost their equipment to the Swiss. The Swiss also had no interest to prolong the war further, though they refused a first peace <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> Maximilian presented at Schaffhausen in August 1499.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 {{a friend}} of Watts {{suggested}} to Henry Gamble, Vicar of St Botolph's Aldersgate, that should the church manage to purchase the land owned by the CPF {{it would make a}} suitable site for Watts's memorial. Watts was approached, and agreed to the suggestion. On 13October 1898 the appeal was relaunched, with the <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> if the remaining £3,000 were raised, Watts would design and build a covered way, which in due course would be lined with memorial tablets to commemorate the bravery of ordinary people. Watts planned to build a covered way around three sides of a quadrangle, with the roof supported on stone or timber columns.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Hess {{enrolled}} in the University of Munich, where he studied history and economics. His geopolitics professor was Karl Haushofer, a proponent {{of the concept of}} Lebensraum ("living space"), which Haushofer cited to justify the <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> Germany should forcefully conquer additional territory in Eastern Europe. Hess later introduced this concept to Adolf Hitler, and it became one of the pillars of Nazi Party ideology. Hess became friends with Haushofer and his son Albrecht, a social theorist and lecturer.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, {{a statue}} of Sir Robert Peel erected in Cheapside in 1855 was {{declared}} an obstruction to traffic and removed. A <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> it be installed {{in front of the}} Bank of England fell through, and in 1952 it was erected in Postman's Park. In 1971 the Metropolitan Police requested that the statue be moved to the new Peel Centre police training complex, and the Corporation of London agreed. In place of Peel's statue, a large bronze sculpture of the Minotaur by Michael Ayrton was unveiled in 1973. Dominating the small park, in 1997 the Minotaur sculpture was moved to a new position on the raised walkway above London Wall.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D'Esposito {{announced}} The Avengers would film {{primarily in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts {{of the film}} were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan, but a plan to film in Detroit ended after Governor Rick Snyder issued a budget <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> would eliminate a film tax incentive. Three months later in March, Governor of Ohio John Kasich announced before Mayor Frank G. Jackson's State of the City address that The Avengers would film in Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|In October 2011 {{city and}} state {{officials}} announced an agreement in which the UN {{would be allowed to}} build a long-sought new office tower adjacent to the existing campus on the current Robert Moses Playground, which would be relocated. In exchange, the United Nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. The plan is similar in concept to an earlier <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward.|$|E

5|$|In their 1914 Flora of Jamaica, William Fawcett and Alfred Barton Rendle linked Sloane's {{illustration}} to {{the tree}} species that was then known as Ficus suffocans, a name that {{had been assigned to}} it in August Grisebach's Flora of the British West Indian Islands. Gordon DeWolf agreed with their conclusion and used the name F. maxima for that species in the 1960 Flora of Panama. Since this use has become widespread, Berg proposed that the name Ficus maxima be conserved in the way DeWolf had used it, a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> was accepted by the nomenclatural committee.|$|E
5|$|McCormack {{retired from}} the Air Force in 1955, {{and became the first}} head of the Institute for Defense Analysis, a {{non-profit}} research organization to provide advice and support to the Department of Defense's scientific and technological research efforts formed by ten universities. In 1958 he became vice president for industrial and governmental relations at MIT. He originated the <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics be used as the basis for a new space agency, which eventually became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.|$|E
5|$|On Shackleton's return home, public honours {{were quickly}} forthcoming.

He was honoured by the Royal Geographical Society, who awarded him a Gold Medal; a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> the medal be smaller than that earlier awarded to Captain Scott was not acted on. All {{the members of the}} Nimrod Expedition shore party received silver Polar Medals on 23 November, with Shackleton receiving a clasp to his earlier medal. Shackleton was also appointed a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a significant honour for British mariners.|$|E
