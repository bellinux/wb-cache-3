5|$|In 1951 the Goons {{made their}} feature film debut in Penny Points to Paradise. Sellers and Milligan then penned the script to Let's Go Crazy, the {{earliest}} film to showcase Sellers's ability to portray {{a series of}} different characters within the same film, and he made another appearance opposite his Goons co-stars in the 1952 flop, Down Among the Z Men. In 1954, Sellers was cast opposite Sid James, Tony Hancock, Raymond Huntley, Donald Pleasence and Eric Sykes in the British Lion Film Corporation comedy <b>production,</b> <b>Orders</b> Are Orders. John Grierson believes that this was Sellers's breakthrough role on screen and credits this film with launching the film careers of both Sellers and Hancock.|$|E

25|$|The sole {{prototype}} of the Fairchild XC-120 Packplane, 48-330, c/n 10312, a design with a detachable pod for the cargo converted from a C-119B, was tested at Eglin AFB in 1951, although no <b>production</b> <b>orders</b> followed. Project abandoned in 1952.|$|E

25|$|The CL.II {{passed its}} Typenprüfung (type-test) on 7 May 1917, which {{resulted}} in <b>production</b> <b>orders</b> being placed. Halberstadt built 700 CL.IIs by the time production shifted to the improved CL.IV in mid-1918. A further 200 CL.II aircraft were built in 1918 by the Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke (BFW).|$|E
25|$|However, the Navy {{was very}} {{interested}} in the VE-7, and received the first machine in May 1920. <b>Production</b> <b>orders</b> soon followed, in fact beyond what the fledgling Vought organization could handle, and the Naval Aircraft Factory was pressed into service. In all, 128 VE-7s were built.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discussed}} <b>production</b> <b>order</b> picking schedule {{problem in}} AGV-based FMS. A general formulation of <b>production</b> <b>order</b> picking schedule mode is suggestion with objective of minimizing the order picking {{time and the}} number of AGVs. Based on the analysis that the relationship between our problem and the standard VRP, we design a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the mode. Computational experiment is conducted and excellent computational results comparison with other method indicates that the genetic algorithm proposed in this paper is suitable for <b>production</b> <b>order</b> picking problem...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{improves}} {{upon the}} existing literature surrounding the <b>production</b> <b>order</b> quantity inventory model in which unit cost and daily production {{are assumed to be}} constant. By including economies of scale into the model, we examine its impact on <b>production</b> <b>order</b> quantity and total cost. The results suggest that the minimal cost solution derived from the <b>production</b> <b>order</b> quantity model needs to balance out holding, setup and production costs. As a result, a smaller inventory level corresponding to a minimum unit production cost is found to be preferred...|$|R

25|$|Production {{commenced}} in late 1916. Sopwith and Clayton & Shuttleworth {{completed their}} RNAS <b>production</b> <b>orders,</b> but Oakley, {{which had no}} prior experience building aircraft, delivered only three Triplanes before its contract was cancelled in October 1917. For unknown reasons, the RFC Triplane contract issued to Clayton & Shuttleworth was simply cancelled rather than being transferred to the RNAS. Total production amounted to 147 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Orlickly {{and others}} at IBM {{developed}} a push approach to inventory control and production planning, now known as material requirements planning (MRP), which takes as input both the master production schedule (MPS) {{and the bill of}} materials (BOM) and gives as output a schedule for the materials (components) needed in the production process. MRP therefore is a planning tool to manage purchase orders and <b>production</b> <b>orders</b> (also called jobs).|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} D.XII first flew in March 1918. Subsequently, Idflieg {{issued a}} production order for 50 aircraft. Pfalz entered several D.XII prototypes {{in the second}} fighter competition at Adlershof in May/June 1918. Only Ernst Udet and Hans Weiss favored the D.XII over the Fokker D.VII, but Udet's opinion carried such weight that Pfalz received substantial <b>production</b> <b>orders</b> for the D.XII. The aircraft passed its Typenprüfung (official type test) on 19 June 1918.|$|E

25|$|The {{prototype}} T.1 first flew in June 1917, {{powered by}} a 200hp Hispano-Suiza 8Ba engine. Official trials commenced in July 1917 and the Admiralty issued <b>production</b> <b>orders</b> for 100 aircraft in August. Contractors Fairfield Engineering and Pegler & Company had no experience as aircraft manufacturers, however, resulting in substantial production delays. Moreover, the S.E.5a had priority for the limited supplies of the Hispano-Suiza 8. Redesign of the T.1 airframe to accommodate the heavier Sunbeam Arab incurred further delays.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{successful}} {{and led to}} <b>production</b> <b>orders</b> being placed for similar trains for the Western, Eastern, Scottish and London Midland Regions. The production power cars featured a redesigned front end without conventional buffers, although a rigid drawbar {{can be used to}} connect an HST to an ordinary locomotive. Following the introduction of production HST sets, the prototype unit was withdrawn, the power cars passing to the Research Division at Derby. Of the ten prototype coaches, two were adapted for use in the Royal Train, five were modified for use with the production HSTs, and three were transferred to Departmental stock.|$|E
25|$|The first navalised prototype, Type 398 TS413 flew on 17 June 1947 {{flown by}} test pilot Mike Lithgow, {{three years after}} the Meteor had made its first flight. <b>Production</b> <b>orders</b> for the FAA were placed in November 1949. The first {{production}} aircraft to take to the skies was the F.1 variant in 1950, entering service with the FAA in August 1951 with the first squadron being 800 Naval Air Squadron. The F.1's armament consisted of four 20mm (.79in) Hispano Mk. V cannons, with 125 rounds of ammunition per gun. It was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Nene Mk. 101 turbojet engine.|$|E

25|$|A revised {{prototype}} with longer-span wings, the Firefly III {{was built}} to Specification N21/26 as a carrier-based fighter to replace the Fleet Air Arm's Fairey Flycatchers, first flying on 17 May 1929. Like the land-based fighter, it was rebuilt with more metal components as the Firefly IIIM, and again like the Firefly II, was beaten by a design produced by Hawker, {{in this case the}} Hawker Nimrod. Although no <b>production</b> <b>orders</b> ensued, the Firefly IIIM was fitted with floats and used as a trainer by the RAF's High Speed Flight preparing for the 1931 Schneider Trophy race.|$|E
25|$|<b>Production</b> <b>orders</b> were {{contingent}} {{on the success of}} the test programme; delays caused by over 250 modifications to the two prototypes led to an initial production order for 200 aircraft being held up until January 1939, followed by a second order for a similar number, deliveries to fighter squadrons being scheduled to begin in September 1940. Earlier, due to the lower expected production at Westland, there had been suggestions that production should be by other firms and an early 1939 plan to build 600 of them at the Castle Bromwich factory was dropped in favour of Spitfire production.|$|E
25|$|The Vimy was {{powered by}} a range of {{different}} engines. Owing to engine supply difficulties, the prototype Vimys were tested {{with a number of}} different engine types, including Sunbeam Maoris, Salmson 9Zm water-cooled radials, and Fiat A.12bis engines, before <b>production</b> <b>orders</b> were placed for aircraft powered by the 230hp (170kW) BHP Puma, 400hp (300kW) Fiat, 400hp (300kW) Liberty L-12 and the 360hp (270kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engines, with a total of 776 ordered {{before the end of the}} First World War. Of these, only aircraft powered by the Eagle engine, known as the Vimy IV, were delivered to the RAF. Due to the diverse number of engines used, there are multiple conflicting official reports on the production numbers of each sub-variant of the Vimy.|$|E
