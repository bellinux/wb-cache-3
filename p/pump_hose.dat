5|$|During World War II, {{more than}} 340 of the village's 1,830 {{residents}} {{served in the}} United States Armed Forces. The Hook and Ladder Company waived fees and dues for those enlisted from 1941 onward. Such {{a sufficient number of}} firefighters was serving the armed forces that the village requested volunteers ages 16–18 to join the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department; at least nine served on active duty during the war and had the ability to excuse themselves from school (which was then located adjacent to Law Memorial Park) if the fire siren went off. Also during the war, in 1944, the department received a trailer-type pump unit with a 500-gallon <b>pump,</b> <b>hose,</b> nozzle, ladders, and other tools. It was loaned to the village by the Office of Civil Defense and was an auxiliary to the existing equipment. One year later, Briarcliff High School graduate and Briarcliff Fire Company lieutenant Sgt. Arthur J. Quinn, Jr. of the 45th Division was killed in action in Germany.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} development of an automated irrigation system, which consisted of a sprinkler that has a range of 16 meters in diameter using only sprinklers per one hectare of land, water <b>pump,</b> <b>hose,</b> water containers, electro valves, relays, electronic components such as humidity and temperature sensor, ultrasonic sensor, LCD screen, microcontroller (Arduino Mega), for communication a bluetooth module and a mobile device (Android). The agile methodology used was Extreme XP Programming, following its 4 phases, planning, design, development and testing. With this an automated irrigation system was used that was developed to monitor temperature, humidity and to generate a saving in the water thanks to the census of the container of the same, as well as the reduction of maintenance costs, this can be activated or deactivated by the user regardless of the conditions. The system complies with the characteristics of a utility model, because these models are all those objects, tools, appliances or tools that, {{as a result of a}} change in their layout, configuration, structure or form, present a different function with respect to the parts that integrate it or advantages in terms of its usefulness and thanks to the search carried out in IMPI.

50|$|Drive by wire, DbW, by-wire, Steer-by-wire, or {{x-by-wire}} {{technology in}} the automotive industry {{is the use of}} electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages. This technology replaces the traditional mechanical control systems with electronic control systems using electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces such as pedal and steering feel emulators. Components such as the steering column, intermediate shafts, <b>pumps,</b> <b>hoses,</b> belts, coolers and vacuum servos and master cylinders are eliminated from the vehicle. This is similar to the fly-by-wire systems used widely in the aviation industry.|$|R
50|$|The biggest {{advantage}} {{with the}} <b>hose</b> <b>pumps</b> over the roller pumps {{is the high}} operating pressure of up to 16 bar. With rollers max pressure can arrive up to 12 Bar without any problem. If the high operating pressure is not required, a tubing pump is a better option than a <b>hose</b> <b>pump</b> if the pumped medium is not abrasive. With recent advances made in the tubing technology for pressure, life and chemical compatibility, {{as well as the}} higher flow rate ranges, the advantages that <b>hose</b> <b>pumps</b> had over roller pumps continues to erode.|$|R

Psychologist Ernest Dichter and DDB Worldwide copywriter Sandy Sulcer learned that motorists desired both power and play while driving, and chose the tiger as an easy-to-remember symbol to communicate those feelings. The North American and later European campaign featured extensive television and radio and magazine ads, including photos with tiger tails supposedly emerging from car gas tanks, promotional events featuring real tigers, billboards, and in Europe station <b>pump</b> <b>hoses</b> [...] "wrapped in tiger stripes" [...] as well as pop music songs.

40|$|Similar to the {{fly-by-wire}} {{technology in}} aerospace industry, drive-by-wire technology in automotive industry replaces the traditional mechanical and hydraulic systems with mechatronic actuation and control and human-machine interfaces (such as pedals and steering wheels) with emulators. Brake-by-wire in particular, represents {{the replacement of}} traditional components such as the <b>pumps,</b> <b>hoses,</b> fluids, belts and brake boosters and master cylinders with electronic sensors and actuators. Some x-by-wire technologies have been already installed on commercial vehicles such as steer-bywire, and throttle-by-wire. Due to its safety-critical nature, the brake-by-wire technology is still under an intensive research and development by some automobile and automotive parts manufacturers worldwide {{and has not been}} widely commercialized yet. This paper surveys some recent patents that suggest techniques to solve two challenging problems in brake-by-wire systems.

50|$|After {{a fire in}} Zikhron Ya'akov in 1897, {{the first}} {{firefighting}} company was established by the Baron Rothschild. The company had 32 members, and equipment was brought from Paris, including <b>pumps,</b> <b>hoses,</b> ladders, axes and uniforms with shiny copper helmets and leather belts.Another company was formed in Tel Aviv in 1925 following a flood in the Brenner neighbourhood, and was based in the first dedicated fire station in the country, a shed near the police station. Throughout the following years, more firefighting companies and fire stations were established throughout the Yishuv. By Israeli independence in 1948 there were fire stations in most Jewish settlements; Petah Tikva, Jerusalem, Haifa, Hadera, Rehovot, Nahariya, Bnei Brak, Ramat Gan, Givatayim, Afula, Herzliya, Kfar Saba, Holon, Netanya and Rishon LeZion.After Israeli independence, fire stations were built in several other cities, including Acre and Beersheba, at Lod Airport, the oil refineries in Haifa and at the ports of Port of Haifa and Port of Ashdod.|$|R

The close approach of typhoon [...] "Gilda" [...] pounded the grounded destroyer so badly that it was impossible for small boats to get alongside her.
