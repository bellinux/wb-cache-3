30|$|However, {{most studies}} only {{evaluate}} <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> for MEA solvent {{and the interaction}} between solvent and process is ignored (Le Moullec et al. 2014). Therefore, it is worth investigating the energy consumption of different amine solvents in different process. As a result, this work proposes a comparative study on CO 2 capture <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> between MEA and DEA, which is aiming to compare the thermal performances between MEA and DEA, as well as investigating the energy saving by different <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> using MEA and DEA. Including the conventional capture <b>process,</b> ten <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> are evaluated, which are inspired {{by the work of}} Le Moullec et al. (2014). The simulations are carried out with commercial software to calculate energy consumption for different <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> with a CO 2 compression process. For the further study and discussion, a detailed analysis is presented to study the effect of some significant parameters in capture process and the total energy consumptions of each condition are evaluated and compared.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presented}} a {{comparative study of}} monoethanolamine (MEA) and diethanolamine (DEA) for post-combustion CO 2 capture (PCC) process with different <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> to study the interaction effect between solvent and process. The steady state process model of the conventional MEA-based PCC process was developed in Pro/II® and was validated with the experimental data. Then ten different <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> were simulated for both MEA and DEA. Their performances in energy consumption were compared in terms of reboiler duty and total equivalent work. The results show that DEA generally has better thermal performances than MEA for all these ten <b>process</b> <b>configurations.</b> Seven <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> provide 0.38 %– 4.61 % total energy saving compared with the conventional PCC process for MEA, and other two configurations are not favourable. For DEA, except one <b>configuration,</b> other <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> have 0.27 %– 4.50 % total energy saving. This work also analyzed the sensitivities of three key parameters (amine concentration, stripper pressure and lean solvent loading) in conventional process and five process modifications to show optimization strategy.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the techno-economic {{performance}} of <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> for ethanol production involving solid-liquid separators and reactors in the saccharification and fermentation stage, a family of <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> where few alternatives have been proposed. Since including these process alternatives creates a large number of possible <b>process</b> <b>configurations,</b> a framework for process synthesis and optimization is proposed. This approach is supported on kinetic models fed with experimental data and a plant-wide techno-economic model. Among 150 <b>process</b> <b>configurations,</b> 40 show an improved MESP compared to a well-documented base case (BC), almost all include solid separators and some show energy retrieved in products 32 % higher compared to the BC. Moreover, 16 of them also show a lower capital investment per unit of ethanol produced per year.

40|$|Capturing CO 2 from {{coal-fired}} power plants is a necessary component of any large-scale effort to reduce anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Conventional absorption/stripping with monoethanolamine (MEA) or similar solvents {{are the most likely}} current process for capturing CO 2 from the flue gas at these facilities. However, one of the largest problems with MEA absorption/stripping is that conventional <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> have energy requirements that result in large reductions in the net power plant output. Several alternative <b>process</b> <b>configurations</b> for reducing these parasitic energy requirements were investigated in this study {{with the assistance of the}} Platte River Power Authority, based on recovering energy from the CO 2 compression train and using this energy in the MEA regeneration step.

50|$|The {{amount of}} sewage sludge {{produced}} {{is proportional to the}} amount and concentration of wastewater treated, and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used. It can be expressed as kg dry solids per cubic metre of wastewater treated. The total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks (if {{they are part of the}} <b>process</b> <b>configuration)</b> plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step. For example, primary sedimentation produces about 110-170 kg/ML of so-called primary sludge, with a value of 150 kg/ML regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the U.S. or Europe. The sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3. Of the biological treatment processes, the activated sludge process produces about 70-100 kg/ML of waste activated sludge, and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process: 60-100 kg/ML. This means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180-270 kg/ML, being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge.|$|E
50|$|SOFC {{design and}} IGFC <b>process</b> <b>configuration</b> can greatly simplify {{the capture of}} carbon dioxide, which will {{increasingly}} be demanded for low greenhouse gas emissions of most fossil-fuel utilization processes. In conventional combustion, fuel is burned in air, resulting in exhaust gases containing large amount of nitrogen from which capture of a pure carbon dioxide stream (needed for storage of carbon in greenhouse gas emissions control scenarios) is inefficient. In oxy-combustion, oxygen is extracted from air and used for fuel combustion, resulting in exhaust gases uncontaminated with nitrogen from which capture of a pure carbon dioxide stream is efficient. However, a large energy penalty for doing the air separation required for isolating the oxygen stream {{in the first place}} is incurred. In contrast, for SOFC function neither inefficient carbon capture from exhaust gases nor air separation is required: the only required interaction of the anode and cathode reactant streams is the transfer of oxygen from cathode side (air) to anode side (fuel). All carbon, excepting the negligible amount in atmospheric air coming in at the cathode, will enter the module with fuel on the anode side, and it must exit the anode as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. By designing the SOFC module to keep anode and cathode off-gas streams separated, dilution of that carbon-rich stream with atmospheric nitrogen from the cathode side is avoided, allowing simple and inexpensive carbon dioxide separation and capture downstream.|$|E
