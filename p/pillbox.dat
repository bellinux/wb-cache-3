5|$|Another {{innovation}} was {{a mobile}} <b>pillbox</b> {{that could be}} driven out onto the airfield. This {{was known as the}} Bison and consisted of a lorry with a concrete armoured cabin and a small concrete <b>pillbox</b> on the flat bed.|$|E
5|$|Defences were {{in place}} at both bridges. On {{the west bank of}} the Caen Canal bridge there were three machine-gun emplacements and on the east bank a machine-gun and an {{anti-tank}} gun. To their north were another three machine-guns and a concrete <b>pillbox.</b> An anti-aircraft tower equipped with machine-guns stood to the south. At the River Orne bridge, the eastern bank south of the bridge had a <b>pillbox</b> with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. To the north of the bridge were two machine-guns. Both bridges had sandbagged trench systems along the banks.|$|E
5|$|The Company Shed {{restaurant}} {{on the west side}} of the island serves seafood fresh to order and has been praised for its quality by Jamie Oliver. Many small shops and ice cream businesses serve the tourism on Mersea's seafront. The Two Sugars Cafe is sited on a former World War II <b>pillbox</b> near the beach.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>pillboxes</b> {{have been}} {{converted}} to make roosts for bats. <b>Pillboxes</b> that are well dug-in and thick walled are naturally damp and provide a stable thermal environment that is required by bats that would otherwise hibernate in caves. With a few minor modifications, suitable <b>pillboxes</b> {{can be converted to}} artificial caves for bats.|$|R
50|$|A {{complex of}} six <b>pillboxes</b> with mortars in support {{held up the}} 1st Battalion, 24th Marines' attack across the airfield, inflicting many casualties. Two M4 medium tanks went forward to knock out the <b>pillboxes.</b> The tanks both hit landmines and were put out of action. Maj Paul Treitel, {{commander}} of 1/24, needed support to destroy the <b>pillboxes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Beyond {{the bridge}} is Bodiam railway station, the western {{terminus}} of the Kent and East Sussex Railway since 2000. On the north {{bank of the river}} is Bodiam Castle, built soon after 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge. Lord Curzon restored the ruins in 1919 and gave them to the National Trust six years later. The buildings are grade I listed, and the landscaped grounds, which include a millpond and a Second World War <b>pillbox,</b> are a scheduled ancient monument.|$|E
5|$|In May 1940, the Directorate of Fortifications and Works (FW3) {{was set up}} at the War Office. Its {{purpose was}} to provide basic <b>pillbox</b> designs which could be {{constructed}} by soldiers and local labour at appropriate defensive locations. In the following June and July FW3 issued 6 basic designs for rifle and light machine gun pillboxes, designated Type 22 to Type 27. In addition, there were designs for gun emplacements suitable for either the Ordnance QF 2 pounder or the Hotchkiss 6 pounder gun (designated Type 28) and a design for a hardened medium machine gun emplacement.|$|E
5|$|Specialised armour {{arriving}} in the first wave included AVREs, mine flails, and armoured bulldozers. Clearing paths off the beach proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone mine flail tank finally cleared a path from the beach up toward the Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer. This route {{was used by the}} Green Howards and tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, who cleared the remaining resistance at the Mont Fleury Battery. B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on Crépon, where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners. Colour Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis earned the only Victoria Cross to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a <b>pillbox,</b> so he shot into the entrance with his Sten gun and dropped a grenade through the roof, killing most of the occupants. He cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon the occupants of a second <b>pillbox</b> surrendered. Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near Crépon.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not clear}} whether any of these <b>pillboxes</b> engaged {{directly}} in the 1944 battle for Guam. These <b>pillboxes</b> were clearly designed to repel invaders coming from the sea. The U.S. invasion beginning on July 21, 1944, however, was further to the south and west; the area of these <b>pillboxes</b> was over-run by U.S. forces coming from the south, on about August 2, 1944.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pillboxes</b> at Brainshaugh and West Thirston {{may not be}} part of the Coquet stopline, {{as their}} ID numbers are out of {{sequence}} with the others. They may have formed an inland stop line running north to south. The <b>pillboxes</b> at Hazon, Brainshaugh, Morwick, West Thirston, Earsdon, Longhirst, Bothal Barns and East Moor (and possibly Eshott) form a line with the <b>pillboxes</b> approximately two miles apart.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>pillboxes</b> were {{designed}} to be prefabricated and transported to their location for assembly. During World War I, Sir Ernest William Moir produced a design for concrete machine-gun <b>pillboxes</b> constructed from a system of interlocking precast concrete blocks, with a steel roof. Around 1500 Moir <b>pillboxes</b> were eventually produced (with blocks cast at Richborough in Kent) {{and sent to the}} Western Front in 1918.|$|R
5|$|The first {{resistance}} {{was met by}} Birks and a corporal, taking two machine-gun positions as another group of officers rushed a strong post. They were attacked with bombs, and the corporal was seriously wounded. Birks continued on alone. Reaching {{the rear of the}} <b>pillbox,</b> he forced the occupants to surrender. Birks then led an attack a series of dugouts and pillboxes on the edge of Glencorse Wood, and fought against machine gun and bombs. He also assisted in the reorganisation and consolidation of Australian men who had drifted away from their unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} was discovered at about 00:30 on June 3, and Zur's force lost {{the element of}} surprise. The Egyptian position that engaged the Israelis had two companies, but Harpaz, the 51st's 3rd Company's commander, underestimated the force and reported that it contained only one platoon. Zur decided to regroup in the wadi and ordered Aryeh Kotzer's 1st Company to stay and engage the Egyptians {{at the spot where}} they were originally discovered and assault the <b>pillbox</b> there, {{while the rest of the}} forces would try a turning movement.|$|E
5|$|All nine gliders {{carrying}} the troops assigned to Group Steel landed {{next to the}} bridge at Veldwezelt at 05:20, the barbed-wire wrapped around the landing skids of the gliders succeeding in rapidly bringing them to a halt. The glider belonging to Leutnant Altmann had landed {{some distance from the}} bridge, and a second had landed directly in front of a Belgian <b>pillbox,</b> which began engaging both groups of airborne troops with small-arms fire. The non-commissioned officer in charge of the troops from the second glider hurled grenades at the <b>pillbox</b> whilst one of his men laid an explosive charge at the door and detonated it, allowing the bunker to be assaulted and removed as an obstacle. Simultaneously, Altmann gathered his troops and led them along a ditch running parallel to the bridge until two men were able to reach the canal bank and climb onto the girders of the bridge and disconnect the demolition charges placed there by the Belgian garrison. Thus the airborne troops prevented the Belgians from destroying the bridge, though they still faced the rest of the Belgian defenders. The defenders held on until a platoon of German reinforcements arrived and forced them to retire to a nearby village. However, the assaulting force's small-arms fire could not overcome two field-guns located five hundred metres from the bridge, thus forcing Altmann to call for air support. Several Junkers Ju 87 Stukas responded and knocked out the guns. Group Steel was to be relieved by 14:30, but Belgian resistance delayed their arrival in strength until 21:30. During the fighting, the attacking force left eight airborne troops dead and thirty wounded.|$|E
50|$|Located on {{the north}} side of the site was the battle {{headquarters}} bunker, defended by a pair of mushroom shaped F.C Construction type <b>pillboxes</b> (also known as Oakington or Fairlop type <b>pillboxes),</b> one of which remains in good condition in 2009.|$|R
5|$|A {{small number}} of <b>pillboxes</b> had been {{constructed}} in the First World War and where possible these were integrated into the defence plans. Some <b>pillboxes</b> may pre-date {{the publication of the}} FW3 designs, but in any case some local commanders introduced modifications to the standard FW3 designs or introduced designs of their own. These non-standard design <b>pillboxes</b> may be produced in some numbers or completely ad hoc designs suited to local conditions. Other designs were produced as commercial ventures.|$|R
5|$|From the Abyssinian Crisis of 1935 onwards, the British built many <b>pillboxes</b> in Malta for defence {{in case of}} an Italian invasion. Many {{others were}} built during World War II. Many <b>pillboxes</b> still exist, {{especially}} on the north eastern part of the island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some <b>pillboxes</b> are still being destroyed as they are not considered to have any architectural or historic value.|$|R
5|$|Even {{though some}} of his {{soldiers}} came within 60 meters of the <b>pillbox,</b> after 19 of them (over a third) were killed and the sun began rising in the horizon, Kotzer decided to retreat, unable to receive official permission due to communication problems. He ordered all of his troops to collect the wounded and any weapons they could carry, helping with the task himself. The dead were left in the field, including the medics (not a single medic survived). The injured were brought under fire into the wadi and at about 07:00 the force {{made its way to}} an unoccupied two-storey building on the east bank. After the Egyptians started shelling the building with mortars, Kotzer's company began to move towards Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|For {{six days}} prior to the {{beginning}} of the American offensive, Allied heavy artillery targeted German defenses around Aachen. Although the heavy bombardment forced the German LXXXI Corps to halt all daylight personnel and supply movements, it had little effect on the pillboxes and strongpoints. The opening aerial bombardment on 2 October also caused little damage to German defensive positions; the 450 aircraft which took part in the first wave failed to register a single direct hit on any German <b>pillbox.</b> Their targets had been largely obscured by thick smoke from the Allied artillery barrage. As the aircraft finished their assault, the artillery resumed bombarding the front lines, firing 18,696 shells from 372 gun tubes within a couple of hours.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the War Office and the Office of Works held discussions on how to manage the castle. In 1908, Portland was placed onto what was known as the Schedule C list, which meant that the Army would {{continue}} to use and manage the historic property, but with input on repairs from the Office of Works. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Portland Harbour became an important naval base and the castle was used an ordnance store. The castle became a military residence again in the interwar years, and during the Second World War it was used for accommodation and offices by British and US soldiers, with part of the castle used once again for storing ordnance. A concrete <b>pillbox,</b> since demolished, was constructed alongside the castle early on in the war.|$|E

50|$|The line {{contained}} <b>pillboxes</b> and bunkers, {{machine gun}} nests and mobile artillery positions. The line also contained mine fields, trenches, tank traps and barbed wire. The minefields {{were at least}} 200 meters deep backed up by 20-30 <b>pillboxes</b> and bunkers per square kilometer.|$|R
5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light <b>pillbox</b> that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
5|$|The 30th Infantry Division {{began its}} advance on 2 October, using divisional heavy {{artillery}} to target German pillboxes; {{even then it}} took, on average, thirty minutes to capture a single <b>pillbox.</b> The Americans found that if they failed to immediately press {{on to the next}} <b>pillbox,</b> the Germans were sure to counterattack. Heavy resistance had not been expected, and one company lost 87 combatants in an hour; another lost 93 out of 120soldiers to a German artillery strike. The attackers were slowly able to cross the Wurm River and engage German pillboxes with flamethrowers and explosive charges. By the afternoon of 2 October, elements of the 30th Infantry Division had breached German defenses and reached the town of Palenberg. Here, GIs advanced house-to-house and fought a number of gruesome hand grenade duels. (Private Harold G. Kiner would be awarded the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a German grenade near Palenberg, thus saving the lives of two fellow soldiers). Fighting in the town of Rimburg was equally terrible; American armor {{had not been able to}} get across the Wurm River, and therefore could not provide fire support to infantrymen who were attempting to storm a medieval castle being used as a fort by the Germans. The 30th Infantry Division subdued roughly 50 German pillboxes on the first day of the advance, often having to envelop the structure and attack from the rear. The division's effort was aided by the 29th Infantry Division's diversionary attacks on their flank, leading the Germans to believe that that was the Americans' main attack. On the night of 2 October, the German 902nd Assault Gun Battalion was ordered to launch a counterattack against the 30th Infantry Division, but Allied artillery delayed the start of the raid, and ultimately the attempt failed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} losses which left gaping {{holes in the}} Allied line, {{it was decided that}} the next stage of the advance was to go ahead. At 08:25, parties from the 34th and 35th Battalions headed out along the {{south-eastern}} edge of the ridge towards the outskirts of Passchendaele. Almost immediately, they came under heavy fire from a <b>pillbox</b> close by a railway embankment, at which time Major J.B. Buchanan, the senior brigade officer with the advance party, fell dead, leaving Jeffries to assume control. Gathering a party of eleven men, he set about silencing the machine gun position. Edging across the open ground, the party attacked the position from the west just as the machine gun was firing to the north. Realising that an attack was imminent, the machine gunner switched around, mortally wounding Jeffries in the stomach and sending the rest of the party to ground. When its fire eased, the remaining members of the group worked around the position, rushed it and seized two machine guns in conjunction with thirty prisoners.|$|E
50|$|During the war {{the town}} was ringed by over 120 <b>pillboxes</b> or other {{defensive}} structures {{as part of the}} Colchester Stop Line. A small number of <b>pillboxes</b> can still be found around the borough, such as at Mount Bures, and the Hythe railway station.|$|R
50|$|Moir {{produced}} a design for concrete machine-gun <b>pillboxes.</b> Designed to be constructed from {{a system of}} interlocking precast concrete blocks, with a steel roof, around 1500 Moir <b>pillboxes</b> were eventually produced (with blocks cast at Richborough in Kent) {{and sent to the}} Western Front in 1918.|$|R
5000|$|During the Second World War Messel {{served as}} a {{camouflage}} officer, disguising [...] <b>pillboxes</b> in Somerset. According to his fellow officer Julian Trevelyan, he revelled in the opportunity to give his talents free rein.

5|$|In cold, wet weather, the 3rd Guards Brigade made a short advance {{behind a}} ragged barrage, took the higher {{ground on the}} edge of Houthoulst Forest and cut off the rest of the spur running {{north-east}} from Veldhoek. Contact with the 17th Division on the right flank was lost, after the left flank formation of the 17th Division veered south and the crew of a contact patrol aircraft observing the advance, failed to see the loss of direction. Two platoons detailed to meet the attacking brigade of the 17th Division, had to dig in near the Angle Point <b>pillbox</b> under machine-gun fire. After dark, the Guards and the 17th Division closed the gap, by capturing the blockhouses at Angle Point and Aden House. Next day, conditions were so bad that the attacking brigade was relieved by the 1st Guards Brigade. The fresh troops patrolled vigorously to the southern edge of Houthoulst Forest, against little organised German resistance, except for extensive sniping around the Colbert cross-roads and Colombo House.|$|E
5|$|Kotzer {{estimated}} that a frontal assault against the Egyptians would be useless, {{as they were}} dug in {{on both sides of}} the <b>pillbox.</b> In complete darkness, the 1st Company made its way south through the wadi hoping to avoid enemy fire from superior positions and weapons until they were close enough to respond. At 03:00, the Israeli artillery barrage started, but did not do significant damage and only alerted all Egyptian positions to the Israeli presence. The only Israeli unit close to engagement at the time was Kotzer's company. About 100 m away from the Egyptian defense line, they stepped into an ambush and the leading squad was eliminated. Kotzer ordered the machine gunners to climb to the east bank of the wadi to provide cover for a counterattack, and this move also led to Israeli casualties. The counterattack was difficult and only destroyed some small Egyptian entrenchments.|$|E
5|$|Lopez {{engaged the}} enemy {{immediately}} after landing with the assault waves. He exposed himself to enemy fire {{in an attempt}} to throw a hand grenade into a <b>pillbox</b> whose fire was pinning down that sector of the beach. He was wounded by enemy gun fire and dropped the grenade. Unable to grasp the hand grenade firmly enough to hurl it, he chose to sacrifice himself rather than endanger the lives of his men. He cradled the grenade under him and absorbed the full impact of the explosion, thus saving the lives of his comrades. Lopez was nominated for the Medal of Honor. Lopez however, was not the only Hispanic member of the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division to be awarded the Medal of Honor. PFC Eugene Arnold Obregon (1930–1950), who also participated in the Inchon landing, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions 11 days after Lopez gave his life. Obregon was killed in action while using his body to shield a wounded fellow Marine.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II, two <b>pillboxes</b> with gun-mountings were {{installed}} on the rooftop for harbor defense, and the Sky Room became the official Airwatch headquarters for Long Beach harbor. [...] One of the <b>pillboxes</b> and gun mountings remained intact on the roof as late as 1991.|$|R
50|$|Between the Abyssinian Crisis of 1936 and World War II, the British built about 200 <b>pillboxes</b> on {{the island}} of Malta for defence in case of an Italian invasion. Less than 100 <b>pillboxes</b> still exist, and most are found on the north eastern part of the island. A few of them have been {{restored}} and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some <b>pillboxes</b> are still being destroyed nowadays as the authorities do not consider them to have any architectural or historic value, despite heritage NGOs calling to preserve them.|$|R
5000|$|Internet games {{typically}} {{begin with}} {{a period in which}} teams are set up while players remain in deep sea, generally returning to agreed-upon starting points prior to an agreed-upon signal initiating active gameplay. The next phase is usually a base run where players attempt to quickly seize as many neutral bases as possible. After this initial phase, various strategies may be employed. Most involve the quick capture of a number of neutral <b>pillboxes,</b> which may be used defensively to prevent opponents from aggressive attacks on one's bases, which can quickly result in resource depletion. <b>Pillboxes</b> are frequently used offensively, however, by pushing them forward toward an opponent's bases, using their firepower to control territory. Games frequently feature fronts of opposing <b>pillboxes</b> [...] - [...] when one side breaks through or flanks the opponent's front, they will often deploy <b>pillboxes</b> to spike bases and force the opposition to refuel farther back. Eventually, the successful team will push more <b>pillboxes</b> forward and/or seize ill-defended enemy bases, progressively limiting the territory of its opponent until all of the enemy's bases are captured or under fire.|$|R
