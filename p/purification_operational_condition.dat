40|$|AbstractDynamic {{time-varying}} <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> pose {{great challenge}} to the estimation of system remaining useful life (RUL) for the deteriorating systems. This paper presents a method based on probabilistic and stochastic approaches to estimate system RUL for periodically monitored degradation processes with dynamic time-varying <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> and condition-specific failure zones. The method assumes that the degradation rate is influenced by specific <b>operational</b> <b>condition</b> and moreover, the transition between different <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> plays the most important role in affecting the degradation process. These <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> are assumed to evolve as a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). The failure thresholds are also determined by specific <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> and described as different failure zones. The 2008 PHM Conference Challenge Data is utilized to illustrate our method, which contains mass sensory signals related to the degradation process of a commercial turbofan engine. The RUL estimation method using the sensor measurements of a single sensor was first developed, and then multiple vital sensors were selected through a particular optimization procedure {{in order to increase}} the prediction accuracy. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are presented in a comparison with existing methods for the same dataset...|$|R
30|$|However, in that research, {{component}} <b>conditions,</b> such as <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> {{and monitoring}} data, were not considered, and components were just treated {{as part of}} transmission lines. But actually, each component has its own failure risk, which is influenced by its <b>operational</b> <b>condition.</b> In practice, component condition assessment is usually conducted by experts or trained on-site engineers. As <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> could be affected by faults or environment, such as loading conditions and temperatures [5, 6], the failure probability of components is not fixed. Thus, the outage probability of transmission lines changes accordingly. As the component failure probability changes, the results of risk assessment are not fixed values as those of traditional risk assessment models [1], which should be determined by both <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> and historical data.|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. A {{performance}} indicator, such as {{the power}} efficiency characterisation, is used to characterise many different systems and is a benchmark for efficiency characterisation. Power is an instantaneous measure that only characterises a specific <b>operational</b> <b>condition</b> of a system. Therefore, it is accurate and sufficient for characterising systems with (as far as possible) constant <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> that do not fluctuate on a frequent basis. To characterise the overall performance of a system with fluctuating <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> another method is required to measure and calculate the overall system efficiency [...] ...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} enabler {{towards the}} successful deployment {{of any new}} element/feature to the cellular network is the investigation and characterization of the <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> where its introduction will enhance performance. Even though there has been significant research activity on the potential of device-to-device (D 2 D) communications, there are currently no clear indications of whether D 2 D communications are actually able to provide benefits {{for a wide range}} of <b>operational</b> <b>conditions,</b> thus justifying their introduction to the system. This paper attempts to fill this gap by taking a stochastic geometry approach on characterizing the set (region) of <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> for which D 2 D communications enhance performance in terms of average user rate. For the practically interesting case of a heavy loaded network, the operational region is provided in closed form as a function of a variety of parameters such as maximum D 2 D link distances and user densities, reflecting a wide range of <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> (points). It is shown that under the appropriate deployment scheme, D 2 D communications can indeed be beneficial not only for the usually considered regime of "proximal communications" but to a wide range of <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> that include D 2 D link distances comparable to the distance to the cellular access point and considerably large user densities.
