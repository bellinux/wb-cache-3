40|$|International audienceCredit default swaps (CDSs), {{initially}} {{intended as}} instruments for hedging and managing credit risk, have been pinpointed {{during the recent}} crisis as being detrimental to ﬁ nancial stability. We argue {{that the impact of}} credit default swap markets on ﬁ nancial stability crucially depends on clearing mechanisms and capital and liquidity requirements for large <b>protection</b> <b>sellers.</b> In particular, the culprits are not so much speculative or “naked” credit default swaps but inadequate risk management and supervision of <b>protection</b> <b>sellers.</b> When <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> are inadequately capitalised, OTC (over-the-counter) CDS markets may act as channels for contagion and systemic risk. On the other hand, a CDS market where all major dealers participate in a central clearing facility with adequate reserves can actually contribute to mitigating systemic risk. In the latter case, a key element is the risk management of the central counterparties, for which we outline some recommendations...|$|R

They are standardised contracts and reference a fixed number of obligors with shared characteristics. Investors can be long or short the index which is equivalent to being <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> or buyers.|$|R
2500|$|Another kind of {{risk for}} the seller of credit default swaps is jump risk or jump-to-default risk. A seller of a CDS could be {{collecting}} monthly premiums with little expectation that the reference entity may default. [...] A default creates a sudden obligation on the <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> to pay millions, if not billions, of dollars to protection buyers. This risk is not present in other over-the-counter derivatives.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "spread" [...] of a CDS is {{the annual}} amount the {{protection}} buyer must pay the <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> over {{the length of}} the contract, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} notional amount. For example, if the CDS spread of Risky Corp is 50 basis points, or 0.5% (1 basis point = 0.01%), then an investor buying $10million worth of protection from AAA-Bank must pay the bank $50,000. [...] Payments are usually made on a quarterly basis, in arrears. [...] These payments continue until either the CDS contract expires or Risky Corp defaults.|$|E
2500|$|Physical settlement: [...] The <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> {{pays the}} buyer par value, {{and in return}} takes {{delivery}} of a debt obligation of the reference entity. [...] For example, a hedge fund has bought $5million worth of protection from a bank on the senior debt of a company. [...] In {{the event of a}} default, the bank pays the hedge fund $5million cash, and the hedge fund must deliver $5million face value of senior debt of the company (typically bonds or loans, which are typically worth very little given that the company is in default).|$|E
2500|$|Cash settlement: [...] The <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> {{pays the}} buyer the {{difference}} between par value and the market price of a debt obligation of the reference entity. [...] For example, a hedge fund has bought $5million worth of protection from a bank on the senior debt of a company. [...] This company has now defaulted, and its senior bonds are now trading at 25 (i.e., 25 cents on the dollar) since the market believes that senior bondholders will receive 25% of the money they are owed once the company is wound up. [...] Therefore, the bank must pay the hedge fund $5million×(100%−25%) =$3.75million.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the second}} half of the 1990 s, the {{surfacing}} of credit derivatives and collateralised debt obligations enlarged the range of instruments for transferring credit risk. Although the characteristics and purposes of the former are very similar to those of the latter, the tradability of the new instruments has resulted in the creation of true markets for credit risk transfer (CRT), which are very rapidly developing. CRT markets are of great interest as regards financial stability: while offering extended risk management opportunities for market participants, they also alter “traditional” relationships (between lenders and borrowers) as well as creating new types of relationships (lenders and credit <b>protection</b> <b>sellers).</b> The present review relies on existing theoretical and empirical work as well as on contacts with market practitioners to explore, from an analytical standpoint, the financial stability implications of all types of CRT instruments. In particular, it analyses the characteristics of differing CRT instruments in light of risk management and asymmetric information problems arising in financial markets. It also proposes possible avenues for further work. Four questions are successively raised: For what purposes are these products designed; why use one instrument rather than another? Who assesses credit risk: lenders, <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> or both? How are CRT instruments priced in practice: does pricing primarily reflect credit risk or does it also incorporate additional elements, such as counterparty, documentation or market risks? What are the potential macro-financial implications of CRT markets?...|$|R

2500|$|Goldman {{argued that}} CDSs are marked to market (i.e. valued at their current market price) and their {{positions}} netted between counterparties daily. Thus, {{as the cost}} of insuring AIG's obligations against default rose substantially in the lead-up to its bailout, the sellers of the CDS contracts had to post more collateral to Goldman Sachs.

However, in practice, the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an AIG bankruptcy.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the impact of equity returns {{volatility}} of reference entities on credit-default swap rates using a new dataset from the Japanese market. Design/methodology/approach – Using a copula approach, the paper models the different relationships that can exist in different ranges of behavior. It studies the bivariate distributions of credit-default swap rates and equity return volatility estimated with GARCH (1, 1) and focus on one parameter Archimedean copula. Findings – First, the paper emphasizes the finding that pairs with higher rating present a weaker dependence coefficient and then, the impact of equity returns volatility on credit-default swap rates is higher for the lowest rating class. Second, the dependence structure is positive and asymmetric indicating that <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> ask for higher credit-default swap returns to compensate the higher credit risk incurred by low rating class. Practical implications – The paper has several practical implications that are of value for financial hedgers and engineers, loan market participants, financial regulators, government regulators, central banks, and risk managers. Originality/value – The paper also illustrates the potential benefits of equity returns volatility of reference entities as a proxy of default risk. These simplifications could be lifted in future research on this theme. Credit, Equity capital, Japan...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a reduced-form credit risk model that {{incorporates}} illiquidity {{in the bond}} and the credit default swap (CDS) market. As CDS are derivative contracts, the effect of illiquidity on them has to be modeled differently than for bonds. In the bond market, illiquidity results in yield premia. In the CDS market, the bid-ask spread constitutes a liquidity signal. This separation has important consequences on the liquidity spill-over between the bond and the CDS market {{as well as the}} co-movement of credit risk and liquidity premia. Our most important findings are threefold. First, we find that adding a CDS-specific liquidity component to the model has the important consequence of consistently positive credit risk and liquidity premia in bond markets. Moreover, the size of these premia relative to the yield spread is intuitively plausible. Second, our analysis of the time series of the liquidity premia shows that the bond market’s liquidity dries up as default risk increases. For the CDS market, the reaction of the liquidity premia depends on the rating class. The investment grade sector becomes more dominated by <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> during times of high default risk, while a lower demand pressure decreases liquidity premia in the subinvestment grade sector. Third, the liquidity of the bond market has a direct impact on the liquidity of the CDS market but not vice versa...|$|R
