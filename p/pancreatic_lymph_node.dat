40|$|Little {{is known}} about the events {{triggering}} lymphocyte invasion of the pancreatic islets in prelude to autoimmune diabetes. For example, where islet-reactive T cells first encounter antigen has not been identified. We addressed this issue using BDC 2. 5 T cell receptor transgenic mice, which express a receptor recognizing a natural islet beta cell antigen. In BDC 2. 5 animals, activated T cells were found only in the islets and the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> draining them, and there was a close temporal correlation between <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> T cell activation and islet infiltration. When naive BDC 2. 5 T cells were transferred into nontransgenic recipients, proliferating cells were observed only in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and this occurred significantly before insulitis was detectable. Surprisingly, proliferation was not seen in 10 -day-old recipients. This age-dependent dichotomy was reproduced in a second transfer system based on an unrelated antigen artificially expressed on beta cells. We conclude that beta cell antigens are transported specifically to <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> where they trigger reactive T cells to invade the islets. Systemic or extrapancreatic T cell priming, indicative of activation via molecular mimicry or superantigens, was not seen.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis Autoantibodies against {{pancreatic}} islets and infections by enteroviruses {{are associated}} with type 1 diabetes, but the specificity of immune responses within the type 1 diabetic pancreas is poorly characterised. We investigated whether pancreatic lymph nodes could provide a source of antigen-specific B cells for analysis of immune responses within the (pre) diabetic pancreas. Methods Human IgG antibodies were cloned from single B lymphocytes sorted from <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells of three organ donors positive for islet autoantibodies, and from the peripheral blood of a patient with type 1 diabetes. Antibodies to insulinoma-associated antigen 2 (IA- 2), GAD 65, zinc trans- porter 8 (ZnT 8) and Coxsackie B virus proteins were assayed by immunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence on pan- creatic sections. Results Human IgG antibodies (863) were successfully cloned and produced from 4, 092 single B cells from lymph nodes and peripheral blood. Reactivity to the protein tyrosine phosphatase domain of the IA- 2 autoantigen was detected in two cloned antibodies: one derived from a <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and one from peripheral blood.

40|$|SummaryAutoimmune {{diabetes}} {{is characterized by}} inflammatory infiltration; however, the initiating events are poorly understood. We found that the islets of Langerhans in young nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice contained two antigen-presenting cell (APC) populations: a major macrophage and a minor CD 103 + dendritic cell (DC) population. By 4  weeks of age, CD 4 + T cells entered islets coincident {{with an increase in}} CD 103 + DCs. In order to examine the role of the CD 103 + DCs in diabetes, we examined Batf 3 -deficient NOD mice that lacked the CD 103 + DCs in islets and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> This led to a lack of autoreactive T cells in islets and, importantly, no incidence of diabetes. Additional examination revealed that presentation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I epitopes in the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was absent with a partial impairment of MHC class II presentation.

In the present work, the plasma d-glucose and insulin concentrations, the protein and insulin content of pancreatic islets, the metabolism of d-glucose, and its insulinotropic action in islets first cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of IL- 1 beta, the production of IFN-gamma and IL- 10 by mesenteric lymph node cells cultured for 48 h in the absence or presence of concanavalin A, the mitogenic activity of Peyer's patch cells and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells in the absence or presence of the same lectin, and the biosynthetic activity of Peyer's patch cells were measured in the BBc and BBdp rats fed either the NIH or the HC diet.

40|$|Peripheral {{tolerance}} is {{an important}} part of the armamentarium of the immune system for preventing autoimmunity. CD 8 T cells specific for self-antigens expressed in the periphery are normally deleted by abortive activation as they encounter antigens that are cross-presented by quiescent dendritic cells. Experiments will be presented demonstrating that persistence of antigen is important to achieve deletion and anergy of CD 8 cells. Type 1 diabetes is the result of autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets and represents a failure on the part of the immune system to sustain peripheral tolerance. Normally, islet-antigen specific CD 8 cells are deleted as a result of activation by cross-presented antigen in the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> We have compared the fate of CD 8 T cells specific for an islet antigen in normal mice and in diabetes-prone NOD mice.

40|$|We {{previously}} described {{a mechanism for}} the maintenance of peripheral self-tolerance. This involves the cross-presentation of tissue-associated antigens by a bone marrow–derived cell type that stimulates the proliferation and ultimate deletion of self-reactive CD 8 T cells. This process has been referred to as cross-tolerance. Here, we characterize the elusive cell type responsible for inducing cross-tolerance as a CD 8 � � dendritic cell (DC). To achieve this aim, transgenic mice were generated expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) linked to CTL epitopes for ovalbumin and glycoprotein B (gB) of herpes simplex virus under the rat insulin promoter (RIP). Although tracking of YFP was inconclusive, the use of a highly sensitive gBspecific hybridoma that produced �-galactosidase on encounter with antigen, enabled detection of antigen presentation by cells isolated from the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> This showed that a CD 11 c�CD 8 � � cell was responsible for cross-tolerance, the same DC subset as previously implicated in cross-priming.

There have been divergent reports on the suppressive capacity of these TGF-Treg cells. We find that TGF-Tregs derived from diabetes-prone NOD mice, although expressing normal Foxp 3 levels, are uniquely defective in suppressive activity, whereas TGF-Tregs from control strains (B 6 g 7) or ex vivo Tregs from NOD mice all function normally. Most Treg-typical transcripts were shared by NOD or B 6 g 7 TGF-Tregs, except for {{a small group of}} differentially expressed genes, including genes relevant for suppressive activity (Lrrc 32, Ctla 4, and Cd 73).

Here we describe a strategy which blocks cellular infiltration of islets and prevents diabetes. Intranasal treatment with the B-subunit of Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin (EtxB), a protein that binds GM 1 ganglioside (as well as GD 1 b, asialo-GM 1 and lactosylceramide with lower affinities), protected NOD mice from developing {{diabetes in}} a receptor-binding dependent manner. Protection was associated with a significant {{reduction in the number of}} macrophages, CD 4 + T cells, B cells, major histocompatibility complex class II+ cells infiltrating the islets. Despite this, treated mice showed increased number of interleukin- 10 + cells in the pancreas, and a decrease in both T helper 1 (Th 1) and Th 2 cytokine production in the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Disease protection was also transferred with CD 4 + splenocytes from treated mice. Taken together, these results demonstrated that EtxB is a potent immune modulator capable of blocking diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Nasal {{administration}} of beta cell-derived auto-antigens {{has been reported}} to suppress the development of autoimmune diabetes. We investigated the tolerogenic effects of insulin conjugated to the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB). Nasal {{administration of}} 1 µg of CTB-insulin significantly delayed the incidence of diabetes in comparison to CTB treated mice. However, administration of 4 or 8 µg of the conjugate had no protective effect. Protection induced by CTB-insulin was transferred to naive recipients by splenic CD 4 + T cells. This result favours an active cellular mechanism of regulation, which was lost using higher (4 – 8 µg) or lower (0 · 1 – 0 · 5 µg) amounts of the conjugate. When co-administered with diabetogenic T cells, splenic T cells from CTB-insulin-treated mice reduced the lymphocytic infiltration of the islets. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of recipients’ pancreatic glands revealed an increase of TGF-β and IL- 10 transcripts after donor mice tolerization, while levels of IFN-γ and IL- 4 RNAs were unchanged. We observed a significant increase of T cell proliferation after unspecific stimulation in the spleen and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> 24 h after CTB-insulin administration in comparison to control treatment. Higher amounts of IL- 4 and IFN-γ were noticed in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of tolerized mice upon in vitro stimulation. Antigen-specific unresponsiveness after immunization and upon subsequent in vitro exposure to homologous antigen was obtained in nasally treated animals. Our results underlined the importance of nasal mucosa as an inducing site of tolerance and provided evidence for similar mechanisms of action to what has been described for the oral route, which favoured a CTB-insulin specific effect...|$|R
40|$|The innate {{immune system}} is known to play an {{important}} role in oral tolerance to dietary antigens. This is important in development of celiac disease (CD) but may also be important in type 1 diabetes (T 1 D), and could potentially explain the reduced incidence of T 1 D in mice receiving a gluten-free (GF) diet. The direct in vivo effect of gluten on innate cells, and particularly dendritic cells (DC) is not sufficiently clarified. Therefore, we wished to investigate the innate cell populations of spontaneous diabetic NOD mice and healthy BALB/c mice kept on a GF or a standard (STD) gluten containing diet. We studied, by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), if dietary gluten induces changes in the activation of DCs and distribution of selected innate cells in lymphoid, pancreatic and intestinal tissues in BALB/c and NOD mice. We found that a GF diet increased the percentage of macrophages in BALB/c spleen and of CD 11 c+ DCs in BALB/c and NOD spleen. Strictly gluten-free (SGF) diet increased the percentage of CD 103 + DCs in BALB/c mice and decreased percentages of CD 11 b+ DCs in mesenteric and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in BALB/c mice. SGF diet in BALB/c mice also decreased DC expression of CD 40, CCR 7 and MHC-II in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> In conclusion, GF diet changes the composition of the {{innate immune system}} in BALB/c and NOD mice and increases expression of DC activation markers in NOD mice. These results contribute to the explanation of the low diabetes incidence in GF NOD mice. This mechanism may be important in development of type 1 diabetes, celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|CD 1 d-restricted {{invariant}} NKT (iNKT) {{cells are}} immunoregulatory cells whose loss exacerbates diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) female mice. Here, {{we show that}} the relative numbers of iNKT cells from the pancreatic islets of NOD mice decrease {{at the time of}} conversion from peri-insulitis to invasive insulitis and diabetes. Conversely, NOD male mice who have a low incidence of diabetes showed an increased frequency of iNKT cells. Moreover, administration of α-galactosylceramide, a potent activating ligand presented by CD 1 d, ameliorated the development of diabetes in NOD female mice and resulted in the accumulation of iNKT cells and myeloid dendritic cells (DC) in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (PLN), but not in inguinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Strikingly, injection of NOD female mice with myeloid DC isolated from the PLN, but not those from the inguinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> completely prevented diabetes. Thus, the immunoregulatory role of iNKT cells is manifested by the recruitment of tolerogenic myeloid DC to the PLN and the inhibition of ongoing autoimmune inflammation...|$|R
