5|$|Birks was {{promoted}} {{as a temporary}} wagon orderly corporal on 5 August 1916, and the rank was made substantive five days later. After his unit {{moved away from the}} front line, Birks had an opportunity to return to Buckley. There, he visited his old school and gave them a Turkish flag that he has attained while in Gallipoli. Following his return to France, Birks was hospitalised for five days with <b>pyrexia.</b> He rejoined his unit on 14 February 1917.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{involvement}} at Pozières and Mouquet Farm, the 12th Battalion {{was briefly}} {{transferred to the}} Ypres sector in Belgium in September, before returning to Bernafay Wood on the Somme late the following month. Newland {{was admitted to the}} 38th Casualty Clearing Station with <b>pyrexia</b> on 4 December. He was moved to the 2nd General Hospital at Le Havre, and returned to the 12th Battalion two weeks later following recuperation. On the same day, he was attached to the headquarters of the 2nd Australian Brigade for duty as a staff officer. He was granted leave on 21 January 1917 on completion of this stint.|$|E

25|$|Since {{alveolar}} osteitis is {{not primarily}} an infection, {{there is not}} usually any <b>pyrexia</b> (fever) and cervical lymphadenitis (swollen glands in the neck), and only minimal edema (swelling) and erythema (redness) {{is present in the}} soft tissues surrounding the socket.|$|E
25|$|Puerperal sepsis is an {{ascending}} {{infection of}} the genital tract. It may happen during or after labour. Signs {{to look out for}} include signs of infection (<b>pyrexia</b> or hypothermia, raised heart rate and respiratory rate, reduced blood pressure), and abdominal pain, offensive lochia (blood loss) increased lochia, clots, diarrhea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|One such evacuee was 42-year-old trooper A. E. Illingworth, who {{had landed}} at Suez in January 1917. He joined the 4th Light Horse Regiment at Ferry Post on 3 March 1917 from Moascar {{training}} camp, {{and was in}} the field until 8 June 1918, when he became ill from <b>pyrexia</b> and was admitted to the 31st General Hospital, Abbassia on 15 June. After treatment he rejoined his regiment on 20 July at Jericho and remained in the field until returning to Australia on the Essex on 15 June 1919. He died five years later.|$|E
25|$|Four {{recognised}} species infect cattle: S. bovifelis, S. bovihominis (S. hominis) S. cruzi (S. bovicanis) and S. hirsuta. S. cruzi is {{the only}} species known to be pathogenic in cattle. A number of clinical syndromes {{have been reported in}} connection with this parasite: eosinophilic myositis; abortions, stillbirths and deaths in pregnant cows; two cases of necrotic encephalitis in heifers have also been reported. Typical clinical signs of acute bovine sarcocystosis are: anorexia, <b>pyrexia</b> (42C or more), anemia, cachexia, enlarged palpable lymph nodes, excessive salivation and loss of hair {{at the tip of the}} tail.|$|E
25|$|Blowfly strike, or flystrike is {{a serious}} welfare problem in the animal industry. This {{cutaneous}} myiasis or infestation not only causes severe discomfort or stress to the animal, but will also cause death when left untreated. Ewe lambs and female sheep are primarily affected and are struck predominately in the rear quadrant of the animal due to fecal staining. Due to the difficulty in controlling these flies, there are considerable losses in the sheep industry every year. Also, there is an increasing concern of the insecticidal use and the surgical procedures done to control L. cuprina, making this not only an animal welfare issue but also an economical one. The maggots of L. cuprina rapidly grow while eating the living flesh of the sheep while secreting ammonia, thus, poisoning the sheep. Sheep show signs of skin irritation by rubbing and biting the affected areas {{during the first few}} days after the eggs have been laid. This causes an inflammatory response in the sheep resulting in severe irritation and <b>pyrexia.</b> Once a flystrike has started other flies are attracted to the site. Although treatment is available, the delayed response time due to symptoms allows wool breakage in the affected area and fleece to be tender overall. There are many predispositions to the flystrike that make a host more favorable, including an infection with dermatophilosis and footrot, both of which can be treated and prevented. In some animals a weak resistance can develop, but this immune response is often associated with a decrease in productivity which is an undesirable trait.|$|E
2500|$|Fever, {{also known}} as <b>pyrexia</b> and febrile response, is defined as having a {{temperature}} above the normal range due {{to an increase in}} the body's temperature set-point. There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between [...] The increase in set-point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold. This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. When the set-point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat. Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure. This is more common in young children. Fevers do not typically go higher than [...]|$|E
2500|$|In 1917 Bryan left Egypt for the Western Front, {{serving in}} the Somme area where he {{suffered}} from <b>pyrexia</b> and was hospitalised for a time. He served {{on the front line}} in France and Belgium throughout 1917 and 1918. He was promoted to Lieutenant in August 1917 and acting Captain in March 1918 during the German Spring Offensive. He saw action during the Second Battle of the Somme in 1918 and was awarded the Military Cross for the way he led his machine guns at Miraumont in August 1918, although Bryan [...] "played down the award". He saw action throughout the period {{until the end of the}} war and was appointed as a company commander during this period.|$|E
2500|$|L. donovani is the causative {{agent of}} visceral leishmaniasis, {{traditionally}} known as kala-azar ("black fever", particularly in India), {{because of its}} characteristic symptoms. The disease is highly lethal if not treated properly. The incubation period generally ranges from 3 to 6 months, {{and in some cases}} may be over a year. In Indian leishmaniasis, incubation can be as short as 10 days. The target cells are those of mononuclear phagocyte system. The two main tissues of infection are spleen and liver. Clinical symptoms include <b>pyrexia</b> (recurring high fever which may be continuous or remittent), enlargement of spleen and liver, and heavy skin pigmentation which darkens the physical appearance (the reason for naming [...] "black fever"). To a lesser extent mucosa of the small intestine and lymph nodes are also invaded by the parasite. Morphological symptoms are noticeable particularly on facial and abdominal regions. Skin becomes coarse and hard. In African infections, warty eruptions are common. In a fully developed stage, the patient shows emaciation and anaemia. Where medical facilities are poor, mortality can be as high as 75–95% within 2 years of epidemics. The disease is often accompanied by complications with dysentery, tuberculosis, septicaemia and even HIV infection.|$|E
60|$|I was now {{sure that}} the bright flush upon her cheeks was due to what we doctors call <b>pyrexia,</b> the initial fever of smallpox, and that the pest which I had dreaded and fled from all my life was {{established}} in my home. The night was hot and I had drunk my fill of wine, but I sat and shook in the ague of my fear. Jane had the disease, but {{she was young and}} strong and might survive it. I should take it from her, and in that event assuredly must die, for the mind is master of the body and the thing we dread is the thing that kills us.|$|E
